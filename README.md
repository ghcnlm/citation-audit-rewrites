# Citation Audit & Rewrites

This project implements a citation fidelity audit workflow that scans academic and policy reviews to identify claims linked to citations, checks whether those citations faithfully support the claims, and proposes evidence-based rewrites for unsupported or weakly supported statements. The pipeline automates extraction, enrichment, adjudication, and rewrite generation, producing structured outputs to improve accuracy and transparency in research reporting.

See context_pack/ for a quick-start on pipeline structure, environment setup, and how to run.
