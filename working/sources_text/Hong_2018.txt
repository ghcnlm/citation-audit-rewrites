Psychological Self-Suﬃciency: A Bottom-Up
Theory of Change in Workforce Development
Philip Young P. Hong, Sangmi Choi, and Whitney Key
The purpose of this study was,ﬁrst, to validate the factor structure of psychological self-
suﬃciency (PSS) and, second, to investigate the extent to which PSS aﬀects economic self-
suﬃciency (ESS) among low-income job seekers. PSS is conceptualized as a transformative
process-driven psychological capital that comprises employment hope and perceived
employment barriers. Using a sample of 802 low-income job seekers from two diﬀerent
local job training programs in Chicago, a multisample conﬁrmatory factor analysis tested the
factor structure of PSS, and a structural equation modeling analysis was conducted to test
the hypothesized pathways to ESS, examining employment hope and perceived employ-
ment barriers individually and taking the diﬀerence score between the two. Findings re-
vealed that PSS signiﬁcantly contributes to ESS. Workforce development practitioners
need to focus on clients’ PSS when working with them to achieve ESS. Benchmarking
PSS, providing adequate supportive services, and engaging employers are warranted as ways
to build a system that generates successful employment and retention paths and outcomes.

S
elf-suﬃciency is regarded in policy, research,
and practice primarily as economic self-
suﬃciency (ESS) (
Hong, Choi, & Polanin,
2014; Hong, Hodge, & Choi, 2015). ESS is a uni-
fying federal and state social policy goal that is pro-
mulgated by politicians and government oﬃcials,
evaluated by policy analysts and social scientists, and
benchmarked by local agency administrators and
practitioners. However, there is no single deﬁnition
when it comes to operationalizing ESS (
Hawkins,
2005). The array of deﬁnitions ranges anywhere
from having ﬁnancial independence or economic
security to having an annual income above the
200% federal poverty line, being able to pay 100%
of necessary bills without any help from govern-
ment or other people, achieving one year job reten-
tion, leaving poverty by way of steady employment,
and attaining job stability (
Cain, 1998; Cancian,
2001; Caputo, 1997; Fleischer, 2001; Johnson &
Corcoran, 2003).
However, the general philosophical agreement
in the literature is that ESS is a labor market out-
come conditioned by adequate earned income that
does not require any external ﬁnancial support
(
Hong, Sheriﬀ, & Naeger, 2009). In practice, this
ESS outcome includes a must condition of being
independent from any government subsidies and
ﬁnancial assistance (Bratt & Keyes, 1997; Caputo,
1997; Mulroy & Lauber, 2004; Taylor & Barusch,
2004) and hopefully a desirable condition of gain-
ing long-term employment above a certain wage
rate (
Cancian, 2001; Johnson & Corcoran, 2003).
The must condition incurs government enforce-
ment to end public assistance if one overstays his or
her welcome beyondﬁve years and exchanges wel-
fare checks with earned income through employ-
ment— an active measure. The desirable condition
on the other hand is left at the mercy of the market
forces for matching the labor supply and demand
and for one to sustain the job once attained— a pas-
sive measure.
In this case, the ESS outcome on the aggregate
can only be as successful as the maximum number
of quality jobs available to absorb low-income
job seekers in the labor market, thereby giving
community-based workforce development agen-
cies and programs little power vis-à-vis the market
when it comes to controlling the level of success.
Particularly when funders primarily emphasize the
bottom line ESS outcome for evaluation, agencies
and programs are forced to use short-term market-
driven outcome measures— that is, welfare exit

and employment placement outcomes— as primary
benchmarks of ESS (Harvey, Hong, & Kwaza,
2010 ). They face a catch-22 situation— fail if they
do not report on the market-prescribed ESS bench-
marks or face funding cuts when the market does
not perform to bring about a good return on
investment on these success metrics (
Hong, 2013,
2016).
Therefore, by ignoring measures that capture
what are key process variables inside the “black
box” as referred to byWeigensberg et al. (2012)—
mediators of direct input and output within the
agency practice context— agencies are disempow-
ered to only rely on market performance to dem-
onstrate success (
Harvey et al., 2010; Hong, 2013).
Comprehensive supportive services oﬀered by agen-
cies as input that tap into the process of empowering
low-income job seekers to become job-ready are
typically ignored and not included as intermediate
measures in current practice of outcome-based
evaluations (
Hong, 2013; Hong, Choi, & Polanin,
2014; H o n g ,H o d g e ,&C h o i ,2 0 1 5). This signals a
new era of market dependency in the face of a dissi-
pating social contract between individuals and the
state— government inaction topublicly tackle the
deep-seated barriers that exacerbate welfare depen-
dency by resorting to private market-based solutions
(
Hong & Crawley, 2015).
Social workers within workforce development
agencies are in a position to lead a win–win solution
to this self-suﬃciency dilemma by recuperating the
importance of mission-based work that provides
added value to agency performance and sustainabil-
ity. To complement ESS as an outcome measure,
psychological self-suﬃciency (PSS) represents the
human-centered ecology of work perspective that
focuses on the bottom-up process of“developing
the workforce” from the perspective of the worker
by honoring low-income job seekers’empower-
ment, strength, self-determination, motivation,
and growth (
Daugherty & Barber, 2001). PSS is
the answer to the question ofhow one becomes
economically self-suﬃcient— by arduously and mean-
ingfully trotting the path, by engaging in a forward
process, and by switching from perceived barriers to
employment hope (
Hong, 2013). Therefore, the pur-
pose of this study is twofold. First, validate PSS as the
process element of self-suﬃciency, which was concep-
tualized and operationalized by Hong and his collea-
gues to include perceived employment barriers and
employment hope (see Figure1)( Hong, 2013; Hong,
Choi, & Polanin, 2014; H o n g ,P o l a n i n ,K e y ,&C h o i ,
2014; H o n g ,P o l a n i n ,&P i g o t t ,2 0 1 2). Second, exam-
ine the extent to which the PSS process contributes to
ESS outcome. By achieving these aims, the study will
help enhance workforce development program evalu-
ation eﬀorts by assessing client progress and document-
ing aggregate outcomes in programs.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Giving peripheral attention to the psychological
dimension of self-suﬃciency forms a gap in pol-
icy implementation ( Hong & Crawley, 2015 ).
Although lawmakers argued that psychological
barriers were the root cause of welfare depen-
dency, leading up to welfare reform, no deliberate
policy investment has been made to reduce psy-
chological barriers as part of a comprehensive
action plan to promote self-suﬃciency (
Cooney,
2006; Harvey et al., 2010). In research, only a
handful of authors have considered the multidi-
mensionality of self-suﬃciency by highlighting its
psychological dimension— for example, personal
and family sustainability as self-su ﬃciency in
terms of achieving economic, physical, psychologi-
cal, and social well-being (
Hawkins, 2005); self-
suﬃciency as a personal process of acquiring money
and resources, psychological power, and skills
(Gowdy & Pearlmutter, 1994); and PSS as driven
by employment hope anchoring on one’s perceived
employment barriers (Hong, 2013, 2016).
Research has found that welfare-to-work policies
are most eﬀective when comprehensively approached
with supportive services that encourage job retention
by focusing on both PSS and ESS (Kazis & Miller,
2001). Previous conceptualizations of the psychologi-
cal dimension of self-suﬃciency have focused on
human agency— individual actions being determined

not only by structure, but also by one’sd e c i s i o n s ,f r e e
will, and choices being enacted onto the structure
(Bandura, 2001, 2006). Orme-Johnson (1988)deﬁned
PSS as “the ability to maintain a conﬁdent, balanced,
happy, productive frame of mind capable of providing
for one’s own needs without dependence on others”
(p. 188).Mellor (2009)maintained that PSS is positive
self-appraisals made about one’s abilities, talents,
skills, and eﬃcacy to provide for oneself. PSS is
philosophically supported by the capabilities approach
(Nussbaum, 1988 , 1992; Sen, 1993, 1999)a n d
the social work practice model of a strengths-based
approach (
Saleebey, 2013 )a n de m p o w e r m e n t
(Gutiérrez, 1994 , 1995 ).
Informed by positive psychology, such goal-
directed motivational concepts as self-eﬃcacy, posi-
tive selves, self-regulation, positive emotions, positive
psychological capital, grit, growth mind-set, and so
on have primarily focused on the positive drives
(
Hong, 2016). Using a grounded theory approach,
however, qualitativeﬁndings from local focus groups
of low-income job seekers suggested that PSS is“a
dynamic process of overcoming perceived employ-
ment barriers along the goal-oriented path to individ-
ualized success and developing employment hope
within the new realities of career goals” (
Hong,
2013; Hong, Polanin, et al., 2014,p .6 9 3 ) .T om a i n -
tain this balance between the negative and positive
on the path to ESS, it is posited that one has to recog-
nize employment barriers as such and be able to
transform this to a motivational outlook and put
eﬀort toward realistic goals as one becomes an em-
powered worker (
Hong, 2013). As illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, the bottom-up theory hypothesizes that PSS as
a necessary condition positively aﬀects ESS (Hong,
2013; Hong, Stokar, & Choi, 2016).
As such, this process of developing PSS can be the-
oretically supported by social cognitive career theory
(SCCT) and the theory of mental contrasting. SCCT
hypothesizes that taking into consideration the
environmental obstacles to achieve targeted goals, self-
eﬃcacy and outcome expectations contribute posi-
tively to the development of vocational hope (
Brown,
Lamp, Telander, & Hacker, 2013). Mental contrasting
combines the negative and positive assessments, which
involves concurrently focusing on a positive outcome
and the obstacles that block the path to the outcome
(
Duckworth, Grant, Loew, Oettingen, & Gollwitzer,
2011). By engaging in the process of contrasting the
barrier-ﬁlled reality with the desired future outcome,
one generates positive energy toward goals (Oettingen,
2000; Oettingen, Pak, & Schnetter, 2001). Making
a strong association between future and reality sig-
nals the need to overcome the obstacles to attain the
desired future.
Paralleling these theories, PSS comprises the
negative perceived employment barriers and the
positive employment hope (
Hong, 2013). Perceiv-
ing employment barriersﬁrst as barriers is the start-
ing point in this psychological process to transform
the negative self-assessment into a positive one and
channel this toward the desired future economic
outcome. PSS is not a byproduct of ESS but a
centerpiece to lasting economic success. Perceived
employment barriers coincide with dwelling —
reﬂecting on the current reality that obstructs the
path to one’s desired future, and employment hope
closely matches with indulging— imagining a desired
future and mentally elaborating its beneﬁts. Dwelling
and indulging individually by themselves do not
necessitate action toward goals, but mental con-
trasting generates energy toward goals.
Previous research has validated the two measures
that comprise PSS— the Perceived Employment Bar-
rier Scale (PEBS) (
Hong, Polanin, et al., 2014; Hong,
Song, Choi, & Park, 2015)a n dt h eE m p l o y m e n t
Hope Scale (EHS) (Hong, Choi, & Polanin, 2014;
Hong et al., 2012; Hong, Song, Choi, & Park,
2016)— and has found them to be valid across multi-
ple settings within the United States and South Kor-
ea. Perceived employment barriers are conceptually
clustered intoﬁve dimensions— physical and mental
health, labor market exclusion, child care, human
capital, and soft skills— and were found to be nega-
tively associated with employment hope (
Hong, Po-
lanin, et al., 2014; Hong, Song, Choi, & Park, 2015).
Employment hope comprises psychological empow-
erment, futuristic self-motivation, utilization of skills
and resources, and goal-orientation and was found to
be positively associated with ESS (
Hong, Choi, &
Polanin, 2014; H o n g ,S o n g ,C h o i ,&P a r k ,2 0 1 6).
The gap in the literature that this study addresses is
conceptualizing PSS as having not only the positive
attribute, but also the negative internal factor— how
perceived employment barriers and employment
hope interact— and quantitatively validating the con-
cept of PSS. The study also seeks to answer how the
two key components of PSS contribute to ESS.
Low PSS would make it diﬃcult for an individual
to navigate the labor market andﬁnd employment,
which then would make it more diﬃcult to achieve
ESS. For example, someone with low PSS mayﬁnd

it diﬃcult to follow through with myriad tasks associ-
ated with identifying job leads, requesting informa-
tion, updating a resume, and so on. In this regard, as
depicted in Figure
1, it is hypothesized that perceived
barriers negatively a ﬀect employment hope
(hypothesis 1) and employment hope positively
contributes to ESS (hypothesis 2). Also, it is hypoth-
esized that employment hope mediates the relation-
ship between perceived employment barriers and ESS
(hypothesis 3).
METHOD
Sample and Data Collection
This study used two independent samples from
local community-based agencies in Chicago. The
ﬁrst sample was collected from participants of a
social services agency in the West Haven community
of Chicago between October 2008 and March 2009
(sample 1). West Haven is a neighborhood facing the
side eﬀects of transformed high-rise public housing;
the clients of this agency have received assistance in
the areas of job preparation, life skills training,
ﬁnancial literacy, public beneﬁts, and other sup-
port services. The second sample was collected
from participants in a nationally recognized job
training program in Chicago (sample 2) between
June 2009 and August 2010. The agency provides
services in the areas of intensive job readiness train-
ing, job search, placement, and yearlong retention
services.
The size of each sample is similar (sample 1= 390,
sample 2= 411), and an equivalent proportion of the
participants were receiving Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families beneﬁts (sample 1= 42.3%; sample
2 = 41.4%). However, other demographic character-
istics of the two independent samples were slightly
diﬀerent. Sample 1 had a higher percentage of
women (62.4%) than sample 2 (54.3%); the aver-
age age for sample 1 was lower (40.5) than that for
sample 2 (42.09). Sample 1 was mostly African
American (97.9%), with 24.9% having less than a
high school education; sample 2 was a bit more
diverse (87.2%), and 14.7% did not have a high
school degree. Sample 1 was less employed (20.3%),
with a lower percentage having more than 10 years
of job training experience (41.7%) compared with
sample 2’s employment rate (28.4%) and job train-
ing experience (57.9%). In addition, there was a dif-
ference in the average individual income across the
two samples (μ:s a m p l e1= $14,595, sample 2=
$8,325).
Measures
Hong et al. (2009) originally conceptualized the
EHS with a 24-item six-factor structure derived
from qualitativeﬁndings. This measure uses a Likert-
type scale ranging from 0= strongly disagree to
10 = strongly agree. Each factor was constructed to
have four items. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
procedure decreased the 24-item six-factor model
into a 14-item two-factor model; four items loaded
on the ﬁrst factor labeled psychological empower-
ment, and 10 items loaded on the second factor of
goal-orientation pathways (
Hong et al., 2012). This
14-item two-factor model preliminarily identiﬁed
using an EFA was then validated as a 14-item four-
factor model using a conﬁrmatory factor analysis
(CFA) (Hong & Choi, 2013) and subsequently a
multisample CFA (Hong, Choi, & Polanin, 2014).
The four factors are (1) psychological empower-
ment (four items), (2) futuristic self-motivation (two
items), (3) utilization of resources and skills (four
items), and (4) goal-orientation (four items). EHS
was cross-nationally revalidated using a national sam-
ple of Self-Suﬃciency Program (SSP) participants in
South Korea (
Hong, Song, Choi, & Park, 2016).
PEBS was developed byHong, Polanin, et al.
(2014) as an empowerment-based measure captur-
ing the level of barriers to securing a job as perceived
by low-income job seekers. The study suggested a
ﬁve-factor 20-item PEBS generally covering the
range of individual, family, human capital, and
structural factors— (1) physical and mental health
(four items), (2) labor market exclusion (three
items), (3) child care (three items), (4) human capital
(ﬁve items), and (5) personal balance and soft skills
(ﬁve items). Respondents were asked to rank each
employment-related barrier item by circling a num-
ber on aﬁve-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1
= not a barrier to 5= strong barrier, according to
how the item aﬀects one’s securing a job. PEBS was
also cross-culturally validated in the South Korean
context from a nationally representative sample of
SSP participants (
Hong, Song, Choi, & Park, 2015).
ESS was measured using the Women’sE m p l o y -
ment Network (WEN) Economic Self-Suﬃciency
Scale (Gowdy & Pearlmutter, 1993) to capture the
multidimensionality of ESS. This scale measures
the self-assessed level of economic and ﬁnancial
independence with four factors: (1) autonomy
and self-determination, (2) ﬁnancial security and
responsibility, (3) family and self well-being, and
(4) basic assets for community living.

Analysis Procedure
The analysis goals of this study were twofold: (1) to
validate PSS as a two-factor— EHS and PEBS—
measurement model across two independent sam-
ples and (2) to investigate the pathways among
P E B S ,E H S ,a n dE S S .
To achieve theﬁrst goal, we conducted a CFA
on PSS as a higher order latent measure that in-
cludes EHS and PEBS. We compared the proposed
two-factor PSS with the one-factor model, follow-
ing
P. Kline’s( 1 9 9 4 )suggestion. While the one-
factor baseline model represents a global hypothesis
where all of the items form one factor, the proposed
second model is composed of EHS and PEBS based
on the theoretical framework. These two nested
models are compared using appropriate model-ﬁt
statistics. Traditional chi-square model-ﬁt statistics
were not considered due to the large sample size
(
Meade, Johnson, & Braddy, 2008). Instead, several
model-ﬁt indices were used to reduce the plausibil-
ity of chanceﬁt and to increase the robustness of the
conclusions— that is, the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) (Steiger & Lind, 1980), the
comparativeﬁti n d e x( C F I )(Bentler, 1990), the non-
normed ﬁti n d e x( N N F I )(Hu & Bentler, 1999),
and Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Akaike,
1987). The values of CFI and NNFI above .90 are
considered a goodﬁt( Bentler & Bonett, 1980; R. B.
Kline, 2011) and conservatively above .95 are an
excellentﬁt( Hu & Bentler, 1999). RMSEA values up
to .08 indicate an acceptableﬁt( R. B. Kline, 2011)
a n du pt o. 0 6ac l o s eﬁt( Hu & Bentler, 1999).
Regarding the AIC, the model with the lowest value
is preferred.
To achieve the second analysis goal after conduct-
ing construct validation of PSS across two samples,
the authors proceeded to test the theoretical model
using structural equation modeling (SEM). Following
Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988)procedures, a CFA
was ﬁrst conducted to assess the proposed dimension-
ality through theﬁt of the individual items to their
respective scales. Next, the hypothesized model was
analyzed using SEM to indicate the pathways from
perceived employment barriers to ESS mediated by
employment hope. AMOS (Version 7.0) (
Arbuckle,
2006) was used to perform CFA, multigroup CFA,
and SEM, using a maximum likelihood estimation
method. Full-information maximum likelihood was
used to handle missing data. Finally, we used theSo-
bel (1982)test to examine the indirect eﬀect of per-
ceived employment barriers on ESS.
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive and bivariate statistics for the latent
construct of PSS— EHS and PEBS— and ESS are pre-
sented in Table1. The correlation between employ-
ment hope and perceived employment barriers was
negative and the correlation between employment
hope and ESS was positive as expected. All the vari-
ables were found to meet the assumptions for normal-
ity with the values of skewness between−1.261 and
1.68 and the values of kurtosis between−0.745 and
2 . 8 0 8 .T h ev a l u e so fs k e w n e s sw i t h i n−2a n d+2
(
Field, 2009; Gravetter & Wallnau, 2014; Trochim &
Donnelly, 2006) and the values of kurtosis within−3
and +3( Byrne, 2010) are considered to be normally
distributed (see Table1).
Because SEM requires that the multivariate nor-
mality assumption is met, the study proceeded to
test the assumption using multivariate kurtosis
(
Mardia, 1970, 1974). As presented in Table1, evi-
dence of multivariate normality was found with
multivariate kurtosis values (critical ratio [CR]) of
0.392 (0.707) in sample 1 and 1.032 (1.910) in
sample 2. CR values of 1.96 or less indicate that
multivariate kurtosis is not signiﬁcant; therefore
multivariate normality can be assumed.
Validation of the PSS Scale
This study examined whether one common model
of PSSﬁts the data well across two samples using a
CFA. Two alternative models were compared in
each group: A one-factor model and a two-factor
model. The one-factor model is a baseline model
where all nine subfactors— four for EHS andﬁve for
PEBS— are loaded onto one general factor. The sec-
ond one is a two-factor model in which four factors
are loaded onto one factor (EHS) and the otherﬁve
factors are loaded onto the other factor (PEBS).
Given the well-known problem of the chi-square
test being sensitive to sample size (
Anderson &
Gerbing, 1988; Marsh & Grayson, 1990; Steenkamp
& Baumgartner, 1998), model ﬁt was evaluated
using several ﬁt indices to quantify the degree of
ﬁt to supplement the chi-square test. The model
comparison is presented in Table2.B a s e do nt h e
ﬁt indices of CFI, NNFI, RMSEA, and AIC, the
two-factor model reported signiﬁcantly better ﬁts
than the baseline model across two samples, indic-
ating the superiority of the two-factor model. The
factor loadings for the PSS model are presented in
Figure
2.

Theoretical Model from PSS to ESS
Given the veriﬁed structure of PSS across the two
samples, the study tested the theoretical model
with the path from PSS to ESS. In keeping with
PSS representing the process of mental contrasting
of employment barriers to hope, it was hypothe-
sized that perceived employment barriers a ﬀect
ESS mediated by employment hope.
Prior to testing the hypothesized pathways from
perceived employment barriers to employment
hope and from employment hope to ESS, the
study tested the individual item reliability to assess
the dimensionality of the proposed model. As a
result of CFA, the measurement modelﬁts the data
reasonably well, χ
2(654, N = 801) = 2132.233,
p = .000, CFI = .935, NNFI = .926, RMSEA
[95% conﬁdence interval (CI)]= .053 [.051–.056].
Baring veriﬁed latent factor structure of the mea-
surement model, the proposed model was tested
using SEM. As reported in Table
3,a l lﬁti n d i c e s
indicate that the hypothesized model has a good
ﬁtt ot h ed a t a ,χ2(655, N = 801) = 2141.453,
p = .000, CFI = .935, NNFI = .926, RMSEA
[95% CI] = .053 [.051–.056]. Perceived employ-
ment barriers are negatively associated with EHS,
supporting hypothesis 1; employment hope is pos-
itively related to ESS, supporting hypothesis 2
(see Figure
3). To estimate the indirect eﬀect of per-
ceived employment barriers (that is, the mediation
eﬀect of EHS), a Sobel test was used. The result in-
dicates that perceived employment barriers have a
negative indirect eﬀect on ESS through employ-
ment hope, z = −3.54, p = .000. The total eﬀect
size from PEBS to ESS, which is also the indirect eﬀect
from perceived employment barriers to ESS, is−.019;
the direct eﬀect from perceived employment bar-
riers to employment hope and from employment
hope to ESS are−.125 and .154, respectively. The
assessment of hypotheses is presented in Table
3.
As another way to examine the mental contrast-
ing process, PSS was operationalized as the diﬀer-
ence in normalized scores between employment
hope and perceived employment barriers. The
proposed model was tested using SEM. As re-
ported in Table
4, all ﬁt indices indicate that the

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This study validated the factor structure of PSS—
comprising employment hope and perceived
employment barriers— and examined how PSS aﬀects
ESS among low-income job seekers. Results from
CFA on PSS revealed that PSS is a valid measure across
two independent samples. The hypothesized path
from PSS to ESS using SEM was also conﬁrmed with
good ﬁt indices, indicating that the theoretical model
has a goodﬁtw i t ht h ed a t a .E m p l o y m e n th o p ew a s
found to be a full mediator between perceived
employment barriers and ESS. Moreover, PSS mea-
sured as the diﬀerence score between employment

hope and perceived employment barriers was also
found to have a signiﬁcant path to ESS.
Limitations of this study need mentioning. First,
PSS primarily captures individual attitudes and
behavioral attributes, but ESS is not aﬀected only
through change at the person level. In fact, employ-
ment and retention outcomes rest more on the
structural conditions embedded within the low-wage
labor market in various complex ways. Second,
although this study examined perceived barriers as
one overarching concept, perceived employment
barriers include both individual and structural barriers.
Barriers, as perceived by low-income job seekers, rep-
resent individual articulation as rational agents the
degree to which personal and socioeconomic con-
ditions are blocking their paths to achieving eco-
nomic success in the labor market (
Hong, Polanin,
et al., 2014). Therefore, employment hope repre-
sents a self-assessment of individual identity, capac-
ity, motivation, future possibilities, resources and
skills, and goal orientation within the context of
individual and structural barriers (
Hong, Choi, &
Polanin, 2014). The PSS process could then be bet-
ter understood as activating employment hope
against how limiting or enabling these barriers may
be when moving toward ESS.
When it comes to the labor market processes
and outcomes, employment hope could parallel
the mediating eﬀects of culture as described by
Wilson (2010)— bringing together the eﬀects of
individual and structural barriers negatively aﬀect-
ing hope and hope negatively aﬀecting ESS. PSS is
a concept that denotes empowerment-based, goal-
oriented individual drive against all odds that one
might face. It places the locus of control on indivi-
duals as much as possible against individual and
structural barriers that limit their drive to reach the
ESS outcome (
Hong, Stokar, & Choi, 2016 ).
However, PSS is not all about internally motivat-
ing oneself with hope within the conﬁnes of ex-
isting barriers. Rather, it is more about keeping
hope alive despite the barriers and actively sus-
taining it greater than the negative barrier-ﬁlled
assessment of reality in the labor market— as the
name of a PSS-based intervention Transforming
Impossible into Possible would suggest (
Hong,
2016).
Therefore, future studies should examine how
the individual and structural barriers dynamically
aﬀect employment hope in the PSS process. In the
case where structural barriers may have strong pres-
ence in reality, they may forcefully limit the possi-
bility of low-income job seekers overcoming their
individual barriers. It is also possible that when bar-
riers are less real and a person only perceives them
to be higher due to social isolation, he or she might
adjust the scores on these barriers downward to
those that more adequately represent the reality

through personal reﬂection in job readiness train-
ing and individual coaching sessions.
Based on the ﬁndings, it is recommended that
workforce development practitioners focus on PSS
to achieve ESS when working with low-income
job seekers at the individual level and with em-
ployers and policymakers at the structural level.
Adhering to the newly emerging transformative
social work practice framework (
Schott & Weiss,
2015), PSS can provide an integrative multisystems
approach to labor market supply–demand matching
and quality job development (Hong, 2016). The for-
mer would involve some form of direct social work
practice— casework or group work— to prepare indi-
viduals to become job ready. And the latter would
entail using PSS as a framework to engage in organi-
zational development within workforce development
and job placement organizations and companies that
recruit and hire from the low-wage labor market.
Also, it would be vital through advocacy and pol-
icy entrepreneurship to incentivize employers and
engage them in human-centered hiring, training,
and retention support.
At the individual level, benchmarking PSS and
providing adequate supportive services along suc-
cessful employment and retention paths are war-
ranted. Workforce development organizations should
use PEB and EHS measures to track the human-
centered developmental process in becoming job
ready (
Hong, 2013). As such, applying PSS as the
main self-suﬃciency process goal would require
“developing relationships based on respect for cli-
ents” and evaluating individual progress on each
goal (Bratt & Keyes, 1998, p. 807). Speciﬁcally, hope
building and maintaining strategies would involve
(a) an individualized employment and retention plan,
(b) support services to remove barriers that block
the drive and pathway, (c) reassessing and revising
goals, and (d) an evaluation based on the short-term
achievement of the process.
PSS as psychological capital is also relevant
i nt e r m so fh o wi tm a n i f e s t sa ss o f ts k i l l st h a te m -
ployers tend to ﬁnd as key in hiring decisions—
that is, employee motivation; self-presentation;
and interpersonal skills such as cheerful demeanor,
eﬀective communication skills, and emotional self-
regulation (
Carnochan, Taylor, Pascual, & Austin,
2014). These inter- and intrapersonal abilities per-
tain to “personality, attitude and behavior” (Moss
& Tilly, 2001) and“personality traits, goals, moti-
vations, and preferences ” (Heckman & Kautz,
2012, p. 451). Heckman and Kautz (2013) have
argued that these attributes are character and that
character is a noncognitive skill and not a trait.
Character skills— personality traits, goals, motiva-
tions, and preferences— or soft skills are important
predictors of success and sources of inequality in
the labor market, in school, and in many other
areas of economic and social life (
Heckman &
Kautz, 2012). They suggest that these skills can be
changed by interventions that promise to improve
manifest behaviors.
At the organizational level, workforce develop-
ment agencies and employers can jointly invest in
pre- and post-employment support for PSS as a
precursor to win–win solutions— job placement
and retention outcomes for the former and reduc-
tion of turnover rates and quality human resource
management for the latter. With some creativity,
community agencies can use curricula, counseling,
coaching, and other support services to carve out
spaces for their clients— their inventors of hope—
to be partners in developing and implementing the
most appropriate intervention.
Liu, Huang, and
Wang (2014), in their meta-analytic review, found
that the job search intervention programs were
largely more successful in facilitating employment
for participants compared with those in the control
group. Interventions that contained such compo-
nents as job search skills, self-presentation, self-
eﬃcacy, proactivity, goal setting, and social support
were found to be more successful than those that
did not include them. Programs that coupled skill
development with motivation enhancement were
found to be more successful inﬁnding employ-
ment for job seekers.
At the structural level, engaging employers as
partners to work together on providing more
comprehensive and holistic approaches to hiring
and retention support would strengthen the
labor market. It is crucial to involve employers
in these programs because of theﬁnancial invest-
ment they put into their employees. By being
involved, employers can not only understand the
type of transformation their prospective employ-
ees have made to exemplify strong soft skills, but
also see the dividends of motivation and perfor-
mance— that is, lower turnover rate and higher
productivity — that the employees have once on
the job site. Incorporating a PSS framework into
the workplace will yield a higher job retention
rate.
