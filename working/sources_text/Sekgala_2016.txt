ABSTRACT
The democratic dispensation in South Africa compelled government to implement 
skills development legislation to intensify employees’ capacity development. The 
evolution of democratic values triggered both the public and private sectors to 
invest in their existing and prospective employees. The public service departments 
and private companies have been obliged to conduct skills needs analyses, develop 
workplace skills plans, and implement training and development programmes as 
p r e s c r i b e d  b y  v a r i o u s  p i e c e s  o f  l e g i s l a t i o n .  E m p l o y e e  t r a i n i n g  a n d  d e v e l o p m e n t  
allow organisations to maximize the achievement of management objectives of 
the department, resolve organisational problems, and align employees’ culture 
and personal thinking to the values, culture, mission and vision of the department. 
This article considers training and development programmes as essential variables 
for improving employees’ performance and explores whether there is a strong 
relationship between training and development and performance improvement in 
the public service.
INTRODUCTION
The importance of the effective conclusion of enabling functions can only be evaluated 
when the questions of supply and demand for well trained employees in the labour market 
are taken into consideration. Erasmus in Netshikhophani (2012:38) argues that the Republic 
of South Africa is a developing country and it is for this reason that there is development 
in a variety of community areas, such as technology, sociology, politics and economics. 
Human resource management consists of a network of functions and functional activities, 
which with the aid of deﬁ ned analytical methods and auxiliary aids and with the recognition 
of speciﬁ c normative guidelines, must be exercised in order to provide, utilise, remunerate, 
train, develop and maintain a motivated personnel corps for the public service.

REASONS FOR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
The intentions of the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), in 
c o n s u l t a t i o n  w i t h  t h e  D e p a r t m e n t  o f  H i g h e r  E d u c a t i o n  a n d  T r a i n i n g  i n  m a k i n g  e v e r y  
workplace a training space, are an attempt to develop public servants’ esprit de corps for 
the public service. This endeavour is to improve the performance of their duties effectively 
and efﬁ ciently in rendering general public services to all South Africans. Raina (2013:18) 
argues that only then would a signiﬁ cant portion of unskilled employees go for training and 
become good performers in rendering public services. When sufﬁ  ciently trained personnel 
are available, the performance of the public service organisations will improve to meet the 
legitimate social expectation from the communities on service delivery. This opinion is 
attested to and supported by the provision of Section 18.2 of the Skills Development Act, 97 
of 1998, as amended.
Former DPSA Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, through Human Resources Development (HRD) 
Circular 1 of 2012, further directed that there shall be a credit bearing Compulsory Induction 
Programme (CIP) that will run for a period of two years (i.e. 24 months) to all new entrants 
in the public service as part of the initiative to ensure professionalism of the public service 
as an organisation. The introduction of the CIP replaces a two-day Public Service Induction 
(PSI) that was introduced through HRD Circular 1 of 2008 for all promoted and transferred 
employees across the public service. Though there are many reasons why training and 
development programmes should be considered by the government departments, inter alia, 
the following are advanced for this study:
 ● creating a pool of readily available and adequate human resources hub for replacement 
of personnel who may leave or move up in the department;
 ● enhancing the department’s ability to adopt and use advances in technology because 
of a sufﬁ cient knowledgeable and skilled staff;
 ● building a more efﬁ cient, effective and highly motivated team, which enhances the 
department’s competitive position and improves employees morale and performance 
levels; and
 ● ensuring adequate human resources pool for expansion into new programmes and 
projects of the department as informed by the strategic direction under the new 
administration.
Whilst recognising the backdrop of various reasons for implementation of training 
and development programmes, Van Tonder (2008:27) brings the historical challenges 
to the fore that training and development programmes in general were not linked to 
employment and were also not aimed at industries’ needs. Ernst in Van Tonder (2008:28) 
states that training and development programmes were typiﬁ  ed by unfairness in terms 
of access to study opportunities in terms of race and gender, before the introduction of 
the Skills Development Act 1998  and Employment Equity  Act. Pillay (ANC Today 2012) 
claims that education and skills development matters are catalysts for job creation; 
however it is not the only area of development that matters. Van Tonder (2008:28) 
further attests to the view that education and training were also seen as two separate 
ﬁ elds, with education on a knowledge-content based system, whereas in training the 
emphasis was on skills.

IMPACT OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT ON 
EMPLOYEES’ PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT
Employee training and development can transform organisations. However, Van Tonder 
(2008:18) brings an argument that lack of employment continuity creates a major problem for 
training and development. He also points out that specialised skills training for the employees 
not only increases safety and productivity, but also lead to improved job satisfaction which 
in turn signiﬁ cantly improves performance of the department.
It is crucial to note that not all performance problems can be solved through training 
p r o g r a m m e s .  I n  m a n y  c a s e s ,  n o n - t r a i n i n g  i n t e r v e n t i o n s  a r e  n e c e s s a r y ,  s u c h  a s  w e l l n e s s  
programmes. According to the Human Resource Development Strategic Framework 
(HRDSF) (Vision 2015:43), the skills development legislation in South Africa encourages 
many organisations to include employee training and development as an integral part of 
their organisational strategy. Van Tonder (2008:27) agrees that the skills development 
legislative environment in South Africa changed the complexion of training and development 
entirely. This was followed in ascending order by recruitment and selection, induction 
and orientation, productivity and quality services, succession planning, employees’ job 
satisfaction, globalisation and diversity.
According to Mello (2010:75) focus should be on positive points, such as acknowledging 
employee’s qualiﬁ cations and qualities and giving them an understanding that employers 
need their contribution and know-how to operate the organisation effectively. Mello (2010:76) 
further notes that government departments that provide special technical training and 
development to employees create ample opportunities for promotions for their employees. 
This exercise encourages employees to exert themselves and take the initiative to rise to the 
challenges which gives guaranteed returns to the organisation. A wide, appropriate selection 
of leadership development seminars, management training, functional and technical courses 
are available to the employers to choose from in order to skill their personnel. According 
to Boonie (2012:3), training of employees is a crucial investment and it is essential to the 
government departments as a means to performance improvement.
Accordingly, it is fundamental to devote resources to on-going training, development 
of leadership skills, and to create opportunities for advancement of employees within 
the organisation. According to Silberman and Philips in Boonie (2012:2), training and 
development programmes supplement the achievement of organisational goals and objectives 
by analysing needs, designing and developing training programmes, and conducting training 
at all levels throughout the organisation and evaluating them. Most organisations consider 
training and development programmes as the key part of their employment equity initiatives, 
performance enhancement and performance recovery initiatives as well as their strategic 
human resources provisioning plan.
THE USE OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE
It is generally understood among trainers that training and development programmes need to 
be evaluated in order, among others, to:
<<<PAGE=4>>>
Volume 9 number 1  March 2016 47
 ● justify ﬁ nancial investments made in the training and development programmes;
 ● gather feedback for an on-going performance improvement as the training and 
development programme is being delivered;
 ● demonstrate a link between human resources development programmes and 
organisational strategy; and
 ● compare effectiveness of two or more training and development programmes.
According to Netshikhophani (2012:14), a performance management and development 
s y s t e m  s h o u l d  l i n k  e m p l o y e e  a c t i v i t i e s  w i t h  t h e  o r g a n i s a t i o n ’ s  g o a l s .  O n e  o f  t h e  w a y s  
the strategies are implemented is through deﬁ  ning the results, behaviours, and to some 
extent, employees’ characteristics that are necessary for carrying out those strategies and 
then developing measurement and feedback systems that maximise and grow results. 
Performance can be measured through objective and subjective means. However, Sousa, 
Aspinwall and Rodrigues express their views in Balgobind (2009:30) that performance 
measurement is the process of quantifying the efﬁ ciency and effectiveness of the action and 
performance measure as the metric used to quantify that action. Both formal and informal 
training interventions are thought to provide a forum for the development of a skill for the 
employees in the department.
Learning organisations are the ones that recognise the desire of people to learn 
and grow and also provide them with the opportunity to enhance the future of the 
organisation. According to Balgobind (2009:74), training and development programmes 
are designed to assist organisations to satisfy their skills requirements and to ensure 
that employees continuously develop themselves. One might therefore clearly imagine 
how failure to provide training and development programmes to the organisation would 
catalyse productivity and performance in the organisation. Workplace learning thus 
forms a critical part of successful functioning of an organisation. Evans, Hodkinson, 
Rainbird and Unwin in Robbertze (2008:9) argue that the employment relationship is 
signiﬁ cant to a workplace learning because the workplace is the site where workers 
experience the unequal power relation between themselves and the employer. Robbertze 
(2008:31) emphasises that high-leverage training initiative has been accompanied by a 
movement to link training and development programmes to performance improvement or 
business strategy.
T o successfully conclude that training and development have a meaningful contribution 
on employees performance improvement, there is no other option except evaluating and 
measuring training and development programmes, by addressing Donald L. Kirkpatrick’s four 
levels of evaluation which became ﬁ ve eventually (Maboa 2009:20), namely:
 ● Level 1- Reaction and Planned actions;
 ● Level 2–Learning;
 ● Level 3–Behaviour;
 ● Level 4–Results; and
 ● Level 5–Return on Investment.
Maboa (2009:20) argues that since its development in 1959, the Kirkpatrick’s four levels 
of evaluation, signiﬁ  c a n t  p r o g r e s s  h a s  b e e n  m a d e  t o  b e t t e r  u n d e r s t a n d  e v a l u a t i o n  o f  
training and development impact to the organisations across the globe. According to
<<<PAGE=5>>>
African Journal of Public Affairs48
Maboa (2009:20), since the evolution of the skills development and human resources 
development professions, Kirkpatrick’s level of evaluation have made a positive 
contribution towards assessing all factors around the Return on Investment that the 
organisations and the public service departments are making towards productivity and 
service delivery improvement, respectively. These developments have therefore proved 
that the Kirkpatrick’s approach is the most commonly used approach in HRD practice in 
South Africa and globally.
ROLE OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
IN PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
According to Mello (2011:440), training and development goals and objectives must be 
reﬂ ected in performance management feedback systems. Netshikhophani (2012:74) is of the 
opinion that performance management and development are critical skills to the success 
of quality and effective organisational management functions that have to be developed. 
Netshikhophani (2008:72) concurs with Mello (2011:440) that all these efforts will dictate 
the training and development needs that eventually form the content part of training and 
development programmes.
According to Cascio and Aguinis (2011:353), speciﬁ cation of training (i.e. what is to be 
learned) becomes possible once training and development needs have been identiﬁ  ed. 
Training needs assessment is therefore a fundamental step in the process of training design. 
The concepts of training and development are mostly used together or interchangeably. 
H o w e v e r  t h i s  d o e s  n o t  n e c e s s a r i l y  m e a n  t h a t  t h e y  h a v e  t h e  s a m e  m e a n i n g,  e v e n  t h o u g h  
they are highly interrelated. It is for this reason that they were clariﬁ ed in chapter one under 
the clariﬁ cation of concepts used in this study. According to Netshikhophani (2012:43), the 
primary aim of training and development is to capacitate the employees with the current 
job related skills requirements and acquire knowledge that would ultimately assist them to 
perform better, effectively and efﬁ ciently even in future positions.
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS (PMFS)
According to Cascio and Aguinis (2011:730), performance management is a continuous 
process of identifying, measuring and developing the performance of individuals and teams 
and also aligning performance with the strategic goals of the organisation. Hale and Franklin 
(2008:99) articulate that performance management frameworks use organisations’ processes 
and clariﬁ c a t i o n  o f  a c c o m p l i s h m e n t  c r i t e r i a  t o  a d v a n c e  t h e  d e c i s i o n  m a k i n g  p r o c e s s .  
This type of approach places a primary emphasis on the systematic measurement of the 
o u t c o m e s  a s  t h e y  r e ﬂ ect desired results emanating from performance improvement as a 
result of training and development programmes, rather than a traditional focus on inputs and 
processes as a means to prioritise funding choices.
According to Hale and Franklin (2008:99), the following ideas are to support performance 
management framework:
<<<PAGE=6>>>
Volume 9 number 1  March 2016 49
 ● most people make decisions based on personal and professional background, 
experiences, and preferences for abstract concepts;
 ● the overall goal is to minimize the negative impact and maximise the positive beneﬁ t 
of decisions;
 ● the choice of measurements can reﬂ ect process and/or product;
 ● indicators should be speciﬁ c and measurable; and
 ● it is important to maximise analytic skills and minimize the potential for political 
manipulation.
According to Balgobind (2008:32), the balance scorecard developed by Kaplan and Norton 
is a way of translating an organisation’s mission and strategy into a comprehensive set of 
performance measures that provides the framework for a strategic measurement and 
management system. He further argues that the scorecard provides a set of measures that 
gives a comprehensive view of the public service operations and brings together the diverse 
elements of the public organisation’s competitive agenda. According to Cascio and Aguinis 
(2011:73), performance needs to be assessed at regular intervals and feedback is provided 
so that performance can be improved on an on-going basis. The Performance Management 
and Development Framework provided by the DPSA also makes provision for the quarterly 
performance appraisals to provide regular performance feedback and address the identiﬁ ed 
development areas through training and development programmes. It can therefore be 
argued that upon performance assessment, the identiﬁ  ed developmental areas need to be 
addressed through training and development programmes in order to catalyse the employees’ 
performance improvement.
According to Mello (2011:398), the key factor in strategising training programmes is to 
ensure that desired results of training and development programmes are reinforced when 
employees achieve or accomplish them. This achievement can be made when managers and 
supervisors begin to accommodate the new learning and knowledge of the employees to be 
practiced at the workplace. Mello (2011:397) further argues that when training, performance 
measurement and compensation are administered separately and not integrated within 
a larger, integrative HR Strategy, there is less chance of the appropriate and necessary 
r e i n f o r c e m e n t .  R e l a t i v e  a s s e s s m e n t  o f  e m p l o y e e s  c a n  b e  u s e f u l  i n  a l l o w i n g  o r g a n i s a t i o n s  
to identify overall top performing employees for a performance reward to encourage 
competitive performance amongst employees; comparatively much as high schools provide 
class rank to their students to facilitate college and university assessment for admission 
(Mello, 201 1:436).
The following ﬁ  gure 1 indicates the correlational relationship amongst training, 
compensation and performance management:
The integration of training, performance management and reward or compensation for 
performance seeks to inﬂ uence the performance of individual employees to competitively 
improve with a view that, when they perform better they would be recognised through 
performance incentives or compensation. In concluding this section Netshikhophani 
(2012:74) argues that training and development become transformational tools to provide 
capacity building for the employees of the organisation for change, adaptability and 
performance improvement.

EVALUATION OF TRAINING AND 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES
Aguinis and Kraiger (2009:41) note that there are continuous calls for establishing tools for the 
Return on Investment (ROI) for training, particularly as training and development activities 
continues to be outsourced and new forms of technology-delivered training instructions are 
marketed as cost effective by various training providers. Training evaluation and assessment 
has become a critical pillar of skills development in South Africa. Employers would want 
t o  k n o w  i f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  t r a i n i n g  i n i t i a t i v e  h a s  m a d e  a n  i m p a c t  o n  t h e  s e r v i c e  d e l i v e r y  o r  
productivity improvement that was anticipated before training happened.
Maboa (2009:19) acknowledges the importance of Kirkpatrick’s four levels of training 
evaluation as argued by Robbertze (2008:15). However he further points out problems 
associated with training evaluation such as subjectivity of evaluation results. Mello (2011:393) 
agrees to this view expressed by Maboa (2009:19) and points out that learning measure 
whether the employees know more than they did prior to undertaking the training. It can 
then be argued that assessment and measurement of training and development programmes 
cannot entirely depend on any methods but on the actual learning that has taken place 
owing to the subjectivities of the training programmes, assessors and evaluators.
According to Carnall in Netshikhophani (2008:161), the purpose of assessing effectiveness 
of the organisation is to identify those sources that contribute to the ineffectiveness of the 
organ isation i n order to develop strategies to deal with them accordi ngly . It is an ideal to 
uncover the underlying factors that hinder the public organisation to effectively achieve 
its own strategic objectives as set down in the strategic plan. It is for this reason that, in 
responding to the performance challenges facing the public service departments, former 
Mi n i ster S i s u l u of the Depa rtmen t of Pub l i c Serv i ce a nd A dm i n i stra ti on (2 0 1 3) i n troduced 
the concepts of turning the public service around and changing performance management 
system based on the Public Service Charter signed by all the stakeholders to address 
diagnostic reports that identiﬁ  ed such deﬁ  ciencies. Robbertze (2008:15) emphasises by 
Figure 1:  The link between training and performance management 
and compensation
Source: Mello (2011:398)
<<<PAGE=8>>>
Volume 9 number 1  March 2016 51
quoting Kirkpatrick, that this approach of assessment and evaluation of training incorporates 
the knowledge and skills content of training, training methods and tactics, learning conditions 
and environment and the attitudinal training programmes. The emphasis made by Robbertze 
(2008:15) does not suggest that this is the only method of assessment but indicates that it 
does cover a variety of factors crucial for testing the quality of training programmes and can 
be considered important in helping to achieve the desired results of training assessment.
According to York (2010:186), measuring the Return on Investment (ROI) for a training 
programme adds a ﬁ fth level to the criteria. The following exhibition of ﬁ gure 2 narratively 
displays the relevance of evaluation for training and development programmes in any 
organisation to ensure their effective impact on the performance improvement.
The above ﬁ  g u r e  e x p l a i n s  t h e  l e v e l s  t h a t  a r e  i n v o l v e d  i n  a s s e s s m e n t  o f  t r a i n i n g  a n d  
development in responding to the questions that the organisation may need to have answered 
by training and development programmes. According to York (2010:187), if an organisation 
invests in new equipment, it is expected that the technological equipment will yield results 
in faster production, less waste and lower maintenance costs. He further argues that if an 
organisation invests in improving the knowledge and skills of its employees there should be 
some beneﬁ ts to the organisation. This opinion therefore suggests that equipment must be 
complemented by training of employees so that they may use them correctly and free from 
hazards, in order to have maximum beneﬁ ts from such equipment.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION 
TRAJECTORIES IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE
To provide comprehensive analogy of the trails of the skills development in the Public 
Service, it is essential to answer the following question; “Why Measure Training Outcomes?” 
According to Cascio and Aguinis (2011:372), few organisations assess the outcomes of 
training activities with any procedure more rigorous than participant reactions following 
the completion of training programmes. This situation is unfortunate if it is correct because 
Cascio and Aguinis (2011:372) believe that training must be evaluated and there are at least 
four reasons to evaluate training, namely:
 ● to make decisions about the future use of a training programme or technique (e.g. 
continue, modify or eliminate);
 ● to make decisions about individual trainees e.g. certify as competent, provide 
additional follow-up or refresher training programmes or declare them not yet 
competent;
 ● to contribute to a scientiﬁ c understanding of a training and development process; and
 ● to further political or public relations agenda e.g. to increase the creditability and 
visibility of the training function by documenting success or chase the numbers like 
under the Expanded Public Works Programme.
According to Balgobind (2009:32), the central aim of training and development is to develop 
staff potential, improve their performance levels and through linking employees’ individual 
objectives to business strategies improve the organisational performance. According to 
Mello (2011:393), after training has been delivered, it must be evaluated. After extensive 
exploration of various methods of determining the Return on Investment (ROI) available to 
assess the impact of training and development on employees’ performance improvement, it 
was therefore decided during the Public Sector Trainers Forum held in East London (2010) 
that the Impact Assessment Method is used in the public service as it is argued that it has 
a bearing on elements of Kirkpatrick’s levels of assessment and also held to be assisting the 
department in achieving the desired results of training assessment.
It should be noted that the President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr Jacob Zuma 
(2013) concurs to the education and training criticality of human resources development as he 
stated during the 2013 State of the Nation Address that “South Africa has declared education 
as  a n  a pe x  p r i o r i ty  n u m be r  o n e  i n  2 00 9  as  p a rt  o f  o u t c o m es  1  a n d  5  o f  1 2  g o v e r n m e n t  
priorities outcomes. It is required that everyone in the country realise that education is an 
essential service for the nation at work for a better life” (SONA 2013). He further emphasised 
that the education sector and the society as a whole should take education services seriously 
than it is happening. This reﬂ ection in the State of the Nation Address (SONA) by the highest 
ofﬁ ce in South Africa, the President of the Republic, gives a momentum to the signiﬁ  cance 
o f  e d u c a t i o n ,  t r a i n i n g  a n d  d e v e l o p m e n t  p r o g r a m m e s  t o  g o v e r n m e n t  p e r f o r m a n c e  a s  a n  
organisation. This argument is attested to by the gradual improvement of matriculations 
results since 2009 academic year to the matric class of 2013.
It is critical to note the views expressed by Maboa (2009:19) when he indicates that 
the success of the training programmes depends on the fact that trainees’ effective domain 
should be considered during training as it has the potential to sway the outcomes negatively,
<<<PAGE=10>>>
Volume 9 number 1  March 2016 53
if a trainee does not like that particular training. As per example, the Minister of Public Works 
directed the Directorate: HRD to implement change management training programmes as a 
compulsory course targeting all directors and chief directors as a good example of wasteful 
compulsory courses in the public service. It has been recorded that only 67 of the targeted 
140 National Department of Public Works Senior Management Services members attended 
this compulsory training programmes and no one submitted the Portfolio of Evidence as 
required by the course for National Department of Public Works (Change Management 
Course Report 2013). Maboa (2009:19) provides advice to trainers and HRD practitioners 
that training is geared towards skills transfer and therefore a new principle, updated facts and 
improved training techniques are central to the success of training.
According to PSC Impact Assessment Report (June 2013), it is generally understood in the 
public service that, in most cases, if the training and development interventions are decided 
by the management and are imposed on employees as mandatory, participants would ask 
some of the following questions:
 ● Is this training programmes going to address my skills needs?
 ● How is my performance activities linked to the training programmes?
 ● Is my improved performance going to be rewarded?
HRD Coordinators may ask if training programmes address the right skills deﬁ  cit of the 
organisation as per the skills audit report and workplace skills plan (WSP)?
 ● Managers would ask if the programmes would make their staff more productive? and
 ● Whilst the executive management would ask if the programmes will yield return on 
the ﬁ nancial investment (RoI) made by the department?
These questions are posed by critical internal clients to HRD components (the employees) 
and should therefore identify the types of measurement that would be employed on training 
and development programmes in the entire public service. The attitude of employees 
becomes negative towards the course as they view them irrelevant, management as 
undermining their skills and intelligence, their level of participation is low and they would 
just attend for the sake of attending. These attitudes generate a situation which results in 
negative ﬁ nancial implications in that trainees would not learn anything during such a 
training and development programme.
When assessing training and development implementation trajectories, the following 
topics come to the fore for exploration:
Human resources development planning and management
According to the Public Service Commission Report (2011:55), HRD is generally effectively 
planned and managed in the public service. Planning has therefore improved because of 
the standards requirements and legal expectations of the Workplace Skills Plans (WSPs) 
and their increased scrutiny by the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs). 
Accordingly, Human Resources Development Strategic Framework (HRDSF) (Vision 
2015:11) indicates that the overall accountability of government has also resulted in progress 
in planning and management of human resources development in the public service. 
Utilisation is made of skills audits reports and training needs assessments results as the basis

for training and development planning, and attention is given to the strategic requirements 
of the public organisations in determining the structure and content of HRD interventions 
and programmes.
The appointment of Skills Development Facilitators (SDFs) in many government 
departments and public entities began to contribute positively towards maximising the 
density of training and development functions in these organisations (HRDSF, Vision 2015:12). 
According to HRDSF (vision 2015), SDFs are appointed to plan and catalyse coordination of 
training in the departments. The following table displays the sectoral training planned for the 
public service as submitted by the SDFs of the various public service departments to Public 
Service Sector Education and Training Authority (PSETA), for the lifespan of the Sector Skills 
Plan (SSP) for the Public Service.
Training dilemma
According to NSDS (111:21), Human Resources Development in both the public service 
and private sector had focused on activities training which was more concerned about the 
number of employees trained during a speciﬁ c ﬁ nancial year. The President of the Republic 
of South Afr i ca a l so a rti c u l a ted th i s be l i ef of n u mbers of tr a i n i n g beneﬁ ciaries, during the 
launch of EPWP phase 3 in the Eastern Cape, on Friday, 3 October 2014, that Community 
Works Programmes contributed to poverty alleviation and construction skills transfers to 
4,5 million EPWP beneﬁ ciaries by 2014 (Zuma 2014). The shift from traditional training to 
performance-driven impact for training is crucial in meeting today’s ever changing business 
strategic objectives and goals as inﬂ uenced by various national and global external factors.

Accessibility to training and development programmes
HRDSF (Vision 2015:12) acknowledges that training is generally accessible in the public 
service though there are some few exceptions. According to PSETA SSP Report (April 
2 0 1 4 ) ,  m a n a g e r s  t e n d  t o  d e n y  s o m e  e m p l o y e e s  a n  o p p o r t u n i t y  t o  a t t e n d  t r a i n i n g  c i t i n g  
the workloads. In some cases, certain employees do not attend the appropriate courses. 
The issue is not the extent to which training resources are managed to meet the strategic 
objectives but meeting these critical organisational priorities may pose more challenges in 
delivering training programmes. Managers just replace targeted employees on the day of 
the course and training is as a result not responsive to the needs and circumstances of the 
organisation (PSETA ATR: 2013/2014).
According to Public Service Sector Education and Training Authority (PSETAs) Sector 
Ski l l s P l an (2 0 1 1 - 2 0 1 6:5 9), the N a ti on a l Sc hoo l of Go v ernment’ s (NSG) ro l e i s to ass i st i n 
building a capable public service through coordinating extensive opportunities and access 
to leadership and management competencies development-oriented programmes. Since the 
NSG can be viewed as a sole training provider in the public service, its achievement can be 
considered together with those of PSETA in its role as the anchor of the skills development 
in the public service. In this regard NSG has trained 26 490 ofﬁ cials in 2009/2010 ﬁ nancial 
year and has also trained 38 482 ofﬁ  cials in 2010/2011 ﬁ nancial year, respectively (PSETA 
SSP 2011-2016:59).
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRAINING 
AND DEVELOPMENT, AND PERFORMANCE 
IMPROVEMENT OF EMPLOYEES
Once a training need has been identiﬁ  ed it is essential for the employer to compile a 
Personal Development Plan (PDP) for such an employee. According to the Public Service 
PMDS Framework (2012), PDPs are also informed by the performance assessments done

on quarterly basis as part of annual appraisals in the NDPW. Mello (2011:430) agrees to the 
opinion expressed by Balgobind (2008:14) that there is a reciprocal relationship between 
training and development and performance management. The following exhibition displays 
Mello’s views on the reciprocity relationship between these functions:
The above ﬁ gure 3 displays the correlation that exists between training and development 
programmes and the performance improvement of the organisation. The outcomes that 
emerge as the link between these variables attest to the strong relationship that exists 
between these variables for the beneﬁ t of the organisation.
Performance appraisals and training impact assessment are critical functions that respond 
whether there is a strong relationship between training and development and performance 
improvement in the department. Naidoo (2008:51) attributes the possibility of poor 
performance to lack of reinforcement from supervisors and lack of proper systems or other 
resources they need to do the job. This argument therefore attests to the fact that the fertile 
environment for practicing the learned skills by employees helps employees for innovation 
on performance of their duties.
CONCLUSION
The administration through governance should set targets for performance improvement and 
set standards that should be monitored in order to hold public servants accountable for their 
public actions. The strength of the public service lies in its values, complemented with the 
employees’ skills improvement efforts, which provide the foundation for service delivery for 
the beneﬁ ts of the community. In general it can be stated that the training phase is the phase 
which has the longest duration. Skills development as a functional arrangement of public 
administration activity is inﬂ uenced by the political decisions and policies of the ruling party. 
The developed policies, laws and regulations passed by the legislature reﬂ  ect the mandate 
of the government-of-the-day and they must be aimed at promoting the general wellbeing of 
the society at large
There is a perception that because workers are continually exposed to change as a 
result of technological progress, training and development programmes cause productivity 
o r  s e r v i c e  d e l i v e r y  i m p r o v e m e n t  i n  t h e  o r g a n i s a t i o n s .  I t  i s  o f  i m p o r t a n c e  i n  t h e  p u b l i c  
service that employees should already know how their work must be performed from time 
of joining the government department so that they may be fully productive at the onset. 
This expectation is attested by the employment requirements set out by the Public Service 
Act, 1994 and Regulations. It however cannot be generally assumed that the new entrants 
into the public service are ready to perform, based only on their academic education. This 
uncertainty necessitates training programmes to essentially close any identiﬁ ed skills gaps. It 
has been observed in this study that the former Minster of Public Service and Administration 
has also acknowledged that the new entrants in the public service may have development 
areas that need to be addressed before they commence their work. This acknowledgement 
by the former Minister is attested to by the introduction of credit bearing and NQF aligned 
Compulsory Induction Programme (CIP) offered by the National School of Government for 
new entrants in the public sector, intended to build the public service cadres during the 
period of cadre development in South Africa.
