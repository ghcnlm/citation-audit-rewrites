Abstract: The impact of continuing job education and professional development on early exit from
the labor market is unclear. This systematic review examined how continuing job education or
professional development inﬂuences the retention of current employment. We searched the PubMed
and Embase databases from their start dates to January 2023. Two reviewers screened the full texts of
relevant reports and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the adapted
Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment. We qualitatively synthesized the results
of the included studies. We screened 7338 publications and included 27 studies consisting of four
cohort and 23 cross-sectional studies in the review. The participants of the selected studies were
mostly from the health sector (24 studies). There were 19 studies on staying or leaving a current
job, six on employee turnover intention, two on job change, one on return to work, one on early
retirement, and one on employment. Continuing employee development or training opportunities
were associated with increased intention to stay in a current job, decreased intention to leave a current
job, decreased employee turnover intention, job change, or early retirement and with faster return
to work. One of the two studies that examined the role of age showed that continuing employee
development is a more important factor for retaining current employment among younger than older
employees. A few studies found that job satisfaction and commitment fully mediated the relationship
between employee development and employee intention to leave current employment. This study
suggests that participating in professional training/development is related to a lower risk of leaving
current employment.

1. Introduction
Employee exit from the labor market is inﬂuenced by various factors, such as personal,
work, and organizational factors [1]. Age is a key factor that affects the risk of disability
retirement, which is higher among older workers [1,2], and the intention to quit the current
job, which is lower among older workers [3]. Education level also plays a role, as workers
with lower education are more likely to leave the labor force due to disability, unemploy-
ment, or early retirement [ 1,4], while workers with higher education are more likely to
change their current job [ 3,5]. Work-related factors, such as workload, working condi-
tions, work–life balance, and burnout, affect employees’ intention to leave their job [3,6,7].
Psychological and organizational factors, especially low job control, are associated with
disability retirement [8]. On the other hand, interventions such as adjusted job demands,
social support at work, coaching, and job training can reduce the rate of premature exit
from the labor market in workers with a chronic disease [1].

To keep and enhance their professional competence (knowledge and skills), workers
need to engage in continuing professional development. This also helps them advance
their careers, practice safely, provide better services to clients, and maintain consumer
trust [9–11]. Continuing professional development is more common among health care
workers [9], while its beneﬁts for other occupations are less explored. Health care workers
participate in continuing professional education and training to develop their careers, stay
updated, and improve the quality of patient care [7,12].
Continuing professional development covers various short courses, conferences, work-
shops, seminars, and other short training programs. It can have different impacts on
health professionals, such as increasing clinical knowledge; fostering networking and
collaboration; changing attitudes; enhancing skills, competence, and performance; and
inﬂuencing clinical practice [9,13]. By taking part in continuing education and training at
work, workers can improve and refresh their skills and learn new ones [ 14]. On-the-job
vocational training improved the mental health, sense of coherence, psychological stress,
dysfunctional attitudes, and smoking rate among health care workers [15]. Employees who
receive continuing job education or training report higher job satisfaction [16–19].
However, the effect of professional development and job education or training on
staying or leaving the current employment is unclear. The purpose of this systematic
review was to investigate how professional development and job education or training are
related to maintaining or exiting the current employment. We also examined whether the
relationship varies between younger and older workers.
2. Methods
2.1. Search Strategy
We followed the PRISMA guidelines [20] to design the review protocol. We searched
PubMed and Embase from their start dates to 2 January 2023 using a combination of MeSH
terms (PubMed), Emtree terms (Embase), and text words (Table 1). We also performed an
extra search in Google Scholar. We did not apply any ﬁlters on the participants’ age or
sex or on the publications’ language. We manually checked the references of the relevant
articles on this topic to ﬁnd more reports that might be useful.

2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, the ﬁrst author searched for reports
related to the topic and selected the ones that seemed relevant for further evaluation.
Then, two reviewers (R.S. and A.L.-M.) screened the abstracts and full texts of the selected
reports independently. The inclusion criteria were studies that investigated the effects of
education, training, or job development on work retention or exit from paid employment
using randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional, case control, and
cohort designs. The exclusion criteria were studies that focused on vocational rehabilitation,
employment services, and educational services for job seekers or people with a disability, as
these interventions aimed at changing jobs rather than enhancing skills for the current job.
Moreover, studies that used an organization as a unit of analysis and reported an employee
turnover rate at the organizational level were excluded. Additionally, qualitative studies
were not included in the review. The reviewers discussed any disagreements and reached
a consensus.
2.3. Quality Assessment
The quality of the studies included in this review was evaluated by two independent
reviewers (R.S. and A.L.-M.) using an adapted version of the Effective Public Health Practice
Project quality assessment tool [21]. This tool assessed five types of bias: selection bias,
performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and confounding (see Supplementary Table S1).
The reviewers discussed and resolved any disagreements about the quality ratings.

2.4. Data Synthesis
We extracted the following characteristics from the studies that met the inclusion
criteria for the review: study design, publication year, country of origin, study population
description, sample age and sex distribution, sample size, professional education or training
type, work participation or exit from paid employment, summary results, and confounding
factors adjustment. We performed a qualitative synthesis of the results of the included
studies because of the heterogeneity in professional training and outcome.
3. Results
A total of 3908 publications were retrieved from PubMed, and 3009 were retrieved
from Embase (Figure 1). The ﬁrst reviewer removed 579 duplicates and screened 6338 titles
and abstracts from PubMed, Embase, and the ﬁrst 1000 hits from Google Scholar (total:
7338). Google Scholar only allows screening the ﬁrst 1000 results. Then, two reviewers
assessed 145 abstracts or full-text articles for relevance. Out of those, 77 reports were
excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria, and 39 reports on vocational re-education
or rehabilitation among job seekers or people with a disability and two studies on employee
turnover rate were omitted from the review because they only reported the outcome at the
organizational level and not at the individual level. Finally, the review included 27 studies
consisting of four cohort studies and 23 cross-sectional studies. The participants of the
selected studies were diverse but mostly from the health sector. Out of the 27 studies, 22
involved health care workers as the target population, while 2 focused on faculty members
of health or medical sciences. The remaining three studies included people with a chronic
disease and bank staff as participants.
The studies were published in different time periods. Eight studies were published
between 2001 and 2010, eight were published between 2011 and 2015, and 11 were pub-
lished between 2016 and 2022. The studies were conducted in various countries. Aus-
tralia [16,22,23] and China [5,24,25] had three studies each. New Zealand [6,26], the United
Kingdom [7,12], and the United States [ 27,28] had two studies each. Canada [ 29], Den-
mark [30], Ethiopia [ 31], Finland [ 32], Ghana [ 33], Japan [ 34], Italy [ 35], Pakistan [ 36],
South Korea [37], Sweden [38], Taiwan [39], and the Netherlands [1] had one study each.
One study recruited participants from Singapore and the USA [40], one study recruited
participants from eight European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy,
Poland, Slovakia, and the Netherlands) [41], and another study was conducted in seven
sub-Saharan African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and
Zambia) [42]. The number of participants in the included studies varied from 81 to 88,948.
The effects of professional development or training on job retention or turnover
were assessed in three studies [27,28,30] using administrative data and 24 studies using
self-reported data (Table A1 and Table S2). The risk of selection bias was low in six
studies, moderate in 11 studies, and high in 10 studies (Supplementary Table S2). Eighteen
studies adjusted for some or all confounding factors. Attrition bias was low in all studies
except two.
3.1. Job Retention
Five studies investigated the relationship between professional development or train-
ing and staying at the current job or intending to do so. An eight-year cohort study [ 28]
reported that junior faculty members who participated in a development program were
11% more likely to remain at the same job than non-participants (67% vs. 56%, p = 0.04).
Additionally, cross-sectional studies showed that professional development opportunities
were linked to a higher intention to stay at the current job [ 16,22,29,42]. Professional de-
velopment or a training opportunity was the main motivator for staying at a current job,
and 80% of laboratory professionals from seven sub-Saharan African countries rated it as
the most important or a very important factor for job retention [42]. Younger employees
valued continuing professional development more than older employees for staying at the
current job [22].

3.2. Leaving a Job
Four studies examined the association between professional development or training
and leaving a job or the workforce, and 10 studies examined the intention to leave a job
(Table A1). A large cohort study [27] found that women who attended 4-day early- and
mid-career faculty professional development programs were less likely to leave their job
than women who did not attend the programs. The programs had a positive effect on
women’s job retention, as those who participated more than once were less likely to quit
than those who only joined once. A similar ﬁnding was reported in a cohort study [12] in
which employees who left their ﬁrst job within six months cited a lack of study days (40%)
and other courses (43%) as important factors in their decision. A cross-sectional study
found that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received additional job training after
their diagnosis were less likely to leave the workforce than those who did not (adjusted OR
0.5, 95% CI 0.4–0.8) [1]. Dissatisfaction with development opportunities was also a major
reason for nurses to leave their job in 51.4% of those who had left their institution [41].
Furthermore, a lack of professional development opportunities [31–33] and low per-
ceived investment in employee development [39,40] increased the intention to leave a job.
Some of the factors that inﬂuenced this intention were a lack of access to professional
development [23,38], a lack of study opportunities [23], and a lack of access to courses other
than study days [12] and/or study days [12]. A lack of professional opportunities ranked
<<<PAGE=6>>>
Healthcare 2023, 11, 2900 6 of 17
second after a low salary as a reason for leaving nursing care, and this was consistent
between nurses aged < 45 years and those aged ≥ 45 years [38]. However, a cross-sectional
study showed that a lack of career advancement and mandatory continuing professional
development did not affect the intention to leave the dental nursing profession [7]. Another
study also found no direct or indirect association between professional development and
intention to leave an organization or profession through burnout and work engagement [6].
The relationship between the perceived investment in employee development and em-
ployee intention to a leave job was mediated by different factors in two studies [39,40]. Job
satisfaction and affective commitment fully explained the relationship between perceived
investment in employee development and the intention to leave a job for nurses [40]. For
health care professionals in underserviced areas with a government subsidy program, the
relationship between perceived investment in employee development and the intention to
leave a job was fully explained by employee professional and organizational commitment,
while for those without a government subsidy program, there were both direct and indi-
rect effects of perceived investment in employee development on the intention to a leave
job [39].
3.3. Turnover Intention
As shown in Table A1, six studies examined the relationship between turnover inten-
tion and professional development. Employees who had domestic training or overseas
study outside of work had a turnover intention of 46%, while those who did not have any
domestic training or overseas study had a turnover intention of 68% [25]. Several factors
related to professional development, such as limited opportunities [ 24,35], inadequate
continuing education [5], dissatisfaction with professional development [37], and low per-
ceived investment in employee development [36] were associated with increased turnover
intention. The effect of professional development opportunities on turnover intention
differed by gender and profession [5,24]. A higher intention to leave the job was linked
to inadequate professional development opportunities for men but not for women [ 24].
Similarly, doctors who had enough opportunities for continuing professional education
had a lower intention to leave, but this was not the case for nurses [5].
Continuing professional education did not affect turnover intention for rural healthcare
workers [5]. Moreover, the effect of satisfaction with professional development on turnover
intention varied according to length of employment for nurses [ 37]. Satisfaction with
professional development reduced turnover intention for nurses who had been employed
for 13 to 18 months but not for those who had been employed for less than 12 months [37].
Training to improve skills or competences reduced turnover intention for nurses who had
been employed for less than 6 months, while opportunities for professional development
reduced turnover intention for nurses who had been employed for 7 to 24 months [ 35].
One study investigated the mechanisms underlying the link between perceived investment
in employee development and turnover intention [36]. It found that job satisfaction and
affective commitment fully mediated this link [36].
3.4. Return to Work, Job Change, Early Retirement, and Employment
Five studies were reviewed on different aspects of career transitions among workers
(Table A1). A Danish study examined the effect of wage-subsidized job training on the
duration of return to work and subsequent employment among sick-listed workers. The
study found that the intervention shortened the time to return to non-subsidized work by
three weeks but did not affect the stability of the subsequent employment [30]. Another
study surveyed psychiatrists who moved or did not move to another area; it reported
that professional support and development was a key factor in their decision to move to
another area for 44% and 47% of them, respectively [26]. A third study investigated the
motives for changing a job in the past ﬁve years among laboratory professionals from
seven sub-Saharan African countries and revealed that the main reasons were lack of
professional development or training (27.8%), lack of beneﬁts (23.5%), relocation (22.6%),
<<<PAGE=7>>>
Healthcare 2023, 11, 2900 7 of 17
and poor working conditions (13.0%) [42]. A fourth study that analyzed the rate of early
retirement among employees with different levels of domestic off-the-job training and/or
overseas study showed that it was lower for those with some training or study (44%) than
for those with none (63%) [ 25]. Lastly, the only study that investigated the relationship
between professional development and employment status reported that participants who
underwent training to enhance their professional skills had a higher probability of being
employed than unemployed [34].
4. Discussion
The main ﬁnding of this systematic review is that there is a positive relationship
between professional development or training and work participation. Employees who
engage in skill development or training are more likely to stay in their current job than
those who do not. However, the quality of the evidence is low, as 85% of the studies
used a cross-sectional design, and more than a quarter of the studies did not adjust for
confounding factors.
A review of the literature revealed that older nurses (over 45 years) have less access to
continuing professional learning and development [43]. Only two cross-sectional studies
examined the effect of age on the link between professional skill development and work
participation [22,38]. One study found that continuing professional development was more
important for retaining younger health professionals (mean age: 35.6 years) than older
health professionals (mean age: 40.2 years) working with people with a disability in rural
areas [22]. For younger health professionals, professional support, continuing professional
development, and a high autonomy of practice were the main factors for staying in their
current job, while for older health professionals, travel arrangements and a high autonomy
of practice were the main factors. The other study reported that a lack of opportunities
for professional development was a reason for leaving nursing care among both nurses
younger than 45 years and those aged 45 years or older [ 38]. However, nurses younger
than 45 years were more likely to leave nursing care due to the nursing workload and a
low salary than older nurses aged ≥ 45 years [38]. Additionally, a qualitative study of
84 nurses over 50 years [44] that was not included in this review suggested that part-time
work, ﬂexible working hours, and continuing professional development could increase
work participation. The relationship between continuing professional education and work
retention among older workers has not been well studied. Future research using quasi-
experimental and prospective cohort designs could help to determine if ongoing job training
lowers the risk of leaving the workforce among ageing workers.
There is limited evidence on the mechanisms that explain how continuing professional
education/training inﬂuences staying in a current job. Professional training is linked to
higher organizational commitment [45]. Job satisfaction and affective commitment [ 40]
or professional and organizational commitment [ 39] fully mediate the relationship be-
tween perceived investment in employee development and intention to quit a current
job. Moreover, the association between perceived investment in employee development
and employee turnover intention was fully mediated by job satisfaction and affective
commitment [36]. However, one study did not ﬁnd any indirect relationship between
professional development and the intention to leave a profession through reducing burnout
or increasing work engagement [6]. In addition to commitment and job satisfaction, con-
tinuing professional education enhances employees’ knowledge, skills, conﬁdence, sense
of coherence, work performance, and mental health, and it leads to changes in attitude,
behavior, and practice [9,13]. These positive outcomes of continuing professional education
can increase employee retention (Figure 2). Continuing professional education is related
to higher career development and job satisfaction among workers [16–19,42], and to less
work–family conﬂict, family complaints, and guilt regarding family [25]. Job satisfaction
promotes employee retention [3,16], and job dissatisfaction is a common reason for quitting
a job [23] or planning to retire early [46]. Mid-career physicians (41–60 years old) reported
a lack of professional satisfaction as a more important factor inﬂuencing their retirement
<<<PAGE=8>>>
Healthcare 2023, 11, 2900 8 of 17
intention than physicians older than 60 years [ 46]. Previous studies have shown mixed
results on the relationship between continuing professional training and work engagement.
One study reported that workers who received professional training were more engaged in
their work than workers without training [25], while another study found no link between
continuing professional development and work engagement [6].
Figure 2. A conceptual diagram showing the potential mediators of the association between continu-
ing professional development or training and maintaining current employment.
This review indicates that participating in professional training is linked to a lower
risk of leaving current employment. However, continuing professional development
opportunities are scarce, especially in remote and rural areas [5,7,26]. A major obstacle to
accessing continuing professional development is a lack of ﬁnancial support [14,47], and
some workers have to pay for their own professional training [7]. Moreover, organizations
reduce their budgets for professional learning and development during economic crises [48];
for example, the satisfaction rate with access to continuing professional development among
rural Australian health care workers declined from 70% in 2005 to 35% in 2008 [49].
The current review has some limitations. Out of the 27 studies that explored this topic,
most of them had a cross-sectional design (23 studies) and a small sample size. Only four
studies had a cohort design, and a third of the studies did not adjust the observed associ-
ations for any confounding factor. In addition, few studies investigated the mechanisms
and factors that inﬂuenced the effect of professional development/training on staying in a
current job or in the labor market.
Future research should adopt more rigorous methods, such as quasi-experimental and
longitudinal designs, to evaluate the impact of different types of training on the likelihood of
exiting the labor force, especially among older workers. Future research should also identify
which aspects of professional development and training are more effective or relevant for
job retention than others (e.g., pedagogical aspects and personalization). Furthermore, in
future research, it would be useful to differentiate between employees who leave their
current job for a better one (qualitative employability) and those who leave for any other
reason (quantitative employability) [50].

5. Conclusions
This review indicates that engaging in continuing professional training or development
may help workers to retain their current employment. However, more high-quality studies,
especially among older workers, are needed to examine the role of continuing job training
in preventing labor-force exit.

In the total sample, there was an inverse
correlation between satisfaction with
professional development and turnover
intention (correlation: −0.198, p < 0.001).
Among nurses with 0 to 6 months of

professional development did not differ
between nurses with low and high
turnover intention (mean: 2.82 vs. 2.81,
p = 0.83) in an unadjusted analysis.
However, after adjustment for other
factors, the adjusted regression coefﬁcient
was positive (β = 0.47, p = 0.002),
showing a positive association between
satisfaction with professional
