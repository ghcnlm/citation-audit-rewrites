ABSTRACT  
This study systematically reviews capacity building projects and programs within the field of 
international development cooperation, with the aim of identifying key facilitators and barriers 
across different levels of implementation. While capacity building is increasingly recognized as a 
central mechanism for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), existing frameworks 
remain fragmented and conceptually inconsistent. To address this gap, the article proposes a level- 
based analytical framework that disaggregates capacity development into individual, organizational, 
and systemic components and conducts a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature. Guided by 
the PRISMA methodology, this study integrates qualitative synthesis with quantitative text mining 
and word cloud analysis to uncover thematic patterns and frequently cited success factors. Key 
success factors include local ownership, partnerships, and context-sensitive training. Conversely, 
barriers such as misalignment, institutional instability, and resource constraints are shown to 
significantly hinder capacity outcomes. This study contributes both theoretically by clarifying the 
operational components of capacity building and practically by offering a diagnostic tool for project 
design and evaluation. It provides development practitioners and policymakers with actionable 
insights to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of capacity building interventions.

Introduction
Globalization has enhanced international development 
cooperation by fostering collaboration among diverse 
international actors to tackle complex and multifaceted 
global challenges. Over time, the international discourse 
on development aid has evolved to emphasize policy 
coherence, aid effectiveness, and sustainability (Naylor 
2011 ; Samy and Aksil 2015 ; Vallejo and Wehn 2016 ). 
Since the United Nations (UN) adopted the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) for 2016–2030, capacity 
development has been recognized as a central pillar of 
development cooperation (Vallejo and Wehn 2016 ). Its 
scope ranges from human resource development to 
broader organizational and institutional strengthening 
(UNESCO 2010 ).
Since the 1990s, capacity building has gained promi -
nence in development discourse, with scholars increas -
ingly focusing on its evaluation, methodology, and 
conceptual framework (Kacou, Ika, and Munro 2022 ). 
Given its multidimensional nature, the concept has 
been defined in diverse ways by both scholars and prac -
titioners, resulting in a lack of consensus on a clear and 
universally accepted definition (Merino and Carmenado 
2012 ; Sanz et al. 2013 ). While the term is not used con -
sistently across the development literature, the UN 
describes capacity development as ‘the process of devel -
oping and strengthening the skills, instincts, abilities, 
processes, and resources that organizations and com -
munities need to survive, adapt, and thrive in a fast- 
changing world’ (UN 2025 ). This conceptual framing is 
essential, as capacity building is closely linked to the 
development project cycle, which includes program -
ming, identification, implementation, and monitoring 
and evaluation. As such, a clear understanding of 
capacity development can provide essential guidance 
throughout all stages of project design and evaluation 
(Porzecanski et al. 2022 ).
As the scope of capacity building expanded during the 
1990s, specific strands such as Community Capacity Build -
ing (CCB) began to receive growing attention in both aca -
demic and policy discourse (Craig 2007 ). Unlike 
approaches that focus primarily on enhancing individual 
knowledge and technical skills, CCB emphasizes empow -
ering communities to define collective goals, mobilize

local assets, and sustain long-term social change. It is 
understood as both a process and an outcome: fostering 
community agency while also improving social, econ -
omic, and institutional conditions. However, the concept 
remains contested, with definitions varying significantly 
across sectors and regions. These variations reflect 
differing ideological orientations, development para -
digms, and implementation contexts. Such definitional 
ambiguity has created theoretical and practical tensions 
– especially when translating CCB into development 
cooperation projects where goals, stakeholders, and 
modes of engagement may diverge substantially. A 
nuanced understanding of how CCB is conceptualized 
and operationalized is therefore essential for assessing 
its role and effectiveness within the broader framework 
of capacity development.
Capacity building initiatives span a wide spectrum – 
from individual to societal levels – and are frequently 
analyzed using a level-based framework comprising 
individual, institutional, and systemic dimensions (An, 
Garvin, and Hall 2017 ; Merino and Carmenado 2012 ; 
OECD 2019 ). However, few studies have systematically 
examined how capacity building is operationalized 
within development cooperation projects. This gap is 
significant, as the lack of conceptual clarity – driven by 
diverse definitions and fragmented frameworks – com -
plicates the evaluation of project effectiveness. In prac -
tice, capacity building efforts often cut across multiple 
levels, making it difficult to distinguish discrete elements 
or apply standardized evaluation criteria (Kühl 2009 ; 
Vallejo and Wehn 2016 ). Combined with the complex 
and multifaceted nature of development projects, 
these conceptual ambiguities can obscure what consti -
tutes success or failure. As evaluation mechanisms in 
international development become increasingly rigor -
ous and outcome-oriented (OECD 2023 ), the need for 
clearer conceptual and analytical standards has 
become more pressing. This study responds to that 
need by conducting a systematic review that identifies 
key success factors and barriers, thereby contributing 
to the development of more coherent and actionable 
frameworks for capacity building within international 
development.
Building on the literature review, this study identifies 
two dominant strands in the conceptualization of 
capacity development frameworks. The first strand 
emphasizes single-level approaches, which examine 
capacity at the individual, organizational, or systemic 
level in isolation (Hall 2017 ; Kabeer 2005 ; Rao 2017 ; 
Shah 2016 ). In contrast, the second strand highlights 
more integrated, multi-level approaches that under -
stand capacity development as an interconnected and 
dynamic process (Kühl 2009 ; Vallejo and Wehn 2016 ). 
The diversity of implementation levels across develop -
ment projects and programs has contributed to substan -
tial variation in how capacity development is defined 
and operationalized. Given its multidimensional charac -
ter, distinct approaches have emerged at each level – 
individual, institutional, and systemic. However, clear 
analytical boundaries or standardized criteria for asses -
sing capacity building in international development 
remain largely underdeveloped.
To address existing gaps, this study proposes an 
analytical framework that delineates key components 
of capacity development across the individual, organiz -
ational, and systemic levels. The framework is intended 
to support project design and evaluation by enabling 
practitioners to prioritize level-specific success factors 
and anticipate potential challenges. While many devel -
opment projects tend to focus on a single level, this 
framework facilitates more targeted planning and pro -
vides clearer evaluation criteria. The success factors 
and barriers identified through this study also offer prac -
tical guidance for aligning project implementation with 
the expectations of donors and partners. Although the 
framework may not be universally applicable, it contrib -
utes to more coherent and effective capacity building 
across diverse development settings.
To explore how capacity building is operationalized 
and how it evolves within development projects and 
programs, this study conducts a systematic review com -
bined with text-mining analysis of peer-reviewed litera -
ture on capacity development. This approach allows 
the study to identify key enabling factors and barriers 
across various levels of intervention. Accordingly, the 
article addresses the following research questions – (i) 
How do capacity building projects function differently 
at the individual, organizational, and systemic levels?; 
(ii) How is capacity building conceptualized and 
framed by donors?; and (iii) What are the key facilitators 
and barriers to effective capacity building in 
international development projects?
To address these questions, the article is structured as 
follows. Section 2 reviews the global literature on 
capacity development. Section 3 outlines the research 
methodology employed in the study. Section 4 presents 
the findings and offers a critical discussion in relation to 
the existing literature. Finally, Section 5 concludes by 
highlighting the study’s contributions to academic dis -
course and its practical implications for international 
development cooperation.
Literature Review
The concept of capacity building began to gain traction 
in the context of international development cooperation

as early as the 1970s, although development projects 
were already evolving by that time (Merino and Carme -
nado 2012 , 960). In the 1980s and 1990s, capacity build -
ing initiatives primarily targeted the macro level, with a 
strong emphasis on long-term training and institution- 
building (Merino and Carmenado 2012 , 960). Its signifi -
cance was reaffirmed in the 2000s and 2010s, as the 
international community increasingly sought to 
improve aid effectiveness by embedding capacity devel -
opment into the core objectives of development assist -
ance. Notably, the Paris Declaration in 2005 and the 
Accra Agenda for Action in 2008 positioned capacity 
building as a central pillar in efforts to enhance develop -
ment outcomes.
Scholars and practitioners have defined capacity 
building in diverse ways, reflecting its inherently multidi -
mensional character (Merino and Carmenado 2012 , 962). 
Capacity development initiatives range from the individ -
ual level to the societal level, encompassing activities 
such as knowledge transfer, institutional reform, and 
systems transformation. As such, the objectives of 
capacity development go beyond human resource 
development to include broader organizational and 
institutional strengthening (UNESCO 2010 ). Given the 
wide variation in implementation levels and intervention 
types, the concept often lacks a clear and universally 
agreed-upon definition (Merino and Carmenado 2012 , 
966; Sanz et al. 2013 ).
Among the various frameworks for understanding 
capacity development, one strand of literature focuses 
on a single level, while another examines the inter -
relationships across multiple levels (Hall 2017 ; Kabeer 
2005 ; Rao 2017 ; Shah 2016 ). Eger, Miller, and Scarles 
( 2018 ) aligned with the latter perspective, proposing a 
model of capacity development structured around 
three interconnected levels: individual, relational, and 
collective. This approach highlights the influence of 
social and cultural relationships in shaping individual 
capacities. However, such interrelational models may 
be less applicable in the context of 
international development cooperation projects, where 
donors and implementing agencies tend to design and 
evaluate interventions according to discrete levels such 
as individual, institutional, or systemic rather 
than across overlapping levels.
Another strand of the literature highlights inter -
related approaches to capacity development at the 
organizational, institutional, systemic, and participatory 
levels (Kühl 2009 ; Vallejo and Wehn 2016 ). The organiz -
ational approach focuses on enhancing internal capacity 
within organizations, while the institutional approach 
seeks to strengthen local institutions and governance 
structures. System-level approaches adopt a more 
holistic and multidimensional perspective, integrating 
both organizational and institutional elements. The par -
ticipatory approach – people-centered and often over -
lapping with other levels, is increasingly framed as an 
interconnected model. However, these frameworks 
often lack clearly defined boundaries, making their prac -
tical application challenging. In response to this ambigu -
ity, alternative approaches such as managerial and 
structural frameworks have emerged (Collier 2007 ; Ika 
and Donnelly 2017 ). The managerial approach empha -
sizes leadership, entrepreneurship, and a broad skill 
set, including knowledge management and innovation. 
In contrast, institutional frameworks focus on structural 
components such as behavioral norms, partnerships, 
and communication systems (An, Garvin, and Hall 
2017 , 394). Structural approaches go even further, 
encompassing policies, legal frameworks, social norms, 
and governance mechanisms (An, Garvin, and Hall 
2017 , 394; Merino and Carmenado 2012 , 966). Given 
this diversity in definitions and conceptual orientations, 
there is a growing need for more clearly articulated stan -
dards to systematically evaluate capacity development 
projects.
The discourse on the evaluation of development aid 
projects has evolved in tandem with the rise of results- 
based management, the adoption of various standards, 
and the diversification of evaluation methodologies 
aimed at assessing project success. Among these, the 
OECD DAC evaluation criteria – relevance, efficiency, 
effectiveness, impact, and sustainability – remain the 
most widely applied by donors and international 
agencies. However, debates continue over how to inter -
pret each criterion and define project success. Critics 
argue that the OECD DAC framework reflects a donor- 
centric perspective and tends to overlook qualitative 
and contextual dimensions of development (Eggers 
2009 ; Kotvojs and Hurworth 2013 ). In contrast, others 
contend that the framework has significantly enhanced 
evaluation practices by introducing a common and 
transparent standard (Longest, Hitlin, and Vaisey 2013 ; 
Schwartz et al. 2012 ). Despite ongoing critiques, the 
OECD DAC criteria continue to serve as a widely 
accepted and robust reference point for evaluating 
development aid initiatives.
Analytical framework
This study adopts a three-level analytical framework – 
individual, organizational, and systemic – as a foun -
dation for addressing inconsistencies in how capacity 
building is defined in the existing literature. To 
enhance conceptual clarity, each level is defined 
through specific components, as illustrated in Figure 1 .

<<<PAGE=5>>>
The individual level encompasses leadership, entrepre -
neurship, and technical skills including knowledge and 
serves to assess the capacities of project recipients and 
key stakeholders (An, Garvin, and Hall 2017 ; Merino 
and Carmenado 2012 ). The organizational level focuses 
on behavioral norms, partnerships, and communication 
mechanisms that shape interactions within and 
between implementing agencies and beneficiary 
groups (An, Garvin, and Hall 2017 ). The systemic level 
captures broader sociocultural and governance dimen -
sions such as policies, legal frameworks, and social 
norms (An, Garvin, and Hall 2017 ; Merino and Carme -
nado 2012 ). This tiered framework enables a structured 
and comprehensive analysis of capacity development 
across distinct but interrelated levels.
Research Methodology
This study conducted a systematic review of peer- 
reviewed literature to identify key factors influencing 
capacity development projects. The review followed 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, ensuring trans -
parency and improved reporting standards. To 
complement the systematic review, the authors also 
employed text mining techniques on qualitative data 
to examine keyword frequency and uncover recurring 
themes across the selected studies.
Search strategy for identification of studies
A comprehensive electronic search was conducted 
across four academic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web 
of Science, and EBSCOhost. The search focused on 
capacity building within the field of 
international development cooperation. The following 
keyword combination was applied across all databases: 
‘[capacity building] AND [capacity development] AND 
[(development cooperation) OR (official development 
assistance)]’. The search was limited to articles published 
between 1970 and 2022 to capture the historical evol -
ution of the concept and its growing prominence, par -
ticularly since the 2010s.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Eligibility criteria were established based on the research 
objectives to guide the selection of relevant and high- 
Figure 1. Analytical framework (Source: An, Garvin, and Hall ( 2017 ); Merino and Carmenado ( 2012 ); OECD ( 2019 ))

quality studies. Articles were included if they were orig -
inal, peer-reviewed journal publications in English 
between 1970 and 2022, and explicitly addressed the 
concept or practice of capacity building within the 
context of international development cooperation. This 
included a wide range of development modalities, 
such as bilateral and multilateral aid programs, NGO- 
led initiatives, and Official Development Assistance 
(ODA) projects. In line with the empirical orientation of 
the research questions, the authors limited inclusion to 
studies that presented primary data or conducted 
applied analysis relevant to capacity development 
frameworks, outcomes, or implementation strategies. 
Exclusion criteria included non-peer-reviewed publi -
cations such as books, editorials, reports, dissertations, 
conference proceedings, and other grey literature. The 
authors also excluded studies that addressed capacity 
building within unrelated domains such as corporate 
training or domestic education policy without reference 
to development cooperation. Additionally, studies 
lacking empirical grounding or failing to elaborate on 
the conceptual or operational dimensions of capacity 
building were deemed ineligible.
Studies selection
The study selection process is summarized in Figure 2 , 
which outlines the stages of data collection, screening, 
and inclusion in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. 
An initial total of 5,919 records was retrieved from four 
major databases based on a predefined search strategy 
aligned with the research questions. These records 
were first imported into EndNote for automatic dupli -
cate removal, resulting in the exclusion of 816 articles. 
Subsequently, non-English articles (n = 176) and publi -
cations not meeting the eligibility criteria (n = 1,260) 
were also removed.
Two authors (HK, YB) independently screened the 
initial 3,667 records by reviewing titles to assess their rel -
evance to capacity building within the context of devel -
opment cooperation. The abstracts of the 187 records 
that passed the initial screening were then indepen -
dently assessed by the same two authors. To ensure 
the inclusion of relevant but potentially overlooked 
studies, two authors also employed a snowballing 
method, identifying 46 additional articles through refer -
ence lists of the selected studies. This process resulted in 
a total of 233 full-text articles selected for detailed 
assessment.
During the full-text screening process, 206 articles 
were excluded for not aligning with the scope of the 
study – for example, lacking a substantive focus on 
capacity development or failing to address development 
cooperation. An additional three articles were removed 
due to the absence of primary data. Throughout the 
selection process, any disagreements between the two 
authors regarding inclusion or exclusion were resolved 
through discussion. When consensus could not be 
reached, a third senior researcher was consulted to 
mediate the decision. This multi-step review and resol -
ution process ensured transparency and enhanced the 
methodological rigor of the study.
Data extraction and analysis
For data extraction, the authors developed a structured 
Excel spreadsheet, with each row representing an 
included study and each column captured key descrip -
tive information such as research objectives, target 
population, geographic focus, study design, and the 
level of capacity development addressed (individual, 
organizational, or systemic). Initial data extraction was 
carried out by HK and subsequently cross-checked by 
YB to ensure consistency and accuracy. The analytical 
focus centered on identifying key factors related to 
capacity building and classifying enabling conditions 
and barriers across the selected studies. Although 
double coding and inter-reviewer validation were 
applied, a degree of subjectivity may persist due to the 
interpretive nature of qualitative screening and thematic 
classification. To address these limitations, the authors 
applied transparent eligibility criteria, resolved discre -
pancies through consensus and third-party consultation, 
and clearly documented each stage of the review 
process in alignment with PRISMA guidelines.
Text mining and word cloud analysis
In addition to the systematic review, the authors con -
ducted a text mining analysis of qualitative data 
extracted from the full-text articles using the R 
program. This analysis involved examining keyword fre -
quency across the included studies and visualizing the 
results through word clouds to identify prominent 
terms and thematic patterns. The text mining approach 
facilitated the detection of recurring concepts and 
trends in how capacity building is framed and operatio -
nalized within international development cooperation 
projects, thereby complementing the qualitative syn -
thesis of the review.
Results
This section synthesizes the collective insights from the 
27 peer-reviewed articles identified through the three- 
stage screening process (see Figure 2 ). The aim is to

uncover recurring patterns and underlying tensions in 
the literature and to relate these thematically to the 
analytical framework developed earlier. The findings 
indicate that while many projects concentrate on 
capacity building at a single level – most often the indi -
vidual or organizational level – there is growing recog -
nition of the interdependencies across levels. This 
tension between conceptualizing capacity building as 
a set of discrete components and as an integrated, rela -
tional process emerges as a central theme throughout 
the studies. By clearly identifying key elements associ -
ated with each level, the analysis offers a practical foun -
dation for more systematic and targeted design, 
implementation, and evaluation of capacity develop -
ment interventions. Although the relevance of success 
factors and barriers may vary depending on project

type and context, the results provide valuable guidance 
for both planning and evaluation. Anticipating facilita -
tors and obstacles at each level can enhance project 
alignment with stakeholder needs, improve design 
coherence, and support the development of more 
robust evaluation criteria.
Description and characteristics of the included 
studies
The 27 studies included in this review examined capacity 
building in the context of development cooperation 
across a variety of countries, with a predominant focus 
on low-income settings in Africa and Asia. Spanning 
publications from 1970 to 2022, they reflect both the 
evolution of capacity building discourse over time and 
its practical relevance across diverse regional and sec -
toral contexts. As summarized in Table 1 , the selected 
studies differ in research focus, geographic coverage, 
and methodological design.
A clear thematic concentration emerged around the 
health sector, with a substantial number of studies 
focusing on areas such as health workforce develop -
ment, health systems strengthening, hospital partner -
ships, and disease-specific issues including maternal 
and newborn health and HIV/AIDS. The predominance 
of health-related projects can be attributed to several 
factors. First, the health sector has historically been a 
primary focus of ODA, particularly in low- and 
middle-income countries where donor interventions 
have targeted urgent and measurable needs. Second, 
capacity building in health systems is often directly 
linked to service delivery outcomes, making it a com -
pelling focus for empirical analysis and donor invest -
ment. In addition, health systems offer relatively 
structured entry points for capacity development – 
such as workforce training, institutional accreditation, 
and public health governance – that align with both 
donor accountability requirements and local develop -
ment priorities.
The majority of studies employed qualitative 
approaches, which aligns with the nature of capacity 
development as an intangible, context-specific, and rela -
tional process – particularly when focused on human 
resources. These dimensions are often better captured 
through qualitative inquiry. Notably, many of the 
included studies assessed capacity not only at the indi -
vidual level such as skills development and leadership, 
but also at the organizational and systemic levels, 
including institutional norms, governance structures, 
and legal frameworks. While some studies focused on 
a single level, a significant number of studies engaged 
with multiple levels simultaneously, underscoring the 
interconnected nature of capacity building and the 
need for more integrated approaches.
Text mining results of the included studies
To complement the qualitative synthesis, a text mining 
analysis was conducted using unigram and bigram 
word clouds to identify frequently occurring terms 
across the 27 included articles. As shown in Figure 3 , 
these visualizations reveal dominant themes and linguis -
tic patterns in the discourse surrounding capacity build -
ing in international development cooperation. 
Reflecting the previously noted sectoral concentration, 
health emerged as the most frequently used term, fol -
lowed by capacity, development, training, community, 
and partnership. These terms indicate a strong emphasis 
on individual-level capacity development within commu -
nity-based health initiatives, supported by training and 
collaborative mechanisms. In the bigram word cloud, 
phrases such as human resources, capacity strengthening, 
and low-income countries appeared predominantly, rein -
forcing the geographic and thematic focus of the studies. 
The frequent recurrence of terms like HRH program (refer -
ring to Human Resources for Health) further underscores 
the centrality of workforce development in health sector 
capacity building strategies.
Barriers and facilitators of capacity building
The systematic review confirms that capacity building is 
widely recognized as a core component of development 
cooperation, regardless of whether interventions target 
the individual, organizational, or systemic level. Across 
the included studies, a range of facilitating factors 
were identified that contributed to enhanced project 
sustainability and the strengthening of individual com -
petencies. At the same time, several studies highlighted 
critical barriers that undermined the effectiveness of 
capacity building efforts, often canceling out their 
intended benefits.
Barriers: structural, contextual, and operational 
constraints
Three interrelated categories of barriers emerged from 
the review. The first is a lack of alignment with local 
systems and contexts, which was consistently cited 
across multiple studies. For instance, Neuhann and 
Barteit ( 2017 ) observed that while international partner -
ships acted as valuable facilitators within relevant depart -
ments, the absence of a self-sustaining institutional 
system and insufficient attention to national contexts 
weakened long-term outcomes. Similarly, Fass ( 1984 ) 
argued that donor countries’ limited understanding of

recipient contexts often led to misaligned project goals, 
thereby undermining implementation efforts.
Second, unstable implementation environments pre -
sented significant challenges. Bausch et al. ( 2018 ) 
emphasized that resource-limited settings – particularly 
those affected by health emergencies – often experi -
enced supply shortages and logistical constraints, even 
when community engagement and program design 
were strong. Such structural limitations undermined 
otherwise well-designed capacity development 
interventions.
Third, the introduction of innovative or unfamiliar 
approaches did not always produce positive results. 
Tumwine et al. ( 2022 ) found that while partner support 
and media engagement generally facilitated organiz -
ational capacity, the adoption of new frameworks – 
such as those related to Sexual and Reproductive 
Health and Rights (SRHR) – occasionally had the oppo -
site effect. Survey data revealed a decline in organiz -
ational effectiveness, suggesting that innovation 
without sufficient contextual sensitivity may act as a 
confounding factor (Tumwine et al. 2022 , 9).
Facilitators: enabling environments and relational 
dynamics
The systematic review also identified a wide range of 
facilitators that positively contributed to capacity devel -
opment across all levels. Several studies emphasized the 
role of favorable institutional and political environments. 
Political stability, government ownership, and policy 
coherence were consistently cited as critical factors for 
long-term capacity development (Audenhove 1998 ; 
Corkery, Land, and Bossuyt 1998 ; Moore 1995 ; Ofstad 
1999 ). Cancedda et al. ( 2015 ; 2018 ) further highlighted 
that strong communication, comprehensive planning, 
and adequate resource availability supported effective 
implementation. In addition, flexible funding 
mechanisms enabled projects to adapt to evolving 
local needs.
Partnerships emerged as one of the most frequently 
cited and influential enablers of capacity development. 
Whether through bilateral commitments (Kanal et al. 
2020 ; Raguin 2016 ), mentoring relationships (Nurse 
and Wight 2011 ), or multi-organizational training collab -
orations (Ramos and Ferreira-Pinto 2002 ; Stover et al. 
2014 ), such partnerships were found to facilitate not 
only knowledge transfer but also long-term cooperation 
and trust-building among actors involved in capacity 
building efforts.
At the individual level, studies identified personal 
motivation, tailored support, and targeted skills devel -
opment as key drivers of capacity enhancement (Diele -
man, Gerretsen, and Wilt 2009 ; Laverack and 
Thangphet 2009 ; West, Dawson, and Homer 2017 ). 
West, Dawson, and Homer ( 2017 ) emphasized that 
acknowledging individual characteristics – such as 
prior capabilities and intrinsic motivation – can signifi -
cantly shape learning outcomes, particularly in pro -
fessional education settings like midwifery. Similarly, 
Laverack and Thangphet ( 2009 ) found that improved 
knowledge and competencies within communities con -
tributed to capacity gains. Building on this, Dieleman, 
Gerretsen, and Wilt ( 2009 ) argued that continuous edu -
cation and role-specific training enhance not only 
Figure 3. Word clouds for keyword frequency and text mining

<<<PAGE=12>>>
knowledge acquisition but also task performance, 
thereby strengthening individual-level outcomes. 
Taken together, these findings highlight that capacity 
development at the individual level is most effective 
when it is context-sensitive, personalized, and sustained 
over time.
Key success factors of capacity building in 
development projects
The authors identified recurring patterns across the 27 
included studies in this review. Table 2 presents a syn -
thesis of key success factors, organized by the level of 
intervention – individual, organizational, and systemic. 
This level-based classification addresses the ambiguity 
found in earlier literature, where inconsistent or vague 
definitions have often hindered meaningful comparison 
of capacity building efforts across diverse contexts.
At the organizational level, several studies empha -
sized the value of community-based approaches and 
locally grounded implementation strategies (Adom, 
Nyadu-Addo, and Kquofi 2021 ; Amde et al. 2019 ; Can -
cedda et al. 2018 ; Corkery, Land, and Bossuyt 1998 ; 
Moore 1995 ; Ramos and Ferreira-Pinto 2002 ; Stover 
et al. 2014 ). Providing employable skills to community 
members and incentivising their participation generated 
spillover effects, extending the impact of capacity build -
ing beyond the initial target group (Adom, Nyadu-Addo, 
and Kquofi 2021 ; Amde et al. 2019 ; Moore 1995 ; Stover 
et al. 2014 ). In addition, strong organizational ownership, 
sustained partnerships, and resource availability 
emerged as critical enablers of effective implementation 
(Cancedda et al. 2018 ; Corkery, Land, and Bossuyt 1998 ; 
Ofstad 1999 ; Ramos and Ferreira-Pinto 2002 ; Tumwine 
et al. 2022 ).
At the systemic level, Potter and Brough ( 2004 ) 
demonstrated that a systematic diagnostic approach – 
focused on identifying and addressing sectoral gaps – 
led to more efficient resource allocation. Other studies 
similarly emphasized that alignment with national priori -
ties, supportive policy environments, and inter-organiz -
ational coordination were critical for enhancing 
system-wide capacity (Cancedda et al. 2015 ; Hartvigson 
and Heshmati 2022 ; Laverack and Thangphet 2009 ; Mar -
condes and Bruyn 2015 ; Raguin 2016 ; West, Dawson, and 
Homer 2017 ). Several projects operated across multiple 
levels, integrating interventions at the individual, organ -
izational, and systemic levels. These multi-level 
approaches often produced more sustained outcomes. 
Recurring success factors included recipient country 
ownership, context-specific design, and mutual trust 
between donors and local stakeholders (Grindle and Hil -
derbrand 1995 ; Jones and Blunt 1998 ; Kanal et al. 2020 ; 
Nurse and Wight 2011 ). In the health sector, interven -
tions that prioritized local participation and provided tai -
lored support for health managers, which proved 
especially effective in fostering long-term capacity 
(Broucke et al. 2010 ; Dieleman, Gerretsen, and Wilt 
2009 ).
Taken together, these findings suggest that while the 
specific modalities of capacity building vary across 
levels, the core enabling conditions often converge. 
Local relevance, strong partnerships, recipient owner -
ship, and contextual alignment consistently emerged 
as critical success factors across individual, organiz -
ational, and systemic interventions. This reinforces the 
notion that, despite variation in project design, capacity 
building efforts can be systematically categorized and 
evaluated based on shared principles that underpin 
their effectiveness.
Discussion
This systematic review analyzed the barriers and facilita -
tors of capacity building in international development 
projects by synthesizing evidence from 27 peer- 
reviewed articles. The study introduces an analytical 
framework that integrates existing models with level- 
specific determinants, offering a more structured lens 
through which capacity development can be under -
stood, assessed, and applied. By categorizing success 
factors and obstacles across individual, organizational, 
and systemic levels, the framework helps clarify the 
ambiguous concept of capacity building – particularly 
within the context of international development 
cooperation.
The findings indicate that most capacity development 
interventions are concentrated at the individual and organ -
izational levels, with comparatively fewer efforts targeting 
systemic change. This imbalance may constrain long-term 
sustainability unless broader structural conditions – such as 
policy environments and institutional governance – are 
also addressed. Three recurring success factors emerged 
from the review. First, local ownership and community- 
led knowledge sharing were essential for ensuring 
project sustainability, particularly when local actors actively 
managed and adapted interventions to their contexts 
(Laverack and Thangphet 2009 ; Ramos and Ferreira-Pinto 
2002 ). Second, partnerships grounded in coordination 
and mutual commitment were consistently associated 
with improved capacity building outcomes (Cancedda 
et al. 2018 ; Kanal et al. 2020 ; Raguin 2016 ). Third, education 
and training programs that delivered relevant skills and 
incorporated local incentives proved especially effective 
at the individual level (Adom, Nyadu-Addo, and Kquofi 
2021 ; Stover et al. 2014 ).

This study makes a theoretical contribution by pro -
posing a level-based analytical framework that enables 
conceptual clarity in defining and analyzing capacity 
building. While the term ‘Community Capacity Building 
(CCB)’ is widely used in the literature, it often lacks a 
unified definition. This framework helps disaggregate 
the concept into distinct yet interrelated levels – each 
with its own enabling conditions. Such an approach 
offers a more nuanced understanding of CCB as a 
layered process rather than a singular construct, reveal -
ing how its functions vary depending on the level of 
intervention. By distinguishing between surface-level 
inputs (e.g. training) and deeper systemic level trans -
formations (e.g. governance or ownership), the analyti -
cal framework provides a structured means of 
analyzing the complexity of capacity development 
efforts.
The framework also serves as a practical tool for prac -
titioners involved in the planning, implementation, and 
evaluation of international development projects. For 
project designers, it can function as a checklist of level- 
specific components – such as motivation and skills at 
the individual level, partnerships and communication 
at the organizational level, and policy coherence at the 
systemic level. For evaluators, the framework offers a 
structured approach to assess whether project activities 
are aligned with appropriate capacity goals across levels, 
and whether key success factors are adequately 
addressed or obstructed. This clarity is particularly valu -
able for donor agencies and implementing partners who 
must demonstrate measurable impact. By translating an 
otherwise abstract concept into concrete and actionable 
elements, the framework helps bridge the gap between 
conceptual ambiguity and practical application in the 
discourse on capacity building.
The authors acknowledge that the proposed frame -
work may not be universally applicable. 
International development projects are highly context- 
specific, operating under diverse institutional, cultural, 
and political conditions. Moreover, because the majority 
of studies included in this review originate from the 
health sector, the findings may reflect a sectoral bias. 
Expanding future reviews to include grey literature and 
capacity building documentation from donor and 
NGO-led projects would strengthen the generalisability 
and applicability of the findings. Despite these limit -
ations, the study makes a meaningful contribution to 
both theory and practice. It underscores the importance 
of identifying success factors not in isolation, but as part 
of a multi-level, interdependent system. Future research 
could apply this framework to empirical case studies 
across sectors to further validate its relevance and 
explore context-specific adaptations.
