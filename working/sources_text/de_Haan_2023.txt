The study involved a comprehensive meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trial
(RCT) studies of workplace and executive coaching programs written in the English lan-
guage between 1994 and 2021, using rigorous inclusion criteria designed to align with the
robustness of statistical significance and coaching applications. Analysis of 39 coaching
RCT samples, with a total sample size ofn 52,528, yielded a statistically significant effect
of workplace coaching across all leadership and personal outcomes. Our best estimate of
a standard effect size for coaching ofg 5.59 fell well within the moderate range, although
there were indications of significant publication bias, as expected. Furthermore, we
develop a model that is based on the leverage from coregulation between coach and coa-
chee. The model was confirmed in five different predictions: moderation analyses indi-
cated that effects are larger with self-reported outcomes, as distinct from observed
outcomes; they are larger with qualified coaches in nonleadership applications; and they
are somewhat larger with female coachees, while they do not depend much on the length
of the overall coaching assignment. Taken together, these findings provide clear and new
evidence of the efficacy of coaching interventions in a variety of applications.
Coaching is a customized personal development
journey that promotes the client’s decision-making
and performance through conversations, making use
of shared inquiry, reflection, support, and challenge.
As a pathway for personal and professional growth,
coaching is now firmly established in the sports and
business worlds and enjoys a growing popularity in
the teaching and medical professions. In response
to the coaching profession’s growth over the last
two decades, research into workplace coaching out-
comes has increased significantly, and has produced
a wide and varied evidence base for its effectiveness.
Of the 160 unique and rigorous empirical studies
summarized in De Haan (2021), 11 were published
in 2019 and 14 in 2020 alone.
Despite a growing base of empirical research, the
effectiveness of workplace coaching has not been es-
tablished beyond doubt. Most published studies show
clear indications of effectiveness, although there are
several counterexamples and the case against coach-
ing’s effectiveness can still be made, especially when
publication biases are estimated (de Haan, 2021).
Beyond establishing general effectiveness, there are
clear questions around how many sessions are needed
to achieve a satisfactory level of outcomes. As this
study will show, a meta-analysis can now establish
not only a convincing measure of general effective-
ness, but also the effects of dosage (session num-
bers), coachee gender, coach and coachee job roles,
and even the types of outcomes measured. Eventu-
ally, one would expect to show differential effects
for coaching models and years of experience, al-
though most researchers expect common factors to
dominate, which means that interventions, qualifi-
cations, and experience levels are not expected to be
very distinctive when regressed against outcomes.
There have been four previously published, explo-
rational meta-analyses of coaching effectiveness (Burt
& Talati, 2017; Jones, Woods, & Guillaume, 2015;
Sonesh, Coultas, Lacerenza, Marlow, Benishek, &
Salas, 2015; Theeboom, Beersma, & van Vianen,
2014), but they were all conducted before a recent

growth of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). They
encompass 18, 24, 17, and 11 studies, respectively,
and miss out on some of the earlier RCTs. We believe
each of those analyses has insufficient power to
demonstrate small effects or reject the null hypothesis—
see, for example, our power analysis in the Methodol-
ogy section. Moreover, they are all based on study
selections that include not just RCTs but also quasi-
experimental designs wherein the control group was
not randomized, which may have overstated the ef-
fect sizes. Only one of the earlier meta-analyses, Jones
et al. (2015), reported a“prediction interval” (PI),
which is meta-analysis’s most powerful measure of
the significance of overall effectiveness, and that
study only reported a nonstandard 80% PI.
The most reliable research protocol, the random-
ized controlled trial, has grown considerably in coach-
ing. RCT applications have more than tripled since
the most recent overview by Burt and Talati in 2017.
Considering this strong growth in research, helped by
a growth in PhDs in coaching and a growing number
of medical applications of workplace coaching, we
believe it is time to attempt a new meta-analysis study,
this time exclusively based on RCTs, so that artificial
biases are avoided, and effect sizes are more compara-
ble. In a meta-analysis of studies with between-group
designs, effect sizes are always measured against
those of a control group in the same circumstances,
which substantially reduces same-source and selec-
tion biases, Hawthorne effects, and other false posi-
tives. For this meta-analysis, we have brought
together all 37 RCT studies in workplace, executive,
and life coaching, containing 40 independent sam-
ples. Where data were incomplete, we contacted the
authors. For one article, the authors could no longer
report the full data, so our meta-analysis is based on
36 rigorous RCT studies, which were published
between 1994 to 2021, with 26% of the included
samples published since the latest published meta-
analysis (Burt & Talati, 2017)
Workplace (including leadership or executive)
coaching has characteristics that lend it very well to
outcome research. Coaching is a goal-directed activ-
ity that mostly takes place during carefully time-
bounded, discrete sessions in a neutral, delimited
location. This creates something similar to a“lab”
situation with clearly described, anticipated out-
comes, where all changes can be attributed to a pre-
cise number of hours and sessions, and to those
sessions alone. There are also challenges in conduct-
ing coaching research, mostly to do with the commis-
sioning of coaching programs, where organizational
sponsors want to determine who gets access and
when, which makes the creation of an equal and ran-
domized control group precarious in realistic situa-
tions (see, e.g., the disrupted trials of Egan & Song,
2005, and Ungerer, Heinzelmann, Baltes, & K€onig,
2019).
We believe nevertheless that, with careful formula-
tion of theory and hypotheses, a new meta-analysis
can give insight into which implementations of coach-
ing can be most (cost-) effective and can resolve chal-
lenges in the implementation of leadership coaching,
such as the number of sessions or qualification levels
of coaches. This meta-analysis can also test if coachee
self-reported outcomes are worth measuring even if
they are notoriously biased toward false positives
(Grover & Furnham, 2016). It would be able to show
that the findings from less rigorous but, in many cases,
more realistic trials still support similar predictions as
the more rigorous studies.
In summary, this study was undertaken to (a) pro-
vide a clear PI for effectiveness of workplace coach-
ing based on the relatively less biased RCT studies,
(b) fill gaps and update the current systematic review
literature, and (c) identify clear and significant mod-
erators of this effectiveness, by studying differentials
in the studies related to type of coaches, coachees,
and outcome measures.
THEORETICAL MODEL UNDERPINNING OUR
META-ANALYSIS
Based on results in psychotherapy (Cuijpers,
Karyotaki, De Wit, & Ebert, 2020) and mentoring
(Stoeger, Balestrini, & Ziegler, 2021), and from a
glance through the results from RCTs in coaching,
we would expect to be able to demonstrate a moder-
ate level of effectiveness and a PI that does not
include zero. We base all our other hypotheses on
the cocreated nature of coaching (Erd€os & Ramseyer,
2021; Wasylyshyn, 2022), where coregulation (Sbarra
& Hazan, 2008), relational attunement (Yip, Trainor,
Black, Soto-Torres, & Reichard, 2020), and nonverbal
synchrony (Koole & Tschacher, 2016) are significantly
shaping measurable outcome factors. Synchrony, re-
sponsiveness, and coregulation within sessions have
been shown to relate to better therapy and coaching
outcomes (e.g., Ianiro, Lehmann-Willenbrock, &
Kauffeld, 2015; Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2011;
Watson & Wiseman, 2021). The terms “respon-
siveness,”“ relational attunement,”“ cocreation,”
and “coregulation” r e f e rt ot h ea b i l i t yo fc o a c ha n d
coachee to respond flexibly and constructively to
new events—
that is, explicitly processing and ad-
dressing new information in the present moment.

Nonverbal (interpersonal) synchrony can be seen as
evidence for this coregulation: it is defined by syn-
chronized (and slightly delayed) changes within
coach and coachee— for example, vocal pitch, bodily
movements, and even their physiological processes.
Coregulation boils down to the ability to influence
one another in a“relational dance” (De Haan, 2008),
moment by moment, but also longer term. One
would expect forces from (self-)motivation and sta-
tus through to positional power and relational lever-
age to play a role in shaping the willingness and
ability to cocreate. Indeed, abundant evidence has
already been found for the contribution of such
leverage-underpinning coregulation to predict coach-
ing effectiveness: (a) the credibility (e.g., Boyce,
Jackson, & Neal, 2010; Bozer, Sarros, & Santora, 2014;
Grant, 2014; Sue-Chan & Latham, 2004) and dominant-
friendliness (e.g., Ianiro & Kauffeld, 2014; Ianiro et al.,
2015; Ianiro, Schermuly, & Kauffeld, 2013) of the
coach; (b) the intrinsic motivation of the coachee (e.g.,
Bozer, Sarros, & Santora, 2013); and (c) the trust
within or strength of the coaching alliance (e.g., Boyce
et al., 2010; De Haan, Grant, Burger, & Eriksson, 2016;
Kim & Kuo, 2015; Zimmermann & Antoni, 2020).
Similar coregulated factors have been shown to be
important in the effectiveness of psychotherapy (e.g.,
Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2011; Stiles, Honos-Webb, &
Surko, 1998; Wieder & Wiltshire, 2020).
We would therefore hypothesize thatleverage as
expressed by coregulation— that is, by influence,
credibility, motivation, and trust within the coach-
ing relationship— is bound to be the determining
variable for the effectiveness of coaching. Our model
as illustrated in Figure 1 predicts that coaching
impact correlates with theleverage that the coach
and coachee have on one another— the ability of
both partners to influence each other and to shape a
coaching relationship that is safe, independent, and
conducive to learning and change.
This Study’s Hypotheses
This study’s hypotheses flow from our model,
which takes theleverage within the cocreated and
responsively regulated coaching relationship as the
fundamental variable that predicts outcomes (see
Figure 1 for an illustration of the hypotheses).
Overall effect size.The most rigorous and helpful
estimate of the range of effect sizes to be expected is
the PI. Of the previous meta-analyses, only Jones
et al. (2015) reported an 80% PI in their meta-
analysis study, which ran from20.16 to 0.97 for cor-
rected effect sizes. We expect, with more samples, to
substantially improve on this interval. We will
report the standard 95% PI, which is a lot more strin-
gent, and we hypothesize to find it entirely above
zero, which would produce a strong indication for
the effectiveness of coaching. Therefore:
Hypothesis 1. Coaching will demonstrate positive and
moderate effects that can be shown to be significantly
different from zero.
The outcomes of coaching.The aim of coaching
and the measures of coaching outcomes varies be-
tween several studies. Evaluating the different out-
comes of coaching research is therefore important. A
systematic review of workplace coaching outcomes
comprising 110 peer-reviewed studies by Athanaso-
poulou and Dopson (2018) suggested that there is
evidence of three categories of coaching outcome—
namely, personal development, behavioral changes,
and the coachee and their work. The personal develop-
ment category includes specific outcomes such as
health-related measures (reduced stress, increased life
satisfaction, and experienced support). The behavioral
change outcome includes specific skills and perfor-
mance measures expressed by better communication
skills, management skills, and team-building skills.
Lastly, the“coachee and their work” category includes
outcomes focusing on psychological preparedness that
affect workplace productivity, such as self-awareness,
psychological capital, and self-efficacy. There is also
support in the literature for a goal attainment approach
in coaching, where the coach strives to achieve the
intended outcomes by working on the coachee’sg o a l
(Grant, 2012). Workplace coaching with a goal attain-
ment focus does not always measure improved health
benefits, workplace skills, or readiness.
We would expect the strength of coaching outcomes
to be dependent on the methodology of data collec-
tion. We expect effect sizes to be higher for self-scores
than for scores by others and for objective ratings sim-
ply because coach and coachee have more leverage on
the same-source biases (see De Haan, 2021, for an
extensive comparison of self-scores, multisource feed-
back scores, and more objective and independent
outcome measures). Given the variety of coaching
outcomes within the review by Athanasopoulou and
Dopson (2018), and the support for goal-attainment
coaching approaches (Grant, 2012), we posit:
Hypothesis 2a. Coaching will have positive effects for
well-being, workplace skills, preparedness, and goal
attainment.
Hypothesis 2b. Effect sizes will be skewed upwards
for self-scores.

Type of coachee.The question about who bene-
fits (the most) from coaching is important and our
meta-analysis can explore for differential effects for
different coachees. To the best of our knowledge,
direct comparisons between different types of coach-
ing clients, such as students in university settings,
general adults, professionals inside organizations,
and managers or executives inside organizations,
has not been undertaken. From within-sample com-
parisons, some first indications have been put
forward that coachees from a higher educational
background, such as university students, benefit
more (e.g., Hoven, Ford, Willmot, Hagan, & Siegrist,
2014; Poluka & Kaifi, 2015). Toegel and Nicholson
(2005) and Bozer, Baek-Kyoo, & Santora (2015) found
a similar small positive effect for same-gender pairs.
We would assume leverage of coaching (from
the viewpoint of autonomy as well as trust and
safety) is highest when the coachee is relatively
separate from an organization (such as in student
and general adult populations) and lowest when
coaching takes place higher up the hierarchical
ranks inside organizations. In view of the male
dominance in the business world, in conjunction
with gender stereotypes suggesting females are
more people oriented, open, and caring (Gray,
De Haan, & Bonneywell, 2019), we expect female
coachees to be more intrinsically motivated for
coaching. Moreover, as the coachee’s agenda and
motivation is central to coaching and intrinsic, vol-
untary motivation influences female learners more
than male counterparts, both in sports coaching and
in traditional education (e.g. Amorose & Horn, 2000;
Vecchione, Alessandri, & Marsicano, 2014), we ex-
pect a slightly higher effectiveness for female coa-
chees. Thus:
Hypothesis 3a. Workplace coaching will be effective
for students, employees, and leaders, and skewed
upwards for student and nonleadership coachees.
Hypothesis 3b. Workplace coaching will achieve
higher effects for female coachees.
Type of coach and coach presence.Leverage will
be highest when the coach is also the coachee’s

instructor or line manager, because then the coach’s
impact tends to stretch beyond the boundaries of for-
mal coaching sessions. For the same reason, we
hypothesize external coaches to have lower impact
than instructors or managers. In a teaching or labora-
tory context, leverage should be on an intermediate
level: coaches have influence over and authority
within the setting, something that external coaches
do not have. As far as we know, there are currently
very few studies into different types and dosages of
coaches. Sue-Chan and Latham (2004) found that
students receiving coaching from a faculty instructor
achieved significantly higher course grades than stu-
dents who had been coached by a peer. Students
also rated the faculty instructor as more credible
than the peer coaches. Liljenstrand and Nebeker
(2008) compared 2,231 coaches of different back-
grounds and suggested that those with psychology
training are more represented in executive coaching
and are finding the marketplace more competitive.
Finally, Boyce et al., (2010), Grant (2014), and Bozer
et al., (2014) have provided some evidence as to the
higher impact of a coach with“credibility”— that is,
external, qualified, psychologically trained execu-
tive coaches. We propose therefore that, compared
to those working with student coaches, coachees
who receive coaching from an external coach may
feel more confident in the credibility and profession-
alism of the coach, and in the confidentiality of the
sessions, which will increase leverage of those coa-
ches and therefore effectiveness.
On first sight, the amount of presence of the coach,
expressed by the number of sessions, should in-
crease leverage. However, we have seen strong evi-
dence of coregulation, or“responsive regulation” in
the psychotherapy literature (Stiles, Barkham, &
Wheeler, 2015), where it is found that therapist
and client can coregulate the overall outcome to fit
within a good range in terms of number of sessions.
In coaching too, coregulation has been found to lead
to the result that similar effect sizes are found for dif-
ferent “doses” of coaching or numbers of sessions
(see Anthony, Gimbert, & Fultz, 2013; Goff, Goldring,
Guthrie, & Bickman, 2014; and, in meta-analysis stud-
ies, Sonesh et al., 2015; Theeboom et al., 2014). We
postulate:
Hypothesis 4a. Coaching provided by an external,
qualified executive coach will demonstrate greater
effect sizes than coaching provided by (a) an internal
or (b) student coach.
Hypothesis 4b. Coaching impact will be independent
of number of coaching sessions provided.
METHODOLOGY
A literature search was carried out using the
EBSCO, Google Scholar, and ProQuest databases to
identify relevant studies published up to December
31, 2020. The following terms were used sequentially
in the search:“executive,”“ workplace,”“ coaching,”
and “research” in combination, then“quantitative,”
then“effect size” and“control group”in combination,
and finally “randomized,” with additional terms
“health coaching” and “executive coaching” to refine
the search (see Figure 2). This search strategy yielded
a total of 463 sources, of which 20 were original RCT
studies. By cross-checking all references of these
sources and the references in earlier systematic re-
views and meta-analyses (i.e., Athanasopoulou &
Dopson, 2018; Burt & Talati, 2017; Ely, Boyce, Nelson,
Zaccaro, Hernez-Broome, & Whyman, 2010; Grover &
Furnham, 2016; Jones et al., 2015; Sonesh et al., 2015;
Theeboom et al., 2014), we were able to grow the num-
ber of original RCT studies in workplace coaching to
37. Details on how many studies were removed at
each stage can be found in Figure 2. We checked all
remaining articles for our definition of coaching as a
series of distinct, one-to-one, client-led, goal-directed
conversations, wherein independent (coaching) pro-
fessionals work with healthy adults. We included one
study with adults who had recently been unable to
work due to mental disability, because they had been
in therapeutic treatment and were being supported by
coaches to reintegrate in normal competitive employ-
ment (Viering et al., 2015).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Our selection stays within the definition of work-
place or leadership coaching as a series of one-to-
one helping conversations, in which the coach is
independent and supports a healthy, adult coachee
who works on his or her own, mostly work-related
goals. For this reason, we have selected all RCTs
(with a control group of comparable size to the inter-
vention group) in leadership, life, and workplace
coaching, as these have similar coaching methods in
common and place the coachee’s own challenges and
decisions at the center of the process. We have ex-
cluded studies in health coaching, sports coaching,
and mentoring where the coach is much more in
charge, uses a different coaching methodology, and
directs the change process by means of instruction or
education. These are large domains of practice that
would skew any meta-analysis around workplace
coaching of independent adults; moreover, we expect
a meta-analysis of all these fields to be so diverse that
2023 De Haan and Nilsson 5
<<<PAGE=6>>>
the PI becomes unwieldy and workplace-related pre-
dictions cannot be well calculated.
In summary, we excluded all studies that were not
researching workplace or executive coaching in the
widest sense. This meant we included work-related,
life, career, and executive coaching with adults. We
did not exclude any studies on the grounds of the
background, interventions, or qualifications of the
coach, nor of the nature of the coaching outcomes,
nor of the coachees’seniority, gender, or age, lack of
realism in the experiment, geography, nor industry.
In the overall sample, these dimensions tended to be
unique in nearly every study. We selected as many
of these aspects as we could as moderating aspects to
study in the meta-analysis. We believe our inclusion
criteria were straightforward and rigorous: any truly
randomized controlled trial (RCT) in adult work-
place coaching would be included. See Table 1 for
a more detailed description of each study, including
the nature of the study, type of coach, type of
coachee, types of outcomes, and sample sizes.
We left out more than 100 RCTs that were under-
taken in health coaching, because they were all con-
ducted with patients (moreover, they were undertaken
in a highly directive, coach-led, educational manner,
which would be likely to turn out differently from
workplace coaching, where the client’so w ng o a l s
are emphasized). We also left out several mentoring
RCTs, which were often nonwork related (e.g.,“youth
mentoring” or “peer mentoring”)a n d— similar to
health coaching— were too advisory and directive to
represent coaching interventions. Health coaching
and mentoring outcome research have been re-
viewed in more depth alongside workplace-
coaching outcome research in De Haan (2021). Our
criteria meant that we did include group coaching
(e.g., Green, Oades, & Grant, 2006; Poepsel, 2011;
and, partially, De Haan, Gray, & Bonneywell, 2019),
life coaching for healthy adults (Green, Grant, & Ryn-
saardt, 2007; Green et al., 2006; Spence & Grant,
2007) and several studies in which coachees were
physically or mentally challenged— for example, by

being close to burn out— but where the coaching was
still work related and separate from their medical
treatment (Duijts, Kant, Van den Brandt, & Swaen,
2008; McGonagle et al., 2014; Viering et al., 2015).
The studies undertaken in the related areas of life
coaching, driver coaching, and burn-out coaching
made use of qualified executive coaches, so they
were all broadly using the same methods as the other
RCT studies.
The selection process excluded two further studies
that started out as rigorous randomized controlled
trials and are therefore worth a mention. In each case,
the experiment was set up in a realistic setting with
executive coachees and proper randomization, but
organizational pressures and attrition meant that inter-
vention and control groups could no longer be fully
randomized. One of these studies found significant
effects and the other had to confirm the null hypothe-
sis. Here is a short summary of each:
/C15Egan and Song (2005) found that 54 new man-
agers in a multinational retail organization who
were coached by external executive coaches
received higher line manager ratings than 49 man-
agers in the control group (d 5 .6; p , .05). Signif-
icant differences on self-scored performance-goal
orientation, job satisfaction, and organizational
commitment were also found.
/C15Ungerer et al. (2019) found that 36 new German
entrepreneurs in innovative technology-based
firms who had received state-sponsored external
coaching did not acquire significantly more sur-
vival capability than the 57-strong control group,
as no significant results were found on any of the
indicators of survival capability.
Even though an impressive amount of good re-
search has now been done and many RCTs can be
reviewed together, there is still considerable variability
remaining between the various studies. Some were
undertaken in realistic, corporate settings with execu-
tive coachees, while others have student coachees or
even student coaches; some have objectively measured
or at least intersubjectively validated (observed) out-
comes, others have only self-scored outcomes. There
are no agreed outcome variables that have been
researched throughout the literature (see Table 1).
Three key challenges in present-day RCTs are (1) the
widespread reliance onself-score measures,i na b o u t
half of the RCTs; (2) the limited statistical power
because ofsmall sample sizeswell undern 5 100, in
four fifths of RTCs; and (3) the focus on leadership—
that is,executive coaching— in about one fifth of the
RCTs (see also Table 1, which has a summary of all
selected studies).
Analysis
Effect sizes.“Effect size” is a quantitative measure
to understand the size of the estimated difference
between two or more populations. A central tenet
of meta-analysis (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &
Rothstein, 2009) is that effect sizes can be applied and
compared between samples regardless of their meth-
odology and size. In this study, the effect sizes were
calculated based on between-group standardized
mean differences, which means that original effect
sizes from all samples were transformed to a repeated-
measures Cohen’sd e l t a(d
ppc2; Morris, 2008) where
means and standard deviations of pre- and post-tests
were available. Morris (2008) suggested using a pooled
pre-test standard deviation of the experiment and con-
trol group to control for effect of the intervention and
correcting for small sample sizes; see Figure 3 for the
equation used by Morris (2008).
For the calculation of effect sizes, we collected
group sizes, all mean scores, and the standard devia-
tions for both groups for at least the time measure-
ments before and after the intervention. There were
11 sources in the sample in which the publication did
not include all those data or at least not in a usable
format; thus we contacted the authors of these papers
and requested the mean scores and standard devia-
tion for the pre- and post-scores of both groups, and
we are very grateful for their help. There was one RCT
for which, unfortunately, the full data could not be
retrieved, and so we had to exclude it from the meta-
analysis: Duijts et al., 2008. This left us with 36 of the
37 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising a total of
39 independent samples, because Williams and Low-
man (2018) reported two independent samples in
their study and Grant (2001) reported three.

Where pre-scores were not available, the reported

2007; Goff et al., 2014; Passmore & Rahman, 2012;
Passmore & Velez, 2012; Poepsel, 2011; Singh et al.,
2015; Tee et al., 2017; Viering et al., 2015), and, in
three other cases, effect sizes had to be transformed
from r
2 and r (Stelter et al., 2011; Taie, 2011; Telle
et al., 2016). To avoid overestimating the population
effect size, given some small sample sizes, we calcu-
lated Hedges’g, which has the same small-sample
correction asd
ppc2 (Borenstein et al., 2009).
We conducted a power analysis for random-
effects models to identify the number of studies
required to achieve a power of. 80% that is recom-
mended to identify a true effect (Ellis, 2010). We
used a conservative effect size ofd 5 . 2 0t oa l l o ws t u d -
ies with low effects to be identified, and the sample
size was set atn 5 56, which was the average number
of participants in the meta-analysis by Theeboom et al.
(2014) when outliers had been controlled for. This
power-analysis revealed thatk 5 27 would be suffi-
cient to assure power over 80%.
Model and heterogeneity.The meta-analysis in
this paper is conducted on RCTs of different partici-
pants, methodologies, and outcomes. A random effects
model in meta-analysis is appropriate to use when the
effect sizes are assumed to fluctuate between studies
due to uncontrolled variables, such as differences
in the methodology of the interventions, differences
in participants, etc. (Borenstein 2019). Given this het-
erogeneity in intervention content, we decided in
advance to pool data using a random-effects model,
with all effect sizes weighted by the reciprocal of
the sampling variances, as suggested by Borenstein,
Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein (2010). Furthermore,
the Hartung–Knapp–Sidik–Jonkman (HKSJ) adjust-
ment was used to correct the random-effects model
and create more robust estimates (Hartung & Knapp,
2001; Sidik & Jonkman, 2002). The HKSJ adjustment
often results in lower error rates in a meta-analysis that
contains a smaller number of studies and studies with
similar sample sizes (IntHout, Ioannidis, & Borm,
2014). The analysis of the moderating relationships
(Hypotheses 2–4) is conducted on smaller subsets of
studies (k4–k27) and the HKSJ adjustment is therefore
a suitable and preferable adjustment model for the
analyses in this study.
As recommended by Borenstein et al. (2009), het-
erogeneity between samples was measured by cal-
culating both the classical Q statistic and theI
2
statistic. The most used heterogeneity statistic is Q,
which calculates a weighted sum of the square
distances of the observed effects from the null
hypothesis of equality of the effects. The Q statistic
provided a significance test for between-sample het-
erogeneity, whereas the value forI2 represented the
percentage of between-sample variance in effect sizes
that can be attributed to between-sample heterogene-
ity rather than within-sample variability (Borenstein
et al., 2009). The software used for the analysis was
MIX 2.0, developed by Leon Bax (2016).
Inclusion variables and outcome categorization.
As Table 1 shows, most RCTs contained multiple out-
come variables. Thus, a four-step selection process
was implemented to categorize outcomes and select
the variables to include in the main meta-analysis.
The first step was to assess if a variable was character-
ized as the main outcome variable by the authors. If,
instead, a sample had multiple variables in focus, the
second step consisted of selecting an objective, or
(next) an observed variable, such as ratings by direct
reports or peers, instead of a self-reported variable, to
reduce same-source biases. If this did not yield a clear
outcome variable for that sample, in a third step, we
undertook an analysis of the variables in the wider
literature to assess which were more reliable than
others. If none of these three steps yielded a single
remaining outcome measure, we randomly selected
one and only one of the remaining variables, to pre-
vent violation of the independent sample assumption
(Borenstein et al., 2009).
When we later tested explicitly for differences
between self-reported, observed, and objective out-
come variables, and a single sample provided vari-
ables in more than one of these categories, then they
were all selected for this test, so as to include the
widest possible range of samples.
Moderator variables.Moderator variables were
investigated using subgroup analyses for sets of sam-
ples that differed in terms of the samples of partici-
pants and outcome variables. Moderating variables are
considered to be present when the value forI
2 is close
to or above 50% (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). Sub-
group analysis and multiple meta-regressions were per-
formed using the R packages Meta (Schwarzer, 2007)
and Metafor (Viechtbauer, 2010). The subgroup analy-
sis pooled the effect size of each subgroup and com-
pared the effect sizes of each subgroup with each other
using a random effects model (Borenstein & Higgins,
2013). Our multiple meta-regression models used pro-
portion of females and number of sessions as predic-
tors of the effect size (this could be done for thek 5 33
samples that provided these data). These multiple-
regression models were controlled by HKSJ adjust-
ments and only performed on subgroups withk $ 10,
as recommended by Borenstein et al. (2009: 188).

RESULTS
Data Check and Meta-Analysis
The Results section is outlined after the four hy-
potheses, and will present the impact of coaching on
types of measurements of outcomes, nature of out-
comes, coachees, and coaches. The random effects
meta-analysis of executive coaching against control
groups yielded an overall weighted effect size for all
outcomes that was in the moderate range, reflecting
an advantage of coaching over control groups, with
Hedges’g 5 .59 [0.45, 0.74],t 5 8.42, p , .001 (95%
PI [20.19 to 1.38]; Figure 4). All results of the meta-
analyses are summarized in Table 2.
An exclusion-sensitivity assessment of the differ-
ent studies, with the aim of identifying how specific
studies impacted the overall results, indicated that
the studies with the most participants (Passmore &
Rahman, 2012; Passmore & Velez, 2012) skewed the
data significantly. An analysis of the whole sample
with the two articles removed showed a higher effect
size, g 5 .63 [0.48, 0.77],t 5 8.69, p , .001. This
improves the prediction interval, which is now PI
[20.15 to 1.40]. The two studies excluded from fur-
ther analysis form part of a group of four studies in
which the coaches were also instructors or line man-
agers of the coachees, and where it can be argued
that coaches provide a lot more than just“coaching
sessions” (Deviney, 1994; Passmore & Rahman,
2012; Passmore & Velez, 2012; Taie, 2011). We tested
what would happen to the overall effect size if these
studies were taken out. Excluding any combination
of these studies did not have a large impact on the
effect size, with the lowest effect size found when
they are all taken out,g 5 .59 [0.46, 0.73],t 5 8.93,
p , .001, and PI [20.07 to 1.26]. Taking any of these
samples out did improve the PI, which confirms that
they were probably outliers and they have limited
relevance to workplace and executive coaching.
Passmore and Rahman (2012) and Passmore and
Velez (2012) were removed from further subgroup
analysis where the overall weight is impacted more,
because the coaches were primarily instructors.
In sum, Hypothesis 1 is clearly supported, although
the 95% PI only nearly excludes zero, especially
when studies with coaches who are also managers or
instructors are taken out.
Types of Measurements of Outcomes
While most studies were focusing on well-being
dependent variables (k 5 15), there were also numer-
ous studies with a focus on professional skills (k 5 13)
or goal attainment (k 5 10). A few studies did also
focus on measuring the impact of coaching on general
preparedness, such as self-efficacy or psychological
capital (k 5 9). All types of measures were signifi-
cantly impacted by coaching (see Table 2). A subgroup
analysis did not indicate that the effect of coaching
significantly differed between any of the variables.
This supports Hypothesis 2a regarding coaching
outcomes.
Self-reported measures were the most reported
measure (k 5 27), followed by objective (k 5 8) and
observed measures (k 5 8), and, as can be seen in
Table 2, all three types of measures were significantly
impacted by coaching. Although the objective out-
comes had a high pooledg, they did not significantly
differ from either self-reported outcomes (z 52 0.45
[20.51, 0.81],p 5 .65) or observed outcomes (z 5
21.51 [21.14; 20.00], p 5 .049) after the confidence
interval being corrected by the Bonferroni correction
(0.05 / 35 0.017). However, coaching does have a
significantly higher effect on self-reported measures
compared to observed measures (z 5 2.63, [0.10,
0.71], p 5 .008). This supports Hypothesis 2b regard-
ing self-scored variables.
Coachees
Coaching studies were mostly conducted on em-
ployees (k 5 11) and students (k 5 13), followed by
leaders (k 5 7), and, lastly, a more general adult popu-
lation (k 5 6). Coaching had a significant impact on all
participant groups; however, the significant effect dis-
appeared on leadership coaching when a Bonferroni
correction was implemented (0.05 / 45 0.013). Fur-
thermore, a subgroup analysis did not identify signifi-
cant effect differences between any of the participant
subgroups. This lends support to Hypothesis 3a,
which stated that we expect lower overall effects on
leaders and managers.
Coaches
The majority of the studies included in this meta-
analysis used coaches with some level of certificate or
accreditation (k 5 15). Other studies had trained inter-
nal coaches (k 5 8) or students as coaches (k 5 4).
From the analysis, we learn that both certified coaches
and internal coaches had a significant effect, while the
effect sizes of student coaches was not significantly
different from zero (see Table 2). However, a subgroup
analysis could not identify any significant differences
in the effect between the types of coaches. This means

that Hypothesis 4a is not supported, yet there is some
support for Hypothesis 4b.
Multiple Meta-Regression
Multiple meta-regressions were conducted to un-
derstand the impact of the number of coaching ses-
sions and the proportion of female clients in the
research sample. The multiple meta-regression in-
dicated that the predictors significantly explained
61.99% of the effect size heterogeneity (r
2 5 61.99),
f(2, 29) 5 5.71, p , .01, where the proportion of
females had a significant unique prediction of the
effect (b 5 0.007, SE 5 0.003, p , .01). This signifies
that a 10% increase in female proportion is associ-
ated with an effect size increase of 0.07. However,
the number of coaching sessions did not have a
unique prediction of the overall effect (b 5 0.04,
SE 5 0.02,p . .05). The number of coaching sessions
ranged from 1 to 16, with an average of seven ses-
sions. A regression on effect size confirms that effect
sizes are stable between four to eight interventions.
The studies with higher effect sizes with interven-
tions between four to eight are studies with fewer par-
ticipants. There seem to be a few studies around 10
interventions with a higher effect size, but these stud-
ies have a lower weight of the meta-analysis.
The number of coaching sessions did, however,
significantly predict the effect size for self-reported
measures only. In fact, the full regression showed
r
2 5 70.54, f(2, 23)5 4.38, p , .01, with number of
coaching sessions (b 5 0.05, SE 5 0.03, p , .05);
and, again, the proportion of females uniquely pre-
dicted this effect size as well (b 5 0.01, SE 5 0.003,
p , .05).
Hypotheses 3b and 4b were both supported, with
females benefiting slightly but significantly more
from coaching in these samples, and numbers of ses-
sions having nearly no impact on effectiveness.
Publication Bias
We performed an analysis of potential publication
bias by conducting a funnel plot and Egger’sr e g r e s -
sions analysis (Duval & Tweedie, 2000). The funnel
plot in Figure 5 suggests that there is funnel asym-
metry among the studies. Egger’s regression test fur-
ther supported that there is an asymmetry,b 5 1.99,
t(37) 5 6.57, p , .001. We corrected the meta-
analysis using the trim-and-fill method (Duval &
Tweedie, 2000), due to the asymmetry of the studies.
The trim-and-fill method identified 16 studies that
may have inflated the effect size, and the trim-and-
fill-corrected analysis revealed a lower overall effect
size,g 5 .32 [0.13, 0.52],t 5 3.35,p , .01 [PI52 0.99
to 1.63]. It is therefore likely that the overall reported
effect size (g 5 .59) is somewhat overestimated due to

publication biases, like the presence of publication
bias in psychotherapy (Cuijpers et al., 2020).
DISCUSSION
We believe that this meta-analysis can give us con-
fidence regarding the effectiveness of coaching pro-
grams. We have found convincing indications for
moderate effectiveness, with best estimateg 5 .59
and 95% PI [20.07 to 1.26] (taking the four articles
that report on coaching by managers or instructors
out of the sample). This estimate is just below what
is usually found for psychotherapy, with latest esti-
mates ofg being around .73 (see, e.g., Cuijpers et al.,
2020) while our PI is narrower than the ones found
in psychotherapy. A lower effect size for coaching
can be expected from the fact that psychotherapy
has higher problem pressure, tends to have more
structure around the sessions with more leverage
(power) residing in psychotherapists, and a higher
frequency and therefore intensity. Given that an
effect size of 0.5 is large enough to be seen by the
naked eye, such as the difference in height between
14- and 18-year-old children (Cohen, 1988), this is a
sizeable effect indeed.
It is important to realize that there is a high variabil-
ity in the sample and that most of the demonstrated
effectiveness relies on self-reported outcomes by the
coachees, which are notoriously biased toward false
positives (Grover & Furnham, 2016). Nevertheless,
when we tested other outcome measures, we still
found significantly positive effect sizes (see Table 2).
Thus, when understanding that the effect of coaching
can easily be seen by the“naked eye,” it can be
pointed out that this is not just the eye of the coachees
themselves. Coaching outcomes are still significant
but somewhat less visible to direct reports, peers, and
line managers (“observed variables”).
This meta-analysis has not just shown a clear PI for
effectiveness of workplace coaching based on RCT
studies, it has also identified a number of significant
moderators of this effectiveness, in terms of types
of coaches, coachees, and outcomes (see Figure 1).
Finally, we confirm the helpfulness of our coregula-
tion model, which is, at the same time, gaining traction
in process studies in the helping professions, which
can fill in further gaps, studying moment-by-moment
changes during the sessions (e.g., Ianiro et al., 2015,
and Erd€os & Ramseyer, 2021). We will now look at the
conceptual and practical inferences that we believe
can be made on the basis of the meta-analysis.
Methodological and Conceptual Contributions
Making use of a coregulation model of coaching
effectiveness (Erd€os & Ramseyer, 2021; Watson &
Wiseman, 2021) has helped to bring clarity to our
findings. We hypothesized that coregulation based
on mutual leverage, trust, and motivation between
coach and coachee would be the key predictor of
coaching effectiveness. This model successfully pre-
dicted five disparate significant relationships in this
study (Hypotheses 2b– 4b), and is therefore a promis-
ing perspective on the effectiveness of coaching rela-
tionships. Coregulation may also explain our finding
that the population effect sizeg in coaching RCTs is
lower than what has been found recently in psycho-
therapy (Cuijpers et al., 2020), because therapy does
enjoy more leverage in terms of therapist credibility,
frequency of sessions, and problem pressure.
We find positive effect sizes for many different
measures of outcome, which confirms the idea that
coaching is an effective intervention on a wide

Standardized Mean Difference
The funnel plot illustrates the standardized mean difference
using Hedges’g by the standard error of the effect size. The shaded
areas show studies with significant effect sizes (p , .01 andp ,
.05, separately). Authors of the studies near thep 5 .05 threshold
might have calculated the effect size differently leading to signifi-
cant results. One indicator of publication bias is a negative rela-
tionship between standard error and effect size (Kepes, Banks,
McDaniel, & Whetzel, 2012), which appears to be the case and
supports the indication of publication bias.

variety of impacts. This matches the fact that, in
practice, coaching works with highly tailored (con-
tracted) coaching objectives, ranging from personal
well-being and work efficiencies through to organi-
zational outputs. We believe that our high effect
sizes for objective outcome variables (namely,g 5
.89; see Table 2) were skewed by a single study
by Taie (2011), which had a large sample and made
use of internal coaches who were also line managers.
In any case, the difference between objective, self-
scored, and observed outcomes was not significant.
Directions for Future Research
We think it is possible to make further predictions
with the coregulation model and to further strengthen
it by looking at how it predicts a variety of settings,
impacts, and results of coaching. It seems that, across
a wide variety of geographies, industries, and profes-
sions, coach and coachee will manage to adapt to the
circumstances of the work, the objectives they agree,
and the permitted length of the assignment to opti-
mize their interactions. In this process, coach and coa-
chee implicitly respond and subtly negotiate“good
enough” terms for outcomes, optimizing outcomes
even in the face of limitations such as a low number of
sessions or lack of coaching or leadership experience,
such as with student coachees and student coaches.
The PI is clearly influenced by the nature of the
coaching and becomes narrower if coaching by line
managers is taken out. We would suggest that future
meta-analysis studies exclude coaching by managers
and that they study more dimensions of coaching by
qualified coaches and student coaches, such as mod-
eration by the nature of training or approach of the
coaches; age and years-of-experience of the coaches;
the quality of the relationship between coachee and
coach; and methodological variables, such as quality
of randomization.
In future meta-analytic research, we believe it is
important to test the coregulation model and to base
further and perhaps more subtle predictions on it—
for example, the differential impact of coaching with
managerial levelof the coachee, or withl e v e lo fc r e d -
ibilityof the coach. Some quasi-experimental studies
have already been done in these areas and they sup-
port our model (see, e.g., Agarwal, Angst, & Magni,
2009, for managerial level, and Bozer et al., 2014, for
coach credibility), but there are no RCTs as far as we
can find. We also need more studies that link lever-
age to intrinsic motivation and empowerment of the
coachee, which is a factor that may go a long way in
explaining our differential results for male and
female coachees. Another aspect worth testing is that
our findings and model seem to support the hypothe-
sis that more challenging coaches are effective for
senior leaders, as they can themselves be challenging
and powerful, and may therefore need more leverage
for the coaching relationship to work well.
Contributions to Practice and
Coach Development
This meta-analysis has brought significant support
for the effectiveness of coaching as a tailored form
of personal and organizational development for
leaders and others in organizations. It supports a
long-standing debate that management learning and
organizational development should be more tailor-
made, customized, and flexible in the current VUCA
world (LeBlanc, 2018).
We found some confirmations of unique findings
in the literature, such as that the number of sessions
does not matter much (see also Anthony et al., 2013).
The findings of the meta-regressions suggest that
the gender distribution of the samples significantly
impacts the effect, although this may be skewed by
one large study that had only female coachees (De
Haan et al., 2019). The effect of gender was small but
significant. It is worth studying more, particularly
when considered from the emancipatory and intrin-
sically motivational aspects of leadership coaching.
Coaching studies undertaken with a single gender
may be skewed, so we need more within-sample
comparisons.
Regarding the noneffect of numbers of sessions, it
seems that coachees and coaches coregulate to maxi-
mize their take-up of coaching for at least the range of
sessions between four and eight, so that they adjust
the total number of sessions to what they need, or else
make sure that they achieve what they can in the num-
ber of sessions provided, no matter the precise number
of sessions, over a wide range (see Stiles et al., 2015,
for an extensive discussion of this coregulation
phenomenon in psychotherapy). The earlier meta-
analyses by Theeboom et al. (2014) and Sonesh et al.
(2015) also found that effect sizes were hardly influ-
enced by the number of sessions. This means we
should be careful not to think about the number of ses-
s i o n sa st h e“dosage” of coaching; for example, even
in shorter contracts with fewer sessions, a high effect
size can be reached. Our finding also does not pre-
clude higher effects in individual contracts when they

2020): coachees can adjust again to take something

more out of every additional session. In this regard,
it may be relevant that we find that the number of
sessions is a significant moderator when measured
purely on self-reported variables.
A strong message comes out of this meta-analysis to
practicing coaches and developers of coaches. It is
that working on the alliance, trust, and mutual influ-
ence pays off in terms of coaching effectiveness. So,
anything that can be done to strengthen the cocreated
relationship should be worthwhile, such as careful
contracting and working flexibly with a variety of
requested outcomes, agreeing on client-initiated goals
and tasks (Gessnitzer & Kauffeld, 2015), and provid-
ing however many sessions the client can agree to.
Provided outcomes and session numbers are carefully
contracted, there seems to be a“sweet spot” in the
range between four and eight sessions wherein coach-
ing programs could make savings with limited detri-
mental results in terms of effectiveness. We also
believe that coach behaviors such as dominant-
friendliness (Ianiro et al., 2013) and perceived empa-
thy can further strengthen this alliance. All these
aspects can be the focus of coach training and devel-
opment as well as supervision.
