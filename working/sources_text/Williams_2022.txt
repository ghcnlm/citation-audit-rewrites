trends highlight continuing opportunities for both higher education and workplace institutions to improve the efficacy
andefficiencyofcareerreadinesstraining.
Interestingly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of competencies that employers find lacking in job candidates
are those that are usually not an explicit focus of postsecondary courses. For instance, employers typically rate compe-
tencies such as social skills, teamwork/collaboration, professionalism/work ethic, leadership, and global/multicultural
fluency as at least somewhat essential for the workplace (e.g., Capelli,2012;N A C E ,2018;S c h a n z e n b a c he ta l . ,2016)
but also underdeveloped in recent college graduates (NACE,2018). One commonality shared across these competen-
cies is that they can be characterized as noncognitive constructs. These constructs are distinct from other individual
differences (i.e., technical knowledge or skills, physical abilities, job experience) and cognitive constructs (i.e., problem
solving,literacy,andtraditionaldefinitionsofintelligence).Noncognitiveconstructs—oftenreferredtoas“softskills”or
“21st century skills” (e.g., Heckman & Kautz,2012)—have been described as “demonstrable personality, motivational,
attitudinal, self-regulatory, and learning approach constructs for which there are differences among people, which stan-
dardizedtestsofcognitiveabilityarenotprimarilydesignedtomeasure,andthebehavioralexpressionofwhichisconsid-

Relevant Noncognitive Constructs
The noncognitive constructs targeted by academic or workplace interventions are a key concern. These constructs are
typicallyidentifiedbyreviewingthecharacteristicsthatorganizationsvalueintheiremployees,predictjobperformance,
and may be perceived as deficient in typical employee candidate pools (NACE,2018). As such, a primary goal of the
Martin-Raugh et al. (2020) literature review was to locate relevant constructs whose malleability was supported by sub-
stantial empirical evidence. Martin-Raugh etal. identified three broad categories for which some degree of longitudinal
change was corroborated in the form of meta-analyses or systematic reviews: personality, social skills (communication
skills,interpersonalskills,leadership,teamwork,cross-culturalskills),andadditionalnoncognitiveconstructs(attitudes,
self-concept,emotion,motivation).

occurring changes as evidence that these constructs are amenable to effortful change, we would argue against this con-
clusion. Instead, just one alternativeexplanation is that it is equally plausible—if not moreso—that naturallyoccurring
changesrepresentanopposingforcethatinterventionprogramsmustovercome.Similarly,conflatingnaturalandeffort-
ful change may unfairly discourage efforts to deliberately improve constructs that are highly stable over the natural life
course.Furthermore,itispossiblethatproposedmechanismsofnaturalchange(e.g.,genetics,significantortraumaticlife
experiences; see Roberts etal.,2006) cannot be translated into workplace interventions, which are the focus of our NCI
ToC. Therefore, we assert that the most valuable conclusion to be drawn from evidence of naturally occurring change is
in emphasizing that studies of effortful change should employ an experimental design. That is, the inclusion of a control
group in which the intervention is not applied is imperative in distinguishing intervention effects from natural longi-
tudinal trajectories. This strategy should facilitate research that supports causal inference for deliberate interventions. It
shouldalsobenotedthatwemaintainthisassertionregardlessofwhethernaturallyoccurringchangesarisefromfactors
that are biological, environmental, or some combination. Researchers may, however, be interested in noting any signif-
icant life events that may have coincidentally occurred during training in order to control for these variables. In turn,
in informing academic and workplace interventions, as well as areas where further research is needed, the NCI ToC’s

support was reported for cross-cultural skills, self-concept, motivation, communication skills, leadership, integrity, and
some personality constructs (e.g., resilience). It should also be noted that within these constructs, there is some varia-
tionregardingspecificsubsetsofconstructs.Forinstance,attitudesthataremorestronglyheldbyanindividualaremore
resistant to change. Similarly, when discussing emotion malleability, there is some debate regarding whether negative or
positive affect is easier to manipulate, though there is evidence that guilt is easier to induce than other emotions (e.g.,
fear, worry, anxiety). There was no evidence located for vocational interests, emotional intelligence, or personality con-
s t r u c t ss u c ha st h eB i gF i v e( s e eM c C r a e&C o s t aJ r . ,2008) or Dark Triad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy;
Paulhus & Williams,2002). However, these findings largely reflect a lack of research rather than conclusive evidence of
construct immutability. Therefore, future efficacy studies and eventually meta-analytic research on these constructs, if
feasible,wouldbeinvaluable.Wealsonotethatmalleabilityevidencemayexistinprimarystudiesoroutsideacademicor
occupationalsettings,butwasbeyondthescopeofMartin-Raughetal.( 2020).
Agents of Change
Once workplace-relevant noncognitive constructs have been identified for intervention, a logical next step is to identify
specific programs whose efficacy is empirically supported (Figure1, Path 1). Martin-Raugh et al. (2020)n o t e dt h a t
programssuchasteamtraining,smallgrouptraining,crewresourcemanagementtraining,interpersonalskillstraining,
and leadership training demonstrated efficacy in improving various social skills. Attitudes related to several forms of
counterproductiveworkbehavior(CWB)suchassexualassault,substanceabuse,andracialprejudicemaybeaddressed
through programs such as diversity training, education programs, and integrity or ethics courses. Additional support
waslocatedforprogramsinvolvingworkplacecoaching,emotionregulation,andempathytraininginimprovingvarious
noncognitiveconstructs.
Although these reviews and meta-analyses were illuminating, they often grouped interventions into broad categories
(Martin-Raughetal., 2020).Therefore,althoughtrainingefficacywasnottypicallyevaluatedatthelevelofspecificinter-
ventionprograms,someresearchexaminedthestrategiesemployedbyinterventionprograms(Figure 1,Path2).Inturn,

observed via self-report, other-report, or performance-based assessments (Martin-Raugh etal.,2020). However, these
changes are typically short-term as few studies included in meta-analyses and reviews evaluate long-term changes. Of
those that do, changes sustained over longer periods are rare (Martin-Raugh etal.,2020). Comparisons among various
assessment options are also relatively understudied. As an example, Martin-Raugh etal.(2020)n o t e dc o n fl i c t i n gr e s u l t s

Alternative OutcomeM e asurement
Conversely, NCI evaluators may be interested in outcomes beyond direct changes in the noncognitive construct. It is
possible that direct changes in the construct do not guarantee changes in other related outcomes. In turn, the NCI eval-
uation must be designed in a manner that will accommodate these outcomes. Although not always described as such,
many of the outcomes used in noncognitive construct change research align with those described by Kirkpatrick (e.g.,
1996). Kirkpatrick’s model is widely used in organizational settings and describes four levels of program evaluation
metrics—reaction,learning,behavior,and results—that progressfromshort-termto long-term.
The first level—reaction—assess trainees’ level of satisfaction with the intervention. In NCI research, this outcome
is operationalized in a similar fashion across workplace and higher education settings and is sometimes referred to as
affective outcomes (see Martin-Raugh etal.,2020). Aside from participants’ evaluations of the intervention, these out-
comesmaycaptureparticipants’attitudesrelatedtothenoncognitiveconstructofinterest(cross-culturalskills,leadership,
teamwork,motivation).Positivereactionsaretypicallydesired,butcriticalresponsesmayalsobeinformative.Reactions
outcomes are commonly used in NCI evaluations due to their ease of assessment. However, in evaluating an interven-
tion’s efficacy, participant reactions are among the most criticized outcome measures given their limited associations
with other, more valuable outcomes (Martin-Raugh et al.,2020). Alternatively, reactions outcomes may be more infor-
mative if separated into affective and utility subcategories, with the former describing participants’ enjoyment of the
interventionwhereasthelattercapturesperceptionsofusefulnessandtransferabilitytotheworkplace(Alligeretal., 1997).
Ultimately, reactions to training may be most instructive in modifying interventions to increase participant enjoyment

Thesecondoutcome—learning—referstopre–postchangesinrelevantconstructsassociatedwithtraining.Theafore-
mentioned direct changes in noncognitive construct scores represent a clear parallel between NCI outcomes and Kirk-
patrick’s(1996)learningoutcome.Forsomenoncognitiveconstructs(p ersonality,cross-culturalskills,leadership,team-
work, attitudes, emotion, motivation), direct changes in these assessments are occasionally augmented with additional
outcomes such as construct-relevant self-efficacy or knowledge (Martin-Raugh etal.,2020). In the case of knowledge,
these outcomes are sometimes described as cognitive outcomes in the NCI literature. There is some evidence (e.g., atti-
t u d ec h a n g er e s e a r c h )t h a tk n o w l e d g eo u t c o m e sa r em o r ea m e n a b l et oc h a n g et h a no t h e ro u t c o m et y p e s ,b u tf u r t h e r

interventions are of varying importance across industries. Communication skills, unsurprisingly, are often emphasized
inindustriesoroccupationssuchashealthcare,sales,customerservice,orotherpositionsthatinvolvecriticalteamwork
contextssuchasaviationcrews(seeMartin-Raughetal., 2020).Alternatively,postsecondaryoutcomesincludeacademic
performance such as course grades and degree attainment. Retention and graduation provide an example of short-term
versus long-term impact: The former is typically defined as continued enrollment 1year after entering college, whereas
the latter is assessed several years later depending on the type of degree, program, or institution (e.g., 2-year vs. 4-year
degrees; see McFarland etal.,2017). When the assessment of behavioral outcomes is not feasible, behavioral intentions
ar eoccasionallymeasur edinstead.
Despite differences in the specific performance-based outcomes across workplace and postsecondary settings, it is
possible that these outcomes differ in context only. These similarities suggest common noncognitive antecedents, which
may be targeted through comparable interventions. For instance, NCIs designed to improve interpersonal skills should
cause more frequent and effective social interactions in both workplace and postsecondary settings. Similarly, parallels
may be drawn between CWB and academic misconduct, suggesting that interventions addressing constructs such as
ethics or the Dark Triad may be equally relevant across contexts. Therefore, many of the causal mechanisms underlying
successfulinterventionsmaybesimilaracrosssettings,differingprimarilyinappropriatelycontextualizedpresentations.
In practice, similar to learning outcomes, behavior and results impact may be assessed through various methods,
includingself-reports,observerratings,orobjectivemeasures(e.g.,salesfigures;seeMartin-Raughetal., 2020).Overall,
these outcomes have been applied in research involving a diverse set of noncognitive constructs, including personal-
ity,communicationskills,cross-culturalskills,leadership,attitudes,emotion,motivation,andteamwork(Martin-Raugh
etal., 2020).However,althoughbehaviorandresultsoutcomesmaybeofmostvaluetovariousstakeholders,therearealso

Itshouldalsobeemphasizedthatdespiteitspopularityinindustrial/organizationalpsychology,theKirkpatrick( 1996)
framework is not without criticisms (e.g., Bates,2004;G i a n g r e c oe ta l . ,2010; Holton III & Naquin,2004), which have
led some researchers to propose alternative evaluation approaches (e.g., Alliger et al.,1997;B e e r ,1990;B r i n k e r h o ff&
Dressler,2015; Holton III & Naquin,2004). For example, Brinkerhoff and Dressler(2015) state that the Kirkpatrick

Quantifying Impact
After selecting appropriate evaluation outcomes, metrics for quantifying noncognitive construct change or intervention
efficacymustbeconsidered.Naturally,theseconsiderationsarecodependentwiththestatisticalmethodologyselectedfor
evaluatingchange.NCIefficacyresearchtendstoemphasizeeffectsizesratherthanstatisticalsignificance(Martin-Raugh
etal., 2020). Effect size calculation is not only necessary for the meta-analytic combination of primary studies, but also
provides established interpretation guidelines (e.g., Cohen,1988) and avoids many of the problematic issues inherent in
statistical significance testing (e.g., Kline,2013). As such, although the criterion for appraising a NCI as “successful” is
largely arbitrary, most meta-analytic estimates report moderate effect sizes (e.g.,d≈0.50–0.79 in a desirable direction;
Martin-Raugh et al.,2020). A small effect size (d≈0.20–0.49 in a desirable direction) would appear to be a reasonable
minimum requirement. Of note, these guidelines utilize Cohen’s(1988) largely theoretical interpretation benchmarks;
conversely,alternativedata-drivenguidelinesforeffectsizeinterpretationmayalsobeconsidered(e.g.,Boscoetal., 2015;
Gignac&Szodorai, 2016;Patersonetal., 2015).Regardless,describingtheprecisionoftheseestimatesthroughconfidence
intervalsisalsostraightforward.

Conversely, one troublesome unintended consequence of NCIs is that they may encourage participants to exaggerate

cerns highlight the importance of further research and development into methods for deterring and detecting response
manipulation, as well as assessment approaches that are less susceptible to faking, such as performance-based measures
asopposedtoself-reportmeasures.
A second unintended consequence of NCIs is that some participants may use their improved noncognitive profi-
ciencies for destructive purposes. For instance, some individuals may use newfound interpersonal skills to unethically
manipulate customers, clients, or coworkers. A similar concern had been raised in the context of psychopathy interven-
tions in forensic settings, for instance (Rice etal.,1992). Although these concerns have been subsequently discredited
(e.g., D’Silva etal.,2004), less is known about this topic in postsecondary and workplace contexts. Similarly, there is
precedence that interventions may have a counterproductive impact on certain noncognitive constructs; for example,
diversitytrainingprogramsoccasionallyreinforcesomeparticipants’stereotypicalattitudestowardspecificracialgroups
(see Bezrukova etal.,2016). These concerns highlight the need to identify participant characteristics—such as the Dark

Thus,severalfuturedirectionsforbothresearchandpracticeareavailable.
Future Research: Understudied Constructs
Despitetheirestablishedconceptualorempiricallinkstoworkplacebehavior,Martin-Raughetal.( 2020)notedresearch
gaps involving the malleability of several noncognitive constructs. For example, there appears to be little to no research
involving the effortful malleability of personality constructs such as the Big Five and the Dark Triad. Some research
has examined these constructs’ longitudinal trajectories in the context of naturalistic changes (e.g., Roberts etal.,2006)
or clinical intervention (e.g., Roberts etal.,2017); we have discussed their inappropriateness for informing academic

interventions is amenable to empirical investigation. Consequently, research disseminations may be considered another
example ofanimpactoutcome.
Translating the NCI ToC into ToAs
A primary distinction between ToCs and ToAs—or program theories and implementation theories, respectively
(Weiss,1997) —involves their level of specificity. The NCI ToC’s description of general mechanisms of noncognitive
constructchangemaybeusedtoinformToAsforindividualinterventionprogramsinacademicandworkplacesettings.
In turn, the focus of ToAs shifts to implementationconcerns such as construct measurement, trainingprogram delivery
methods, intervention duration and intensity (i.e., “dosage”), and moderators of training efficacy. Intervention setting
represents another central topic: Although these strategies are intended to improve workplace-relevant noncognitive
constructs, the interventions themselves may be conducted in academic or workplace contexts. We briefly discussed
strategies for quantifying change (i.e., statistical methodology), though these may also differ according to the construct
of interest and the specific intervention. Therefore, these may be elaborated within a ToA. ToAs may also be more
appropriateforinvestigatingcausallinksbetweenintermediateandultimateimpactspecifictoaparticularintervention.
Implementation theories may also describe unintended consequences at a more detailed level, thus informing specific
approachesforminimizingandaddressing such concerns.Overall,resultsfromresearchinvolvingtheseToAsmayhave

Concluding Comments
As employers and researchers increasingly recognize noncognitive constructs’ value in predicting workplace perfor-
mance,effortstoimprovetheseconstructsbecomemoresignificant.Morebroadly,theseeffortssignalashiftfromsimple
predictivevalidityresearchtowardinterventionefficacystudies.Inturn,thepracticalvalueofspecificworkplace-relevant
noncognitive constructs may be situated on a spectrum from selection applications (less malleable) to training and
developmentsettings(moremalleable).Ineithercase,apremiumisplacedonthecollectionoflongitudinaldata.Within
noncognitive constructs, this research should allow stakeholders to differentiate between less effective intervention
strategies and more successful programs. Although some unintended NCI outcomes are of obvious concern, they are
largely speculative, and methods for minimizing and detecting these outcomes are provided. Furthermore, the intended
consequences appear to be far more numerous, including the positive development of various noncognitive constructs
and improvement in occupational performance. In turn, NCIs should have a positive impact not only on individuals’
psychological attributes and socioeconomic mobility, but also for the advancement of science and for society as a whole
(Aguinis&Kraiger, 2009).
