Background: A growing number of studies emphasize executive coaching as an
eﬀective developmental tool that managers can use to increase th eir performance
in organizational settings. However, the coaching research sugg ests a large
variety of processes and outcomes, lacking clarity on the primary psychological
dimensions most impacted.
Method: Reviewing /two.tnum/zero.tnum studies with a rigorous methodological design that used
control trials and pre-post tests, we evaluated and compared the r elative eﬀects
of coaching on diﬀerent types and sub-types of outcomes by means o f a
classiﬁcation of coaching outcomes based on previously used taxon omies.
Results: The results indicate that the impact of coaching on behavioral
outcomes was higher compared to attitudes and person characteristi cs outcomes,
suggesting that behavioral coaching outcomes, especially cogni tive behavioral
activities, are the most impacted by executive coaching. Moreover , we found
signiﬁcant positive eﬀects for some speciﬁc outcomes, such as self -eﬃcacy,
psychological capital, and resilience, indicating that executiv e coaching is eﬀective
in producing change even on dimensions considered relatively s table over time.
The results show no moderation eﬀects of the number of session s. The length
of the coaching program was a signiﬁcant moderator only for the at titudes
outcomes.
Discussion: These ﬁndings provide evidence that executive coaching is a
powerful instrument for organizations to support positive ch ange and personal
development.

Introduction
Rapid changes in and the uncertainty of the economic, political, technological, and social
environment require leaders to develop human capital and the capacity to respond to these
challenges and achieve strategic organizational goals (
Kim et al., 2014 ). This complex context
increases the demands and expectations on leadership development to cultivate leaders
who can maintain and create optimal conditions for employees and long-term outcomes.
Executive coaching is now considered one of the primary methodologies for supporting
leaders’ development (
MacKie, 2014). Executive coaching concerns the supported changes in
individuals with managerial authority and responsibility in an organization to enhance their
professional performance and personal aspirations (
Kilburg, 1996 ). Organizations widely

Nicolau et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum
use coaching to create cultural and wellbeing change ( O’Connor
and Cavanagh, 2013 ). It enables long-term solutions by developing
new habits, attitudes, and work practices through a systemic
approach (
Ballesteros-Sánchez et al., 2019 ). Its increased popularity
has led to signiﬁcant ﬁnancial investment and over 71,000 coach
practitioners worldwide (
ICF, 2020).
Despite the high demand for executive coaching and the
increased interest from scholars, there is signiﬁcant debate
about what outcomes can be achieved and where coaching
resources should be targeted (
MacKie, 2014 ). Executive coaching
outcomes for an individual or organization can be manifold
because they diﬀer depending on the client’s goal and the social
context (
Athanasopoulou and Dopson, 2018 ). Thus, how executive
coaching outcomes are deﬁned and classiﬁed varies from one study
to another, making it diﬃcult to assess what is most impacted.
One of the main limitations of the past research in evaluating
coaching eﬀectiveness centers on choosing from various outcomes
and their beneﬁts (
Leonard-Cross, 2010 ; Graßmann et al., 2020 ).
Therefore, previous meta-analyses pointed out the lack of a clear
conceptual framework for categorizing coaching outcomes and the
importance of having one (
Theeboom et al., 2014 ). Although some
criteria for classifying coaching outcomes have been proposed and
analyzed in previous meta-analyses, they only have been deﬁned
based on the criteria measured and applicable to the included
studies.
Grant (2010), Theeboom et al. (2014) suggested that
a robust framework incorporating theoretical perspectives from
several sub-disciplines of psychology could enrich the coaching
literature and beneﬁt practitioners in improving the coaching
intervention. We believe that consistency in the deﬁnition and use
of outcome measures is paramount to obtaining robust insights
into the eﬀectiveness of executive coaching. Therefore, we used a
systematic framework for coaching outcome classiﬁcation based on
existing typologies in applied psychology research to address the
past literature limitations and help evaluate the relative strength of
executive coaching on diﬀerent sub-types of outcomes.
Apart from the diﬃculty in structuring the outcomes, another
challenge for consensus on evaluating the eﬀectiveness of executive
coaching is the appropriate research designs (
De Meuse et al., 2009 ;
Theeboom et al., 2014 ; Sonesh et al., 2015 ; Jones et al., 2016 ).
Most studies on executive coaching investigated the eﬀectiveness
of coaching by utilizing a within-subject research design (
Jones
et al., 2016 ). In within-subjects designs, the eﬀect sizes represent the
diﬀerences between measurements before and after the coaching,
with time variation between measurements depending on the
number of coaching sessions. An alternative design is a between-
subjects design where eﬀect sizes represent the diﬀerences between
the control and the experimental (i.e., coaching) groups (
Neal et al.,
2006; Orvis et al., 2009 ). The previous meta-analyses of executive
coaching eﬀectiveness ( Theeboom et al., 2014 ; Sonesh et al., 2015 ;
Jones et al., 2016 ) were based on study selections that include
various research designs, such as randomized control trials (RCT)
but also quasi-experimental designs that may have overestimated
the eﬀect sizes.
Theeboom et al. (2014) reported that the studies
using a within-subject design show larger eﬀect sizes than those
using an independent-group design, implying that the study design
considerably inﬂuences the relationship between the coaching
intervention and the reported outcomes. These conclusions were
supported by the ﬁndings of a recent meta-analysis using only
randomized control trials (
Burt and Talati, 2017 ). Their analysis
yielded notably lower overall weighted eﬀect sizes for all coaching
outcomes in the small to medium range, compared with a medium
to large eﬀect size (
Theeboom et al., 2014 ) and a very large eﬀect
size ( De Meuse et al., 2009 ), which was attributed to the diﬀerence
in methodologies. To our knowledge, just one meta-analysis on
executive coaching used only RCT (11 studies;
Burt and Talati,
2017). However, several RCT studies on executive coaching have
been published since its publication. Therefore, we believe that
there is a need for a new meta-analytic study, including exclusively
RCT studies on executive coaching, where eﬀects are always
established compared to a control group in the same circumstances,
and source and selection biases are substantially reduced. Thus, to
assess the eﬀectiveness of executive coaching, we have included 20
RCT studies in the current meta-analysis, with only four of these
included in the most recent published meta-analysis (
Burt and
Talati, 2017).
Executive coaching is a supportive relationship with clearly
deﬁned individual anticipated outcomes. However, there are
questions about how many sessions are needed or how long a
coaching program should take. As this study will show, a meta-
analysis could investigate and provide evidence on how important
these aspects are for the perceived coaching eﬀectiveness on
diﬀerent types of outcomes.
Thus, the present study aims to evaluate executive coaching
eﬀectiveness and assess the relative strength of coaching on
diﬀerent types of outcomes by reviewing and analyzing almost
20 years (2006–2023) of published research using the most
rigorous research design. Such analyses allow us to inform the
coaching buyers’ decisions and allow important discussion of
coaching eﬀectiveness regarding what is most impacted to facilitate
more tailor-made and customized individual and organizational
development in the current world context (
LeBlanc, 2018 ). To
our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst meta-analysis of the relative
strength of coaching among diﬀerent types of outcomes. The
present article diﬀers from previous meta-analyses in that our focus
is on including only RCT studies and comparing diﬀerent types of
coaching outcomes to understand the most impacted ones rather
than including studies using diﬀerent research designs and merely
assessing the overall eﬀect of coaching eﬀectiveness. Our meta-
analysis of RCT studies aims to (a) provide a way to structure
and analyze the coaching outcomes, (b) examine the eﬀects of
executive coaching on the overall outcomes studied and compare
its relative strengths on diﬀerent types of coaching outcomes and
(c) analyze possible conditions for coaching eﬀectiveness. Our hope
is that our results contribute to improving the way of structuring
and analyzing the coaching outcomes and the decisions on how to
allocate coaching resources and support.
Theoretical framework
Deﬁning executive coaching
Executive coaching—also referred to as business coaching,
leadership coaching, or workplace coaching—is an individualized
learning and development intervention to help leaders improve

Nicolau et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum
their capabilities, enhance their eﬀectiveness and maximize
their personal and professional potential in their organizations
(
Richardson, 2010; Jones et al., 2016 ; Williams and Lowman, 2018 ).
Executive coaching is considered a new discipline aimed
at enhancing leaders’ growth and development ( Finn, 2007 ;
Moen and Skaalvik, 2009 ). In organizational settings, executive
coaching is a means for executives to increase knowledge, improve
competencies, and enhance eﬀective leadership behavior favoring
the company (
Elliott, 2011 ; Moen and Federici, 2012 ). It has been
suggested that executive coaching developed exponentially in the
1980’s. One of the reasons was the volatile economic context, which
required leadership development and outplacement, among other
needs (
Richardson, 2010).
Kilburg (1996) and Grant et al. (2009) deﬁned executive
coaching as a helping, collaborative relationship between a client
who has managerial authority and responsibility in an organization
and a professional coach, which focuses on setting mutually deﬁned
goals and actions with the aim of improving their professional
performance and personal aspirations, and, consequently, the
eﬀectiveness of the organization. An executive coach facilitates
continuous learning, provides emotional support and feedback,
and helps managers to achieve a performance breakthrough and a
fundamental transformation (
Evers et al., 2006 ; Finn, 2007 ; Fontes
and Dello Russo, 2021 ).
Despite various approaches and models being available and
used, common features of executive coaching interventions include
goal-setting, awareness-raising, commitment and accountability,
planning, and action (
Grant et al., 2009 ; Jones et al., 2016 ). A
particularity of executive coaching is its focus on goal-directed
initiatives (
Grant and Cavanagh, 2007 ; Spence and Oades, 2011 ).
It is primarily concerned with setting goals related to strategic
organizational objectives and improving performance at work
(
Moen and Skaalvik, 2009 ; Athanasopoulou and Dopson, 2018 ).
Previous meta-analyses
De Meuse et al. (2009) conducted the ﬁrst review of studies on
executive coaching outcomes and assessed its eﬀectiveness using a
meta-analytic approach. Only six of the 12 studies used external
coaches and a methodological design that provided pre- and post-
data. Their ﬁndings point to positive eﬀects of executive coaching,
ranging from improved individual skills and behaviors to increased
team performance. However, their meta-analysis found a lack of
consistency in the impact of executive coaching due to the speciﬁc
content area being coached. They suggested that the outcomes may
vary based on the context and that there may even be negative
outcomes in some situations.
Theeboom et al. (2014), in a subsequent meta-analysis,
highlighted the need for deﬁning relevant outcomes dimensions
for executive coaching. They reported that executive coaching
has signiﬁcant positive eﬀects on ﬁve outcomes suggested to be
theoretically and practically relevant, which can ﬁt under three
main branches: cognitive, aﬀective, and behavioral (
Fontes and
Dello Russo, 2021 ). Nevertheless, the large eﬀect size they found
may have been partly due to the inclusion of diﬀerent research
designs and the shortage of rigorous studies available. For this
reason, the same outcomes—performance, wellbeing, attitude,
coping, and goal attainment—were investigated in a meta-analysis
conducted by
Burt and Talati (2017) using only randomized control
trial studies. It should be noted that, even though the authors refer
to executive coaching in their meta-analysis, also studies that used
life coaching were included, such as studies conducted by
Green
et al. (2006) and Spence and Grant (2007).
Another framework for executive coaching outcomes was
proposed and examined meta-analytically by Jones et al. (2016).
Their meta-analysis, which included studies using diﬀerent
research designs, indicated that coaching positively aﬀects skill-
based, aﬀective, and individual-level outcomes, with a larger
eﬀect size ( d = 0.5) for individual-level results.
Sonesh et al.
(2015) conducted a meta-analysis that explored a diﬀerent
three-dimension framework, consisting of relationship outcomes,
coachee outcomes, and organizational outcomes. Their ﬁndings
suggested that coaching is an eﬀective development tool that
contributes especially to improving the coachee outcome related
to the behavioral change dimension. Although both meta-analyses
reported positive eﬀects of coaching, the results have likely been
inﬂuenced by the inclusion of correlational design studies (
Sonesh
et al., 2015 ) and studies that used both internal and external
coaches ( Jones et al., 2016 ). Internal coaches are employees of the
organization who provide coaching to other employees with whom
they do not have formal authority. In contrast, external coaches are
engaged by the organization based on a contractual agreement for
speciﬁc coaching hours with speciﬁc employees.
Present study
To evaluate the relative strength of executive coaching on
diﬀerent types of outcomes—the key aim of our study—we propose
a classiﬁcation based on the taxonomy that
Bosco et al. (2015)
developed. This hierarchical variable taxonomy allows to code
and analyze the eﬀect sizes (ES) to provide results on the extent
to which Cohen’s ES benchmarks reﬂect the omnibus distribution
of ﬁndings commonly investigated in applied psychology research
and which benchmarks vary across bivariate relation types
(e.g., attitude–intention vs. attitude–behavior). The taxonomy
resulted from a content-coding scheme created inductively and
covers all major areas of industrial–organizational psychology,
organizational behavior, and human resource management. In
total, the taxonomy includes 4,869 levels nodes (i.e., variable names
or category names), 11 ﬁrst-level nodes (person characteristics,
attitudes/evaluations, behaviors, organizational characteristics,
contextual characteristics, miscellaneous, intentions, dyad/group
characteristics, HR practices, cognitions, and occupational
characteristics), which branch to second-level nodes, third-level
nodes, and so forth It presents what a variable represents rather
than how it is used in the studies. An example of hierarchical
classiﬁcation used in the taxonomy developed by
Bosco et al.
(2015) is the variable transformative leadership located as a
ﬁfth-level node, where level one is the variable “behaviors, ” level
two is the variable “as an employee, ” level three is the variable
“leadership, ” and level four is the variable “relations behavior.”
The taxonomy oﬀers the possibility to extract eﬀect sizes at

many diﬀerent levels of generality by zooming in on each of the
broad categories.
Bosco et al.’s (2015) analyses were based on
a database of 1,660 unique articles containing 25,891 variables,
their associated eﬀect sizes, and existing typologies in applied
psychology research (
Bosco et al., 2015 ). Thus, this study oﬀers
information that can be used to understand the relative importance
of the eﬀect sizes found in a particular study in relation to
others in the same and other domains. We believe that this
hierarchical taxonomy of variables, based on 147,328 correlations
among the above-mentioned variables reported in the Journal of
Applied Psychology and Personnel Psychology from 20 common
research domains, represents a valuable approach to coaching
outcomes classiﬁcation and evaluation of the relative coaching
eﬀect on diﬀerent levels of generality. The increased awareness
regarding eﬀect sizes across areas commonly researched in applied
psychology allows us to anticipate a typical context-speciﬁc ES
(e.g., for an attitude–behavior relation) and formulate predictors
for observed coaching outcomes variables. As Wilkinson and
the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference (
Wilkinson, 1999 , p.
599) noted, “We must stress again that reporting and interpreting
eﬀect sizes in the context of previously reported eﬀects is essential
to good research. It enables readers to evaluate the stability of
results across samples, designs, and analyses.” Thus, a consistent
classiﬁcation of outcomes is crucial.
An overview of the coaching outcomes reported in the reviewed
studies using the MetaBUS hierarchical structure is presented in
Figure 1. As an example of hierarchical structure, the ﬁrst level of
coaching outcomes includes ﬁve general types: behaviors, attitudes,
person characteristics, intentions, and cognitions. The second
classiﬁcation level includes sub-types such as leadership behaviors,
organizational attitudes, and traits. The level of speciﬁcity further
increases at the third classiﬁcation level, which includes the
individual outcomes variables reported in the reviewed studies
classiﬁed according to the classiﬁcation in
Bosco et al.’s (2015)
taxonomy. An example of a third-level outcomes variable is the goal
attainment reported in four studies included in the current meta-
analysis (
Grant et al., 2009 , 2010; Ballesteros-Sánchez et al., 2019 ;
Zanchetta et al., 2020 ). The deﬁnitions of the types of outcomes
included in the classiﬁcation and the variables related to each type
of outcome are listed in the
Appendix.
Hypotheses
The ﬁrst study hypothesis ﬂows from our classiﬁcation model
indicated in Figure 1. We expect to be able to show the eﬀect size
of executive coaching on overall outcomes. The previous meta-
analyses found a moderate to large eﬀect size for the overall
coaching eﬀectiveness. By including studies with rigorous research
design, and a sample similar to the one used in the previous
meta-analyses, we expect to ﬁnd strong evidence of coaching
eﬀectiveness. Therefore:
Hypothesis 1 . Executive coaching will demonstrate an overall
positive signiﬁcant eﬀect size across all outcomes.
Based on the outcome classiﬁcation proposed, we expected
a meta-analysis of rigorous methodological design studies to
be able to show the relative strength of executive coaching on
diﬀerent types of outcomes. Past research suggested that executive
coaching is related to sustainable positive changes (
Grant, 2012 )
and desirable behaviors ( Ladegard and Gjerde, 2014 ; McGonagle
et al., 2014 ; Nicolau and Constantin, 2021 ). Executive coaching was
also associated with changes in attitudes, such as organizational
commitment (
Fontes and Dello Russo, 2021 ), and personality traits,
such as core self-evaluations ( McGonagle et al., 2014 ). However,
attitudes and personality traits have been considered to persist
despite attempts at change. A recent review on attitudes change
found a small eﬀect size ( d = 0.22) for the attitude change based on
interventions or messages delivered at a particular time (
Albarracin
and Shavitt, 2018 ), while interventions associated with marked
changes in personality trait measures over time indicated a medium
eﬀect ( d = 0.37) in a recent systematic review (
Roberts et al., 2017 ).
Previous meta-analyses indicated that the coachee behavioral
change improvements were signiﬁcantly larger than attitudinal
changes (
Sonesh et al., 2015 ), and the coaching outcomes represent
the translation of learning through to performance beneﬁts ( Jones
et al., 2016 ); therefore, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2 : The relative strength of executive coaching on
behavioral outcomes will be stronger compared to (a) attitude and
(b) person characteristics outcomes.
Furthermore, executive coaching measurement usually relates
to the managers’ and organizations’ bottom-line performance
(
Athanasopoulou and Dopson, 2018 ). In our classiﬁcation,
performance behaviors comprised goal attainment outcomes.
Several studies have shown that coaching is associated with
signiﬁcant progress toward self-set goals (
Grant et al., 2009 ; Grant,
2010; Ballesteros-Sánchez et al., 2019 ; Zanchetta et al., 2020 ).
Moreover, when the coach guides managers through exploring
their potential for development and optimal functioning, these
managers usually deﬁne speciﬁc goals, explore internal and
external resources, and ﬁnd speciﬁc actions to achieve them
(
Schunk, 1995; Whitmore, 2002). Thus, behaviors include cognitive
activities, such as goal strategy and adopting new behaviors, which
also improve during coaching (
Finn, 2007 ; Moen and Federici,
2012). The development of the alliance between the coach and
coachee may also support behavioral modeling translated into the
manager’s leadership behaviors, such as openness to consultation
and compassion (
Kochanowski et al., 2010 ; McGonagle et al.,
2020). However, executive coaching is a solution-focused goal-
oriented process ( Grant et al., 2009 ). Moreover, the hierarchical
taxonomy developed by Bosco et al. (2015) based on eﬀect sizes
indicates that the performance behaviors (e.g., task performance)
as an employee are better predicted than leadership behaviors
(e.g., relations or change behaviors). Thus, we expect performance
behaviors to be highly impacted in the coaching process. Therefore,
we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 3 : The relative strength of coaching on behavioral
performance outcomes will be stronger compared to (a) behavioral
leadership and (b) behavioral cognitive activities.
Potential moderators
Several moderators of coaching eﬀectiveness have been
suggested, such as coach background, coaching model, type of

coach (external or internal), and the number of coaching sessions.
For most of these potential moderators, the lack of data reported in
the reviewed studies prevented us from including them in the meta-
analysis. For example, regarding coaching methods, we evaluated
the methods reported in the included studies, such as positive
psychology coaching, Goal-Reality-Options-Will (GROW), and
cognitive-behavioral developmental coaching. Several of these
methods’ components, such as setting the coaching goal, deﬁning
strategies, designing actions for achieving the goal, and identifying
resources or strengths, and overlap. Therefore, we concluded that
there are no clear distinctions among them. Two related aspects
of coaching could be included, i.e., the number of coaching
sessions and the overall length of the coaching program. Research
examining these possible moderators is limited and sometimes
contradictory. For example, some meta-analyses suggested that the
number of coaching sessions or the overall longevity of coaching

Nicolau et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum
interventions did not signiﬁcantly impact the executive coaching
outcomes (
Theeboom et al., 2014 ; Jones et al., 2016 ), while others
showed a signiﬁcant moderating eﬀect of the number of coaching
sessions (
Sonesh et al., 2015 ). Authors have suggested that even a
one-time coaching session is eﬀective ( Bright and Crockett, 2012 ).
It is possible that executive coaching may have an immediate
eﬀect by directing managers’ resources and focusing on clarifying
the actions that are needed to increase performance (
Moen and
Skaalvik, 2009; Bright and Crockett, 2012 ; Peláez Zuberbuhler et al.,
2020). In their meta-analysis, Sonesh et al. (2015) suggested that
the complexity and diﬃculty of the coaching goals may impact
the number of coaching sessions. As participants acquired new
behaviors and competencies, they inevitably developed feelings of
self-eﬃcacy, goal-focused orientation, and positive aﬀect, which,
once inﬂuenced, continue to increase over time, generating a
“prophylactic eﬀect” (
Finn, 2007 ; Grant, 2010 ). Given these
considerations, we did not expect unambiguous eﬀects of the
number of sessions and length of the coaching program on
the coaching outcomes, and we did not formulate a hypothesis
regarding these moderation analyses.
Method
Literature search and inclusion criteria
In this study, we focus on executive coaching as a supportive
relationship provided by an external professional coach and a
manager with authority and responsibility in an organizational
context, excluding all other coaching or developmental practices
(e.g., life coaching, internal/managerial coaching, and mentoring).
To identify relevant published and unpublished studies (including
doctoral theses), science databases were searched (SAGE Journals
Online, Taylor and Francis, Science-Direct, PsycINFO, Google
Scholar, Emerald, Research Gate, ProQuest, and ICF Research
Portal) using the following keywords: “executive coaching, ”
“leadership coaching, ” “managerial coaching, ” “coaching” in
combination with “organizational performance.” We additionally
manually reviewed the reference lists of all publications identiﬁed
in the database search and the studies cited in the previous meta-
analyses (i.e.,
De Meuse et al., 2009 ; Theeboom et al., 2014 ;
Sonesh et al., 2015 ; Jones et al., 2016 ; Burt and Talati, 2017 )
and included the relevant studies. The Preferred Reporting Items
guided this extensive literature search for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA;
Liberati et al., 2009 , see Figure 2).
We assessed the studies for inclusion based on the following
criteria: (a) the executive coaching intervention matched Kilburg’s
(1996: p. 142) deﬁnition; (b) an external coach led the executive
coaching intervention in a one-to-one session in an organizational
setting; (c) the published or unpublished study was in English;
(d) the study empirically investigated the relationship between the
intervention and the executive coaching outcomes for the client; (e)
the study used a between-subject design with a pre-post-test and
control group and reported suﬃcient statistical data such as group
sample sizes, means and standard deviation for each group.
The main reason for not including studies that used internal
coaches was to control for eﬀects that may contaminate the overall
result of coaching eﬀectiveness.
Jones et al. (2016) suggested
that the eﬀects of coaching by internal coaches had a stronger
eﬀect compared to external coaches. Moreover, the research on
mentoring has shown that a mentee’s behavior can be aﬀected
during the session when the mentor has formal authority over the
mentee (
Mullen, 1994 ). Thus, we decided to include only studies
that used external coaches.
The current meta-analysis did not include a study if the data
needed to establish eﬀect sizes were unavailable.
The ﬁrst two authors independently selected potentially eligible
articles. The ﬁnal set of records was selected by reading the
full texts of all articles that passed an initial screening of titles
and abstracts. There was a 95.3% initial interrater agreement for
screening full texts.
The disagreements about screening and selection were resolved
by consensus.
The selection process yielded a total of 20 studies that met
the selection criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (see
Figure 2 and Table 1). All studies included in the ﬁnal analysis are
indicated with an asterisk in our list of references.
Research model
The statistical model used to conduct the meta-analysis was
a random eﬀects model, which permits that the true eﬀect
sizes vary from study to study based on both the independent
variable and the variability and diﬀerences in the research sample
(
Hedges and Cooper, 1994 ; Borenstein et al., 2009 ). The classical
Cochran Q statistic and the I2 statistic, as proposed by Higgins
and Thompson (2002), were calculated to test for heterogeneity
between studies. The Q statistics provide a test of signiﬁcance
for between-study heterogeneity, while the value of I2 represents
the proportion of between-study variance in eﬀect sizes to
between-study heterogeneity (
Borenstein et al., 2009 ). When the
value for I2 is close to or above 50%, moderating variables
are considered to be present ( Higgins and Thompson, 2002 ).
Moderator analysis was conducted using sub-group analysis when
the moderators were categorical and meta-regression when the
moderators were continuous.
Outcome categories and moderators
The ﬁrst two authors independently codded the outcomes. The
disagreements about outcomes coding were resolved by consensus.
The categorization of outcomes was conducted in two steps. In the
ﬁrst step, we assigned the studies to one of the following general
executive coaching outcomes categories: behaviors, attitudes,
person characteristics, cognitions, and intentions. In the second
step, we distinguished 10 sub-types categories based on the
taxonomy developed by
Bosco et al. (2015).
We eliminated two general types of outcomes that could not
be tested because of the limited number of studies that included
them: cognition and intentions. Several studies selected for the
meta-analysis included a broad range of outcomes within the same
outcome category (e.g., measures of leading and eﬀectiveness both
fall within the behavior category). For those studies, we examined

the individual eﬀect sizes for each category, and an overall eﬀect
size per study was included for each outcome category. All reported
outcomes in the primary studies are based on self-reports and not
on observations of others (e.g., subordinates and peers), test results,
or measures of job performance because other measures were either
not reported or reported only in a few studies.
In addition to the meta-analysis of the executive coaching
outcomes, we investigated whether the length of the coaching
program and the number of sessions moderate the eﬀectiveness of
executive coaching.
Eﬀect sizes, methodology, and database
Similar to the previous meta-analyses, the overall weighted
eﬀect size was calculated using the
Hedges and Olkin (1984)
approach. The post-pre eﬀect size from the control group was
subtracted from the post-pre eﬀect size for the treatment group.
To standardize the mean diﬀerence between the pre- and post-
measures of coaching outcomes, the eﬀect sizes of the original
studies were transformed to a variation of Cohen’s d, the Hedges’
g eﬀect size. This conservative approach allows for statistical
correction of biases due to small sample sizes, measurement error,
and range restriction to avoid overestimates (
Hedges, 1981; Hedges
et al., 2009 ). It provides a conservative estimate of the conﬁdence
interval used for calculating the statistical signiﬁcance of eﬀect sizes
(
Johnson et al., 1995 ).
We used Biostat’s Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program
(CMA) version 2 ( Borenstein et al., 2005 ). This application is
based on the approach to meta-analysis proposed by Hedges and
Olkin (1984). CMA oﬀers the advantages of handling multiple data
entry formats, the detection of between-study heterogeneity, and an
intuitive approach to sensitivity analysis (
Borenstein, 2005).

any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. All data,

Results
Aggregated eﬀect sizes across all studies
and outcomes
Table 2 contains the weighted eﬀect sizes (aggregated across
outcomes) per study. We found an overall moderate weighted
eﬀect size for all outcomes, reﬂecting an advantage of coaching
over control groups [Hedges’ g = 0.43, 95% CI, 0.35–0.50, p
< 0.001 [95% PI ( − 0.05 to 0.92)]. Hypothesis 1 was clearly
supported. The results show that coaching has a signiﬁcant positive
eﬀect on the overall coachee outcomes. The results also indicate
that heterogeneity was statistically signiﬁcant and medium in
magnitude ( Q = 100.64; p < 0.001; I2 = 61.24). Therefore, we
continued this analysis by exploring various moderators for the
positive eﬀect of executive coaching.
Eﬀect sizes per general type, sub-type, and
speciﬁc outcome
Table 3 presents the eﬀect sizes for coaching interventions
on the three general types of outcomes: behaviors, attitudes, and
person characteristics. The eﬀect of coaching was signiﬁcant and
positive for all three categories. The eﬀect sizes of coaching on
behaviors, attitudes, and person characteristics were all positive
(behaviors: Hedges’ g = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.41–1.05, p < 0.001;
attitudes: Hedges’ g = 0.34, 95% CI, 0.24–0.44, p < 0.001; person
characteristics: Hedges’ g = 0.51, 95% CI, 0.39–0.64, p < 0.001).
We compared the eﬀects between these three categories. The results
indicated a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between attitude and behavioral
outcomes categories ( Q = 5.167, p < 0.05) and attitudes and person
characteristics categories ( Q = 4.205, p < 0.05). These results
supported Hypothesis 2a regarding the relative eﬀect of coaching
on behavioral outcomes compared with attitudes and person
characteristics outcomes. We also observed low heterogeneity in
the results for attitudes and person characteristics (non-signiﬁcant
Q values and low I2). However, we found signiﬁcant heterogeneity
for behavior ( Q = 60.48, p < 0.001; I2 = 81.81), which suggested
possible moderators.
The results for the relative eﬀects of coaching on behavioral
outcome sub-categories yielded a larger eﬀect size for the
cognitive activities outcomes than for performance outcomes and
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between cognitive activities and leadership
activities (Q = 10.388, p < 0.01). Hypothesis 2a was not supported.
Table 4 presents the eﬀect sizes of the coaching intervention on sub-
categories.
We computed a series of analyses for some speciﬁc outcomes
(see Table 5). Although most studies involved the measurement of
multiple outcomes, only a few of them were included in a suﬃcient
number of studies to allow us to do meaningful meta-analytic
calculations. Thus, we found signiﬁcant and positive eﬀects on
self-eﬃcacy (Hedges’ g = 0.31, p < 0.05), goal attainment (Hedges’
g = 0.32, p < 0.001), psychological capital (Hedges’ g = 0.83, p <
0.001), and resilience (Hedges’g = 0.57, p < 0.001). The aggregated
eﬀect size for job satisfaction was positive but not signiﬁcant
(Hedges’g = 0.36, p = 0.17).
Moderator analysis
We tested the moderating role of the length of the coaching
program and the number of sessions for the three outcome
categories (behavior, attitudes, and person characteristics). The
results are displayed in
Table 6. A series of meta-regressions showed
that the length of the coaching program was a signiﬁcant moderator
only for the attitudes category (coeﬃcient = 0.01, se = 0.008,
p = 0.03). The longer the program was, the greater the eﬀect size.
The number of sessions was not a signiﬁcant moderator for any
outcome category.
Publication bias
Publication bias was assessed via visual inspection of funnel
plots and the Egger bias test (
Egger et al., 1997 ). The Egger test
was signiﬁcant ( p < 0.001). Based on this result, we conducted
further sensitivity analyses. Firstly, using the trim and ﬁll method,
we found that by adding 29 new eﬀect sizes in the meta-analysis,
the aggregated eﬀect size would decrease from 0.43 to 0.27. Even
with this decrease, the aggregated eﬀect size would remain similar.
Secondly, by using Orwin’s fail-safe N method (
Orwin, 1983 ), we
found that to ﬁnd a trivial eﬀect size ( <0.10), the addition of 332
studies with an eﬀect size lower than 0.10 would be necessary.
Concluding, we found no publication bias in this study.
Discussion
The purpose of the current meta-analysis was to evaluate
coaching eﬀectiveness by investigating its eﬀect on the overall
outcomes studied and its relative strength on diﬀerent coaching
outcome types by systematically reviewing the existing RCT studies
on coaching eﬀectiveness at work. Additionally, the study examined
whether the number of coaching sessions and overall length of
the coaching program moderated its eﬀectiveness. To evaluate the
executive coaching intervention and multiple types of outcomes,
we proposed a classiﬁcation based on previously used taxonomy in
applied psychology. Hypothesis 1 was conﬁrmed. We found strong
evidence for a signiﬁcant moderate eﬀect of executive coaching on
overall coaching outcomes dimensions reported in the reviewed
studies. We found support for Hypothesis 2a and Hypothesis 2b.
The results indicated that the relative strength of coaching was
higher on behavioral than on attitude and person characteristics
outcomes, with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between behavior and
attitude outcomes and between attitude and person characteristics
outcomes. Hypotheses 3a and 3b were not conﬁrmed. The
analyses indicated a large eﬀect size for performance behaviors
and behavioral-cognitive activities and a moderate eﬀect size for
leadership behaviors, with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence only between
behavioral cognitive activities and leadership behavior. The results
show no moderating eﬀects of the number of coaching sessions

and the length of the coaching program, except for a positive
relationship between the coaching program’s length and coaching
eﬀectiveness for the attitude outcome. In summary, our meta-
analytic ﬁndings indicate that executive coaching is an eﬀective tool
resulting mainly in changes in individuals’ behaviors, especially in
cognitive behaviors, with no conditional eﬀect from the number of
sessions or the length of the coaching program.
Contribution to theory and future research
Our results are consistent with previous ﬁndings in the
executive coaching literature about the overall eﬀect size and the
varying eﬀect sizes for diﬀerent outcomes (
Theeboom et al., 2014 ;
Jones et al., 2016 ; Burt and Talati, 2017). We found clear indications
that the relative strength of coaching was higher on behavioral
outcomes than on other outcomes categories. Considering the
stability of attitudes and person characteristics, the lower eﬀect
sizes reported in our study can be expected. However, our ﬁndings
on attitudes are likely to throw light on the contextual factors
that contribute to coaching eﬀectiveness. Improvements in work-
related attitudes, such as job satisfaction and wellbeing, suggest that
coaching may facilitate a better alignment between the individual
and the organization, ultimately creating a positive impact
on coachees’ organization-related attitudes and the perception
of coaching as an aid from the organization for individual
development (
Fontes and Dello Russo, 2021 ). The executives may
experience positive work-related attitudes due to the perceived
support provided by the organization that sponsors them with
coaching (
McGonagle et al., 2020 ). Managers who receive executive
coaching may develop a stronger sense of control over their
outcomes and workplace experience, resulting in an improved
attitude and enhanced personal characteristics.
We suggest that future research continues to assess the impact
of the organizational context on executive coaching outcomes. It
would be interesting to explore if a higher alignment between
change initiatives at the organizational level and managers’ goals
or increased support and resources from the supervisor would
positively impact coaching outcomes.
We found conﬁrmation that cognitive activities, such as
openness to new behavior and goal strategy, represent the most
impacted behavioral aspect. This is important because behavioral
change is the most common objective of coaching engagements
(
Sonesh et al., 2015 ). Our ﬁndings suggest that although not the
primary focus of executive coaching, cognitive outcomes, such as
developing planning and goal strategy, are essential in promoting
behavioral change. The coach’s feedback and support, and the focus
on planning, can lead the coachee to develop an action plan, ﬁnd
personal resources, and identify strategies to overcome possible
obstacles (
Fontes and Dello Russo, 2021 ). The large eﬀect size
(g = 1.28) for cognitive activities diﬀers considerably from recent
meta-analyses reported ( g = 0.22; Sonesh et al., 2015 ). However,
these results should be interpreted cautiously, given the small
number of studies included in the analysis ( k = 3).
While our meta-analysis provides an insight into the
relative eﬀects of executive coaching on the diﬀerent types of
behavior outcomes, we were unable to explore speciﬁc behavior
relationship constructs (e.g., adopting new behaviors, leader trust
in subordinates, rational persuasion, and inspirational appeal) or
task-oriented ones (e.g., goal types) due to a lack of primary studies.
The coaching ﬁeld would beneﬁt from deﬁning outcomes by other
considerations, essential for the behavioral outcome distinction
given the variability in its eﬀect sizes between studies. Moreover,
future research may investigate how the coaching and control
groups changed in diﬀerent behavioral outcomes over time using
multiple post-measures to establish whether executive coaching
facilitates consistent change.
Our meta-analysis revealed signiﬁcant and positive eﬀects of
executive coaching on speciﬁc outcomes such as goal attainment,
self-eﬃcacy, psychological capital, and resilience. Several
mechanisms may be responsible for these improvements. Firstly,
goalsetting at the starting phase of the coaching process aﬀects goal
attainment through direction, energy, persistence, and improved
task strategies (
Locke and Latham, 2002 ). Secondly, executive
coaching may encompass psychosocial-support dimensions such

as self-conﬁdence or emotional support for executives’ role distress
(
Nicolau and Constantin, 2021 ). It allows one to reﬂect on attempts
and errors, gain awareness of personal resources and strengths
(
Rank and Gray, 2017 ), and strive for mastery experiences,
leading to improved self-eﬃcacy. By focusing on strengths and
positive episodes, the reﬂection would increase conﬁdence in
development and change, the ability to identify options, optimism
about the change, and resilience when confronted with obstacles
(
Fontes and Dello Russo, 2021 ), thus improving psychological
capital. It boasts a solution-focused reﬂection and strategy with a
signiﬁcant impact on increasing resources and a sense of control
through planning, which has the potential to reduce stress and
enhance resilience (
Grant et al., 2009 ; Nicolau and Constantin,
2021).
Nevertheless, executive coaching may exhibit the strongest
relationship with these speciﬁc outcomes because they are assessed
holistically, especially when assessing goal attainment (
Graßmann
et al., 2020 ). For example, goal achievements may depend on
the manager’s tasks, team dynamics, and organizational support.
Considering that organizations sponsored the executives with
coaching for personal development in the reviewed studies, we
might assume that the managers had perceived high contextual
support, thus remaining committed and engaged to their goals
(
Fontes and Dello Russo, 2021 ). Future research should investigate
the impact of perceived low organizational support, destructive
leadership, or disruptive team dynamics on coaching outcomes.
This study did not focus on the eﬀectiveness of speciﬁc
elements coaches involve in their coaching engagement. Past
research suggested that coaching is a complex dynamic change
process rather than a linear input-output mechanism (
Erdös
and Ramseyer, 2021 ; Wasylyshyn, 2022 ; de Haan and Nilsson,
2023) where relational coaching processes signiﬁcantly impact the
outcomes. Future research may want to investigate some coaching
processes that lead to change, such as the goal type, the coachee’s
engagement during sessions, or the perceived coach’s support
impact on executive coaching eﬀectiveness.

Moderator analyses resulted in only one signiﬁcant moderator,
the length of the coaching program, and only for the attitudes
dimension. Although the length of the coaching programs may
heighten the opportunity to identify resources and strategies for
goal attainment, it is unclear what the moderating eﬀect means,
as we did not ﬁnd diﬀerences in the number of coaching sessions.
A possible explanation could be related to the fact that attitudes
and beliefs that are consistent with other values are likely to persist,
and defensive cognitive processes can be involved to protect the
attitudes and beliefs, especially when motivation is low (
Hart et al.,
2009). This means managers who receive coaching might need
more time to change their attitudes regardless of the number of
sessions. Future research should investigate how the length of the
coaching program may alter or enhance the coaching outcomes.
Furthermore, researchers should provide more details related to the
goal type, motivation, and organizational context to allow future
analyses of other possible moderators.
The eﬀect sizes observed across diﬀerent types of outcomes
allow for identifying the research area that lags. As described
earlier, we eliminated from the analyses two types of outcomes,
intentions and cognitions, and subtypes of outcomes, such as
goals and attitudes, because of the limited number of studies
that included them. We propose that for coaching research
to continue to advance, these are areas where progress is
not being made and thus constitute important directions for
future studies.
Contribution to the coaching practice
We found a robust relationship between executive coaching
and all the outcome dimensions investigated, suggesting that
executive coaching is an eﬀective developmental tool from which
all organizations may beneﬁt. As an implication for practice, we
suggest that organizations use executive coaching as a valuable
tool for managers in any context, especially during organizational
change, given both business and human costs (
Grant et al., 2009 ).
Our study points to behavior cognitive activities as the main
outcome categories impacted by coaching. Thus, organizations
may consider using coaching for managers involved in planning
and strategizing processes, such as product and project managers.
Moreover, designing coaching interventions that help managers
identify goal strategies and support developmental planning in
their roles and relationships at work could have signiﬁcant
consequences at the organizational level (
O’Connor and Cavanagh,
2013).
Considering the possible change in attitudes and person
characteristics, we suggest that the strength of the coaching
Frontiers in Psychology /one.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org
<<<PAGE=14>>>
Nicolau et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum
on these dimensions could be stronger if coaches take a more
systemic approach and facilitate aligning the manager’s goals
with the organization’s strategy to enhance their positive attitudes
toward the organization and, thus, motivation and engagement in
goal achievement.
We found conﬁrmation that the number of coaching sessions
does not impact the coaching eﬀectiveness. This suggests that the
coachees may adjust the number of sessions based on their needs
and the complexity of the goals. This coregulation phenomenon
was supported in psychotherapy by research that found that the
patients showed similar gains regardless of the duration of the
treatment (
Stiles et al., 2015 ). Therefore, we suggest that allowing
the coachees to schedule their own appointments rather than
scheduling regular (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) appointments might
signiﬁcantly reduce “no-shows” or session cancellations without
eﬀects on coaching eﬀectiveness.
Limitations
Although many of the methodological limitations of previous
meta-analytic studies were addressed, some notable ones remained.
Firstly, the coaching interventions, measures, and outcomes across
the included studies varied considerably, which limited the number
of direct comparisons that could be made for a meta-analytic
synthesis. Some of the ﬁndings are based on a relatively small
number of studies (k = 3), and such estimates are likely to be
less stable (
Borenstein et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, we could not
analyze the relationship with executive coaching for some outcome
dimensions, such as cognitions and intentions, or potential
moderators, such as coaching background and coaching method,
because of missing studies or data in the reviewed studies. Although
there was no evidence for publication bias and the inclusion of the
20 studies was above the minimum for meta-analysis (
Sterne et al.,
2008), further research is still required to substantiate these results
and to explore the uncovered outcomes dimensions and possible
moderators. Secondly, even though we provide insights into the
impact of executive coaching on behaviors, attitudes, and person
characteristic dimensions, we were unable to analyze speciﬁc
outcomes (e.g., leading, engagement, job stress, and turnover
intentions) or speciﬁc achievement goal frameworks due to a lack of
primary studies. Thirdly, we could not measure the possible impact
of executive coaching on other people within an organization due
to the focus on individual outcomes of coaching in the studies
included in our analysis (
Grant et al., 2009 ). Similarly, we could
not include the possible impact of context factors in facilitating or
thwarting the coaching outcomes (
Fontes and Dello Russo, 2021 ).
Fourthly, the authors of the reviewed studies have investigated the
coaching outcomes using a variety of measurements that could have
inﬂuenced the results and may have depended on other variables
(
Graßmann et al., 2020 ).
Conclusion
The current meta-analysis strongly contributes to providing
evidence that executive coaching is an eﬀective intervention
in organizations, especially for behavioral change. While the
literature shows that the recipients of executive coaching
typically are leaders (
De Meuse et al., 2009 ; MacKie, 2014 ;
de Haan and Nilsson, 2023 ), this meta-analysis has brought
signiﬁcant support for the eﬀectiveness of coaching that
organizations may consider using for other groups of employees,
such as production employees, to support their personal
development, mainly due to its impact on behavioral cognitive
activities and performance behaviors such as goal strategy and
goal attainment.
Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis has made
important contributions to our understanding of coaching
eﬀectiveness. Firstly, it proposes a way to structure the large variety
of outcomes using a systemic approach for outcomes classiﬁcation
based on existing typologies in applied psychology research (
Bosco
et al., 2015 ). This meta-analysis provides a more inclusive and
robust hierarchic classiﬁcation framework for coaching outcomes
and points to areas less explored by coaching research. It highlights
future research directions, such as intentions, goals, cognitions,
and attributions. Secondly, it investigates the relative eﬀect of
executive coaching on diﬀerent types of coaching outcomes
reported in RCT studies. Unlike the previous meta-analyses, it
includes only the studies on executive coaching in organizational
settings with rigorous research designs that allow controlling
for a range of threats to internal and external validity (
Grant
et al., 2009 ; Grant, 2012 ) and substantially reduce same-source
biases, Hawthorne eﬀects, and other false positives. Thirdly, our
study oﬀers evidence regarding the distribution of eﬀect sizes
across diﬀerent coaching outcomes and compares the strengths
of coaching on diﬀerent types of outcomes to assess what is
most impacted. Fourthly, it explores possible conditions for
the relative eﬀect of coaching on diﬀerent types of outcomes,
providing evidence for the importance of these conditions for
coaching eﬀectiveness.
Overall, our study supports the further development of
coaching research and practice that can be used to identify
the underlying mechanisms and processes by which coaching
interventions are successful.
