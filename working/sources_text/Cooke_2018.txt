REVIEW Open Access
Uncovering the mechanisms of research
capacity development in health and social
care: a realist synthesis
Jo Cooke 1, Paolo Gardois 2 and Andrew Booth 3*
Abstract
Background: Research capacity development (RCD) is considered fundamental to closing the evidence –practice
gap, thereby contributing to health, wealth and knowledge for practice. Numerous frameworks and models have
been proposed for RCD, but there is little evidence of what works for whom and under what circumstances. There
is a need to identify mechanisms by which candidate interventions or clusters of interventions might achieve RCD
and contribute to societal impact, thereby proving meaningful to stakeholders.
Methods: A realist synthesis was used to develop programme theories for RCD. Structured database searches were
conducted across seven databases to identify papers examining RCD in a health or social care context (1998 – 2013).
In addition, citation searches for 10 key articles (citation pearls) were conducted across Google Scholar and Web of
Science. Of 214 included articles, 116 reported on specif ic interventions or initiat ives or their evaluation. The
remaining 98 articles were discussion papers or explicitly sought to make a theoretical contribution. A core
set of 36 RCD theoretical and conceptual papers were selected and analysed to generate mechanisms that
map across macro contexts (individual, team, organisational, network). Data were extracted by means of ‘If-Then’
statements into an Excel spreadsheet. Models and frameworks were deconstructed into their original elements.
Results: Eight overarching programme theories were identified featuring mechanisms that were triggered across
multiple contexts. Three of these fulfilled a symbolic role in signalling the importance of RCD (e.g. positive role models,
signal importance, make a difference), whilst the remainder were more functional (e.g. liberate talents, release resource,
exceed sum of parts, learning by doing and co-production of knowledge). Outcomes from one mechanism produced
changes in context to stimulate mechanisms in other activities. The eight programme theories were validated with
findings from 10 systematic reviews (2014 –2017).
Conclusions: This realist synthesis is the starting point for constructing an RCD framework shaped by these
programme theories. Future work is required to further test and refine these findings against empirical data
from intervention studies.

Background
National policy and financial investment across the globe
indicates overwhelming support for building research cap-
acity in healthcare systems. Enhanced capacity is believed
to promote problem solving [ 1], reduce the gap between
evidence and practice [ 2, 3], and promote health gains [ 4].
It is considered a powerful and cost-effective way of ad-
vancing healthcare and development [ 5] and, if done well,
can improve collaboration between high- and low-income
countries [ 1] and address health inequalities [ 6]. United
Kingdom policy highlights that the ‘best’ health research
promotes the health and wealth of the nation [ 7].
Despite overwhelming support in the research litera-
ture and policy documents, research capacity develop-
ment (RCD) is poorly defined, and conceptually elusive
[8]. Undertaking a conceptual review of the literature,
Condell and Begley define research capacity-building, a
component of RCD, as “a funded, dynamic intervention
operationalised through a range of foci and levels to aug-
ment ability to carry out research or achieve objectives in
the field of research over the long-term, with aspects of
social change as an ultimate outcome ” [8]. This defin-
ition highlights that RCD is complex and operates at a
number of structural levels, including individual, team,
organisational and within networks [ 9], and includes a
range of ‘interventions’ [10] or foci of activity. RCD ac-
tivities are often conducted in parallel and can be inter-
related. Research training, fellowships and mentorship
schemes, for example, can be planned and evaluated
separately, but in practice are often linked [ 11] and add
value to each other. RCD ‘interventions’ may include
processes such as priority-setting [ 12], but equally can
incorporate structural changes in organisations, for ex-
ample, developing an information technology infrastruc-
ture [ 13, 14]. Structural and process interventions can
link to outcomes of their own but can also produce a
fertile environment for other RCD initiatives. Collect-
ively and separately, they achieve the common goal of
stimulating ‘more research done well ’.
The challenge of understanding RCD and how it oper-
ates is compounded by the fact that RCD is often seen
as a means to an end [ 9] rather than an end in itself.
From this perspective, means are the skills and structural
enhancements that enable research to be conducted with
the ultimate ‘end’ or goal of RCD in healthcare being to
change practice and systems to improve health [ 13]. Set-
ting the criteria for impact to this level makes it even
more challenging to understand ‘what works ’ in RCD.
Although targeting improved health as the goal gives
more value and ‘meaning’to RCD activity, it necessitates
long and convoluted causal chains, making it even more
difficult to attribute impact. It also requires consider-
ation of the nature and quality of how RCD interven-
tions are performed, whether they are ‘meaningful’ and
whether they can produce change in practice. Nuyens,
for example, suggests that how priority-setting is under-
taken influences how meaningful it is, and whether re-
search is subsequently used in practice [ 15].
The literature on RCD reflects its elusive and
chameleon-like quality and how difficult it is to measure
and attribute impact [ 16]. Reports and case studies of
RCD interventions in health do exist but evidence on
effectiveness is inconclusive. Many evaluations fall short
of being able to determine the impact on healthcare
systems and thus demonstrate meaningful RCD. Such
limitations may, in turn, reflect shortcomings in the the-
oretical underpinning of RCD interventions [ 16].
Further complexity is added when considering the re-
lationship between RCD and knowledge mobilisation
(KM). RCD focuses very much on empowering and en-
abling different levels of the health research system to
conduct research. KM focuses further downstream –
once the capacity is in place, to what extent can the re-
search that has been generated change practice? Many
health systems display an evolutionary or developmental
aspect to these activities; in the United Kingdom, for ex-
ample, antecedent investment in research and develop-
ment support units has started to deliver the capacity to
mobilise knowledge through networks such as the Col-
laborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research
and Care (CLAHRCs). However, typically, RCD and KM
co-exist and interact given that new requirements identi-
fied from KM will feed into subsequent requirements for
specific reconfigurations of research capacity.
In summary, RCD can be categorised as a complex
intervention, what Willis et al. describe as “a set of pur-
posefully coordinated components that target multiple
levels and sectors of a system, that operate both inde-
pendently and inter-dependently, and that interact in the
contexts in which they are implemented ” [17]. Realist ap-
proaches offer an ideal methodology for understanding,
evaluating and planning such interventions.
Numerous models suggest how RCD works [ 1, 9, 14,
18– 21]. However, few models address underlying mecha-
nisms for what works, and why, across a range of con-
texts, in achieving a meaningful impact on health
services and systems. No attempt has been undertaken
to link existing RCD models, nor to develop theories in
a systematic way from them.
The objective of this realist synthesis is to address
what are the mechanisms that support meaningful RCD
that are triggered across diverse contexts, specifically at
individual, team, organisation or network level, as de-
scribed in conceptual and theoretical papers? We aim
to isolate mechanisms that are activated across and
within diverse contexts in order to develop programme
theories that will identify and test causal chains in RCD
programmes.

Methods
This paper reports on a work package within a larger
programme of work on reviewing the RCD literature in
health and social care. The wider programme aims to ana-
lyse both the conceptual papers and intervention studies.
This paper reports on the first stage of this research,
namely a realist synthesis of theoretical and conceptual
papers to develop programme theory at a macro level. A
realist synthesis seeks to explain and unpack the mecha-
nisms by which an intervention works (or fails to work); it
seeks to advance a potential explanation, as opposed to a
definitive judgement, about how interventions (in this case
research capacity development activities) achieve their
outcomes [ 22]. By mechanisms we mean the responses
that the ‘active’components within an intervention stimu-
late, either individually or collectively, within participants.
We explore these mechanisms by first identifying an ac-
cessible explanation of how the intervention is understood
to work, known as a ‘programme theory’, derived from the
research literature, official documents or stakeholder
explanations.
A realist approach recognises that the context within
which an intervention is delivered is “complex, multi-fa-
ceted and dynamic ” [23]. It challenges the assumption,
implicit in conventional systematic review methodology,
that the same intervention will work in the same way in
different contexts. Realist logic seeks to articulate state-
ments along the lines of ‘IF Context A includes … THEN
Mechanisms X, Y, Z are activated LEADING TO Out-
come O 1’– these statements are technically known as
‘CMO Configurations’or ‘CMO chains’.
The work described in this study seeks to identify
mechanisms that are activated across a variety of con-
texts operating at different levels (individual, team, or-
ganisational, network) within the health research system
to achieve either desirable or unintended outcomes. Sub-
sequent work will seek to map evidence from empirical
studies to the theoretical framework. The realist synthe-
sis method was supported by systematic mapping meth-
odology. A core set of theoretical and conceptual papers
on RCD was analysed in order to generate mechanisms
and map these across macro contexts (individual, team,
organisational, network) in order to develop programme
theories.
Initial scoping of the literature
In 2005, a scoping review, Re:Cap – Identifying the
Evidence Base for Research Capacity Development in
Health and Social Care [ 10], was commissioned by the
National Coordinating Centre for Research Capacity De-
velopment, in partnership with the National Steering
Committee of Research and Development Support Units,
to “identify, map, and describe the literature available to
inform research capacity development (RCD) activities in
health and social care, and to inform the work of RDSUs
[Research and Development Support Units] ” (the then
United Kingdom regional research and development sup-
port units) [ 10]. A scoping review is “a preliminary assess-
ment of the potential size and scope of the available
research literature” [24] and does not seek to conduct for-
mal assessments of evidence quality. One component of
the scoping review sought to identify existing RCD
models, frameworks and theories. Four limitations were
identified for this component of the wider scoping review,
namely (1) models, frameworks and theories were derived
from a heterogeneous range of sources and disciplines
making comparison and specific application to health and
social care problematic, especially as some models origi-
nated from outside the context of research capacity; (2) no
recognised procedures existed for identifying models,
frameworks and theories in a systematic way; (3) time
constraints did not permit a formal attempt to examine an
empirical base for each identified model, framework or
theory; and (4) related to (3), there was limited opportun-
ity to link the theories identified to eight RCD activities
(Box 1) prioritised for the scoping review. Several years
later, two authors of the original scoping review (JC &
AB), working with a trained information specialist (PG),
therefore sought to return to the topic area to consolidate
opportunities identified from the quantity and characteris-
tics of the literature in order to extend the conceptual
thinking that underpins RCD.
A considerable body of literature describes models for
RCD together with evaluations of specific individual
RCD activities. However, none of the identified studies
sought to explore beneath the level of actual interven-
tions to examine the mechanisms by which interventions
might achieve their intended effects. We hypothesised
that some of these effects would be specific to the con-
text of research capacity.
Search strategy
Structured database searches were conducted across seven
databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ASSIA, CINAHL, ERIC,
PsycInfo, and Web of Science) to identify papers that
examined RCD in a health or social care context. Searches
were conducted across the period 1998 – 2013. In addition,
given the diversity of terminology, 10 key articles were
selected from the original Re:CAP review [ 10] and desig-
nated as ‘citation pearls ’.C i t a t i o ns e a r c h e sw e r et h e n
conducted across Google Scholar and Web of Science for
articles citing these conceptual works.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
For inclusion in the initial review project a paper should:
1. Describe an RCD model/theory/framework OR
Cooke et al. Health Research Policy and Systems  (2018) 16:93 Page 3 of 22
<<<PAGE=4>>>
2. Evaluate a model/theory/framework cited from
elsewhere OR
3. Report an evaluation of an intervention that was
based on or cites model/theory/framework
AND
4. Be specific to a health or social care setting
5. Be published in English between 1999 and 2013
Note that subsequent phases of the project required
validation and refreshment of the original dataset to ex-
tend coverage between 2014 and 2017. For details see
below.
Keywords
The Research question was formulated according to the
BeHeMoTH question structure [ 25]. This formulation is
specifically designed to help to specify theory-related lit-
erature searches, as follows:
Be – Behaviour of Interest: RCD (including eight
specific interventions: Prioritisation; Mentoring for
research; Research leadership; Research facilitation;
Research skills training; Funding (including bursaries
and fellowships); Networks and collaborations;
Infrastructure).
H – Health Context: Health and social care.
E – Exclusions: Capacity development for other
(non-research) purposes; Models of RCD not tried or
proposed for a health and social care context.
MoTh – Models or Theories: operationalised as a
generic ‘model* or theor* or concept* or framework* ’
strategy together with named models or theories if
required. Illustrative keywords are given in Table 1.
Key citation pearls
A list of 10 previous models identified for the Re:CAP
project [ 1, 6, 9, 14, 18– 21, 26, 27] (designated as ‘citation
pearls’) was searched in 2014 using Google Scholar, Web
of Science and Scopus. Supplementary search approaches
proved of particular importance given the significant
variation in terminology and the update role of the review.
In addition, reference lists of included articles were exam-
ined for additional references not retrieved by the database
keywords search. An updat e procedure was conducted,
specifically for systematic reviews, in December 2017 (see
the section Validation and refreshment of programme the-
ories below).
Date and language restrictions
Papers were published between 2000 and 2015. Only
English language papers were considered given the
intended target audience for the review findings.
Quality assessment
No accepted instruments have been developed to assess
the theoretical sufficiency of conceptual papers. Our
overall goal was interpretative (configurative), not aggre-
gative [ 28], so we did not exclude any studies based on
study quality alone. However, we did examine included
papers in relation to their perceived proximity to the
United Kingdom context for which we were producing
the review [ 29].
Data extraction
Data were extracted on author, year, country, context
and, where appropriate, RCD activity and study type. For
this work package, articles with RCD theories, models
and frameworks were used to extract causative relations
of components within them in the form of ‘If-Then’
statements. The level at which the activity was described

as taking place was also extracted (individual, team, or-
ganisation and network level). These data were extracted
into Excel sheets.
Data synthesis
Accessing the programme theories
Careful reading and re-reading of identified conceptual
papers was undertaken individually by two investigators
(AB, JC). Particular attention was focused on identifying
causal chains by which an RCD programme or specific
intervention might achieve either proximal (e.g. know-
ledge or skill gains) or long-term gains (i.e. improve-
ments in health, increases in wealth or the achievement
of an evidence-formed organisation or society). Data
were extracted as If-Then statements into an Excel
spreadsheet [ 30].
In cases of uncertainty, the If-Then statements, and
proposed causal links, were discussed within the team.
Chains of If-Then statements were constructed to yield
insights on overall generic RCD approaches. A further
complexity related to the level at which particular activ-
ities might be targeted, for example, at an individual,
team, organisation or network level. If-Then statements
were grouped by level of targeted intervention, with
mechanisms that occurred at more than one contextual
level being identified. In line with realist approaches, the
team reasoned that similarities in mechanism, as op-
posed to the actual activities themselves, would extend
across all levels of operations (context), to enable
programme theory building.
Validation and refreshment of programme theories
An essential feature of the realist synthesis method is the
process of validating the original programme theories
against a further independent dataset. Citation searches
were repeated for the 10 citation pearls in December 2017
and all reviews published between 2014 and 2017 meeting
the original inclusion criteria and exhibiting a recognisable
degree of systematicity were analysed for confirmatory
and original programme theory.
Results
Literature base
The literature search was conducted across nine data-
bases. Potentially relevant articles ( n = 2763) were identi-
fied from searching electronic databases, and 14
additional potentially relevant articles were identified
from follow-up of models and framework papers in-
cluded in the earlier Re:CAP scoping review (the desig-
nated ‘citation pearls ’). Of the potentially relevant
articles, 2081 were excluded because their primary focus
was not on RCD, leaving 682 potentially relevant papers
from electronic databases; 468 articles were subsequently
excluded at abstract stage, being either not relevant, only
available in abstract form or written in a language other
than English and 214 articles from electronic databases
were retained, 116 of which reported on specific inter-
ventions or initiatives or their evaluation. A subset of 98
articles were discussion papers or explicitly sought to
make a theoretical contribution. These 98 articles were
read carefully by one of the review team (JC/AB) and,
where the study was considered appropriate to the re-
view question, selected for data extraction. A final list of
36 conceptual papers, reflecting consensus between the
reviewers, were ultimately included. Figure 1 outlines
the PRISMA diagram.
The 36 papers (Table 2) reflected international interest
in RCD, with prominent players including the United
Kingdom ( n = 11), Australia ( n = 6), the United States of
America ( n = 5), Canada [ 31] and Canada/United States
combined [ 27] (North America). Five papers represented
international perspectives, typically in the form of litera-
ture reviews. Low- and middle-income countries were
represented by five collective papers and individual pa-
pers from Bangladesh [ 5], Liberia [ 20] and South Africa
[21]. Primary care was the most prevalent field of re-
search ( n = 12), with nursing ( n = 10), health and health
services research ( n = 9) also being well represented.
Three papers examined allied health ( n = 3) and the final
paper looked at public health [ 21]. Collectively, the pa-
pers represented all the identified activities of RCD, with
richer papers yielding programme theory relating to
three or more activities (Table 2).
Given that the aim of the project was interpretative
and explanatory it was not considered necessary to com-
prehensively sample every possible RCD model, frame-
work or theory. Instead, we were looking to construct
theory and therefore employed a purposeful sampling
approach described as ‘intensity sampling ’. In the con-
text of a research synthesis, intensity sampling involves
selecting papers that are “excellent or rich examples of the
phenomenon of interest, but not highly unusual cases …
cases that manifest sufficient intensity to illuminate the
nature of success or failure, but not at the extreme ” [32].
This method of sampling appears particularly appro-
priate given that the intent of realist synthesis is to
delve into inconsistencies of evidence in order to
build programme theories to offer to policy-makers
[29]. Sampling was operationalised through initial se-
lection of the 10 citation pearls and, subsequently,
through selection of articles that specifically sought to
theorise or conceptualise RCD.
Literature classification
The final list of included studies comprised 36 theor-
etical and conceptual papers (Table 2). The included
literature reflected a wide range of environments and
Cooke et al. Health Research Policy and Systems  (2018) 16:93 Page 5 of 22

settings within which RCD might take place. The ap-
plied context for this synthesis meant we were par-
ticularly interested in United Kingdom-based studies,
although Australia and the United States were par-
ticularly well represented. Primary care as a context
was particularly prominent. Reasons for this may be
temporal, with acute hospit al infrastructures being at
a later stage of development than primary care coun-
terparts, related to saleability, with primary care orga-
nisations and networks being more able to facilitate
actionable change, or may relate to external develop-
ments and priorities. We also identified papers that
described North – South partnerships as exemplars of
collaborations or networks.
The focus of this paper
This paper focuses on 36 conceptual and theoretical
papers (Table 2), including papers containing some form
of framework or model of RCD. Models and frameworks
were handled in the same way and were deconstructed
into their original elements (in the form of If-Then state-
ments). Thus, hypothesised relationships were not privi-
leged within the original deconstruction but emerged
naturally from the synthesised data.
A process of discussion and consensus led to identifica-
tion of eight overarching programme theories, identifying
mechanisms triggered across multiple (i.e. at least more
than one) macro contexts (Table 3). Several programme
theories recognise RCD as a collaborative effort facilitating

Table 3 Overarching programme theories for Re:CAP (Expanded)
‘Label’ Elements of programme theory Lines for further
inquiry from mid-range theory
Example of source data
Research capacity will be effected if …“ This was what we achieved … .”“This is what I think … .”
By Activity
PT1. ‘Exceeding the sum
of the parts ’
Individuals/organisations/networks realise a contribution
that they are unlikely or less likely to achieve in isolation
Social Network and
Organisational Theory
Community of Practice [ 69]
Social Capital
“Building research capacity is a complex challenge and needs to be thought
of as a holistic process. Each constituent part is vital to the success of the
whole, and is inextricably interlinked with all the others – a gestalt-like
phenomenon in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ” [70]
PT2. ‘Learning by doing ’ Individuals/organisations prototype or practise activities
required for subsequent full engagement, and sequentially
learn through cycles of reflection
Experiential Learning Model [ 55, 61]
Learning Organisation
“‘Learning by doing ’approaches, usually in the form of developmental or
seed grants, hands-on training in ongoing research programmes or
mentorship programmes, are effective approaches that complement
academic degree offerings. They are also most appropriate for building
capacity on the ‘demand’side so that those who use research findings
understand and appreciate their value in improving health outcomes ” [1]
Social Capital
Learning Organisation
“Training should be and should remain one of the central foci when
partnerships are awarded. Training young scientists in the context of such
ongoing projects is irreplaceable (so-called ‘learning by doing ’) and leads to a
rapid acquisition and development of research skills and experience ” [57]
PT3.1 ‘Liberating the talents ’ Individuals/organisations release the dormant potential of
their skills and experience
Bourdieu’s Theory of Practice 1977 “A more focused approach can accelerate progress in building capacity and
allows researchers and teachers to develop their ‘natural talents ’” [70]
PT4. ‘Releasing resources ’ Resources provided to overcome individual/organisational
inhibition and act as a focus for activity, and information is
freely shared about these opportunities
Lewin Model of Change
(Unfreeze/Change/Freeze)
Social Capital
“Evidence of resource investment from the organisation to support pump-
priming of research, e.g. research support sessions, pump-priming money
for pre-protocol or pilot work ”
PT5. ‘Coproducing knowledge ’ Individuals/organisations share ideas and knowledge
development through networks and partnerships
Beresford [ 71]
Coproduction [ 72, 73]
Social Change
“Engaging other stakeholders – such as service users, community members,
health practitioners and policy-makers – is helpful for setting realistic goals,
meeting local priorities and addressing resource issues. This requires extensive
participation and hence more resources ” [74]
“A new kind of production of knowledge is emerging. This new model of
knowledge production is called ‘Mode 2 ’...Mode 2 knowledge production is
characterized as multi-professional driven, allowing ideas and knowledge to
be generated and reflected upon within research groups which combine
heterogeneous skills and experience. Within Mode 2, research groupings
change from project to project and tend towards non-hierarchical,
networking arrangements ” [52]
Symbolic
PT6. ‘Feeling that you are making
a difference ’
Individuals/organisations perceive that research has an
impact on health/wealth/knowledge creation/tackling
inequalities
Social Change “Both nurses had never been involved in research before but were actively
interested in taking part as they perceived that the research process would
directly benefit patients in the short and long term, as well as giving them
the opportunity to learn about research through a problem-based
approach” [61]
PT7. ‘Modelling positive behaviours ’ Individuals observe the positive impact of involvement in
research by others in the organisation
“The best aspect of the workshop was having access to senior GP academics
– as role models – and meeting early career researchers — as reassurance ”
“Role modelling from academics and research-minded registrars was
influential. It was good to discover that academics were not scary! ” [75]
PT8. ‘Signalling importance and
making research core business ’
Individuals perceive that involvement in research is a valid
activity in relation to competing priorities within the organisation
Social Norms “Some saw next stages as about consolidation, making sure that gains were
hard-wired in and that senior managers themselves were proactive, for example
in operationalizing research objectives through the appraisal system ” [76]
“The Office of Research staff … do not become involved in graduate student
education or research presentation materials. The support services provide
instrumental assistance and convey a clear message about the importance
of preparing competitive grant applications ” [49]

academic engagement in health systems. Therefore, for
example, the ‘more than sum of parts ’ includes valuing
and recognising as an asset, the contribution that each in-
dividual brings to the partnership, enabling discussion and
joint thinking, access to different networks, and dividing
workload across disciplines. This promotes respectful and
meaningful discussion that can lead to trust and on-going
dialogue and can be underlying mechanisms throughout
diverse interventions, for example, in priority-setting,
grant writing groups, communities of practice, knowledge
transfer partnerships and doctoral training networks. Add-
itionally, the resulting outcome provides a new context
that can activate other mechanisms, for example, ‘copro-
duction of research’and ‘learning by doing ’. Thus, the out-
come of one mechanism can produce the context to
stimulate mechanisms in others. Reviewing the
programme theories in Table 3 reveals that they form
chains of ‘context (C) – mechanism (M) – outcome (O) ’,
where the outcome of one part of the chain shapes a sub-
sequent context within which to stimulate the mechanism
in others in the RCD programme. Similarly, ‘liberating tal-
ents’, ‘learning by doing ’ and ‘releasing resources ’ form
chains, which may be usefully harnessed when developing
fellowship and secondment interventions, for example.
A major finding from the qualitative synthesis and
analysis was that many activities fulfil an emblematic
(symbolic) role in signalling the importance of RCD
within the organisations, networks or teams. Therefore,
for example, the ‘protected time ’ or ‘buy out from other
responsibilities’ interventions initially seem to serve an
instrumental role in freeing staff from their other duties
in order to participate in research. On closer examin-
ation, however, it is clear that such activities are equally
important in demonstrating to staff within an organisa-
tion that research is important and should be considered
an organisational/system priority. Similarly, the develop-
ment of small funding schemes in research networks or
organisations, engagement in writing workshops and the
promulgation of mentorship schemes assume signifi-
cance beyond their monetary value in signalling that re-
search is valued and hence an activity in which it is
legitimate for staff to engage. A common trigger for all
mechanisms is ‘making a difference ’, which can stimulate
motivation in stakeholders across the RCD programme,
and can be seen as a community building exercise.
Validation and refreshment of programme theories
Citation searches for the 10 citation pearls in December
2017 identified a further 10 systematic reviews published
between 2014 and 2017 that met our original inclusion
criteria (Table 4). Collectively, these covered all the RCD
activities (Box 1) and reflected the diversity of contexts
identified in the original dataset (e.g. high- ( n = 5) and
low- and middle-income countries ( n = 5); allied health
[33], nursing [ 34], public health [ 35], and health and
health services research ( n = 6), etc.). A new addition
was in the emerging field of knowledge translation [ 36].
Again, the papers represented all the identified activities
of RCD (Box 1), yet, since they were all reviews, they
were more likely to describe multiple activities than the
original dataset (Table 5).

The identified reviews confirmed the original
programme theory, adding a nuanced understanding of
many RCD activities. However, the new dataset did not
identify any new strands of programme theory, possibly
indicating that theoretical saturation had been reached.
Evaluation, debatably an RCD activity in its own right,
emerged as increasingly prominent in the recent litera-
ture. However, evaluation was considered to be a subtext
to all the other activities and was not included as an
additional activity. Future conceptual models should en-
sure that they feature evaluation, albeit to be handled
differently from other activities.
Discussion
Many governments and global partnerships invest consid-
erable funds to support RCD in healthcare, and it is a
moral and ethical imperative to develop, shape and evalu-
ate such activity [ 37] in order to plan and attain the
desired effect, and to justify continued funding [ 16]. This
unique realist synthesis of the conceptual literature on
RCD has uncovered mechanisms that operate beneath
such activities which, we suggest, can function across and
within different structural levels with an emphasis of
meaningful societal impact. We suggest that the
programme theories developed here might help to plan
and demonstrate cohesion and alignment across structural
levels. Several authors recognise that RCD activities need
to take place concurrently at a number of different levels
[1, 8, 13], with many calling for a ‘whole systems’approach
to RCD [ 3, 19]. We propose that the programme theories
developed here could act as a guide for application across
the diverse individual, organisational and network levels in
order to promote synergy and ensure RCD activities ‘pull’
in the same direction.
Social change is the ultimate outcome for RCD [ 8]. The
programme theories presented here, particularly those
described as ‘symbolic’, can provide visible mechanisms of
how RCD might influence culture, leadership and motiv-
ation. Many of these mechanisms have foundations in
theories of social change and social capital, and provide an
explanation of how interventions that adopt such an
approach can engender a research culture within organisa-
tions and networks, and reciprocity and leadership in
individuals.
Our programme theories resonate with others that
explain how research activity can promote impact in
healthcare organisations and communities [ 38, 39, 40].
Whilst training in research traditionally includes research
methods, data collection and analysis skills, the co-pro-
duction programme theory suggests diverse skills of cross
boundary working, negotiation and creative practices in
knowledge production [ 39]. Researchers using a
co-productive approach are more likely to align research
with stakeholder and organisational objectives [ 1]a n d
form dynamic partnerships using assets from different or-
ganisations and networks [ 38] to make a difference.
Under what circumstances are RCD interventions
most likely to achieve their intended effect? Our analysis
has identified several principal components from a the-
oretical perspective:
1) RCD interventions may act as a catalyst for
releasing potential research energies from within
individuals and organisations. This is most clearly
seen in the programme theories that relate to
‘Exceeding the sum of the parts (PT1) ’, ‘Liberating
the talents (PT3) ’ and ‘Releasing resources (PT4) ’.
The implication is that, without such triggers, the
organisation and individuals remain essentially inert
or slow moving with regard to their engagement in
research activities.
2) RCDs must meet criteria for observability, meaning
that current and potential participants must be able
to perceive potential and actual benefits from their
involvement. This is most clearly seen in the
collective programme theories labelled as symbolic
(or emblematic), i.e. ‘Feeling that you are making a
difference (PT6) ’, ‘Modelling positive behaviours
(PT7)’ and ‘Signalling importance (PT8) ’. However,
it is additionally present within the ‘Learning by
doing (PT2) ’ programme theory, where trainers and
trainees receive almost synchronous confirmation of
personal growth and skills acquisition.
3) RCDs must secure the engagement and
commitment of their stakeholders and beneficiaries.
Such commitment may be overtly signalled through
explicit strategies or statements on research,
through the celebration of achievements and
through the provision of protected time from the
demands of competing activities ( ‘Signalling
importance PT8). It can also be secured by co-
creation opportunities through ‘Releasing resources
(PT4)’ and ‘Coproducing knowledge (PT5) ’ with
added opportunities for ‘Feeling that you are
making a difference (PT5) ’.
4) Possible linkages and C-M-O chains are emerging,
where the outcome of one mechanism stimulates
another within the programme architecture, and
can act as leverage within it. For example, the
mechanisms that are symbolic (PT6 – 8) may
nurture a research culture that acts as a backdrop
to other activities (P1 – 7). Variation in this cultural
backdrop can be conceived as the effect of a
dimmer switch [ 41] by which the range of
outcomes of the symbolic mechanisms have
correspondingly greater or lesser influence on
associated RCD activities. The more evident a

<<<PAGE=18>>>
research culture, the more assets/resources that
culture is able to bring to the RCD architecture
and, correspondingly, the more power released
within the dimmer switch to stimulate a range of
mechanisms across the programme.
Thus, the findings from this realist synthesis of the
conceptual RCD literature offer a starting point for con-
structing a RCD framework shaped by these programme
theories. Future work should include exploration, elabor-
ation and iterative refinement of these programme the-
ories through exploration with other theory (some
suggestions are included in Table 3), and testing against
empirical data from intervention studies [ 42, 43].
Strengths
We have taken a first step in developing components of
an overarching theory to determine what works for
whom to accomplish ‘more research done well ’. Searches
were conducted across a wide range of databases and
were supplemented by exhaustive reference checking
and citation tracking. The 36 conceptual and theoretical
papers we identified are derived from diverse settings
and describe RCD activities at multiple levels, strength-
ening confidence in the identification of candidate
mechanisms. All major RCD activities are identifiable in
both the included set of papers and in the validation set
of recent reviews with which we tested our initial find-
ings. Our realist-based approach offers an opportunity
for a more nuanced understanding of how interventions
might work and, indeed, in understanding circumstances
in which they may not, which goes beyond the mere
presence or absence of a specific intervention, a seren-
dipitous bundle of collective interventions or a tailored
package of synergistic initiatives.
Limitations
The systematic mapping process was subject to time and
resource constraints and was primarily conducted by
one investigator. Validation of a 20% sample was per-
formed by the other two investigators to sensitise team
members to the characteristics of the evidence base. The
team reached a consensus on what should be recognised
as constituting a model, theory or framework but did
not distinguish between these three contested terms.
The articles studied for the presence of programme the-
ory were purposively sampled from a wide range of can-
didate studies and were selected to represent diverse
settings and contexts and because of the perceived rich-
ness of their data.

group of nine National Health Service organisations who
meet to promote organisational development in RCD,
called ACORN (Addressing Capacity in Organisations to
do Research Network) [ 44]. Individuals were able to com-
ment on the extent to which th ese programme theories fit
with their practical experience of RCD.
Potential implications, based upon our theoretical
frameworks, for those planning RCD at different con-
textual levels are given in Box 2.
Conclusions
Realist evaluation approaches are increasingly common
when evaluating specific interventions in RCD [ 45, 46,
47]. Other authors are further using innovative literature
review methods in order to explore development strat-
egies for RCD [ 48]. We believe that this is the first time
that the innovative approach of realist synthesis has been
applied to conceptual papers on RCD in order to isolate
the underpinning RCD programme theories. The value
of this approach is in drilling down beneath the activities
of a programme to identify the mechanisms that are de-
ployed therein.
This review found that, collectively and individually,
RCDs engage with multiple defined programme theories
to achieve their potential impact. Such programme theor-
ies have a role in developing new RCD interventions, in
modifying existing initiatives, and in creating a compre-
hensive evaluation framework against which to measure
achievements. We have been able to tentatively explore
how C-M-O might link to develop ‘trigger’ chains and
speculate how symbolic mechanisms may link to interven-
tional ones. This needs to be explored further within inter-
vention studies. Our initial work requires further
development to extend the analysis and thus cover a full
range of RCD interventions, mapping both activities and
evaluation measures by intervention, stage in the develop-
ment lifecycle, and by programme theory.
Our investigation represents an overt attempt to capital-
ise on the utility of realist synthesis for the specific tasks
of theory generation and subsequent exploration of poten-
tial mechanisms. Gough et al. [ 28] characterise the poten-
tial contributions of synthesis in general in terms of
generating, exploring and testing (G-E-T) of theory. A
subsequent stage of this project is therefore to test these
emergent concepts with reference to empirical studies,
either relating to research capacity as a composite activity
or to the individual interventions by which we characterise
research capacity activities. Planned outcomes from the
subsequent stages of this project include identifying which
mechanisms are associated with specific types of interven-
tion and the development of an evaluation framework
with which to assess the achievements of general RCD
programmes and their constituent interventions.
Our novel evidence-based model identified 36 concep-
tually rich papers relevant to RCD. Although we acknow-
ledge that other papers hold the potential to inform our

production of research, and provide positive role models.
/C15Develop funding calls to a release resource and signal importance of research activity within healthcare organisations. For example,
through a matched funding model in large research programmes, and protected time agreed with managers in ‘learning by doing ’
opportunities.
/C15Fund novel methods of research dissemination that promote action in clinical and healthcare practice so that the research findings
can make a difference, and signal importance of implementing research knowledge into practice.
Healthcare organisations
/C15Signal the importance of research activity within the organisation through job descriptions, mission statements, training and R&D
strategies. Support business plans in order to release resources that will include protected research time and ring-fenced research
resources.
/C15Recognise and celebrate positive research behaviours in clinical academic staff, managers and services through award schemes and
communication channels.
/C15Enable mentoring and coaching schemes to be undertaken in their organisation in order to release potential talent and support
learning by doing activities.

theory development, particularly in relation to the charac-
teristics of individual interventions, we believe that we
have identified the more common and significant
programme theories that relate to RCD. We anticipate
that further exploration will reveal a point of theoretical
saturation and may help in identifying some of the nu-
ances or, indeed, disconfirming cases, associated with spe-
cific RCD initiatives. Ultimately, we hope that the
conceptual framework presented in this paper will con-
tribute to the demonstration of long-term outcomes in
health, wealth and knowledge as commissioners and ser-
vice providers work together to increase RCD.
