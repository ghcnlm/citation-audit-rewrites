ABSTRACT
The theorization of the relationship between organizational investments in career development
and individual success remains underdeveloped, and empirical tests of this relationship, which
have been dispersed among several disciplinary areas, have produced inconsistent results.
Addressing these issues, the purpose of this article is to propose a theoretical framework that
illustrates why and how organizational career management practices translate into career success
and underwhat circumstances the relationship is eﬀective. Using a systematic review of empirical
studies on career management practices and objective success, we identify three theoretical
mechanisms - developmental, informational, and relational - and two groups of contingency
factors that explain this relationship. Our framework advances the extant literature on organi-
zational career management and provides suggestions to companies for designing eﬀective career
management systems.
1. Introduction
Organizational career management (OCM) refers to the activities companies carry out to sustain their employees' career devel-
opment (
Baruch & Peiperl, 2000), helping them obtain promotions and pay raises, and assisting their transition into leadership
positions (Vinkenburg & Weber, 2012). Over the last twenty-ﬁve years, the career literature has conceptualized“new” career models
(e.g., boundaryless career, protean career) centered on individuals' proactivity (Arthur & Rousseau, 2001; Hall, 1996; Tomlinson,
Baird, Berg, & Cooper, 2018) and it has acknowledged that career success has evolved into a concept broader than pay and status
alone (Ng, Eby, Sorensen, & Feldman, 2005). Notwithstanding, research and practice have continued to place organizational career
management, which aims at feeding the“talent pipeline”, among the most important challenges for organizations' human resources
(HR) function (Clarke, 2013; De Vos & Cambré, 2017; Koch, Forgues, & Monties, 2017).
Theoretical research on OCM, which dates back to the 1970s (e.g.,Bowen & Hall, 1977; Walker, 1978), initially focused on
providing companies with guidelines and advice on the design of eﬀective succession plans and later on the deﬁnition of OCM
practices that either individually (Baruch, 1996, 1999) or as systems (Gunz, 1989; Lepak & Snell, 1999; Sonnenfeld & Peiperl, 1988)
can support employees in reaching their career goals. However, with the exception ofRosenbaum's (1984) seminal work, which
subsequent career studies have substantially overlooked, no authors have proposed a theoretical explanation of the relationship
between organizational investments in career management and career success. The empirical research on career management is
fragmented, since studies have been published in a variety of disciplinary areas (e.g., vocational psychology, labor economics, HR

management), have tested OCM practices (e.g., mentoring, training, assessment centers) in isolation (e.g.,⁎Dreher & Ash, 1990;
⁎Georgakakis, Dauth, & Ruigrok, 2016; ⁎Jansen & Vinkenburg, 2006) and have achieved ambiguous results (e.g.,⁎Fagenson, 1989;
⁎Whitely & Coetsier, 1993). Thus, no consolidated empirical research has stated the eﬀectiveness of OCM practices either as single
practices or as a system of practices (De Vos, Dewettinck, & Buyens, 2008).
We contribute to the theoretical and empirical career literature by proposing a theoretical framework that illustrates the re-
lationship between OCM practices and individuals' objective career success (OCS). In developing this framework, we perform a
systematic review (
Denyer & Tranﬁeld, 2009) of the empirical research that tests the eﬀectiveness of OCM practices on OCS. This
review approach is particularly appropriate for our research purpose since it can help us ascertainwhy and how a relationship
between two variables occurs and underwhat circumstances it is most eﬀective (Denyer & Tranﬁeld, 2009, p. 682). In addition, the
systematic review is useful in research on topics such as career development and success, which are characterized by interdisciplinary
literature and empirical studies that adopt various deﬁnitions, measurements, and participants (
Arthur, Hall, & Lawrence, 1989; Gunz
& Peiperl, 2007).
Our theoretical framework makes two primary contributions to the career literature. First, it deﬁnes three theoretical mechanisms
- developmental, informational, and relational - that explainhow and why organizational investments in career development translate
into individual career success, a topic that the literature has largely overlooked (e.g.,Rosenbaum, 1984). The framework also ad-
vances the career literature that measures the diﬀusion of OCM practices (e.g.,Baruch, 1996; Gutteridge & Otte, 1983) but does not
explain how they produce their eﬀects. This process must be described and understood both if career theory is to overcome a purely
descriptive and“atheoretical” approach to career development (Baruch & Peiperl, 2000) and if companies and HR departments are to
make well-guided investments in employees' development (Cappelli & Keller, 2014). These beneﬁts are possible because the proposed
framework oﬀers a theoretically sound and evidence-based (Gill, 2018) explanation of the eﬀects of OCM practices on individual
career success. Second, since our review focuses on empirical studies, we provide an overview of OCM practices' eﬃcacy in aﬀecting
OCS. In doing so, we identify and include in our framework two sets of contingency factors that can aﬀect the relationship between
OCM practices and individual career success - that is, factors that explain underwhat circumstances this relationship holds. This eﬀort
can also guide HR departments in identifying career development practices that can be eﬀective in organizations, given their speciﬁc
contingencies.
1.1. The role of organizations in managing individual careers
According to
Orpen (1994, p. 28), OCM refers to“practices deliberately established by organizations, to improve the career
eﬀectiveness of their employee, establishing what employees want from their careers, providing appropriate career opportunities for
employees, identifying which employees deserve these opportunities and then providing them”. These practices include a wide range
of programs and interventions (De Vos et al., 2008) that companies design“to promote and contribute to business goals [while giving
individuals] the opportunity to fulﬁll their personal needs and aspirations” (Doyle, 2000, p. 229). In an analysis of the evolution of
the organizational career models,Clarke (2013) showed that in many companies, employees take responsibility for their career
management, but the organization continues to support their professional development through career management initiatives.
Rosenbaum's (1984)seminal work explained the theoretical rationale that relates organizational investment to individual career
development. Building onTurner's (1960)) contribution, Rosenbaum applied to organizational career management the notion of
“sponsored mobility”, as opposed to the predictions of human capital theory (Becker, 1964), which posits that individual achieve-
ments are the result of individuals' abilities and investments in education and training and that there are no barriers to career
mobility, as individuals control the investments that determine their careers.
Rosenbaum (1984) suggested instead that individual
investments in developmental actions are lower and not comparable to those made by organizations, which invest primarily in
“chosen” individuals who have the potential to grow into leadership positions (
Spence, 1973). Given the diﬃculty and the costs
involved in obtaining information about employees' abilities and potential, employers use information such as their past jobs, when
they have advanced, and the rate at which they have advanced (
Rosenbaum, 1984) as signals of their abilities and potential. In a
dynamic process that occurs over time, organizational investments convert into individual achievements, which are both the starting
point for further career development and the basis for selecting those who will advance in the corporate hierarchy.
The process
Rosenbaum (1984)sketched is one of the rare eﬀorts to deﬁne theoretically the organizational mechanisms through
which companies sustain individual career development. Studies published in the 1970s focused primarily on career planning (e.g.,
Bowen & Hall, 1977; Walker, 1978) and oﬀered companies practical solutions for the design of their succession plans. Since most
studies published after the beginning of the 1980s (e.g.,Baruch, 1996, 1999) were concerned with the diﬀusion and implementation
of OCM practices in companies, the mechanismsRosenbaum (1984)outlined remained substantially implicit and neglected in most of
the subsequent career studies (Baruch, Szűcs, & Gunz, 2015).
1.2. Organizational career management practices and career success
While the deﬁnitions of OCM converge in identifying it as a set of practices, there is little consensus on the speciﬁc practices
involved, which number anywhere from nine (Gutteridge & Otte, 1983) to thirty-two (Gutteridge, 1993). Table 1compares the lists of
practices proposed by the literature, which repeat several activities but diﬀer with respect to labels, content, and the number of
practices.
The practices most frequently included in these lists are (seeBaruch, 2003 for a larger set of deﬁnitions): career counselling,
which is the process of discussing with employees their current job activities and performance, personal skills, and career

development objectives; succession planning, which supports the identiﬁcation and development of key individuals for executive
positions; and career-planning workshops that help employees make career decisions and set goals through the discussion with other
people in similar situations and/or human resources professionals. Other practices frequently included in these lists are job postings,
an internal recruitment channel that gives employees the opportunity to apply toﬁll vacancies in the organization; outplacement and
preretirement programs that help sustain workers during job transitions; assessment centers for the evaluation of workers' compe-
tences and potential; dual-ladder systems, which provide promotions and rewards to employees based on their career orientation
(i.e., technical/scientiﬁc versus managerial); and mentoring programs that support workers with the personal and professional in-
sights of experienced individuals.
Although organizations tend to oﬀer OCM practices in combination (
Baruch, 1999), there is no“generally accepted typology of
OCM practices” (De Vos et al., 2008, p. 162). A few theoretical and empirical studies have suggested how OCM practices work as
groups, but they have had a limited impact on the later career literature. The major theoretical eﬀort in this case is represented by the
career systems models, which are frameworks that link the organizational structure's characteristics (Gunz, 1989), organizational
strategy (Sonnenfeld & Peiperl, 1988), and individual competencies (Lepak & Snell, 1999) to the investments organizations should
devote to employees to support their career development. On the empirical side, building on exploratory studies, a few authors (i.e.,
Baruch & Peiperl, 2000; De Vos et al., 2008; Eby, Allen, & Brinley, 2005) have proposed categorizations of OCM practices based on
their adoption by companies and how they support individual professional development.
One of the main limitations of these studies is that they do not consider the eﬀect of the proposed OCM typologies or taxonomies
on OCS, so they neglect OCM activities' original goal. We know from the career literature that career success can be both subjective,
referring to an individual's satisfaction with all aspects of his or her career (
Greenhaus, Parasuraman, & Wormley, 1990), and
objective, referring to tangible professional achievement as evaluated by others (Judge, Cable, Boudreau, & Bretz, 1995). The primary
purpose of OCM practices is to support employees' professional achievements based on organizational goals by rewarding them with
promotions (e.g.,
⁎Campion, Cheraskin, & Stevens, 1994; ⁎Cannings, 1988; ⁎Wakabayashi & Graen, 1984), salary (e.g.,⁎Dohmen,
Kriechel, & Pfann, 2004; ⁎Suutari & Brewster, 2003; ⁎Turban & Dougherty, 1994), and movement to the upper echelons (e.g.,
⁎Bozionelos, 2003; ⁎Kirchmeyer, 1998; ⁎Tharenou, Latimer, & Conroy, 1994). In other words, companies provide OCM activities
with the primary purpose of increasing the individual's productivity and professional development, so subjective career success is,
from the organization's point of view, a byproduct of this process.
Moving from the limitations of the theoretical and empirical OCM literature, we use a systemic literature review to develop an
overarching framework (the“OCM-OCS framework” hereafter) that explains the theoretical rationale (thewhy) and the mechanisms
(the how) that underlie the relationship between OCM practices and OCS.
We make two primary contributions to the career literature. First, we contribute to the“thin” (
Baruch & Peiperl, 2000, p. 348)
theoretical basis of OCM that, with the notable exception ofRosenbaum (1984), has not explained the relationship between OCM
practices and career success. The purpose of our framework is to developRosenbaum's (1984)career process, which did not describe
which OCM practices are involved in individuals' career development and their eﬀects on career attainment. In this way, we also add
to the career literature that has proposed various classiﬁcations of OCM practices but has never considered their eﬀects on OCS as a
criterion for grouping them. Second, our theoretical framework includes the contingency factors (underwhat circumstances) that
aﬀect the main relationship. Drawing on the results of the empirical studies that are included in the systematic review, we identify the
conditions under which OCM practices can be more or less eﬀective in increasing individual career success, thereby contributing to
the empirical literature on OCM practices and providing managerial implications. Finally, our framework and its functioning inform
the formulation of a set of research propositions that can guide future empirical research.
2. Method
Denyer and Tranﬁeld (2009, p. 671)deﬁned the systematic review as“a speciﬁc methodology that locates existing studies, selects
and evaluates contributions, analyses and synthesizes data, and reports the evidence in such a way that allows reasonably clear
conclusions to be reached about what is and is not known”. Unlike narrative approaches, systematic reviews are based on replicable
methods that minimize bias related to the identiﬁcation, selection, and analysis of studies. In reviewing and synthesizing the lit-
erature, we followed the stages
Tranﬁeld, Denyer, and Smart (2003)proposed for a systematic review: planning, executing, and
reporting.
2.1. Planning
The ﬁrst stage of a systematic review consists of identifying the key data sources that are consistent with the research's purpose.
We limited our sources to articles published in scholarly (peer-reviewed) journals written in English. We chose a set of electronic
databases that are among the most comprehensive databases in the social sciences: EconLit, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences
Collection, Business Source Premier, SocINDEX with Full Text (EBSCO), and Web of Science (ISI). We also focused on empirical
articles because, as evidence-based management suggests (
Briner, Denyer, & Rousseau, 2009; Gill, 2018; Pfeﬀer & Sutton, 2006),
studies on organizational practices (e.g., OCM) that seek to support management processes and decision-making should be based on
evidence. In the academic literature, evidence is produced by empirical research that, as in our case, tests the eﬃcacy of a practice in
delivering its expected outcomes. We reviewed all articles independently to determine whether they met our predeﬁned criteria,
which are illustrated in the following paragraph, and then discussed ambiguous cases to achieve agreement.

2.2. Executing
To identify and select the academic studies that are relevant to our research, we conducted our search in two steps. First, we
performed a literature search for studies that listed OCM practices among their key words. To identify these key words, we referred to
studies that listed OCM practices (
Table 1), creating a list of twenty-six key terms, some of which refer to an OCM practice (e.g.,
training) and others that can be combined to deﬁne one or more OCM practices (e.g.,“dual*” as a part of“dual ladder” or “dual
career couple”). The twenty-six key terms used in the analysis are: job posting*, education, appraisal, counselling, counselling,
lateral, job rotation*, *retirement, succession, mentor*, path*, dual*, book*, written, assessment, development*, workshop*, in-
duction, orientation, network*, training, plan*, inventory, talent, *potential, and OCM. Next, we followed the same steps toﬁnd
articles on OCS. After reading studies on the measures of OCS (
Dries, Pepermans, Hofmans, & Rypens, 2009; Ng et al., 2005), we
identiﬁed eight key terms (career, success, advancement*, promotion*, salary, top, pay, hierarch*) that reﬂect the three measures
that are usually used to measure OCS (Dries et al., 2009): salary, promotions, and hierarchical level.
We ran our search in the electronic databases with multiple search strings that combined the eight key terms related to OCS (e.g.,
success AND advancement) with each of the twenty-six key terms related to OCM practices (e.g., success AND training). We extracted
all the articles (as of May 2017) whose abstracts and/or titles contained combinations of the keywords, without restricting the date of
publication. This primary search produced more than 100,000 articles, some of which were not relevant to our study (e.g., articles on
students' academic achievement). We used theﬁlter Subject Thesaurus Term (in EBSCO databases) and Research Areas (in Web of
Science) to restrict the sample to 5331 articles, selecting terms (e.g., personnel management) and areas (e.g., business economics)
that were consistent with our research.
Next, we read the selected articles' titles and abstracts and excluded studies that did not focus on OCM practices' eﬀect on OCS. We
considered only empirical studies that collected and analyzed primary data, so literature reviews, meta-analyses, and theoretical
articles were excluded. While these articles are not included in the review, we consulted some of them in developing the OCM-OCS
framework to conceptualize the process and the links in the framework. Then, we excluded articles that analyzed the career success of
professional groups, such as academics (
Dowd & Kaplan, 2005), which are strongly regulated by country-level institutional rules that
constrain organizations (i.e., universities) in their eﬀorts to manage individuals' career development. Finally, we excluded articles
that analyze informal practices, as OCM refers to“practices deliberately established by organizations” (Orpen, 1994, p. 28). This
procedure produced 73 journal articles that contain 128 empirical tests of the relationship between an OCM practice and one or more
indicators of career success.
2.3. Reporting
The ﬁnal step of a systematic review produces a synthetic description of the studies and then reports the results of the analysis.
Most of the seventy-three studies selected were conducted in North America (n = 39), but some were conducted in Europe (n = 16),
Asia (n = 7), Australia (n = 6), and other parts of the world (n = 5).
Most of the studies adopted a cross-sectional approach (n = 44), while others were longitudinal analyses (n = 29). Most of the
studies' data were collected through surveys (n = 48) of managers and professionals, and the sizes of the samples the articles analyzed
varied from thirty to thousands. Twenty-four studies focused on individuals who worked for one company only, but the company
sizes and industries varied.
The selected articles were published between 1969 and 2017, with forty-ﬁve studies published after 2000 and fourteen after 2010.
The articles were published in thirty-ﬁve journals, but twenty-ﬁve of the articles appeared in just three journals (Journal of Applied
Psychology, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, andAcademy of Management Journal).
Table 2 provides information about the 128 empirical analyses (labeled“a” to distinguish them from the number of articles,
labeled “n”) in the seventy-three articles. We found empirical tests for only eight out of the more than thirty OCM practices deﬁned in
the literature (Table 1). The empirical analyses used promotion (a = 56), salary (a = 53), and hierarchical level (a = 19) as measures
of OCS. Most of the empirical analyses veriﬁed a positive relationship between OCM practices and OCS (a = 73), but approximately

one-third (a = 44) found no statistically signiﬁcant relationship. Only three analyses showed a negative relationship, while the results
were mixed in eight cases (e.g., curvilinear relationship or diﬀerent results for diﬀerent samples).
The ﬁnal phase of the systematic review concerns the reporting of“what is known and unknown about the questions addressed in
the review” (Denyer & Tranﬁeld, 2009, p. 688). We report these results in the next section.
3. Results
Our review reveals the theoretical underpinnings of the relationship between OCM practice and OCS (the results of this analysis
and the main characteristics of the reviewed articles are inTable 3). Our study conﬁrms the theoretical fragmentation of the literature
and shows that more than a third of the studies (25 out of 73) are“atheoretical”, as the hypothesized relationship between OCM
practice and OCS is not explicitly sustained by any theory. In some cases, the lack of a theoretical framing relates to the fact that the
relationship between the OCM practice and OCS was not the study's core analysis, while in other cases the authors referred to the
results of previous empirical studies to sustain the hypothesized relationship.
Our analysis of the various theories adopted by the studies in depicting the relationship between OCM practices and OCS
identiﬁed three main mechanisms - developmental, informational, and relational - that aﬀect three outcomes - competencies, in-
formation, and relationships - respectively. Such outcomes lead to career success either directly or indirectly through mediating
factors (e.g., individual performance). In addition, most OCM practices can inﬂuence more than one outcome. The next sections
describe the three mechanisms that relate OCM practices to OCS and the contingency factors that aﬀect these relationships.
3.1. The developmental mechanism: OCM practices that enhance competencies
The developmental mechanism originates from OCM practices that increase the individual competencies (knowledge, skills, and
abilities) that are necessary to job performance, which is an input for promotion and compensation decisions. As the review of the
studies reveals, two main theories - human capital theory and social learning theory - underpin this mechanism.
Human capital theory (
Becker, 1964) posits that the labor market oﬀers opportunities and that individuals' abilities, education,
and eﬀort lead to productivity and performance, which is the basis for promotions and compensation. Human capital theory is the
reference theory in most of the studies that test the eﬀects of practices such as training, developmental assignments, and international
assignments on career success. Since trаіnіng improves employees' skills, it enhances their job performance and consequently, their
compensation. Training should also increase the likelihood of promotion when it improves the skills that are required to be pro-
ductive at higher-level jobs. International assignments increase workers' - particularly managers' - human capital because they expose
them to new organizational contexts, languages, and institutional environments (
⁎Benson & Pattie, 2008) and give them a chance to
gain important general-management skills. Such expertise may be particularly relevant to career advancement in global companies,
as the resource-based view also suggests (
⁎Carpenter, Sanders, & Gregersen, 2001; ⁎Magnusson & Boggs, 2006). Developmental
assignments and lateral moves (or job rotation) require individuals to accomplish tasks for which they may not yet be fully qualiﬁed
(⁎Lyness & Thompson, 2000). Challenging situations provide them with the opportunity to acquire new knowledge when they face
dynamic and problematic settings in which they must make decisions under uncertainty. Such challenges reveal deﬁciencies in their
current competencies, resulting in their desire to close these gaps through learning and experience (McCauley, Eastman, & Ohlott,
1995).
The second theory that underpins the developmental mechanism is social learning theory (Bandura, 1977), which posits that
individuals may acquire new skills and/or change their behaviors by observing others (“models”), a process referred to as vicarious
learning or modeling. The OCM practice of mentoring oﬀers a fertile ground for modeling, as mentoring is embedded in the re-
lationship between a mentor and a protégé, who acquires important skills by observing the model (Malhotra & Singh, 2016).
3.2. The informational mechanism: OCM practices that provide information
The informational mechanism originates from OCM practices that provide career-related information to the organization and its
employees. These mechanisms oﬀer organizations information that can be used in promotion and compensation decisions and in-
dividuals the feedback they need for their professional development. Our review reveals one main theoretical perspective: the sig-
naling theory that underpins this mechanism.
As originally proposed, signaling theory (
Arrow, 1973; Spence, 1973) acknowledges that it can be costly for managers who are
recruiting new employees to obtain accurate information about a candidate's potential to beneﬁt the organization, so they often use
formal education as a signal of future success. Since information asymmetry continues after employees are hired, as individuals often
occupy a variety of jobs with diﬀering and seldom comparable requirements and are evaluated by various supervisors, organizations
base promotions on job attainments such as past performance and results, which are considered signals of individual ability
(
Rosenbaum, 1984). Rosenbaum (1984, p. 287)observed that“employees who can exhibit short-term performance, perhaps even to
the detriment of long-term outcomes, will be promoted in this system”. Our review reveals that articles that test the eﬀect of practices
such as assessment centers, performance management, training, and international assignment on career success often explicitly or
implicitly adopt signaling theory as the explicative theory (often together with other theoretical models). Assessment centers use
situational exercises to identify individuals who have managerial and leadership potential and who will contribute to organizational
performance by obtaining reliable information about individuals' skills that are useful in upper-level positions (
Huck, 1973). Training
can also serve as a screening device becauseﬁrms learn about workers' abilities and skills during training activities and can promote

<<<PAGE=10>>>
the workers who best ﬁt the requirements to the next jobs in the hierarchy (⁎Dekker, De Grip, & Heijke, 2002). International
assignments also provide a signal regarding employees' managerial potential. Since employees in these jobs go through a selection
process to obtain the assignment, those who succeed tend to be motivated and competent and to seize the opportunity to increase
their competencies and experience while they work abroad (
⁎Biemann & Braakmann, 2013). Finally, and more intuitively, in-
formation gathered through the performance management process provides the organization with useful signals for promotion de-
cisions, according to a career system that
Rosenbaum (1984, p. 25)refers to as the“tournament model”. The tournament model of
careers contends that organizations' career management systems operate similar to sports tournaments, with a set number of rounds
and with only the winners of each round allowed to compete at the next level. Performance appraisals that compare employees to one
another or to certain standards (
Boswell & Boudreau, 2002)o ﬀer a basis on which to decide who wins each tournament round.
Organizations then usually base promotion decisions on a combination of performance and information about potential (Cappelli &
Keller, 2014).
The informative purpose of performance management is directed toward the organization, but it can also motivate individuals.
Both equity theory (Adams, 1965) and expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964) argue that employees' motivation increases when their
performance is recognized by the appraisal system, and higher motivation can improve future performance (⁎Oh & Lewis, 2013).
Because the motivational aspects of OCM practices are as critical to explaining the process that leads to career success as they are
under-considered by the articles we reviewed, we elaborate on this issue when we present the complete OCM-OCS framework.
3.3. The relational mechanism: OCM practices that aﬀect relationships
The relational mechanism originates from OCM practices that provide employees the support and visibility of their managers and
peers. Our review reveals that two main theoretical perspectives - development career theory (
Moore, Gunz, & Hall, 2007) and social
capital theories - underpin this mechanism.
The seminal work ofLevinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, and McKee (1978)is one of the most useful theoretical bases for studies
that address individual career development. The central thesis of Levinson and colleagues' model was that people, no matter their
occupation or background, grow through four life stages, each requiring the completion of several activities and psychological
adjustments. These life stages - preadulthood, early adulthood, middle adulthood, and late adulthood - are closely associated with
biological age. According to
Levinson (1986), one of the key factors in supporting the individual in accomplishing the personal and
professional challenges of each life stage is the person's relationships with signiﬁcant others, such as friends, lovers, bosses, teachers,
and mentors.Kram's (1983, 1985)inﬂuential studies on mentoring translatedLevinson's (1986)intuition about the role of external
actors in supporting the individual's life cycles into theﬁeld of organizational career development.
Mentoring is an interpersonal relationship between a less-experienced individual (the protégé or mentee) and a more-experienced
individual (the mentor), whose goal is to advance the protégé's personal and professional development. Mentors exert their support
through career-related functions and psychosocial functions (
Kram, 1985), the former of which (i.e., sponsorship, exposure and
visibility, coaching and challenging assignments) are strong predictors of compensation and advancement (Allen, Eby, Poteet, Lentz,
& Lima, 2004). Mentors oﬀer advice and“inside” information about the organizational culture and protocols that enable protégés to
adapt rapidly to performance expectations (⁎Aryee, Wyatt, & Stone, 1996; ⁎Orpen, 1995; ⁎Singh, Ragins, & Tharenou, 2009). In
addition, mentors advocate on their protégés' behalf, recommending them for leadership positions and communicating their ac-
complishments to senior management (
⁎Kirchmeyer, 2002; ⁎Lee & Nolan, 1998). Consequently, a mentor's sponsorship opens doors
to promotions and salary increases (⁎Bozionelos, 2008; ⁎Eddleston, Baldridge, & Veiga, 2004) and increases protégés' visibility,
which is especially important in organizational tournaments, where there might be incomplete or biased information (Longenecker,
Sims Jr, & Gioia, 1987).
Social capital theories provide the second perspective on the role of relationships in fostering career success. Social capital is
deﬁned as any aspect of social structure that creates value and facilitates the actions of those who are in that social structure
(Coleman, 1990). In proposing a social capital model of career success,⁎Seibert, Kraimer, and Liden (2001), p. 221) suggested
combining the extant theories of social capital (i.e., weak tie theory [Granovetter, 1973], structural holes theory [Burt, 1992], and
social resource theory [Lin, Ensel, & Vaughn, 1981]) into an overarching construct that deﬁnes social capital as“both the diﬀerent
network structures that facilitate (or impede) access to social resourcesand the nature of the social resources embedded in the
network”. Social capital can support individuals in their eﬀorts to achieve career success by providing access to new information,
resources, and opportunities through a social network of friends, family, colleagues, and acquaintances. For instance, individuals can
use their social capital to obtain information on job openings or to inﬂuence a promotion decision in their favor (
⁎Metz, 2009).
Higgins and Kram (2001)adopted social capital theory in reconsidering the role of the mentor, one of the many actors who constitute
the individual's developmental network. However, networking diﬀers from mentoring because it encompasses many contacts (versus
one or few mentors) whose status can be lower, higher, or equal to that of the individual, whereas the mentor usually has a higher
status. Companies support formal networks of employees (e.g., women's leadership networks, expatriate networks) so they can share
experiences, learn from each other, and increase their familiarity with other business units across the company. Such relationships
support career success because they provide resources such as status, the information required to perform one's job, information on
promotion opportunities, and advice on organizational norms (
⁎Kirchmeyer, 1998). A similar eﬀect to that depicted in the studies on
networking is also described regarding international and developmental assignments. International assignments help individuals
build international social networks that may provide future employment opportunities (
⁎Carpenter et al., 2001; ⁎Kraimer, Shaﬀer, &
Bolino, 2009). Developmental assignments enlarge an individual's visibility and increase the availability of career-related resources
when he or she contacts new coworkers and supervisors and extends his or her reach into new social circles (⁎Campion et al., 1994).

3.4. Contingency factors that aﬀect the three mechanisms
As Table 2 shows, not all of the empirical analyses supported the hypothesized relationship between OCM practices and OCS.
Whereas most of the articles that tested OCM practices whose primary purpose is to provide information (i.e., assessment centers and
performance appraisals) conﬁrmed these practices' eﬃcacy in predicting career success, a minority of the analyses that related
networking to career success demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant relationship. The group of practices that leverage the devel-
opmental mechanism (i.e., training, international assignments and developmental assignments) had mixed eﬀects (positive, negative
or null) on career success. When an empirical study'sﬁndings did not support its theoretical expectations, the authors suggested
contingency factors that could have aﬀected the relationship between OCM practice and OCS. Drawing on the explanations proposed
in the studies, we identiﬁed two groups of contingency factors that work as moderators in the two-step process through which OCM
practices aﬀect their direct outcomes (i.e., enhancing competencies, providing information, and creating relationships) and in turn,
increase individual success.
The ﬁrst group of contingency factors,Individual and organizational contingency factors,a ﬀects the initial part of the process and
either strengthens or hinders how OCM practices create competencies, information, and relationships. These factors comprise both
individual characteristics (e.g., personality traits, learning styles, nationality, career stage and experience, age, gender) and orga-
nizational characteristics (e.g., informal HR practices, organizational procedures, communication processes, supervisor/managerial
support, organizational structure, international scope).
Individual characteristics can aﬀect the eﬃcacy of OCM practices in creating individual competencies. For instance, age plays a
role, as training activities have more of an eﬀect on career success for young employees and new entrants, while developmental
assignments are more eﬀective for older employees (
⁎Tharenou, 2001). Individual attitudinal factors (e.g., an individual's learning
style, readiness to learn and motivation) can also aﬀect the eﬀectiveness of OCM practices in creating useful competencies (⁎Metz,
2004). Gender is relevant to OCM practices that create relationships and provide information. For instance, studies that have dis-
cussed the eﬀect of mentoring on women have demonstrated that although mentor support may be particularly valuable in over-
coming stereotyping and discrimination (⁎Ragins & Cotton, 1999), senior managers who provide mentoring tend to be male, and the
nature of their relationships with female protégés may impair the beneﬁts of mentoring (⁎Kirchmeyer, 1998, 2002). The evaluation of
performance and potential may also be aﬀected by gender biases, as women are expected to interrupt their careers to take re-
sponsibility for children and aging parents, and assessments of their career potential are inﬂuenced by this expectation (⁎Cox &
Harquail, 1991).
Organizational characteristics can aﬀect the creation of useful competencies; for example, international assignments are oﬀered
only by organizations that have an international scope, since these companies can exploit the knowledge the individuals accumulate
abroad (
⁎Kraimer et al., 2009). Organizational procedures and policies may also aﬀect OCM practices' ability to provide valuable
information. As attribution theory suggests (Igbaria & Baroudi, 1995), performance appraisals (⁎Wakabayashi & Graen, 1984;
Nathan, Mohrman, & Milliman, 1991) and assessment centers (Klimosky & Brickner, 1987)s uﬀer from a subjectivity bias that is
reinforced both by the relationship between the supervisor and the employee and by organizational policies. Regarding the creation
of relationships, the relative power of one gender (i.e., male) over another (i.e., female) in the organization may impair networking's
eﬀect in supporting career advancement (
⁎Kirchmeyer, 2002). Similarly, if organizations do a poor job of placing and supporting
expatriates, the “out of sight, out of mind” syndrome (Tung, 1988) can result in expatriates' being overlooked for promotion op-
portunities.
The second group of contingency factors,Institutional contingency factors,a ﬀects the direct and indirect links between each of the
three outcomes of OCM practices (i.e., competencies, information, relationships) and career success. Institutions are rules, norms, and
collective meanings (
Scott, 2014) that operate at both the organizational and the societal level. Internal labor market rules determine,
for instance, whether the organization rewards a certain level of competence with career advancement (⁎Melero, 2010). Similarly,
the competencies acquired during an international assignment will not lead to career advancement if the company does not have
career-planning rules to ensure that these assignmentsﬁt into the employee's professional development (
Pattie, White, & Tansky,
2010). Concerning the eﬀect of information on success, studies of female managers have demonstrated that career promotion op-
portunities are more likely to be oﬀered to men regardless of their performance ratings because of organizational norms holding
lower-status individuals (i.e., women) to stricter standards than those to which higher-status individuals (i.e., men) are held (⁎Lyness
& Heilman, 2006). Similarly, national level factors such as“seniority rules” in collective contracts, labor laws, the level of un-
employment, and the country's rate of growth can aﬀect compensation and promotions regardless of individuals' performance
(⁎Sheridan, Slocum, & Buda, 1997; ⁎Wayne, Liden, Kraimer, & Graf, 1999). Concerning the eﬀect of relationships on individual
career success, since organizational rules can deﬁne who the mentors are, and the mentors' hierarchical positions are key to whether
the mentors can aﬀect their protégés' career success (⁎Kirchmeyer, 1998), the eﬃcacy of mentoring relationships is aﬀected by
company policies. As far as networking is concerned, since personalized relationships with coworkers are parts of collectivist so-
cieties, such relationships are often not diﬀerential factors in these cultural contexts (
⁎Bozionelos & Wang, 2006; ⁎Koyuncu, Burke,
Alayoglu, & Wolpin, 2014).
4. Framework development and propositions
Our systematic review identiﬁed three mechanisms - developmental, informational, and relational - through which OCM practices
increase the individual's competencies, provide the organization with information for promotion decisions, give individuals feedback
they can use for development, and create relationships that enhance the individual's visibility and promotion chances. Each of the

papers we reviewed presented a partial view of the process that leads to career success. By recombining, integrating, and interpreting
these fragments of information, we develop ourOCM-OCS framework(
Fig. 1), which oﬀers a comprehensive view of the mechanisms
that lead to career success and the theories that explain them. We complement this comprehensive view with propositions to guide
future research in testing the mechanisms and how they function.
Our framework shows how OCM practices can aﬀect one or more intermediate outcomes (competence, information, relationship)
through various mechanisms and a variety of explanatory theories. For instance, training primarily enhances competencies (devel-
opmental mechanism), but it also provides the organization with information about the individual (informational mechanism).
Developmental and international assignments increase competencies (developmental mechanism) and enlarge workers' relationships
(relational mechanism). Mentoring and networking create relationships (relational mechanism) but also develop the competencies
required for promotion (developmental mechanism). These elements suggest ourﬁrst proposition:
Proposition 1.Competencies, information, and relationships mediate the relationship between OCM practices and objective career
success. Each OCM practice can aﬀect objective career success through more than one mediator.
The empirical papers in our review tested only a limited number of the OCM practices proposed in the literature, but the same
types of mechanisms and eﬀects can be described for most of the practices listed in
Table 1. For instance, OCM practices that rely on
the developmental mechanism include external seminars or workshops and job enrichment. For the informational mechanism,
practices such as development centers and 360-degree appraisals oﬀer organizations the information they need to make develop-
mental decisions about their employees. Other practices, such as job posting, information on career ladders and paths, career
counselling, and career planning workshops give employees the information they need to plan their professional development. Some
of the same practices (e.g., career workshops, counselling) can also provide useful relationships for career advancement. Therefore,
we propose a second set of propositions regarding the mechanisms activated by the OCM practices.
Proposition 2.a) OCM practices that oﬀer opportunities to improve human capital and/or to observe more experienced individuals
enhance career success by increasing individual competencies.b) OCM practices that 1) allow the company to collect signals about
the performance and individuals' potential and 2) allow individuals to collect advice about the company's career policies and about
their own potential and performance enhance career success by providing information.c) OCM practices that oﬀer opportunities to
interact with more experienced individuals and with peers increase career success by creating relationships.
Our framework shows that an OCM practice can activate various mechanisms in inﬂuencing OCS and that since many practices
can activate the same mechanism, these practices are likely to interact when they are implemented. This result is in line with the rich
theoretical and empirical strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature, which demonstrated decades ago that human
resource management (HRM) practices do not work in isolation but only as sets of self-reinforcing activities or bundles (
Delery &
Doty, 1996; MacDuﬃe, 1995). Building on this literature, we expect a similar eﬀect for groups of OCM practices. In addition, since
the goal of all OCM practices is to enhance career success through a variety of mechanisms, we expect that individuals who ex-
perience more OCM practices reach a higher level of success than do those who experience fewer OCM activities. Therefore, we
propose a set of propositions concerning how OCM practices work as a system.
Proposition 3.a) The more OCM practices an individual experiences, the greater his or her career success.b) OCM practices that
activate more than one mechanism (developmental, informational, or relational) are more eﬀective in increasing the individual's
career success than are OCM practices that activate only one mechanism.c) OCM practices that leverage the same mechanism
(developmental, informational, or relational) reinforce each other in enhancing the individual's career success.
As our OCM-OCS framework shows, in some cases, the relationships between performance and the three outcomes of OCM
practices are not only direct ones. In the case of the developmental mechanism, enhanced competencies can directly increase salary
when the organization has a skill based-pay system in place (
Armstrong & Stephens, 2005), but more often they improve job per-
formance, which gives companies the information they need for promotion decisions and salary increases (particularly incentives).
Similarly, as suggested in illustrating the informational mechanisms, many OCM practices can be sources of motivation, an element
neglected in
Rosenbaum's (1984)model and discussed in only one of the papers we reviewed (⁎Oh & Lewis, 2013). Several theories
provide the theoretical rationale for what sustains OCM practices' motivational eﬀect on workers. Equity theory (Adams, 1965),
expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964), and the job characteristics model (Hackman & Oldham, 1976) argue that employees' motivation
increases when the appraisal system recognizes their performance. Motivation is a strong driver of increased employee eﬀort (and
their performance in turn). More recently, the ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) framework developed in the SHRM literature
(
Boxall & Purcell, 2016; Jiang, Lepak, Hu, & Baer, 2012) demonstrates that career development practices aﬀect motivation, while
motivation and enhanced competencies (aﬀected by training) impact individual performance (Boxall & Purcell, 2016). Even though
only one of the papers we reviewed mentioned this motivational eﬀect, we draw on the extensive theoretical and empirical literature
on the topic to argue that motivation plays an important role in the process we analyze. Therefore, we added motivation to our OCM-
OCM framework as a direct eﬀect of OCM practices.
Proposition 4.a) Motivation interacts with OCM practices' outcomes (i.e., competencies, information, and relationships) in aﬀecting
career success. b) Individual performance mediates the relationship between OCM practices' outcomes (i.e., competencies,
information, and relationships) and career success.
Finally, as described in the section about contingency factors, the processes that relate OCM practices to OCS are aﬀected by many
individual, organizational, and institutional characteristics. Only a few empirical studies (e.g.,
Ferris, Buckley, & Allen, 1992; Stumpf
S. Bagdadli, M. Gianecchini Human Resource Management Review xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx
13
<<<PAGE=14>>>
& London, 1981) have tried to identify the factors aﬀecting the performance of a promotion system. Our OCM-OCS framework not
only identiﬁes groups of contingency factors but also suggests how they are likely to aﬀect the steps of the process.
Proposition 5. a) Individual and organizational contingency factors moderate the relationship between OCM practices and their
proximal outcomes (i.e., competencies, information, relationships).b)Institutional factors at the organizational and societal levels aﬀect
the relationship between objective career success and the accumulation of competencies, information, and relationships.
5. Discussion and conclusion
Despite the steady managerial and academic interest in OCM, thisﬁeld of study remains theoretically underdeveloped and
empirically fragmented. Our systematic review of the research on the relationship between OCM practices and OCS addresses these
issues by proposing a theoretical framework.
Building on the results of the review, the OCM-OCS framework oﬀers a comprehensive view of the theoretical reasons (why) and
mechanisms (how) through which OCM practices aﬀect career success, and it illustrates the circumstances (what) under which these
relationships work. In addition, we formulated a set of propositions that provide useful guidelines for testing the framework and how
it functions.
As a ﬁrst theoretical contribution, this framework advances and extends the embryonic career process that
Rosenbaum (1984)
proposed by illustrating the developmental, informational, and relational mechanisms through which OCM practices aﬀect career
success. Conﬁrming the interdisciplinarity of career studies (e.g.,Gunz & Peiperl, 2007), the OCM-OCS framework highlights which
theories underpin the three mechanisms, showing that in some cases, more than one theory can explain why OCM practices favor the
accumulation of competencies, the provision of information, or the creation of relationships. By grouping practices according to the
main mechanisms to which they refer and considering the practices that have been tested empirically on OCS (
Briner et al., 2009), we
add to the studies in the career literature that have proposed a variety of classiﬁcations for OCM practices without grounding them
theoretically (e.g.,Baruch & Peiperl, 2000; De Vos et al., 2008; Eby et al., 2005). With respect to the studies on career systems (Gunz,
1989; Lepak & Snell, 1999; Sonnenfeld & Peiperl, 1988) that have suggested using any one OCM practice only in certain circum-
stances or with certain employees, we contribute to clarifyingwhy and how these practices can result in individuals' success.
As a second theoretical contribution, our framework includes two sets of contingency factors that are likely to aﬀect the process
related to OCM and OCS. Thus, we add to the theoretical (e.g.,Mayrhofer, Meyer, & Steyrer, 2007) and empirical career literature
(e.g., Ferris et al., 1992) that has suggested the relevance of contextual factors to career development but has not deﬁned which are
relevant to the relationship between OCM practices and individual OCS.
The empirical studies we reviewed provide tests for only eight practices out of more than thirty listed in the literature. These few
tests suggest a detachment between the theoretical and the empirical literature on OCM since many practices are described but not
tested for their eﬀect on career success, which should be the primary hypothesized outcome. In addition, our analysis demonstrates
that the lists of OCM practices that the literature has proposed are not complete and current. For example, organizational work-life
balance policies (e.g.,ﬂexible work hours, working from home) should be included; such policies support workers' eﬀorts to maintain
eﬀective performance in the face of competing family demands (
Beauregard & Henry, 2009), so they could support individual career
success. We found four articles -Glass (2004), Hall, Lee, Kossek, and Las Heras (2012), Konrad and Yang (2012), and ⁎Noback,
Broersma, and Dijk (2016)) - that discussed the role of work-life balance practices in supporting career development and success, but
these practices may not be included among the traditional OCM practices because some may be mandatory in some national contexts
(e.g., parental leave), while others help to reduce discrimination at work (e.g., equal opportunity interventions). Future research
should also investigate the OCM practices that companies have developed recently in response to Millennials' career demands (
Ng,
Schweitzer, & Lyons, 2010), the needs of aging employees (Hall & Mirvis, 1995), and culturally diverse workers (Dheer &
Lenartowicz, 2017).
The results of our systematic review and the development of our framework oﬀer practical implications for companies and
individuals. The three mechanisms identiﬁed in the framework show how OCM practices work as groups. This result cannot be
deﬁned as new because of the SHRM literature that demonstrated decades ago that HRM practices do not work in isolation but only as
sets of self-reinforcing activities or bundles (Delery & Doty, 1996; MacDuﬃe, 1995). Similarly, in the career literature, studies on
organization career systems (e.g.,Bagdadli, 2007; Baruch, 2006; Sonnenfeld, 1989) have suggested the theoretical relevance of a
comprehensive approach to OCM. However,ﬁfty-nine of the seventy-three articles we reviewed measured the eﬀects of single
practices on career success, and many of them did notﬁnd the expected eﬀects, suggesting that the empirical studies neglected the
literature's indication. Drawing on our framework, we reinforce the call for an integrated approach to career management and
suggest that companies should group OCM according to the mechanisms they leverage to beneﬁt from their interaction.
Other practical implications concern the design and the implementation of OCM practices. Because OCM practices can exert their
eﬀect over diﬀering time horizons, companies should consider the temporal perspective when they design and test systems of OCM
practices. For instance, while assessment centers have long-term eﬀects (
⁎Jansen & Vinkenburg, 2006), performance appraisals have
short-term eﬀects (⁎Oh & Lewis, 2013), and training can have both short- and long-term eﬀects, depending on its content and the
recipients' characteristics (⁎Fang, Zikic, & Novicevic, 2009; ⁎Sheridan et al., 1997). In addition, as several studies have suggested,
companies should also consider the curvilinear relationship between OCM practices and career success. For instance, the positive
eﬀect of a career development activity can change over time, as
⁎Sheridan et al. (1997)demonstrated for on-the-job training, which
has a positive inﬂuence on promotion rates for theﬁrst job that diminishes in subsequent jobs. In addition, a greater investment in an
OCM practice might not always be related to a higher return in terms of career success; for instance,⁎Kraimer et al. (2009)found that
S. Bagdadli, M. Gianecchini Human Resource Management Review xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx
14
<<<PAGE=15>>>
the number of international assignments had a U-shaped relationship with career advancement upon repatriation. Together with the
role of time, the rich set of contingency factors included in our framework suggests that companies should consider customizing their
OCM practices according to individual and institutional characteristics. As the comparative career and HRM literature suggests (e.g.,
Mayrhofer, Meyer, Iellatchitch, & Schiﬃnger, 2004), local culture aﬀects management practices at the national level, so multi-
national companies should customize their career management activities at the local level.
6. Limitations and future research
Our framework has several limitations. First, although our research focuses on organizational careers, the social and political
changes that have become particularly evident since the 1990s (
Baruch et al., 2015) have favored the diﬀusion of ﬂexible and
adaptive careers. These new career models (e.g., boundaryless, protean) are generally characterized by individuals' increased cen-
trality in their career management by means of career self-management activities, a desire for mobility and voluntary turnover, and a
focus on subjective career success (
Arthur & Rousseau, 2001; Hall, 1996; Tomlinson et al., 2018). We acknowledge that our fra-
mework has low explanatory power in depicting the career development of individuals who are not interested in climbing the
organizational hierarchy. Companies are unlikely to be interested in investing in such employees' development (i.e., OCM practices)
since they are not sure they can retain them, and these individuals are unlikely to be interested in creating competencies, receiving
information, and establishing relationships that are mostlyﬁrm-speciﬁc. However, since the organizational career has not completely
disappeared (
Vinkenburg & Weber, 2012), our framework should be extended to include the features of the“new organizational
career” model (Clarke, 2013, p. 684) that combines the characteristics of the traditional organization career, the boundaryless career,
and the protean career. As the organization and the individual jointly manage the new organizational career, our framework might
include career self-management practices such as self-promotion, networking, consultation with mentors, and extended job in-
volvement (
Gould & Penley, 1984) to verify the validity of the three theoretical mechanisms we identiﬁed.
Second, we followed rigorous coding procedures for our literature review, but we acknowledge the limitations inherent in setting
the key words and their combinations. Our intention was to adopt a comprehensive approach to gathering the empirical studies that
measure the eﬀects of OCM practices, but we may have excluded articles on new and/or emerging OCM practices, the key words for
which were not included in the list we compiled, along with articles published in journals that do not have a management focus (e.g.,
medical journals). Extending the research to new OCM practices and/or testing the OCM-OCS framework in certain professional
groups (e.g., teachers, nurses) is a potentially fruitful path forward.
