ABSTRACT 
 
Training and development programmes play a crucial role in enhancing staff performance within an organization. These 
programmes are designed to improve employees ’ knowledge, skills, and abili ties, ultimately leading to increased productivity, 
efficiency, and overall organizational success. One of the primary reasons why training and development programmes are crucial 
for staff performance is that they contribute to the enhancement of employees ’ skills and knowledge. Through targeted training 
initiatives, employees can acquire new skills, stay updated with industry best practices, and gain a deeper understanding of their 
roles within the organization. It is in this context, this study assessed t he influence of training and development program on staff 
performance: a case of Tanzania Revenue Authority, coast region. The study focused on three specific objectives including to 
identify existing practice of training and development programmes offered  by TRA coast region, to determine whether training 
and development programmes have effects on employees’ performance at TRA coast region and to investigate the current 
challenges the TRA coast region experie nces in training it employees. The study was  done at TRA Coast region where by a 
sample of 92 respondents from the population of 120 senior and operational employees who randomly and stratified sampled 
participated. The study was guided by transformative learning theory. Descriptive research design was employed. Questionnaires 
and interview questions were used to collect data. Data was analyzed using descriptive and regression analysis.  Findings suggest 
that on -the-job training at TRA allows employees to acquire specific job - related skills in a real wo rk environment. Through 
engaging in actual tasks and responsibilities under the guidance of experienced mentors or supervisors, employees can develop  
a deeper understanding of their roles and responsibilities, Findings further suggest that off -the-job training opportunities have 
played a significant role in enhancing employees’ overall professional development at the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). It 
was revealed from the study that TRA is relevant to employees’ job responsibilities, and that the feedback received during on-the-
job training is constructive while training and positively impacted employees’ job performance.    Findings revealed that off-the-job 
training opportunities enhanced employees’ overall professional development. The study conc ludes that on -the-job training 
programmes at TRA are relevant to employees’ job responsibilities, and for that case the feedback received during on - the-job 
training is constructive. The study also concluded that induction training provided by TRA Coast Re gion adequately familiarizes 
new employees with organizational policies and procedures. It was recommended that the management of TRA should continue 
investing in training and development programmes since Training and development programmes leads to improv ed employee 
performance by equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to carry out their duties effectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Training and development programmes play a crucial role in enhancing staff performance within an 
organization. These programmes are designed to improve  employees’ knowledge, skills, and abilities, ultimately 
leading to increased productivity, efficiency, and overall organizational success. Human capital stands as the foremost 
asset within any organization, requiring investment for sustained survival and expansion. This involves assessing and 
fulfilling future personnel requirements (Arn, 2018).  
The intense global competition has prompted organizations to scrutinize every facet of their operations, 
evaluating how each function and process can align with strategic objectives. Similarly, training and development 
departments are challenged to show case their worth within this framework of organizational value (Scott,  2020). 
Training and development play a crucial role in enhancing staff performance across the globe.  Organizations 
worldwide recognize the importance of investing in their employees'  skills and knowledge to improve productivity, 
efficiency, and overall business success. This comprehensive approach to employee development has proven to yield  
numerous benefits, both for individuals and the organizations they work for (Adedo, 2020). 
In developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany,  training and 
development programmes are well -established and widely implemented.  These countries have robust economies that 
heavily rely on skilled labour and innovation. Consequently, organizations in these countries prioritize training

initiatives to ensure their workforce remains competitive in a rapidly evolving global  market (Ahmed, 2014). In the 
United States companies invest billions  of dollars annually in employee training programmes and the impact of such  
investments is evident in improved employee performance, increased job satisfaction, and reduced turnover rates 
(Amir and Amen, 2017). Similarly, the United Kingdom places great  emphasis on training and development as a  
means to enhance staff performance. These initiatives not only improve individual performance but also contribute to  
economic growth by fostering a highly skilled workforce (Elnaga & Imran, 2019).  Germany is renowned for its 
vocational education system, which combines classroom learning with practical training. This dual approach ensures 
that individuals acquire both theoretical knowledge and hands -on experience relevant to  their chosen fields. As a 
result, German companies benefit from highly skilled employees who possess the necessary expertise to drive 
innovation and productivity (Johnson et al., 2020). 
In African countries, training and development programmes are gaining increasing recognition as essential 
tools for improving staff performance. These countries are experiencing rapid economic growth and are striving to 
develop their human capital to meet the demands of a competitive global market (Gilaninia, 2020).  In Ghana, for 
instance, organizations are investing in training programmes to address skill gaps and improve employee performance 
(Afeke, 2020). Nigeria recognizes the importance of training and development in  enhancing staff performance. The 
country has witnessed an increase in corporate  training programmes, particularly in sectors such as banking, 
telecommunications, and oil and gas (Adedo, 2020). 
In Tanzania, effective  management of training functions is crucial for the success and growth of 
organizations. It involves  various aspects such as identifying training needs, designing appropriat e programmes,  
implementing training initiatives, and evaluating their effectiveness (Kiiza & Picho, 2019). Training programmes 
aligned with the skills identified in their human resource plans. Despite this policy, there is a discrepancy between the 
intended outcomes of these training programmes and the actual improvement in employee productivity.  
 
1.1 Statement of the Problem 
For enterprises in Tanzania to succeed and expand, training functions must be managed well. It entails a 
number of tasks, including determining the need for training, creating suitable programs,  carrying out training efforts, 
assessing their efficacy (Kiiza and Picho, 2019) and, training strategies that are in line with the competencies listed in 
their HR plans. The desired results of these training programs and the actual increase in staff productivity do not align, 
notwithstanding this regulation.  
Several studies were conducted in relation to effects of training and development program on staff 
performance. Mwapira (2015) conc entrated on evaluating the effectiveness of employee training programmes on 
organizational performance within the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) Office located in the Ilala tax region. 
Licombe (2018) investigated the influence of training and development  on employee performance within the public 
sector, particularly at TTCL Head Quarters. Khamis (2019) analyzed the outcomes of training on employee 
performance within the Zanzibar Social Security. 
Despite that several studies were carried out in the context  of training and development program on staff 
performance, but little is informed about effects of training and development program on staff performance: a case of 
Tanzania Revenue Authority, Coast Region. Hence this current study filled the gap particular ly to identify existing 
practice of training and development programmes offered by TRA coast region, to determine whether training and 
development programmes have influence on employees’ performance at TRA coast region and to explore the current 
challenges the TRA coast region experiences in training it employees. 
 
1.2 Research Objectives 
The specific objectives of this study were; 
i. Identify existing practice of training and development programmes offered by Tanzania Revenue Authority 
in Coast Region 
ii. To determine whether training and development programmes have effects on  employees’ performance in 
Tanzania Revenue Authority in Coast Region 
iii. To investigate the current challenges the TRA coast region experiences in training employees. 
 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1 Theoretical Review 
2.1.1 Transformative Learning Theory 
Jack Mezirow developed transformative learning theory in the late 1990s to illustrate how individuals engage 
in critical self -reflection to reconsider their experiences and beliefs, leading to e motional changes. This theory 
encourages active participation from learners in shaping both the application and content of learning activities. Central

to transformative learning theory are commitments and personal job satisfaction, which are vital compone nts of 
empowered learning (Michael et al., 2015).  Its implementation facilitates critical examination of assumptions and 
fosters empathy towards others undergoing similar transformative processes (Mezirow, 1991). Moreover, 
transformative learning theory p rovides avenues for individuals to act upon newly acquired perspectives (Howie & 
Bagnall, 2013). 
When linking to the study transformative learning theory encourages individuals to adopt a more inclusive and 
diverse perspective, which involves considering multiple viewpoints and perspectives. In a training and development 
program, employees can  engage in role -playing exercises, group discussions, and other activities that promote  
perspective-taking, enabling them to understand the needs and perspectives of their colleagues and customers better. 
 
2.2 Empirical Review 
2.2.1 Existing Practice of Training and Development Programmes Offered by TRA Coast Region 
According to Mtavangu and Nkya (2019), training programmes within the TRA are designed to enhance the 
skills and performance of employees, ensuring they are equipped to meet organizational goals effectively. The focus 
has been primarily on capacity building, especially in technical areas like tax administration, auditing, and customer 
service, to improve overall tax compliance and revenue collection. 
A study by Komba (2020) further identifies that while the TRA offers structured training programmes, there is 
still a gap in soft skills training, such as leadership and communication, which are crucial for manag ing taxpayer 
relations and intern al team dynamics. Additionally, Musoma and Leonard (2021) observed that the training 
programmes are mainly short -term, focusing on immediate needs without a long -term development plan. This 
approach tends to limit the long -lasting impact of these training efforts on employee performance and organizational 
efficiency. 
 
2.2.2 Effect of Training and Development Programmes on Employees’ Performance 
Mwapira (2015) conducted a study evaluating employee training initiatives' impact  on organizational 
performance at the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) Office in the Ilala tax region. The research assessed TRA's 
ability to train employees, examined motivation levels regarding training, its benefits to employees, and explored 
challenges in implementing training. Data collection methods included interviews, questionnaires, observation, and 
documentation, involving 172 respondents from various TRA departments. 
Kirigia (2017) investigated the relationship between employee training and perfo rmance at Kenya Power and 
Lighting Company. The study surveyed 135 respondents selected from a population of 450 through stratified random 
sampling. Questionnaires were used for data collection, and analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics with 
SPSS. Findings indicated that training aspects such as needs assessment, content, and delivery significantly influenced 
employee performance.  
Tagesse (2018) explored the impact of training and development on employee performance at ASKU plc. The 
study uti lized a descriptive and correlation research design, distributing 148 questionnaires and analyzing 140 
responses. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression using SPSS 23. The findings 
showed a positive correlation between t raining and employee performance, with training design having the highest 
impact. 
Licombe (2018) examined training and development effects on employee performance at TTCL Headquarters 
in the public sector. The study used a cross -sectional design with purpo sive sampling, collecting data through self -
administered questionnaires. Results indicated that periodic training improved skills, motivation, teamwork, and 
bridged skill gaps, ultimately enhancing performance. 
Khamis (2019) assessed training effects on em ployee performance at the Zanzibar Social Security Fund 
(ZSSF). Survey design was employed, utilizing questionnaires and interviews. Findings revealed ZSSF's commitment 
to various training methods but limited use of distance training, aiming to equip emplo yees with necessary skills to 
fulfill their roles effectively 
Studies have consistently shown that training enhances employees' skills, knowledge, and abilities, which 
leads to increased job efficiency and productivity. For instance, a study by Ijeoma and Amos (2019) found that 
training programmes significantly boosted employee productivity and job satisfaction in both public and private 
sectors. Similarly, a study by Johnson et al. (2020) emphasized the importance of continuous development in shaping 
employees’ ability to adapt to new technologies and methodologies, which in turn enhances performance. 
In the context of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), effective training programmes are vital, particularly 
in regions like the coast, where complex tax reg ulations require employees to have up -to-date knowledge and skills. 
According to Musa and Michael (2021), the impact of training at TRA’s coastal offices was seen in the increased 
accuracy of tax assessments and compliance management, both of which are key  performance indicators for the 
organization. Moreover, Njoroge et al. (2022) revealed that employees who undergo regular training are more engaged

and motivated, contributing positively to organizational goals. 
 
2.2.3 Current Challenges Experienced by the TRA in Training Employees 
One major challenge is the limited budget allocation for training programmes, which restricts the scope and 
quality of employee development (John, 2020). Despite the recognition of training as a critical factor for improving 
employee performance, TRA's training initiatives are often constrained by financial resources, affecting their ability to 
offer continuous professional development opportunities (Mfaume & Kessy, 2019). 
Moreover, inadequate training facilities and infrastructure further complicate the delivery of effective training 
programmes. A study by Mchopa and Mnyawi (2021) found that the absence of modern technology and relevant 
training tools hinders the acquisition of essential skills, particularly in digital systems and taxation software. The rapid 
advancements in technology necessitate updated training approaches, which are often lacking in the Coast Region. 
Lastly, the lack of customized training programmes that address the specific needs of TRA employees has 
been highlighted. Standardized training modules fail to consider the diverse roles within the organization, leading to a 
mismatch between training content and job requirements (Ngowi & Kisanga, 2018). As a result, employees may not 
acquire the skills they need to meet the organization’s evolving demand 
 
III. METHODOLOGY 
 
3.1 Research Philosophy 
A research approach refers to the overall strategy and plan for conducting a research project or study. Some 
common research approaches include quantitative research which f ocuses on numerical data and statistical analysis, 
qualitative research which focuses on non-numerical data like text, images, videos and mixed methods research which 
combines elements of both quantitative and qualitative approaches (Ghauri & Grønhaug, 2005).  
This study used mixed research approach, this is because the research question is complex and requires a 
multifaceted approach: The relationship between training and development programmes and staff performance is 
complex and influenced by various fact ors, both internal and external to the organization. A mixed research approach 
allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of these factors and their interactions 
The need to gather both quantitative and qualitative data: Quantitative data, such as performance metrics and 
survey results provided objective measures of staff performance and training program effectiveness. However, 
qualitative data, such as interviews provided in -depth insights into the perceptions and experiences of staff members, 
which helped to explain and interpret the quantitative data. 
 
3.2 Research Design 
This study used descriptive research design. A descriptive research design is an appropriate choice for a study 
investigating the effects of training and development programmes o n staff performance within the Tanzania Revenue 
Authority (TRA), Coast Region. This approach is suitable because it aimed to describe and characterize the current 
situation or phenomenon under study. In this case, the study sought to comprehend the existin g levels of staff 
performance and the impact of training and development programmes on those levels. 
 
3.3 Study Area 
This study took place at TRA Coast region. The TRA Coast region is a distinct and self -contained 
geographical area, making it easier to conduct the study within a limited scope. Through focusing on a specific region, 
the study was more comprehensive and in -depth, allowing for more accurate and reliable results. The TRA Coast 
region has a homogeneous work environment, with all employees workin g in similar roles and facing similar 
challenges. This homogeneity ensured that the study’s findings can be generalized to the entire region, making it 
easier to draw conclusions and make recommendations. 
 
3.4 Population and Sample  
3.4.1 Population 
A population is the entire group of individuals or objects that are the subject of the study. It is the group from 
which the researcher drew a sample, which is a smaller subset of the population that was studied directly (Ghauri & 
Grønhaug, 2005). The study popu lation included all operational and senior employees working at TRA Coast region 
who are 120 employees.

3.4.2 Sample 
Sampling Procedures 
In the context of this study, using simple random sampling to select operational employees ensures that each 
employee had an equal chance of being included in the sample, thus providing an unbiased representation of the entire 
operational workforce. 
On the other hand, purposive sampling involved selecting a sample based on specific characteristics or criteria 
relevant t o the research objectives. This method is often used when researcher aimed to include participants who 
possess certain qualities or experiences that are essential to the study. In this case, using purposive sampling to select 
heads of departments allows the researchers to target individuals who hold key positions and possess valuable insights 
related to the research topic. Through employing these two sampling techniques, the study aimed to gather 
comprehensive data from both operational employees and heads of departments, providing a well - rounded 
understanding of the organization’s dynamics and perspectives. 
 
Sample Size 
In research, the sample size refers to the number of individual subjects or units of analysis included in a study. 
It is a critical aspect  of experimental design and statistical analysis, as the size of the sample can influence the 
generalizability and reliability of the study's findings (Ghauri & Grønhaug, 2005). The sample size for this study was 
calculated using the Yamane (1967) formula,  considering a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5% (or 
0.05). The formula is as follows: 
n=N÷ (1+Ne2) 
Where: n= is the number of the sample (required) 
N = Total population (120) and 
e = Error tolerance (level) or margin of error (0.05) 150/ (1+120(0.05)2) = 120/1.3 
= 92 Samples 
 
3.5 Data Source 
The study used primary data namely questionnaire and interview to collect data related to effects of training 
and development program on staff performance: a case of Tanzania Revenue Authority, coast region. 
In the same trail the study used secondary data to assess effects of training and development program on staff 
performance. Using secondary data is often more cost - effective than collecting primary data. Through utilizing 
existing secondary data, researcher saved time and resources. Secondary data is readily available; saving the time that 
would otherwise be spent on collecting new data 
 
3.6 Data Collection Methods 
This study employed questionnaires to collect data from participants, surpassing the  efficiency of alternative 
methods. This technique was predominantly utilized with senior staff members to comprehensively address all 
research objectives and questions. The data gathering process involved conducting interviews with participants, posing 
a variety of questions related to the study. 
Additionally, the researcher undertook a comprehensive review of both published and unpublished documents 
that specifically address training and development programmes. This multifaceted examination encompassed a wide 
array of sources, including academic journals, conference proceedings, books, reports, and internal organizational 
documents that may not be readily available to the public. 
 
3.7 Data Analysis 
In this study, the data that were collected through questionnaire, descriptive analysis with the aid of Statistical 
Package for Social Science and Ms -Excel was used while for the data that were collected through interview; content 
analysis was used whereas quotes of the key informants were captured.  
 
IV. FINDINGS & DISCUSSIONS 
 
4.1 Existing Practice of Training and Development Programmes offered by TRA Coast Region 
The study on the first objective intended to identify existing practice of training and development programmes 
offered by TRA coast region. To answer this specific objective one, the data were gathered through questionnaire and 
interview. The respondents were asked whether the on -the-job training programmes at TRA are relevant to my job 
responsibilities. The findings are indicated in Figure 1 below as obtained from the field: -

Figure 1 
On-the-Job Training Programmes at TRA are Relevant to Job Responsibilities 
 
The findings illustrate that about 3.3% said to have strongly disagreed that the on-the-job training programmes 
at TRA are relevant to my job responsibilities as supported by other respondents with 8.7% who disagreed the same. 
In the meantime, about 15.2% were neutral while 39.1% agreed and the rest with 33.7% strongly agreed accordingly. 
Hence, it was not surprising to argue that majority of respondents agreed that the on -the-job training programmes at 
TRA were relevant to my job responsibilities. 
The findings suggest that on-the-job training at TRA allows employees to acquire specific job- related skills in 
a real work environment. Through engaging in actual tasks and responsibilities under the guidance of experienced 
mentors or supervisors, employees can develop a deeper understanding of their roles and responsibilities. This 
practical experience helps them apply theoretical knowledge gained through formal education or previous training 
sessions to real-world scenarios, thereby bridging the gap between theory and practice. 
On-the-job training programmes at TRA enable employees to familiarize themselves with the organization’s 
policies, procedures, and work culture. Through direct participation in day -to-day operations, employees gain insights 
into how tasks are executed within the organization and learn about the expectations and standards set by TRA. This 
familiarity not only enhances their job performance but also fosters a sense of belonging and commitment to the 
organization. The study findings are supported by Mwapira (2015) that on -the-job training allows employees to 
directly apply what they learn to their daily tasks. This hands -on approach reinforces learning and helps employees 
understand how to perform their job responsibilities effectively. On-the-job training programmes are customized to fit 
the specific needs of the job and the individual employee.  
The respondents were also asked whether the off -the-job training programmes offered by TRA are aligned 
with employees’ career goals. The findings are indicated in Figure 2 as obtained from the field: -
<<<PAGE=7>>>

Figure 2 
Off-the-Job Training Programmes Offered by TRA are Aligned with Employees’ Career Goals 
 
The study found that about 5.4% said to have strongly disagreed that the off -the-job training programmes 
offered by TRA are aligned with employees’ career goals as supported by other respondents with 10.9% who 
disagreed the same. Meanwhile 19.6% were neutral while 39.1% agreed and the rest with 25% strongly agreed 
accordingly. Hence, it was not surprising to argue that majority of resp ondents agreed that the off -the-job training 
programmes offered by TRA are aligned with employee’s career goals. 
The findings suggest off - the-job training programmes help employees acquire new skills and competencies 
that are relevant to their current rol es or future career progression within the organization. These programmes offer 
specialized training sessions that focus on enhancing specific skills required for job performance and career 
advancement. Through participating in off-the-job training programmes, employees broaden their knowledge base and 
expertise, which leads to increased opportunities for career advancement within the organization. TRA’s training 
initiatives are designed to equip employees with the necessary skills and qualifications to tak e on more challenging 
roles and responsibilities. Off-the-job training programmes contribute to employees’ professional growth by exposing 
them to new ideas, best practices, and industry trends. Through these programmes, employees stay abreast of 
developments in their field of work and continuously improve their professional capabilities. 
The study findings are supported by Tagesse (2018) that when training programmes are aligned with 
employees' career goals, it demonstrates to employees that the organizati on is invested in their professional 
development and growth. This can increase employee motivation and engagement as they see the training as relevant 
and beneficial to their career progression. Training programmes that are aligned with employees' career goals focus on 
developing skills and knowledge that are directly applicable to their desired career path. This ensures that employees 
are gaining relevant expertise that will help them advance in their careers. 
 
4.2 Effect of Training and Development Programmes on Employees Performance 
The study on the second objective intended to determine whether training and development programmes have 
effects on employees’ performance at TRA coast region.  In this objective, respondents were asked whether on-the-job 
training has equipped employees with the necessary skills for employee’s role. The study findings are summarized in

the-job training at the TRA is that it allows employees to learn in a real -world setting, where they can apply their 
knowledge and skills in a practical context. 
This type of training enables employees to develop a deeper understanding of their roles and responsibilities 
by working directly with experienced colleagues and supervisors. Throu gh on-the-job training, employees can gain 
valuable insights into the day -to-day operations of the TRA and learn how to navigate complex tax regulations and 
procedures. Additionally, on-the-job training at the TRA helps employees to acquire specific techni cal skills that are 
essential for carrying out their duties effectively. For example, employees may receive training on how to use 
specialized software systems for tax collection and reporting or how to conduct audits and investigations. According 
to Mwapira (2015) On Job Training allows employees to learn by doing, providing them with practical experience in 
real-world situations. This hands -on approach can be highly effective in reinforcing theoretical knowledge and 
enabling employees to understand how to  apply it in their specific job contexts. Employees immediately apply what 
they learn during on -the-job training to their daily tasks and responsibilities. This immediacy helps solidify learning 
and ensures that employees can quickly contribute to their roles without a lengthy adjustment period 
 
4.3 The Current Challenges the TRA Coast Region Experiences in Training its Employees 
In this aspect, respondents were required to state what they know regarding the statement that budget 
constraint was one of the current challenges the TRA coast region experiences in training its employees. The study 
findings are therefore summarized in Figure 5.

Time Constraint One of the Current Challenges the TRA Coast Region Experiences in Training its Employees 
 
The study revealed that 5.4% strongly disagreed that time constraint was one of the current challenges the 
TRA coast region experiences in training its employees, 22.8% disagreed and 15.2% were neutral with the statement. 
In addition to that, 27.2% agreed and 29.3% strongly agreed with the statement. About majority of respondents 
disagreed that t ime constraint was one of the current challenges the TRA coast region experiences in training its 
employees. 
The findings suggest that there is adequate budget allocated for the program, and this is due to the fact that 
adequate budget allocation ensures t hat the TRA invests in high -quality training programmes that are essential for 
enhancing the skills and knowledge of its employees. This is particularly important in a dynamic field like taxation 
where regulations and practices are constantly evolving. Thr ough allocating sufficient funds to training programmes, 
the TRA ensures that its staff members are equipped with the latest information and tools to effectively carry out their 
duties. 
Budget allocation for training programmes demonstrates the TRA’s commi tment to employee development 
and professional growth. Investing in training shows employees that the organization values their continuous learning 
and improvement, which can boost morale and motivation within the workforce. The findings of the study are 
supported by Kirigia (2017) that training programmes require resources such as trainers, materials, technology, and 
facilities. Proper budget allocation ensures that these resources are available when needed, preventing delays or 
disruptions in the training process. Adequate funding allows organizations to invest in high -quality training materials, 
technology, and instructors. This ensures that employees receive effective and relevant training that enhances their 
skills and knowledge. 
In this aspect, respondents were required to state what they know regarding the statement that time constraint 
was one of the current challenges the TRA coast region experiences in training its employees. About majority of 
respondents disagreed that time constraint was one of th e current challenges the TRA coast region experiences in 
training its employees.  
The findings suggest that TRA allocates time for the program and this is due to the fact that providing 
sufficient time for training allows employees to fully grasp and inter nalize the new information and skills being 
taught. This is especially important in a complex and dynamic field such as tax administration, where employees need 
to stay updated on changing regulations, procedures, and technologies. Rushing through training  can lead to gaps in 
knowledge and understanding, which may result in errors or inefficiencies in the workplace. Adequate time for 
training enables trainers to cover all necessary topics thoroughly and address any questions or concerns that 
participants may have. This promotes a more interactive and engaging learning experience, leading to better retention 
of information. In a specialized organization like the TRA, where accuracy and compliance are paramount, ensuring 
that employees receive comprehensive training is essential for maintaining high standards of performance.

4.4 Discussion 
On-the-job training programmes at TRA enable employees to familiarize themselves with the organization’s 
policies, procedures, and work culture. Through direct participatio n in day-to-day operations, employees gain insights 
into how tasks are executed within the organization and learn about the expectations and standards set by TRA. This 
familiarity not only enhances their job performance but also fosters a sense of belongin g and commitment to the 
organization. The study findings are supported by Mwapira (2015) that on -the-job training allows employees to 
directly apply what they learn to their daily tasks. This hands -on approach reinforces learning and helps employees 
understand how to perform their job responsibilities effectively. On-the-job training programmes are customized to fit 
the specific needs of the job and the individual employee.  
The findings suggest off - the-job training programmes help employees acquire new skills and competencies 
that are relevant to their current roles or future career progression within the organization. These programmes offer 
specialized training sessions that focus on enhancing specific skills required for job performance and career 
advancement. Through participating in off-the-job training programmes, employees broaden their knowledge base and 
expertise, which leads to increased opportunities for career advancement within the organization. TRA’s training 
initiatives are designed to equip  employees with the necessary skills and qualifications to take on more challenging 
roles and responsibilities. Off-the-job training programmes contribute to employees’ professional growth by exposing 
them to new ideas, best practices, and industry trends.  Through these programmes, employees stay abreast of 
developments in their field of work and continuously improve their professional capabilities (Licombe, 2018). 
The study findings are supported by Tagesse (2018) that when training programmes are aligned with 
employees' career goals, it demonstrates to employees that the organization is invested in their professional 
development and growth. This can increase employee motivation and engagement as they see the training as relevant 
and beneficial to their career progression. Training programmes that are aligned with employees' career goals focus on 
developing skills and knowledge that are directly applicable to their desired career path. This ensures that employees 
are gaining relevant expertise that will help them advance in their careers. 
Generally, the findings indicated that majority of respondents agreed that participating in off -the- job training 
has improved employees’ ability to handle job challenges. The findings suggest that participating in off -the-job 
training has been shown to improve employees’ ability to handle job challenges at the Tanzania Revenue Authority 
(TRA). At the Tanzania Revenue Authority, off -the-job training initiatives have been implemented to equip 
employees with the necessary skill s and expertise to navigate the complexities of their roles effectively. Through 
engaging in structured training programmes outside of their daily work responsibilities, employees have the 
opportunity to acquire new knowledge, develop critical thinking abi lities, and enhance problem -solving skills. This 
ultimately enables them to tackle job challenges with confidence and efficiency. 
The findings suggest that resistance to change is not one of the current challenges faced by the Tanzania 
Revenue Authority (TRA) in the Coast region when it comes to training its employees because one key factor is the 
TRA’s proactive approach to change management, which involves effective communication, employee involvement, 
and providing adequate support during transitions. Ad ditionally, the TRA has established a culture of continuous 
learning and development, which fosters openness to new ideas and practices among its employees. Furthermore, the 
organization emphasizes the importance of adaptability and innovation in respondin g to evolving tax policies and 
procedures, creating a mindset that embraces change as an opportunity for growth rather than a threat. According to 
Kirigia (2017) resistance to change can hinder the successful implementation of new training programmes. Employees 
may be less likely to engage with the training materials or adopt new practices if they are resistant to change. This can 
result in wasted resources and time. Training programmes are investments in the organization's human capital 
 
V. CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
5.1 Conclusions 
The study concludes that on -the-job training programmers at TRA are relevant to employees’ job 
responsibilities, and for that case the feedback received during on - the-job training is constructive. The study also 
concluded th at induction training provided by TRA Coast Region adequately familiarizes new employees with 
organizational policies and procedures. 
When looking at whether training and development programmes have effects on employees’ performance at 
TRA coast region, th e study concluded that training and development programmes have significant effect on 
employees’ performance at TRA. This is due to the fact that on -the-job training has positively impacted employees’ 
job performance while off-the-job training opportunities have enhanced employees’ overall professional development. 
With reference to challenges the TRA coast region experiences in training it employees, the study concluded 
that to a large extent, various challenges pointed out such as budget constraint, time constraint, resistance to change as 
well as lack of alignment with organizational goals do not affect training program offered at Tanzania Revenue

5.2 Recommendations 
The management of TRA should continue investing in training and development program since Training and 
development programmes leads to improved employee performance by equipping them with the necessary skills and 
knowledge to carry out their duties effectively. This results in increased productivity, efficiency, and quality of wor k 
at TRA. 
Also investing in training and development programmes demonstrates a commitment to employee growth and 
development, which can enhance job satisfaction and motivation among employees. This, in turn, contributes to higher 
employee retention rates a t TRA. Training programmes ensures that employees are well -informed about tax laws, 
regulations, and procedures, enabling them to perform their roles in compliance with legal requirements. This can help 
TRA avoid penalties or legal issues due to non-compliance.
