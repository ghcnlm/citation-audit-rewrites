Abstract 
Whilst apprenticeships are gaining momentum in the UK with extensive resources directed 
to the programme, knowledge on the factors contributing to apprentices’ professional 
development in the workplace is still limited. This research addresses this gap by introducing 
an organizational perspective that integrates the formal learning, informal learning and HRM 
literatures. In doing so, this study advances a holistic approach to apprenticeships.   
Turning the focus to the work environment as enabler of apprentices’ competence 
development, this study seeks to achieve two main objectives. Firstly, to develop and 
empirically test an apprenticeship development model that relates formal and informal 
learning factors to apprentices’ competencies. Secondly, to investigate whether important 
boundary conditions such as the HRM system at contextual level and learning goal 
orientation at individual level influence apprentices’ professional development.  
To this end, the research presents a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study complemented 
by qualitative data on a sample of 233 apprentices operating in the engineering sector in 
England. The results evidence the factors that organisations can leverage to promote 
apprentices’ development by means of formal and informal learning. Concerning the former, 
transfer design and supervisor support are critical for enabling apprentices to transfer the 
knowledge acquired at college and university to the workplace improving performance. 
Regarding the latter, challenging experiences in supportive environments, providing regular 
feedback, adequate task autonomy and task interdependence contribute to the development 
of critical competencies.  
Additionally, identifying the high-commitment HR system as the strategy for managing the 
employment relationship with apprentices, the study provides novel insight into the 
influence of HRM in apprenticeship. In finding performance appraisal to moderate the 
relationship between critical informal learning factors and performance, the study 
underscores the importance of appraisal satisfaction in fostering engagement with informal 
learning and elucidates how appropriate HR practices can promote successful 
apprenticeships. Furthermore, the study evidences how apprentices with stronger learning 
orientations achieve higher levels of competence, explaining why individuals engage 
differently with the learning opportunities provided in the immediate work environment. 
Practical implications are discussed drawing attention to the role of line managers for 
securing effective apprenticeships.

Chapter 1: 
Introduction and overview of apprenticeship in England 
 
 
1.1 Introduction 
Apprenticeship is an institution dating back to medieval times that has evolved over the 
centuries adapting to social, economic and political forces, maintaining its core features as a 
model of learning in employment. In England, apprenticeships are experiencing a revival 
and have been placed a t the core of the Government’s V ocational Education and Training 
(VET) policies so to contribute to the future skill needs in a rapidly evolving economy (Lee, 
2012; Rowe, Moss, Moore and Perrin, 2017; Saraswat, 2016).  
It is in this context of revitalisation that this research takes place, considering how in light 
of a host of related public and private investments, apprenticeships can provide optimal 
benefits to those participating in the programme. At a time of reform, the quality of 
apprenticeships has been placed under the spotlight and the relationship between the 
apprentice and the employer has risen to the fore (Department for Business, Innovation and 
Skills, 2015). These are the themes central to this research, around which an empirical model 
for apprentices’ professional development is advanced. Turning the spotlight onto the work 
environment, this research seeks to understand how apprentices’ competence develo pment 
can be supported in the workplace. This is a critical consideration given that knowledge on 
the factors enhancing apprentices’ competence development is still limited (Gambin and 
Hogarth, 2015).  
Considering apprenticeships as model of learning rather than instrument of Government 
policy (Lewis, 2014), this study seeks to achieve two main objectives. Firstly, to develop 
and empirically test an apprenticeship development model that relates training intervention 
and work environment factors to apprentic es’ resultant competencies. Secondly, to 
investigate whether important boundary conditions such as the Human Resource 
Management system (HRM) at contextual level, and learning goal orientation at individual 
level, influence apprentices’ professional development. In so doing, the research introduces 
an organisational perspective to the study of apprenticeship providing novel insights into the 
phenomenon.

Before introducing the theoretical framework of the study, this chapter starts with a brief 
historical analysis of how the institution of apprenticeship has evolved in England over the 
last decades. A historical overview is warrant ed to set the scene for the most recent policy 
developments, highlighting how apprenticeships have evolved over time as a result of the 
tensions between its use as a model of learning, as a vehicle for employers’ needs, and as an 
instrument of State policy (Fuller and Unwin, 2009). In light of the prominent role assigned 
to employers in apprenticeship, the chapter reviews the introduction of the Modern 
Apprenticeship scheme and the most recent policy reform, highlighting the centrality of the 
relationship between the employer and the apprentice with implications for the effectiveness 
of the programme.  
After briefly presenting a pict ure of apprentices’ participation rates and evaluating the 
benefits and motivations leading both apprentices and employers to participate in the 
programme, the chapter introduces the organisational perspective to the study of 
apprenticeship. In so doing, the chapter introduces the research question guiding the project 
and the framework of the study. Ultimately, the main contributions of the study and the 
organisation of the thesis are outlined.   
 
1.2 Historical review  
Apprenticeship is once again at the heart of policy reform in England, and it is therefore 
important to understand how this model of learning has evolved over time as an institutional 
and social practice. As argued by Fuller and Unwin (2009), whilst maintaining its principle 
feature of model of learning, distinct vested interests have transformed the institution of 
apprenticeship with implications for its quality as a method of skill formation, personal 
development and employer needs. A historical overview of apprenticeship therefore requires 
a deliberation of how apprenticeships have been transformed over time to respond to social, 
economic and political forces, overlooking its underlying principles.  
A brief consideration of the evolution of apprenticeship since the medieval period and the 
industrial revolution is here necessitated to review how apprenticeships have undergone 
processes of regulation and deregulation with consequences for the quality of the 
programme. With apprenticeship originating in the Middle Ages, Snell (1996) presents three 
phases spanning apprenticeship temporal dimensions, with ‘guild apprenticeships’ up until 
1563; ‘statutory apprenticeship’ between 1563 and 1814; and ‘voluntary apprenticeship’
<<<PAGE=19>>>
3 
 
from 1814 onwards. The first phase saw apprenticeship as an integral part of the guild 
system, whilst the second phase saw apprenticeship as being increasingly regulated by the 
State, and the latter as an arrangement between employers and unions.  
Since the 12th century apprentices were bounded to a master for the purpose of learning a 
trade and were characterised by ‘time serving’, learning a craft observing a skilled master 
and participating in production (Rikowski, 1999). The 1563 Statute of Artificers established 
that written indentures had to be drawn, laying the rights and duties of apprentices, parents 
or guardians and employers. It also forbade anyone from exercising a trade without 
completing a 7 years apprenticeship, indicating the Government recognition of 
apprenticeship as a social practice and its intent to regulate it (Rikowski, 1999). As argued 
by Fuller and Unwin (2009), the Statute of Artificers is important in representing the 
Government engagement in apprenticeship until its repeal in 1814, the year marking the start 
of an unregulated approach to VET which among other factors contributed to apprenticeship 
decline. The practice of indentures was indeed abandoned at a time of industrialisation and 
urbanisation, coinciding with an increase in low skilled occupations requiring no training 
and formation via apprenticeship, and with the introduction of compulsory education 
(Rikowski, 1999).  
While apprenticeship subsequently went through a revival during the 1950s and 1960s with 
public and private corporations employing apprentices in large numbers, the lack of State 
regulation along with conflicting industrial relations and increased public investments in 
general education, hindered its consistency as a sustainable model of learning (Fuller and 
Unwin, 2009). The economic crisis of the 1970s and the collapse of traditional industries 
saw apprentices’ number in stark decline and youth unemployment on the rise (Allen and 
Ainley, 2014).  
As reported by Fuller and Unwin, the Government responded to the social crisis with the 
introduction of youth training schemes (YTS), described as ‘essentially a cheaper version of 
apprenticeship’ (2009, pp. 409). The scholars note how YTS were government-funded work 
experience programmes, lasting between 1 and 2 years and leading to level 2 National 
Vocational Qualifications ( NVQs); additionally, in line with the traditionally unregulated 
approach to training, YTS maintained a voluntarist approach for employers. But the most 
important observation, is that the introduction of YTS in the UK marked the transition from 
an employer-led to a State- and training provider-led apprenticeship system, with the State
<<<PAGE=20>>>

becoming the real employer and with employers adopting a passive role as training providers 
dealt with training and assessment (Fuller and Unwin, 2009).  
The introduction of YTS in the 1970s and 1980s is presented by the scholars as training 
programmes that would in the long run degrade the quality of apprenticeship as in ‘(1) 
separating the recruitment of young people from long-term business needs; (2) divesting 
employers of the responsibility for training; and (3) diluting the concept of apprenticeship to 
mean little more than work experience.’ (Fuller and Unwin, 2009: 411). These 
considerations are central to the most recent policy developments (i.e. Richard Review, 
2012) which, as described later, have addressed the shortcomings of apprenticeship as a 
model of learning in employment, and present the background into which Modern 
Apprenticeship was introduced.  
1.2.1 Modern Apprenticeship 
Modern Apprenticeship was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1994 as an 
attempt to revive apprenticeship following its stark reduction since the economic recession 
and manufacturing decline of the 1960s, and since YTS absorbed much of its provision over 
1970s and 1980s (Fuller and Unwin, 2007). The launch of the Modern Apprenticeship 
programme represents the renewed interest by the Government in apprenticeship as an 
institution and as an instrument of social policy, fitting an agenda of economic-growth, skill 
development and controlled youth unemployment (Fuller and Unwin, 2009).  
Modern Apprenticeship was available to 16-25 year olds as a programme of training leading 
to level 3 NVQ qualifications. In 2000 level 2 YTS were rebranded as foundation 
apprenticeships in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and since 2004 both Level 2 
(foundation) and Level 3 (advanced) apprenticeship were branded as ‘Apprenticeship’ 
(Fuller and Unwin, 2007). As reported by Gospel and Fuller (1998), Modern Apprenticeship 
included traditional and new elements. As in traditional apprenticeships, the programme was 
a model of learning in employment including training both on- and off-the-job. In line with 
the tradition of indentures, the apprenticeship was regulated by agreements between the 
apprentice and the employer, with the former working for a reduced wage in exchange of 
training in an occupation. However, whilst traditionally the costs of training were shared 
between the apprentice and the employer, Modern Apprenticeship relied on public funds 
introducing the State as a third stakeholder.

A major implication of Modern Apprenticeship is the substitution of ‘time-serving’ with the 
introduction of competency-based NVQs and core skills specified in industry frameworks 
as proof of the apprenticeship successful completion (Gospel and Fuller, 1998). With various 
apprenticeship levels, completion of a level 2 apprenticeship is normally associated with a 
semi-skilled worker, with most occupation requiring a level 3 apprenticeship to be classified 
as skilled, and Higher Apprenticeships at level 4 and above introduced in 2006 (Oultram, 
2012). Additionally, Modern Apprenticeship has been made available in a vast range of new 
sectors such as retailing, health and social care, providing access to large numbers of female 
apprentices, whilst traditional apprenticeships in manufacturing, construction and 
engineering attracted mainly males (Fuller and Unwin, 2003a).  
Modern Apprenticeship saw increased State intervention, with the Government appointing 
National Training Organisations (NTOs) to design Modern Apprenticeship frameworks for 
each sector, requiring apprentices to have employed-status and train to a minimum level 3 
NVQ and key skill units (Fuller and Unwin, 2003a). However, as noted by Fuller and Unwin 
(2003a), despite the attempt to regulate apprenticeship ensuring rigour and consistency, the 
lack of legislation in the UK resulted in hundreds of apprenticeship frameworks 
characterised by differences in level and duration of training, qualifications attained and pay. 
Only fifteen years after the introduction of Modern Apprenticeship the Government enacted 
legislation in the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act (ASCL) of 2009, the 
first statute to set the apprenticeship minimum requirements since the repeal of the Statute 
of Artificers in 1814. The ASCL also established the National Apprenticeship Service 
(NAS), the dedicated government agency in England monitoring apprenticeship standards , 
and the Skill Funding Agency (SFA) overseen by the Department for Business Innovation 
and Skills (DBIS), responsible for apprenticeship funding.  
In 2011 the Specification of Apprenticeship Standards in England (SASE) set the statutory 
requirements that apprenticeship frameworks must follow, and compliance with the SASE 
is a statutory requirement of the ASCL Act. The document identifies the minimum number 
of Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) credits required for each apprenticeship 
level, including competence and technical knowledge elements; a list of ‘Functional Skills’ 
requirements including English, Math and Information and Communications Technology 
(ICT); Employee Rights and Responsibilities (ERR) outcomes; a list of Personal Learning 
and Thinking Skills (PLTS); and the minimum number of Guided Learning Hours (GLH),
<<<PAGE=22>>>
6 
 
set at a minimum of 280, of which at least 100 or 30% (whichever is the greater) delivered 
off-the-job.  
Although the SASE has been set to ensure that every apprenticeship provides competence in 
an occupation, underpinned by theoretical knowledge and transferable skills, scholars have 
found great variation among frameworks sets at the same level, questionable educational 
rigour and limited progression to higher education (Fuller and Unwin, 2011). Despite the 
introduction of legislation regulating the programme, apprenticeships in England present 
stark dissimilarities ranging from highly selective apprenticeships providing individuals 
with access to well-remunerated careers as in the engineering sector, to shorter programmes 
as in retailing with limited training and prospects for academic or professional progression.  
It is therefore apparent that the regulatory focus underpinning Modern Apprenticeship is 
grounded in an agenda of social inclusion and economic growth, and that the 
apprenticeship’s historical foundations hinder the rigorousness of the programme and 
undermine the role played by employers.  The next section discusses how the restoration of 
Modern Apprenticeship has contributed to diluting the centrality of the relationship between 
the apprentice and the employing organisation, with implications for the quality of 
contemporary apprenticeships.  
1.2.2 The role of employers in Modern Apprenticeship  
The review of Modern Apprenticeship has highlighted how the State has engaged with 
apprenticeship since the early 1990s regulating apprenticeship standards and funding. 
Apprenticeship has increasingly been used as an instrument of government policy, with the 
aim of raising the country’s level of skills and controlling youth unemployment (Fuller and 
Unwin, 2009). Increased state intervention has changed the dynamics of Apprenticeship as 
a method of skill formation traditionally led by employers. As reported by Fuller and Unwin 
(2003a, pp. 9):  
‘Apprenticeships of the past were demand rather than supply-led. Employers decided 
when and if they needed apprentices. Today, the agencies of government orchestrate 
apprenticeship recruitment, supported by local networks of training providers.’ 
The use of apprenticeship as an instrument of state policy has therefore distanced the 
relationship between the apprentice and the employer, with training providers taking a 
leading role in Modern Apprenticeship. As reported by Fuller and Unwin (2007), a very 
small proportion of employers is in charge of their apprenticeship training contracting 
directly with state agencies to gain funding, whilst the large majority of employers contracts
<<<PAGE=23>>>
7 
 
with training providers (TP) acting as intermediaries. This has led to a situation where 
apprentices are employed and receive a wage from their employer, but the training is 
conducted and administered by the TP.  
As defined by Laurie (2013), TP are external organisations encompassing FE, Sixth Form 
and special colleges, schools or Private Training Providers, but also some large employers, 
receiving public funds from the SFA to provide training. With vocational education and 
training becoming increasingly ‘marketised’ (Fuller and Unwin, 2009), the role of employers 
in apprenticeship has been progressively marginalised as these have come to act as customers 
to the TP (Oultram, 2012). The latter playing an intermediary role between the Government, 
employers and apprentices, deal with the educational and administrative aspects of the 
programme, and act as major point of contact for the apprentice. Additionally, TP play an 
important role in persuading employers to hire apprentices, even when the organisation does 
not present a real business need, promising to deal with apprentices’ recruitment, selection 
and training (Fuller and Unwin, 2003a). As observed by Laurie (2013), the development of 
markets in the delivery of VET has led to the ‘commodification’ of apprenticeship, with 
organisations such as TP profiting from the delivery of apprenticeship training via 
government funding.  
Among the factors contributing to distancing the relationship between the apprentice and the 
employer are ‘Apprenticeship Training Agencies’ (ATA) acting as recruitment and 
employment agencies for apprentices. As reported by Allen and Ainley (2014), ATAs play 
a ‘middleman’ role, employing apprentices and hiring them out to host employers. Under 
this arrangement, if the host employer is unable to retain the apprentice for the full term of 
the apprenticeship, the agency as the main employer provides the apprentice with an 
alternative host employer in order to complete the programme (Allen and Ainley, 2014). 
Whilst under this arrangement, employment remains key to the apprenticeship, the 
relationship between the apprentice and the host employer is undermined by the prominent 
role of the agency.  
These examples reflect the commodification of apprenticeship which, as observed by Laurie 
(2013) enables organisations such as ATAs and TP to profit from its trade, contributing to: 
‘distancing apprenticeship from the best practices of learning embedded within 
companies, the ‘expansive apprenticeship’  (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b, 2008), as 
apprenticeship is seen as a way to tap into additional financial resources’  (Laurie, 
2013, pp. 46).
<<<PAGE=24>>>
8 
 
The commodification of apprenticeship has therefore changed the role played by employers 
breaking with the tradition of apprenticeship as an investment in the organisation future 
talent, and has resulted in TP opening the door to apprentices in organisations that lack the 
infrastructure required to support their learning journey. As argued by Fuller and Unwin 
(2007, 2009) only those organisations which regard apprenticeship as central to their 
business strategy have put in place the structures to form, support and nurture apprentices. 
The State ’s striving to increase apprentices’ partici pation rates, regardless of employers 
demand for intermediate skills, has proven problematic given the weak relationship between 
apprenticeship and occupation, especially in sectors such as business, retail and health care 
which lack a tradition of apprenticeship (Fuller and Unwin, 2003a).  
As discussed by Fuller and Unwin (2003a), the UK multi-sector and social inclusion 
approach to apprenticeship has contributed to distancing the relationship between the 
apprentice and the employer, reinforcing the role of third parties such as TP, with 
implications for the apprenticeship as a model of learning. Whilst the most recent 
Government policies (i.e. Richard Review, 2012) have focused on addressing employers’ 
engagement aiming to increase businesses’ participatio n rates, the role and contribution o f 
employers to apprenticeship has also featured highly. The next section considers the current 
apprenticeship reform, evaluating how this new wave of State intervention addresses the 
shortcomings outlined above attempting to revive the role of employers in what has 
traditionally been an employer-led programme.   
 
1.3 Apprenticeship reform 
 
The Richard Review (2012), commissioned by the Department for Business Innovation and 
Skills, drives the current English apprenticeship reform set to redefine the apprenticeship 
system. The reform tackles the inadequacy of qualifications in proving apprentices ’ 
competencies and stresses the need to deliver job competence along with transferable skills 
responding to a dynamic economy. More crucially, the reform aims to address the 
relationship between employers and apprentices, as stated in the Richard Review (2012, 
pp.4): 
‘whereas historically, an apprenticeship was at its very heart a relationship between 
an employer and an apprentice, too often that is not the case today – apprenticeships 
instead becoming a government-led training programme, shaped by training 
professionals not employers. The relationship between an employer and an 
apprentice must once again rise to the fore.’
<<<PAGE=25>>>
9 
 
This statement reflects the issues previously discussed in relation to the commodification of 
apprenticeship (Laurie, 2013) and the leading role of TP as apprenticeship has increasingly 
become an instrument of government policy (Fuller and Unwin, 2009). The restructuring of 
the apprenticeship system is the overriding aim of the reform whereby employers lead and 
drive apprenticeships and training providers act as suppliers of training. An additional and 
interrelated phenomenon addressed by Doug Richard is the imprope r application of the 
apprenticeship model to forms of training that are either mere work experience to support 
entry into employment, or forms of on-the-job training where an employee is apprentic ed 
for accrediting existing skills or undergoing training. At the centre of the reform is thus the 
redefinition of apprenticeship as in:  
 
‘An Apprenticeship is a job that requires substantial and sustained training, leading 
to the achievement of an Apprenticeship standard and the development of 
transferable skills.’ 
 
This definition is underpinned by four principles:  
  
 an Apprenticeship is a job, in a skilled occupation  
 
 an Apprenticeship requires substantial and sustained training, lasting a minimum 
of 12 months and including off-the-job training  
 
 an Apprenticeship leads to full competency in an occupation, demonstrated by the 
achievement of an Apprenticeship standard that is defined by employers and  
 
 an Apprenticeship develops transferable skills , including English and maths, to 
progress careers.’ (BIS, 2013, pp. 9).  
 
Key to the reform is the focus of apprenticeships on employer needs, guaranteed by placing 
employers in charge of defining apprenticeship standards. Employer groups called 
trailblazers are developing apprenticeship standards that indicate the knowledge, skills and 
behaviours required to undertake a particular occupation and operate confidently in a sector 
(Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2015). Apprenticeship standards are 
expected to progressively replace the existing apprenticeship frameworks from 2017-18 
onwards. Additionally, degree apprenticeships leading to attainment of a Bachelor’s or 
Master’s Degree have been gradually introduced since 2015 as an alternative to the 
traditional academic courses (Saraswat, 2016). Furthermore, the funding of apprenticeships 
has changed with the introduction of the apprenticeship levy in April 2017. The levy 
represents a new business tax for large public and private employers, amounting to around
<<<PAGE=26>>>
10 
 
2% of businesses in the UK. The levy is payable on annual pay bills of more than £3 million 
and by 2019/20 funds raised with the levy along with government public funds are expected 
to double the level of spending on apprenticeship in 2010/11 (House of Commons Library, 
March 2016). In routing government funding via employers the reform aims to raise the 
quality of training, giving employers purchasing power over the content and quality of 
training delivered by training providers.  
Overall the reform aims to increase the quality of apprenticeships as model of learning in 
employment, and is expected to reduce semi-skilled (level 2) apprenticeships and generate 
more programmes at level 3 and above leading to high skill jobs (Fuller and Unwin, 2012) . 
With participation rates rising, the reform aims to secure greater employer ownership and 
high quality training to ensure apprenticeships contribute to the highly skilled workforce 
required for competitiveness (BIS, 2015). 
 
1.4 Apprenticeship profile in England  
Having presented the institutional context of apprenticeships in England, an overview of the 
apprenticeship profile and an evaluation of the motives leading apprentices and employers 
to engage in the programme follows.  
1.4.1 Apprenticeship starts  
Over 3.4 million apprenticeship starts between the academic years 2010/11 and 2016 /17 
and 1.5 million apprenticeship completions between 2010/11 and 2015 /16 (House of 
Commons Library, January 2018) confirm the popularity of apprenticeships in England. 
Figures presented in a parliament’s briefing paper in November 2016 (House of Commons 
Library, November 2016), indicate that in 2015/16 there was an increase of 9,500 
apprenticeship starts in comparison to the previous year, with a total of 509,400 
apprenticeship starts.  
As indicated in Table 1.1, apprenticeship starts increased starkly between the years 2009/10 
and 2010/11 amounting to a 63% increase following considerable Government investments 
in the programme. With the only exception of the academic year 2013/14 which saw around 
440, 000 starts, apprenticeship starts levelled to approximately 500, 000 per year up to 
2015/16. Most recent figures reveal that in the academic year 2016/17 there were 491,300 
apprenticeship starts, representing a reduction of 18,100 starts from the previous year.

House of Commons Library, 2016, 2018 
 
As reported in a parliamentary briefing paper in January 2018 (House of Commons Library, 
January 2018), the stark reduction in apprenticeship starts concentrates in the last quarter of 
2016/17 following the introduction of the Apprenticeship levy in May 2017 in accordance 
with the funding reform.  
Remarkably, the academic year 2015/16 saw the highest volume of achievements with 
271,700 apprentices completing the programme (House of Commons Library, 2018). In line 
with the overall positive trend, the Government has made a commitment to 3 million new 
apprenticeship starts in England between the years 2015 and 2020.  
Starts by age  
Apprenticeships are available from the age of 16, and since 2004/05 they have been made 
available to people aged over 24 with no upper age restriction. As indicated in Table 1.2, 
apprentices aged over 25 have increased since 2009/10 and have come to represent a large 
proportion of all apprentices. In the academic year 2016/17 46% of apprenticeship starts 
were aged 25 and over, 29% were aged between 19 and 24, and only 25% were aged unde r 
19 (House of Commons Library, January 2018).  
Notably, figures reported for the first quarter of the academic year 2017/18 reveal a different 
trend with 41% of apprenticeship starts aged under 19, 30% aged between 19 and 24 and 
29% aged 25 and over (House of Commons Library, January 2018). The figures indicate that 
the first quarter of the academic year tend to have a higher percentage of apprenticeship 
starts aged under 19, revealing that young school leavers progress from school onto an 
apprenticeship.

Starts by level 
As indicated in Table 1.3, the largest proportion of apprenticeships starts is at level 2. 
However, since 2011/12 apprenticeship starts at advanced and higher levels have steadily 
increased, from 37% in 2011/12 to 47% in 2016/17. More specifically, in the academic year 
2016/17, 53% of apprenticeship starts were at intermediate level, 40% were at advanced 
level and 7% at higher level. This represents a 12% decrease in intermediate apprenticeship 
starts over the last 4 years. As reported by the House of Commons Library (January 2018), 
the number of higher apprenticeship starts has risen from 20,000 in 2014/15 to 36,000 in 
2016/17 revealing a generally positive trend.

Starts by sector and framework  
The sectors attracting the majority of apprenticeship starters in 2015/16 were: Business, 
Administration and Law; Health, Public Services and Care; and Retail and Commercial 
Enterprise, representing 71% of the apprenticeship starts (House of Commons Library, 
November 2016). Similar figures were reported for the academic year 2016/17 with 86% of 
all apprenticeship starts found in four subject areas encompassing Health, Public Services 
and Care; Business, Administration and Law; Retail and Commercial Enterprise; 
Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies. Notably, the first two areas account for over 
half of apprenticeship starts.  
Although in 2016/17 95% of apprenticeship starts were on frameworks, there were around 
23,700 starts on apprenticeship standards, corresponding to an increase of 20,000 from the 
previous year (House of Commons Library, 2018). As indicated in Table 1.4, the most 
popular frameworks in 2016/17 reflect the popularity of the service sectors outlined above.

Starts by gender 
Whilst apprenticeship in sectors as engineering and construction have traditionally attracted 
mainly male apprentices, when considering the total number of apprentices in England 
across all sectors, women represent an important figure (Table 1.5). In the academic year 
2015/16, 53% of apprenticeship starters were indeed female, reflecting the expansion of 
frameworks in the service sectors. Figures that are more recent confirm this trend with 54% 
of women apprenticeship starts in 2016/17 accounting for 262,820 (House of Commons 
Library, January 2018).  Overall, the percentage of women starting an apprenticeship has 
been higher than the percentage of man since the academic year 2010/11.

1.4.2 Apprentices’ motivations and satisfaction 
The national survey conducted by Vivian and colleagues (2012) and commissioned by the 
Department for Business, Innovation & Skills is important in providing an understanding of 
the factors attracting apprentices to the programme and the overall level of satisfaction. The 
survey identified the principal motivator for engaging with apprenticeship as in the desire to 
progress with one career (48% of respondents). Acquiring a qualification (35% of 
respondents) and the opportunity to be paid whilst in training (13% of respondents) were 
also reported as factors attracting apprentices into the programme. As noted by the scholars, 
the motivators are linked to the entry route into the apprenticeship, as those already 
employed were predominantly motivated by the achievement of a qualification, whilst new 
recruits were motivated by the opportunity of a career.  
Further research investigating the views of young learners and parents on the attractiveness 
of vocational education reveals that apprenticeships still retain a low status imagine in 
comparison to the traditional academic pathway (i.e. Chartered Institute of Personnel and 
Development, 2013; Swift and Fisher, 2012). However, findings of the CIPD (2013) indicate
<<<PAGE=31>>>
15 
 
that apprenticeships are generally perceived as a good career choice among parents, but more 
information is needed to reinforce the public views on apprenticeship as a reputable form of 
education.  
When considering reported levels of satisfaction with apprenticeship, the survey conducted 
by Vivian and colleagues (2012) on a sample of 5,000 respondents in England found 
relatively high levels of satisfaction. More specifically, 89% of respondents reported to be 
satisfied and 71% to be very satisfied with the programme, whilst only 4% expressed 
dissatisfaction. This latter category identified lack of support from the TP, poor 
communication and organisation from the TP, and little support or training from the 
employer as main reasons for dissatisfaction. It is important to note that low satisfaction 
levels were associated with short duration apprenticeships (less than 6 months) or situations 
where the apprenticeship had been required by the employer.  
Satisfaction levels also varied among frameworks, with those undertaking apprenticeships 
in Construction, Planning and Built Environment reporting highest levels, and those in 
Health, Public Services and Care and Leisure, Travel and Tourism reporting lower levels of 
satisfaction. However, Vivian and colleagues (2012) note that differences in satisfaction 
levels are associated with apprentices’ characteristics such as age and type of contract. In 
some frameworks satisfaction levels were higher for younger apprentices, whilst across most 
frameworks satisfaction levels were lower for those employed on a fixed-term contract, those 
undertaking short duration apprenticeships and those undertaking the apprenticeship because 
required by the employer.  
The survey identified positive attitudes towards the level of training received, the quality of 
assessment and the quality of feedback (Vivian et al., 2012). Variation was however found 
among frameworks, with apprentices in Construction, Planning and the Built Environment, 
as well as those in Agriculture, Horticulture and Animal Care satisfied with the provision of 
skills relevant and applicable to their job, whilst those in Business, Administration and Law 
and Retail and Commercial Enterprise being satisfied with the quality of training, but not 
with the transferability of skills to the workplace.  
Vivian and colleagues (2012) also found good levels of satisfaction (80%) with the amount 
of training received and with the balance between training and working (83%). Whilst the 
survey found generally positive attitudes among apprentices about the role of employers in 
supporting them, it found that existing employees received less support from the employer
<<<PAGE=32>>>
16 
 
in the structure, delivery and content of the apprenticeship. Negative attitudes towards 
employers’ support for those apprentices who had been asked by the employer to undertake 
the programme, also suggest that in these cases employees had been apprenticed only to 
accredit existing skills, with minimal engagement from their employer (Vivian et al., 2012). 
An important finding is that most apprentices (84%) reported that the apprenticeship had 
provided them with the knowledge and skills required in their current or desired area of 
work, and 81% found the apprenticeship to have improved their career prospects. Whilst 
young apprentices were more likely to report skills improvements as a result of the 
programme, those who were doing the apprenticeship to get a qualification and certify 
existing skills, were less likely to do so. 
Improved skill levels were associated with particular aspects of the apprenticeship 
programme, as the duration of at least 12 months, the quality and amount of training 
received, and support from the employer. Those who were dissatisfied with these aspects of 
the programme were indeed more likely to report lower levels of skill improvements. The 
survey found variations among frameworks in relation to the impact of the apprenticeship 
on skills improvement, however the scholars noted that frameworks reporting low skills 
improvement, such as Business, Administration and Law, attracted mainly existing 
employees rather than new recruits (Vivian et al., 2012).  
These findings are significant in identifying the quality of training and the role of employers 
in apprenticeships as important factors for the success of the programme in improving 
apprentices’ knowledge and skills. Ove rall the findings present a positive picture of 
apprenticeship as a valid method of skill formation, drawing attention on areas in need of 
improvement addressed by the current reform (Richard Review, 2012).  
1.4.3 Employers’ motivations and benefits  
A study conducted by Winterbotham and colleagues (2012) on a sample of 4,075 employers 
in England with staff completing an apprenticeship over the course of the previous 18 
months reveals good levels of satisfaction with apprenticeships and good propensity to 
recommend the programme to others. Notably, employers reported to value all elements of 
the apprenticeship, with 78% of respondents finding the competency element (accredited by 
an NVQ) as the most relevant, and transferable skills rated as the least valuable, although 
60% of the sample rated them as very valuable. The knowledge element accredited by a 
technical certificate was rated as very valuable by 72% of the sample, and was particularly

of value to employers in Engineering and Manufacturing Technology, and Construction, 
Planning and the Built Environment.  
Research indicates that employers derive notable benefits from engaging with apprenticeship 
and these are linked to the reasons for recruiting apprentices. The study conducted by 
Winterbotham and colleagues (2012) found around two-thirds of respondents to report 
improved productivity, improved staff morale, improved product or service, improved image 
in the sector, better staff retention and the introduction of new ideas into the organisation.  
These findings are in line with those presented in the Fifth Net Benefits of Training to 
Employers Study conducted by Hogarth and colleagues (2012a) for the Department for 
Business, Innovation and Skills. The research, based on around 80 employer case studies in 
various sectors, including engineering, construction, retail, hospitality, business and 
administration, reveals that employers benefit from an inflow of young people to the 
organisation, the introduction of new skills to be shared with the workforce, an optimal fit 
between skills and business needs, staff motivation and retention and improved profile in the 
local community. When considering the motivators inducing employers to offer 
apprenticeship, employers indicated the provision of skills required in an occupation as the 
main reason, but also a history of engaging with apprenticeship, the willingness to bring 
young people into the organisation, the preference to train their own workforce and meet a 
fit between skills and business needs (Hogarth et al., 2012a).  
It is important to note that variations were found between sectors, with employers in 
engineering and construction regarding apprenticeship as a licence to practice, hence a 
formal requirement for new recruits, and those in retail and hospitality providing workplace 
learning to existing employees in light of high levels of turnover in the sector, hence as a 
strategy for staff retention. When considering the costs faced by employers, those operating 
in construction and engineering and offering formal training over the course of a three to 
four year period reported the higher net costs. In contrast, sectors such as retail which 
provided lower level, on-the-job and short duration training, encountered much lower costs. 
Overall Hogarth and colleagues (2012a) estimated that employers are able to recoup such 
costs over a relatively short period, ranging between one and two years from the end of the 
training, provided that the trainee remains with the organisation.  
Both studies reveal that employers engaging in apprenticeship report significant benefits, 
and although variations were identified among sectors, satisfaction with and commitment to

the programme are relatively high. Having reviewed the institutional context and the profile 
of apprenticeships in England, the focus turns to the research outlooks on apprenticeship 
considering how the phenomenon has been investigated in various disciplines.  
 
1.5 Research outlooks on apprenticeship  
The literature highlights different aspects of apprenticeships. Educational research (i.e. 
Esmond, 2018; Fuller and Unwin, 2009; Mazenod, 2016) has considered how the 
institutional arrangements within particular education and training systems shape 
apprentices’ learning experience with implications for educational progressio n and career 
prospects. Recently, Mazenod (2016) examined how national education and training system 
influence the learning quality of apprenticeships. In comparing the English, French and 
Finnish apprenticeships, Mazenod (2016) discusses how national education systems 
determine particular conceptualisations of apprenticeship as education or training. Her study 
highlights how the cultural-historical, political and institutional context plays a determinant 
role in shaping vocational education (i.e. Mulder, Messman and Konig, 2015). Similarly, 
Jorgensen (2017) reviews progression from apprenticeship to higher education within an 
historical perspective considering policy implications in Denmark. Others have investigated 
issues of race and ethnicity (Avis, Orr and Warmington, 2017) analysing participation and 
experiences of minority ethnic students in VET. A proliferation of publications has 
considered policy developments, participation and completion rates, along with social and 
economic benefits of apprenticeships (Abdel-Wahab, 2012; Chankseliani and Relly, 2012; 
Hogarth, Gambin and Hasluck, 2012b; Lee, 2012). Altogether, these studies are important 
in advancing the understanding of the context in which apprenticeships take place presenting 
the cultural-historical, political and institutional background to the study of apprenticeships 
as particular model of learning (Mulder, Messman and Konig, 2015).  
Another stream of research has adopted a process-based outlook on apprenticeships 
considering how apprentices learn and develop into competent professionals, although from 
disparate perspectives. Most recent studies range from identity construction (Brockmann and 
Laurie, 2016), apprentices’ social integration during organisational entry (Nagele and 
Neuenschwander, 2016), to apprentices’ sense of belonging as determinant of commitment 
and engagement (Chan, 2016). Lately, Moon (2018) explored the processes and activities 
that contribute to apprentices’ professional development from onboarding to proficiency, 
furthering the understanding of how apprentices acquire knowledge and skills. Drawing
<<<PAGE=35>>>
19 
 
from cognitive apprenticeship and situated learning theories, Moon (2018) identifies 
effective learning activities that enable apprentices’ professional development including 
training, scaffolding, brainstorming and empowerment.  
Other studies centred on the learning process in apprenticeship have investigated how 
mimesis, learning through observation, imitation and practice contributes to learning a trade 
(Chan, 2015) and how the social context of the apprenticeships contributes to experiencing 
a sense of thriving (Conway and Foskey, 2015). The widely acknowledged expansive-
restrictive framework of apprenticeship advanced by Fuller and Unwin (2003b) considers 
how the work environment enables apprentices’ learning and the development of an 
occupational identity positioned towards a clear career projection. Among the key features 
contributing to an expansive apprenticeship, the scholars identify the explicit status of the 
apprentice as learner, access to formal training, the opportunity to participate in multiple 
communities of practice and clear career progression.  
Overall, these studies share commonalities and are complementary in relation to explaining 
the phenomenon of apprenticeship. Although addressing different research questions, these 
studies share the view that learning in apprenticeship is embedded within the work context 
and involves both participation in practice and social interaction. Various theoretical 
frameworks have informed this research. The work of Fuller and Unwin (2003b) draws on 
situated learning in communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991) a nd Engestrom’s 
activity theory (1994); more recently, the study of Poortman, Illeris and Nieuwenhuis (2011) 
on apprenticeships in the Netherlands elaborates on Illeris’ (2003) workplace learning theory 
in comprising a cognitive, a social and an emotional dimension. In researching collective 
guidance in apprenticeships, Filliettaz (2011) adopts a Vygotskian perspective in assuming 
psychological development as resulting from interactions with the cultural environment and 
from experienced individuals, and refers to the work of Billett (2001) as central workplace 
learning theory. The latter has recently reviewed the theoretical foundations of 
apprenticeship as model of learning, providing a rich account of how learning in 
apprenticeships arises from a practice curriculum and how it can be enhanced by practice 
pedagogies (Billett, 2016).  
Government commissioned research project s in England have evaluated the quality of 
apprenticeships adopting various indicators (Gambin, 2013). The most informative study 
conducted by Vivian and colleagues (2012) considered the balance between formal and
<<<PAGE=36>>>
20 
 
informal learning, asking apprentices whether they had received either or both forms of 
training and enquiring about the duration of such training. An important finding is that 
apprenticeships that do not offer any training or last less than six months are less likely to 
improve apprentices’ knowledge and skills and impact on the ability to perform the job. As 
reported by Gambin (2013), subjective measurements to estimate the quality of 
apprenticeships enquired about satisfaction with the amount of training received, the balance 
between training and working, the quality of feedback and assessment from TP, and 
employer involvement with the programme (Vivian et al., 2012). Overall, these reports 
present an overview of apprentices’ satisfaction with the programme and identify critical 
elements related to the structure of apprenticeships.  
Whilst such research has its value, the dominant outlook has been on the educational and 
policy elements of apprenticeships giving primacy to the apprenticeship institutional 
arrangements. Considering that employers are critical actors in the apprenticeship tripartite 
system along with the government and educational institutions, an organisational perspective 
to the study of apprenticeship is here introduced turning the focus onto the work environment 
as enabler of appr entices’ professional development. In so doing, this study addresses the 
critical need to advance knowledge on the factors enhancing apprentices’ competence 
development in the workplace. As discussed by Gambin and Hogarth (2015), apprenticeship 
policy and research has predominantly focused on the motives leading apprentices and 
employers to participate in the programme and on the returns available, overlooking the 
factors that during the apprenticeship contribute to its success. This research extends 
knowledge on this gap and directing attention to apprentices’ experiences in the workplace 
responds to recent calls for studies investigating the organisational conditions that foster 
apprentices’ engagement with workplace  learning (Moon, 2018). Accordingly, the 
foundational argument of this thesis is that introducing an organisational perspective to the 
study of apprenticeship can expand our understanding of the factors supporting apprentices’ 
professional development in the workplace and therefore ensure the success of the 
programme. These are imperative considerations in light of the expansion of apprenticeships 
in England and the host of public and private investments directed to the programme (BIS, 
2015).

1.6 Introducing an organisational perspective on apprenticeship  
In focusing on apprenticeship as model of learning in employment this research investigates 
apprentices’ experiences in the workplace. Considering that apprenticeships are classified as 
jobs (BIS, 2015) and in light of the fact that apprentices spend a considerable proportion of 
their time in the workplace provide a prima facie case for an organisational study of 
apprenticeships. Despite extensive research on the topic of apprenticeships, there exist no 
comprehensive theory that systematically explores how apprentices can be supported in the 
workplace to develop into competent professionals. Noting that apprentices undergo formal 
training at college and University whilst being employed full time, this research draws on 
the training transfer and the informal learning domain to explore and clarify the factors 
fostering apprentices’ competence development. In so doing, the research advances and 
empirically tests an apprenticeship development model that relates formal and informal 
learning factors to apprentices’ resultant competencies.  
Consideration of training transfer is particularly important in apprenticeship given that 
learning occurs across different contexts, as the educational institutions and the workplace. 
As discussed by Mulder and colleagues (2015), the relationship between school and work is 
a critical determinant of the quality of vocational education and training. Whilst this has 
recently received attention in the context of apprenticeships (Messman and Mulder, 2015) 
and in the context of vocational education more generally (Pineda-Herrero et al., 2015; 
Sappa, Choy and Aprea, 2016), research needs to be further developed. As argued by Renta 
Davids, Van den Bossche, Gijbels and Garrido  (2017), learners in vocational education need 
to integrate diverse educational and workplace learning experiences in order to develop 
professionally. This process involves transfer of learning between contexts and requires 
particular support structures (Renta Davids et al., 2017; Rowe, 2018). Directing attention to 
the work environment, this study aims to identify the factors that can facilitate apprentices 
in transferring the knowledge and skills acquired at college and University to the workplace. 
In that way, the study aims to illustrate particular aspects that ought to be considered in order 
to support apprentices in the transfer process and maximise the use of knowledge and skills 
in the workplace. 
Added to this, in light of growing consensus that learning in the workplace contributes to 
professional development (Becker and Bish, 2017; Eraut, 2007; Felstead et al., 2005 ; 
Janssens et al., 2016), it is important to understand how the work environment can support 
apprentices in learning the interrelated knowledge and skills required for effectiveness. As
<<<PAGE=38>>>
22 
 
discussed by Raemdonck, Gijbels and van Groen (2014), learning and competence 
development are largely dependent on the characteristics of the job. Accordingly, insights 
into the work environment are critical in understanding how to stimulate informal learning 
so to create powerful learning experiences (Gijbels, Raemdonck and Vervecken, 2010). In 
line with a growing field of research considering the antecedents of informal learning 
(Cerasoli, Alliger, Donsbach, Mathieu and others, 2018; Jeong, Han, Lee and others, 2018; 
Segers, Messman and Dochy, 2018; Tews, Michel and Noe, 2017), this study explores the 
work environment as enabler of apprentices’ competence development. Conceptualising the 
work environment as driver for professional development, the study identifies factors that 
organisations can leverage to promote learning in the workplace and enhance the 
development of critical competencies.  
Furthermore, although extensive research has documented apprenticeships, little is known 
about the role of the human resource management (HRM) system in supporting apprentices’ 
development. As indicated in previous studies, notwithstanding the significance of the 
quality of apprenticeships other organisational factors play a determinant role in ensuring 
the success of the programme. A study on large employers in Britain identified practices as 
selective staffing, career development and socialisation in association with apprentices’ 
retention (Ryan et al., 2007), whilst similar practices were  detected by Fuller and Unwin 
(2007) in organisations successfully offering Engineering and Business Administration 
apprenticeships. As discussed by Hogarth and colleagues (2012b), such evidence points to 
the need to investigate the link between the apprenticeship and the HRM practices in place 
in the organisation, recognising that the design and execution of the apprenticeship is 
strongly influenced by the HRM system embedding the programme. Accordingly, 
considering both the formal and informal learning processes at the basis of apprent ices’ 
professional development and accounting for the influence of HRM, this study advances a 
holistic approach to apprenticeship research and presents novel practical and theoretical 
implications.  
Building on the work of Lewis (2014) who discusses how human capital theory and HRM 
theory inform employers’ decision to participate in apprenticeships based on the returns 
available, this study presents novel insight into the influence of HRM in apprenticeships. 
Specifically, Lewis (2014) argues that whilst human capital theory suggest that training 
apprentices may lead to high turnover rates as external skills certifications enhance skills 
transferability resulting in low returns for employers, HRM theory points to the opposite
<<<PAGE=39>>>
23 
 
possibility. According to the HRM perspective, providing apprentices with certificated 
training accompanied by career opportunities may reduce turnover intentions, justifying 
investing in the programme. Hasluck and Hogarth (2010) present empirical evidence for this 
proposition revealing that employers can recoup the costs of investing in apprenticeship in a 
relatively short period of time, provided that apprentices remain with the company. In light 
of this evidence, the employment relationship between the apprentice and the employer 
emerges as critical to ensuring the success of the programme and bringing maximum benefits 
for the organisation.  
In exploring the influence of HRM in apprenticeship, this research considers how the 
employment relationship as portrayed by the HRM system shapes apprentices’ competence 
development. Given that HR practices signal the organisation’s intention to establish a 
particular employment relationship with employees (Sun et al., 2007), this study poses to 
investigate how apprentices’ perceptions of HR practices influence apprentices’ professional 
development. With limited scholarly knowledge on HR systems in apprenticeship, this study 
draws on the human resource architecture model advanced by Lepak and Snell (1999; 2002) 
to identify the high-commitment HR system as the configuration most suited for managing 
the employment relationship with apprentices as highly valued employees.  
Given that employers engage with apprenticeship to address the need for qualified staff and 
to develop their talent as corporate resource (Winterbotham et al., 2013), apprentices 
represent core employees of high strategic value. Building on the view that particular 
employment groups require different HR practices to be managed effectively (Kinnie et al., 
2005: Liao et al., 2009), the high-commitment HR system is presented as the strategy for 
managing the employment relationship with apprentices (i.e. Lepak and Snell, 1999, 2002; 
Sun, Aryee and Law, 2007). In examining the influence of HRM in apprenticeships, the 
study presents novel insight furthering the understanding of why the relationship between 
the apprentice and the employer matters and how it can be nurtured by means of HR 
practices. These are critical considerations given the primacy placed by the latest wave of 
reform on the relationship between the apprentice and the employer (BIS, 2015) and poses 
important practical and theoretical implications.  
Ultimately, research in the formal (Baldwin and Ford, 1988; Bell et al., 2017; Blume et al., 
2010) and informal (Cesaroli et al., 2018; Noe, Tews and Marand, 2013; Schulz and 
Rossnagel, 2010; Tannenbaum et al., 2010) learning domain has considered both personal
<<<PAGE=40>>>
24 
 
and situational factors as determinants of learning. As discussed by Cesaroli and colleagues 
(2018), individual predispositions represent powerful drivers for explaining engagement in 
learning behaviours. The construct of learning goal orientation is particularly insightful in 
explaining individuals’ intentions to engage in both formal and informal learning and is an 
exceptionally fertile construct in organisational studies (i.e. Belschak and den Hartog, 2010; 
De Clercq, Rahman and Belausterguigoitia, 2015). As reported by VandeWalle (2003), 
understanding individual orientations towards learning presents various implications for 
organisations ranging from personnel decisions to the management of the work environment 
as in the design of training programmes, reward structures and cultures. Accordingly, this 
study investigates the influence of learning goal orientation in apprenticeship presenting 
further insight into how organisations can foster apprentices’ competence development. 
Given that learning in the workplace is the result of the interaction between the 
characteristics of the job and those of the individual (Raemdonck, Gijbels and van Groen, 
2014), in accounting for both individual and contextual dimensions, this study presents a 
rounded view on apprenticeships. Altogether, an organisational perspective to the study of 
apprenticeship is set to shed new light on the factors enhanc ing apprentices’ professional 
development and to provide evidence- based recommendations for supporting apprentices’ 
development using a combination of formal and informal learning.  
  
1.7 Theoretical framework of the study  
Having introduced the organisational perspective to the study of apprenticeship as the lens 
guiding the research, the theoretical framework of the study is outlined next.  
1.7.1 Research question and objectives  
In view of the sustained expansion of apprenticeships in England and given that workplace 
learning remains a distinct employer responsibility (Rowe et al., 2017), there is an urgent 
need to advance knowledge on how best to support apprentices’ professional development 
in the workplace. Accordingly, this research addresses the following question: 
How can organisations support apprentices to develop into competent professionals? 
In investigating the research question, the study presents the following objectives: 
- to determine the relationship between formal and informal learning factors in 
apprenticeship and apprentices’ resultant competencies
<<<PAGE=41>>>
25 
 
- to test boundary conditions inherent to apprenticeship such as perceptions of HRM 
implementation and individual learning goal orientation, assessing their impact on 
apprentices’ competence development 
- to determine changes in perceptions of the apprenticeship formal and informal 
learning factors and apprentices’ compete ncies over time, investigating the causal 
link between the apprenticeship and apprentices’ performance 
- to provide research-informed evidence to the organisations under study about the 
factors supporting informal learning, those enhancing training transfer, and about the 
role of HRM implementation and learning goal orientation in shaping the 
apprenticeship effectiveness.  
 
In line with these objectives, Figure 1.1 illustrates the conceptual framework of the study 
featuring the apprenticeship development model and the boundary conditions tested in this 
research.  
The first objective of the study is to develop and empirically test an apprenticeship 
development model that specifies the formal and informal learning factors contributing to 
the development of apprentices’ end -state competencies. In doing so, the study reviews 
formal training (Baldwin, Ford, Blume, 2017; Bell et al., 2017; Blume et al., 2010; Taylor 
et al., 2005) and informal learning literatures (Cerasoli et al., 2018; Cheetham and Chivers, 
2001; Conlon, 2004; Jeong et al., 2018 ) to identify critical factors fostering apprentices’ 
professional development. Additionally, based on the apprenticeship statutory requirements 
in England (SASE, 2017) and in line with competency models presented in the literature (Le 
Deist and Winterton, 2005), the study advances a categorisation of the apprenticeship 
resultant competencies. Presenting apprentices’ competencies as learning outcomes, these 
are classified in technical knowledge, job competence and work and business skills. As 
illustrated in Figure 1.1 and further discussed in Chapter 2, technical knowledge in 
apprenticeship is mainly developed off-the-job attending formal learning at college and 
University. Conversely, job competence and work and business skills are primarily acquired 
on-the-job and are therefore presented as informal learning outcomes.
<<<PAGE=42>>>
26 
 
Fig. 1.1 Theoretical framework of the study
<<<PAGE=43>>>
27 
 
Given apprentices’ dual status of worker and learner (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b), t he 
apprenticeship development model introduced in Chapter 2, integrates the formal learning 
and informal learning literatures. Drawing on Baldwin and Ford’s  (1988) model of the 
transfer process, this study identifies training intervention (transfer design) and work 
environment factors (supervisor support, supervisor feedback, colleagues’ feedback, 
opportunity to use knowledge and skills) fostering transfer of knowledge between school 
and work. These are here presented as formal learning factors related to the development of 
apprentices’ technical knowledge (Fig. 1.1).  
Additionally, the job demand-control-support (JDCS) model (Johnson and Hall, 1988; 
Karasek and Theorell, 1979), discussed further in Chapter 2, informs the identification of 
specific job characteristics (social support, feedback, problem solving, experimenting, task 
autonomy, task interdependence) promoting apprentices’ professional development. These 
are here presented as informal learning factors related to the development of apprentices’ 
job competence and work and business skills (Fig. 1.1). By testing the model empirically, 
the study elucidates how organisations might design the work environment to foster 
apprentices’ professional development facilitating both formal and informal learning.  
Secondly, following the work of Dragoni and colleagues (2009), the research incorporates 
both contextual factors and individual differences in the apprenticeship development model 
as important ‘boundary conditions’  advancing the understanding of how the HRM system 
and apprentices’ learning goal orientation influence competence development. As reported 
by the scholars, failing to account for contextual and individual factors may lead to the 
assumption that developmental assignments - such as apprenticeships - produce competent 
professionals under all organisational conditions and for all individuals (Dragoni et al., 
2009).  
As illustrated in Figure 1.1, at contextual level the study tests the influence of the HRM 
system strength and performance appraisal (PA) on the apprenticeship development model. 
Accounting for these dimensions, the research provides insight into the influence of the 
organisational context as determinant of the employment relationship on appre ntices’ 
professional development. This focus is justified as HRM research indicates that employees’ 
responses to developmental practices such as training depend on the quality of the employee-
organisational relationship (i.e. Kuvaas, 2008), whilst apprenticeship research points to the
<<<PAGE=44>>>
28 
 
relevance of the organisational context in influencing the quality of the programme (i.e. 
Fuller and Unwin, 2003c).  
As discussed in Chapter 3, in line with strategic human resource management research (i.e. 
Lepak and Snell, 1999, 2002; Sun, Aryee and Law, 2007; Tsui et al., 1997), this study 
considers the HRM system as the organisational strategy for managing the employment 
relationship with apprentices and identifies the high-commitment configuration as the most 
suited for apprentices as highly valued employees (i.e. Lepak and Snell, 1999; 2002). In so 
doing, the study turns the spotlight to HRM – not as a set of practices, but rather, following 
recent developments in the strategic HRM literature (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004, 2016 ; 
Sanders, Shipton and Gomes, 2014) according to how such practices are perceived by 
employees. 
Accordingly, the research examines the role of the HRM system strength, intended as the 
effectiveness of the HRM system in communicating messages unambiguously and enabling 
the clear interpretation of such messages (i.e. Bowen and Ostroff, 2004; 2016), in sustaining 
a high quality employment relationship with apprentices and consequently enhancing 
apprentices’ learning and performance. As apprentices develop knowledge and skills 
attending formal training courses at college and University and engaging in informal 
learning in the workplace , this research investigates how apprentices’ engagement in both 
forms of learning is enhanced by perceptions of HR practices. As illustrated in Figure 1.1, 
the study tests the influence of the HRM system strength on both formal and informal 
learning in the apprenticeship development model.  
Additionally, the research investigates the role of PA as facilitator of informal learning. 
Whilst HRM research has long promoted a system view of HRM in investigating the impact 
of HRM systems rather than single practices on individual and organisational outcomes 
(Combs et al., 2006; Delery, 1998; Lepak et al., 2006), the influence of PA as particular HR 
practice in apprenticeship is considered. Given employers reporting challenges in securing 
apprentices’ performance, engagement and retention (Rowe et al., 2017) and acknowledging 
the need to deliver support and guidance to apprentices in the workplace (Mulkeen et al., 
2017), PA is here considered as support mechanism for developing and motivating 
apprentices.  
Building on the assumption that different groups of employees need to be managed 
differently according to their needs and expectations (Kinnie et al., 2005), PA is deemed
<<<PAGE=45>>>
29 
 
crucial for apprentices as high-value employees. PA is a salient practice for supporting 
employees’ competence development and fostering employees’ identification with th e 
organisation (Ostroff and Bowen, 2000). In light of compelling evidence that PA satisfaction 
is associated with organisational commitment for professional employees (Kinnie et al., 
2005), PA is here investigated as critical determinant of a positive employment relationship 
for apprentices as emergent professionals. 
As discussed by Kinnie and colleagues (2005), PA is particularly important for professional 
employees in aligning individual and organisational interests. In so doing, PA responds to 
the particular needs of professional employees providing the form of organisational support 
that is important for them. Added to this, quality PA promotes participation in informal 
learning activities (Bednall et al., 2014) emerging as facilitator of informal learni ng. 
Accordingly, PA is investigated as the HR practice shaping the organisational employment 
relationship for apprentices as emergent professionals and supporting apprentices’ 
competence development in the workplace. As discussed in Chapter 3, this study considers 
the interaction of PA with problem solving, task autonomy and feedback as critical informal 
learning factors, presenting fresh insight into PA as support mechanism in apprenticeship.  
Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 1.1 and further elaborated in Chapter 3, this study 
investigates the influence of learning goal orientation on both formal and informal learning 
in the apprenticeship development model. Considering the individual characteristic of 
learning goal orientation provides a nuanced understanding on how apprentices perceive and 
respond to learning opportunities, showing how individual dispositions towards learning 
affect apprent ices’ competence development. According to the argument presented here, 
goal orientation forms the basis for deeper motivational processes that determine how 
apprentices approach formal and informal learning. As the construct of goal orientation has 
proven particularly insightful in predicting individual level outcomes (i.e. Chiaburu and 
Marinova, 2005; Kozwloski et al., 2001; VandeWalle and Cummings, 1997), it presents the 
potential to explain individual differences in learning behaviours and consequent 
competence development in apprenticeship. With apprentices being exposed to formal and 
informal developmental activities, it is important to examine how apprentices’ learning goal 
orientation influences their competence development, providing valuable insight to 
organisations investing in the programme.
<<<PAGE=46>>>

Thirdly, employing a positivist epistemology the research adopts a quantitative research 
strategy. In so doing, the research presents a cross-sectional (N= 233) and a longitudinal 
study (N= 90) testing the validity of the apprenticeship development model. Whilst 
originally set up exclusively as longitudinal study based on panel data collected over two 
waves, issues of sample attrition reduced the sample size to 90 observations limiting the 
power for statistical inference tests (Hair et al., 2014). As discussed by Bryman and Bell 
(2015), longitudinal research designs are advantageous in comparison to cross-sectional 
designs in allowing insight into the time order of variables and therefore allowing inferences 
about causality, but are problematic in relation to sample attrition. Accordingly, this research 
is centred on a cross-sectional study complemented by a longitudinal study. Whilst the 
former seeks to explain patterns of associations between the apprenticeship development 
model and apprentices’ resultant competencies identifying the relative importance of 
different sources of learning, the latter allows mapping social change over time providing a 
preliminary basis for inferring causality (Keeves, 1988). 
 
Additionally, the research draws on a qualitative data set collected along the quantitative 
data by means of an open question in the survey. Although quantitative and qualitative data 
have been analysed separately, they form an integrated data corpus and provide a strong 
basis for data triangulation. Maintaining a positivist epistemology, qualitative data has been 
employed with an objectivist orientation and analysed using thematic analysis. As discussed 
by Braun and Clarke (2006), thematic analysis can be applied across a range of 
epistemologies and is compatible with the essentialist paradigm assuming a straightforward 
link between language and experience. Accordingly, the themes identified in the qualitative 
data set complement and reinforce the validity of the quantitative cross-sectional and 
longitudinal findings. Overall, implementing a rigorous methodology this research 
empirically tests the theoretically derived apprenticeship development model advancing 
knowledge on the factors contributing to a positive apprenticeship experience.  
1.7.2 Context of the study  
In view of increased progression routes into Higher and Degree Apprenticeship along with 
the integration between traditional education and vocational training (Lee, 2012; Rowe et 
al., 2017; Saraswat, 2016), this research explores Advanced (Level 3) and Higher (Level 4 
and above) Apprenticeships in knowledge-intensive industries. The study targets 
organisations operating in the engineering sector, a sector leading in the delivery of Higher 
Apprenticeship whose skills are best acquired on-the-job (Keeps and James, 2011),
<<<PAGE=47>>>
31 
 
highlighting the importance of integrating formal and informal learning for effective 
performance.  
The focus on knowledge-intensive industries is warranted as apprenticeships are particularly 
suited to the demands of the postmodern society where learning and production are re-
integrated. As argued by Nielsen and Pedersen (2011), knowledge intensive industries 
require an increasing volume of knowledge along with an increasing variety of knowledge, 
as necessitated by regular technological innovations. Accordingly, the scholars argue that 
traditional academic systems are unable to attend to the demands of the postmodern society, 
requiring apprenticeship-like forms of training to integrate learning with working activities. 
This research is therefore set to provide greater insight into how organisations operating in 
knowledge-intensive industries can foster learning and innovation, and to validate 
apprenticeship as valid method of skill formation.  
1.7.3 Contributions of the study
 
This study presents several important implications for theory and practice. Firstly, despite 
the centrality of apprenticeships as vehicle of vocational training on an international scale 
(Fuller and Unwin, 2011), the literature is lacking an empirically supported theory on 
apprenticeship as human capital development programme. This study addresses this gap, 
theoretically developing and empirically testing a comprehensive apprenticeship 
development model. In so doing, this study advances a holistic approach to apprenticeships 
that in accounting for both formal training at college and University and informal learning 
in the workplace identifies critical factors supporting apprentices’ development.  
Secondly, categorising apprentices’ resultant competencies in to job competence, technical 
knowledge and work and business skills in accordance with the English statutory 
requirements (SASE, 2017), this study discerns particular training intervention and work 
environment factors associated with the competencies required for effective performance. In 
so doing, the findings extend previous apprenticeship research (i.e. Messman and Mulder, 
2015) which only considered learning as outcome of interest validating the apprenticeship 
as method of skill formation. In going beyond associating job characteristics with 
engagement with informal learning by demonstrating an association with the enhancement 
of apprentices’ competencies, this research presents novel insight into how the work 
environment can support apprentices’ professional development.
<<<PAGE=48>>>

Thirdly, introducing the HRM system as determinant of the apprenticeship employment 
relationship this study presents original insight into the influence of HRM in apprenticeship. 
Whilst the findings do not support the hypothesis related to the HRM system strength 
(Bowen and Ostroff, 2004, 2016), the influence of PA on apprentices’ engagement with 
informal learning is innovative. In finding PA satisfaction to moderate the relationship 
between both problem solving and feedback with apprentices’ resultant competencies, this 
study extends knowledge on the influence of HR on employees’ professional development. 
In particular, the research illustrates the mechanisms required for establishing a positive 
employment relationship in apprenticeship, and demonstrates how satisfaction with PA 
fosters engagement with informal learning and contributes to better functioning of the team 
and the organisation. Overall, the results lend support to previous research which found the 
effectiveness of HRM to be dependent on the nature of specific employment groups (i.e. 
Kinnie et al., 2005; Lepak and Snell, 2002; Liao et al., 2009) and reveal how the provision 
of appropriate HR practices is likely to enhance the effects of informal learning on 
performance.  
Added to this, investigating the individual difference of learning goal orientation this study 
identifies an important personal factor illustrating why apprentices may differently respond 
to the learning opportunities provided in the work environment with implications for 
resultant performance. In accounting for both contextual and individual boundary conditions 
the research is informative regarding when and for whom particular informal learning drivers 
play a determinant role in apprenticeships.  
Ultimately, the study presents several contributions to practice. Firstly, the study reveals the 
critical support mechanisms that organisations ought to put in place to enable apprentices in 
transferring the technical knowledge acquired at college or university to the workplace. 
Among these, the content and the structure of the training intervention along with the role of 
the supervisor in the workplace are pivotal.  
Secondly, apprentices’ competence development can be directly supported in the workplace 
when organisations adopt appropriate interventions. Presenting apprentices with the right 
level of challenge along with regular feedback and support from colleagues and supervisors 
is critical. Additionally, crafting apprentices’ work in ensuring the right level of autonomy 
and interdependence within the work system enhances apprentices’ learning a nd 
performance.
<<<PAGE=49>>>
33 
 
Thirdly, organisations investing in apprenticeship as strategy for talent development need to 
invest in HR practices in order to establish and sustain a high quality employment 
relationship with the apprentice. In particular, PA is instrumental for supporting a positive 
employment relationship and in turn fostering engagement in informal learning and ensuring 
apprentices contribute to better functioning of the team and the organisation. In light of these 
practical implications, the role of the line manager has emerged as crucial in determining 
positive apprenticeship experiences. Lastly, the study identifies a series of interventions 
aimed at fostering apprentices’ learning orientation and further support their competence 
development. 
 
1.8 Organisation of the thesis 
Chapter 2 (Introducing the apprenticeship development model ) reviews the apprenticeship 
as model of learning and defines the developmental quality of the apprenticeship in 
contributing to the knowledge and skills required for effective performance. The chapter 
reviews the formal training and informal learning literature to identify relevant factors and 
develop a theoretically derived apprenticeship development model. Lastly, it presents the 
hypotheses that explicate how formal and informal learning factors relate to particular 
apprentices’ competencies.  
Chapter 3 ( The influence of HRM and learning goal orientation on apprentices’ 
development) introduces critical boundary conditions in the apprenticeship development 
model. It first reviews the HRM literature to identify the high-commitment HR strategy as 
the most suited for apprentices as high value employees. In line with the process approach 
to HRM it then considers the communicative function of the HR system and evaluates how 
the latter contributes to a positive employment relationship. Secondly, the chapter introduces 
PA as critical HR practice fostering apprentices’ engagement with informal learning. 
Thirdly, the chapter reviews the goal orientation literature and discusses how this can inform 
our understanding of apprentices’ development. Lastly, it advances hypotheses to test the 
influence of these contextual and individual factors in apprenticeships. 
Chapter 4 ( Research design and method ) presents the research paradigm and provides a 
detailed account of the project design, procedure, sample and ethical issues. It includes a 
description of the measures of the study variables and of the procedure adopted to analyse 
quantitative and qualitative data.
<<<PAGE=50>>>
34 
 
Chapter 5 ( Testing the apprenticeship development model : how formal and informal 
learning contribute to competence development ) presents the results of two studies testing 
the validity of the apprenticeship development model. A cross-sectional study 
complemented by qualitative data and a longitudinal study based on panel data test the 
hypotheses advanced in Chapter 2.  
Chapter 6 ( The role of the HRM system strength, PA and learning goal orientation in 
apprenticeship) tests the hypotheses advanced in Chapter 3. It presents three studies 
complemented by qualitative data considering the influence of the HRM system strength, 
PA and learning goal orientation in apprenticeship.  
Chapter 7 (Discussion) summarises the findings of the research and discusses implications 
for theory, practice and policy. The chapter draws attention to the limitations of the study 
and directions for future research, before presenting an overall conclusion of the project.  
 
1.9 Summary  
This chapter has introduced the context of the research presenting an overview of 
apprenticeships in England. In light of the current reform, it has identified the themes central 
to the research and the related gaps in the extant literature. The chapter has presented the 
objectives and potential contribution of the study along with an outline of the structure of

Chapter 2 
Introducing the apprenticeship development model  
 
 
2.1 Introduction  
Having introduced the context of the research, this chapter turns the focus on the 
apprenticeship as a tool for human capital development. In doing so, the concept of the 
apprenticeship and its theoretical foundations are reviewed, before defining th e 
developmental quality of the a pprenticeship as precursor of apprentices’ competence 
development. 
Whilst educationalists have looked at the academic content and the social processes at the 
basis of apprentices’ skill formation, this chapter turns the focus to the work environment as 
an important determinant of apprentices’ learning experience. In adopting an organisational 
perspective, the chapter considers facets of the work environment that have been associated 
with training transfer and workplace learning, and evaluates their relevance to the context of 
apprenticeships. Drawing on formal (i.e. Baldwin, Ford, Blume, 2017) and informal learning 
(i.e. Cerasoli et al., 2018 ) literatures, the chapter explores factors promoting apprentices’ 
learning in order to construct an empirical model for apprentices’ competence development.  
Whilst formal and informal learning are treated as analytically distinct in order to identify 
key factors supporting professional development, the research argues that the combined 
influence of formal and informal learning is pivotal for apprentices’ professional 
development. After developing a typology of apprentices’ competencies on the basis of the 
apprenticeship’s statutory requirements in England, a review of the formal and informal 
learning literature is conducted to inform the research hypotheses. In so doing, the study 
identifies factors contributing to the developmental quality of the apprenticeship providing 
much needed insights for practitioners and academics.   
In sum, the chapter lays the theoretical foundations of the study that seeks to demonstrate 
the impact of the apprenticeship on the development of observable end-state competencies 
critical for effective performance.

2.2 Apprenticeship as a concept 
As reported by Nielsen and Pedersen (2011), the interest on apprenticeship as a model of 
learning has grown in recent years with a focus on how social models of learning can enhance 
learning in the workplace and support the transfer of knowledge between education and work 
settings. The scholars make a compelling case on how the growing interest on apprenticeship 
is not ill-founded, but is aligned with the postmodern conception of knowledge. In a society 
dominated by specialised, flexible and constantly changing forms of production, learning 
local and pragmatic kinds of knowledge becomes essential, whilst the cognitive conception 
of knowledge centred on the learner as a passive receiver of educational establishments loses 
traction. This shift entails a reconceptualization of learning from an individualised activity 
to a social and interactive process, where knowledge does not reside with the individual but 
is rather socially distributed (Nielsen and Pedersen, 2011). Such reconceptualization is 
evident in the apprenticeship conceived as a vehicle for learning in the workplace, and stands 
at the basis of the situated learning and the expansive-restrictive theories of apprenticeship 
discussed next.  
2.2.1 Situated learning  
Introducing a situated perspective on learning, the work of anthropologists Lave and Wenger 
(1991) is pivotal for a conceptual understanding of apprenticeship. Central to the situated 
learning approach are the concepts of legitimate peripheral participation and identity 
formation, which present an analytical viewpoint on apprenticeship as a model of learning 
in employment (Lave and Wenger, 1991). 
With legitimate peripheral participation, the scholars refer to the process by which 
newcomers become part of a community and, by having access to the practices of the 
community, develop their competence and identity. Learning is therefore the result of being 
located in the social world and engaging in social practice, rather than a process of 
internalisation by cognitive transmission (Cox, 2005). Presenting learning as a journey that 
newcomers undertake from the periphery to the centre of the community, Lave and Wenger 
(1991) present participation in the community of practice as the epistemological principle of 
learning. 
Peripherality, intended as source of access to the social world, enables participation that 
allows exposure to the practice of the community (Wenger, 1998), and can present itself as 
an empowering or disempowering resource in placing the individual at the centre or at the 
periphery of the community (Lave and Wenger, 1991). Accordingly, as individuals engage
<<<PAGE=53>>>
37 
 
in practice, they are exposed to the curriculum of the community, which unfolds itself as 
opportunities for practise arise (Wenger, 1998). As discussed by Nielsen and Pedersen 
(2011), situated learning presents a decentered perspective on apprenticeship in which 
knowledge is socially distributed among actors, tools and the structure of work. It follows 
that learning in apprenticeship is dependent on access to the community; on learning from 
practice, with a gradual transition to more complex tasks; on the opportunity to observe 
experts in production; and on having access to the narratives of the trade (Nielsen and 
Pedersen, 2011).  
The concept of legitimate peripheral participation is intrinsically linked to the concept of 
identity formation, with full participation at the basis of identity development. As argued by 
Wenger (2000), CoP c orrespond to social ‘containers’ of competence, encompassing a 
shared repertoire of communal resources as language, stories, artefacts, routines. 
Participation in the CoP enables the understanding of both its explicit components, as 
language, roles, procedures and regulations, and of its implicit values, assumptions and 
conventions (Handley et al., 2006) allowing deep and broad meaning and understanding. As 
the implicit aspects of practice may never be fully articulated in the community, only broad 
and extended participation can foster identity- development (Wenger, 1998), enabling 
individuals to learn how to act, respond, discuss and function as competent members of the 
community. The formation of identity is therefore a composite process involving deep 
connections with members of the community through a sense of belonging, mutual 
commitment and shared repertoire (Wenger, 2000).  
The epistemological stand of situated learning theory, which views learning in terms of the 
whole person acting in the world (Lave and Wenger, 1991), provides the foundation for 
understanding apprentices’ competence development, as the results of participating in the 
work processes and interacting with other members of the community. Whilst developing 
the concept of situated learning analysing traditional societies, the work of Lave and Wenger 
(1991) presents ground for exploring apprenticeship in more modern contexts, and has been 
referred to as the foundation of recent discussions on the topic. 
2.2.2 The apprenticeship Expansive and Restrictive Framework  
Educationalists Fuller and Unwin have led the debate on apprenticeship in England, 
exploring the practice of Modern Apprenticeship through the lens of Lave and Wenger’s 
(1991) situated learning theory. The scholars employ the concepts of legitimate peripheral 
participation and community of practice to analyse how apprentices become competent in
<<<PAGE=54>>>
38 
 
an occupation, however find the situated learning perspective to be too simplistic for the 
context of the Modern Apprenticeship. 
Fuller and Unwin (2003b, 2003c) identify three main shortcomings in Lave and Wenger’s 
(1991) viewpoint on apprenticeship when applied to contemporary industrialised settings: - 
the lack of a role for off-the-job training in formal education institutions; - the relevance of 
institutional arrangements; - and the conceptualisation of the apprentice’s journey from 
novices to experts. Based on traditional societies, situated learning theory does not indeed 
account for the formal training delivered at college or University, disregarding an important 
community of practice for the apprentice. Additionally, the institutional arrangements of the 
Modern Apprenticeship introduce new elements to the traditional apprenticeship as in the 
requirement of attaining formal qualifications.  
Furthermore, whilst Fuller and Unwin (2003c) recognise that modern apprentices have the 
opportunity to become legitimate peripheral participants, they question the relevance of the 
journey from novice to expert in contemporary settings. The scholars argue that the 
pedagogical relations between modern apprentices and older employees transcend those 
depicted by Lave and Wenger (1991) between novices and experts. Whereas situated 
learning presents experts as passing their knowledge to novices ensuring the reproduction of 
the community of practice, research conducted by Fuller and Unwin (2003c) has found that 
apprentices play a key role in passing their knowledge to existing employees, depicting a 
more intricate perspective on learning in apprenticeship. 
Given the limitations of the concepts advanced by Lave and Wenger (1991) in capturing the 
complexity of institutionalised apprenticeship in modern settings, Fuller and Unwin (2003b, 
2003c) have advanced a conceptual framework based on the notions of expansive and 
restrictive to analyse the learning environments shaping apprentices’ experiences. The 
scholars have developed a categorisation of approaches to apprenticeship based on a list of 
features ranging from expansive to restrictive, which enables the identification of barriers 
and opportunities to learning.  
The expansive or restrictive nature of the apprenticeship is associated with the form of 
participation in communities of practice, the underlying institutional arrangements and the 
ways in which personal development is enabled (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b). As argued by 
Fuller and Unwin (2003b, 2013), apprenticeships characterised by expansive features 
provide access to a wide range of learning opportunities, enabling apprentices to progress
<<<PAGE=55>>>
39 
 
with their career and education, whilst restrictive apprenticeships present limited 
opportunities for educational progression and career development (Table 2.1).  
The work of Fuller and Unwin is important in contributing to elaborate an innovative 
approach to apprenticeship intended as a dynamic vehicle of learning set to enable vertical 
progression in higher education and horizontal progression between jobs. The expansive-
restrictive framework is significant in evaluating the nature of the learning environment, 
intended as w orkplace and vocational education site, in shaping apprentices’ learning 
experiences. It provides valuable insight in pointing to key aspects of the apprenticeship 
arrangements as in apprentices having a dual status of worker and learner, participating in 
different communities of practice inside and outside the organisation, gaining qualifications 
and developing expertise for progression.  
An important consideration advanced by Fuller and Unwin (2003b) for the quality of 
apprenticeship is the configuration of formal and informal learning processes, an aspect 
central to this research. As discussed in an earlier publication (Fuller and Unwin, 1998), 
formal and informal learning are pivotal to skill formation, and an integrated approach to 
training on- and off-the-job is essential for apprentices’ development. The scholars reject the 
formal and informal learning dualism that entails the superiority of learning in educational 
institutions over learning in the workplace, and advance an interdependent viewpoint of 
learner-centred and teacher-centred activities. Such approach lays the foundations for the 
conceptualisation of apprenticeship presented in this research, and guides the search for 
theories related to both the formal and informal learning literature to develop a model of 
apprentices’ competence development.  
Drawing from Engestrom’s activity theory (1994), Fuller and Unwin elaborate on the 
concept of learning as socially situated, whilst recognising the value of structured teaching 
in making learning purposeful. In doing so the scholars (1998) recognise the pedagogical 
value of the daily interactions of apprentices with members of the community of practice, 
explicating that teacher-centred activities do not necessitate a qualified teacher, a didacti c 
method and an authoritarian relationship between ‘teacher’ and ‘learner’. The scholars argue 
that: 
‘The key to the development of learners is seen to be the quality of interactions which 
accompany the undertaking of authentic tasks. Such interactions are likely to include 
incidental, as well as more structured, planned and goal-orientated, learning 
experiences.’ (Fuller and Unwin, 1998, pp. 164)

With situated learning and ‘activity theory’ at the basis of Fuller and Unwin’s work, the 
scholars contribute to the reconceptualization of apprenticeship in modern settings, 
reconciling the social aspects of learning with an interdependent learner-centred and teacher-
centred pedagogy. Whilst the expansive-restrictive framework is valuable in identifying 
critical features that contribute to positive apprenticeship experiences (i.e. dual status of 
worker and learner; training off-the-job; qualifications for career progression), deeper insight 
into specific facto rs steering apprentices’ development is needed. Accordingly, this study 
builds on the expansive approaches to apprenticeships advocated by Fuller and Unwin and 
explores formal and informal learning drivers contributing to apprentices’ knowledge and 
skills.  
Recognising the role played by the individual as self-directed learner, and the facilitative 
function played by colleagues, peers, experts, instructors in both the educational and the 
workplace settings, the developmental quality of the apprenticeship is discussed next as 
central to apprentices’ competence development.  
 
2.3 The developmental quality of apprenticeship  
In discussing the developmental quality of the apprenticeship this research focuses on the 
combined influence of formal and informal learn ing in shaping apprentices’ competence 
development. As argued by Poortman and colleagues (2011), a comprehensive theoretical 
framework for discussing workplace learning requires the reconciliation of the social and 
cognitive dimensions of learning. This statement is supported by Guile (2011, pp. 454) who 
discusses how Lave and Wenger’s conceptualisation (1991) of the teaching and learning 
curriculum is based on ‘separate realms of experience: a world of theory and a world of 
practice’, which whilst analytic ally different, present a mediated relation particularly 
relevant in the context of apprenticeship. Building on the work of Fuller and Unwin (1998) 
advocating learner-centred and teacher-centred activities as interdependent aspects of 
expansive learning processes, this research integrates principles of the formal and informal 
learning literature to develop a model of apprenticeship competence development.  
Given the association between apprenticeship and the development of knowledge and skills 
required for effective performance (Vivian et al., 2012), the developmental quality of the 
apprenticeship is defined as the extent to which the apprenticeship, encompassing formal 
and informal learning activities, contributes to apprentices’ competence development. More
<<<PAGE=58>>>
42 
 
specifically, following the work of Dragoni and colleagues (2009) on managerial 
development, the developmental quality of apprenticeship encompasses features of the 
training intervention and the work environment that provide opportunities for learning ne w 
knowledge and skills. Whilst considerable research has explored apprentices’ learning 
experiences in the workplace, a comprehensive model investigating the factors contributing 
to the developmental quality of the apprenticeship is needed. Accordingly, this research 
investigates formal and informal learning factors contributing to the development of critical 
competencies, providing insight into how best apprentices’ professional development can be 
supported.  
With a dual status of worker and learner (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b), apprentices engage in 
learning activities at the educational institution (college, University, training academy), and 
in the workplace. Whilst the former falls under the learning ‘as acquisition’ paradigm, 
entailing learning as a predominantly individualistic activity leading to the acquisition of 
knowledge, ideas, materials (Sfard, 1998), the latter is best described as learning ‘as 
participation’ (Sfard, 1998), resulting from practicing and interacting with people, tools and 
materials, placing emphasis on the context in which learning occurs (Felstead et al., 2005). 
Whilst postulating an integrated approach between formal and informal learning, the 
contribution of each learning mode to apprentices’ development is reviewed respectively.  
The following section hence considers how formal and informal learning activities 
contribute to apprentices’ development, unravelling the multidimensionality of 
competencies as the intended outcome of the apprenticeship.  
2.3.1 Formal training  
Formal training in apprenticeship is associated with the development of the technical and 
theoretical knowledge underpinning the job role and providing apprentices with the 
conceptual understanding required to progress in their occupation and in education (Fuller 
and Unwin, 1998; 2007). In the context of apprenticeship, formal training in the form of 
teacher-centred instruction and individual study away from the workplace contributes also 
to apprentices’ personal development, representing an opportunity for reflection and for the 
development of the ability of critical thinking (Fuller and Unwin, 1998).  
Recalling Engestrom (1994), Fuller and Unwin (1998), acknowledge the value of structured 
teaching and learning for the development of intellectual and critical abilities, central for 
generating innovative capabilities and for enhancing creativity and the ability to develop 
new ideas. Similarly, the development of a robust knowledge base has been associated with
<<<PAGE=59>>>
43 
 
‘particular ways of knowing, thinking and practicing’ when facing complex situations 
(Brown et al., 2012, pp. 757), reflecting the contribution of formal training to the 
development of more general and transferable skills. As argued by Cheng and Hampson 
(2008), in addition to delivering qualifications, formal off-the-job training contributes to 
developing generic skills that individuals can transfer to the workplace or between jobs 
throughout their career, supporting mobility and progression in the labour market. 
Formal training is a statutory requirement of any apprenticeship (SASE, 2017) and is central 
to the development of apprentices’ theoretical knowledge and core skills, as already 
discussed by many commentators (Broackmann et al., 2010; Fuller and Unwin, 1998, 
2003b).  Whilst acknowledging the importance of training for the development of a 
substantial knowledge base, this research focuses on the factors that support the transfer and 
application of technical knowledge to the workplace underpinning apprentices’ 
performance. This is an imperative consideration given that for any training to be successful 
the knowledge and skills acquired in the training intervention need to be applied and 
translated into competent behaviours (Grossman and Salas, 2011). In doing so, this research 
builds on previous work on apprenticeship (i.e. the expansive-restrictive framework of Fuller 
and Unwin) and considers how facets of the work environment support the transfer and 
application of knowledge acquired through formal instruction to the job.  On this basis, this 
research tests the association between formal training and the development and application 
of apprentices’ technical knowledge underpinning the occupation.  
2.3.2 Informal learning 
When considering apprentices’ learning activities in the workplace, Messmann and Mulder 
(2015) define them as learning activities carried out in relation to the accomplishment of 
work tasks. Apprentices’ learning in the workplace is therefore categorised as informal, 
hence taking place without being institutionally sponsored, arising mainly from experiences 
and interactions, and presenting various levels of intentionality.  
Informal learning is usually presented in contrast with formal training, and basing the 
distinction on the locus of control, informal learning activities are depicted as learner-
centred, whilst formal learning activities are presented as trainer-centred (Garavan et al., 
2002).  Marsick and Watkins (2001, pp. 25) follow this paradigm, describing formal learning 
as ‘institutionally sponsored, classroom-based, and highly structured’ and informal learning 
as ‘intentional but not highly structured’.
<<<PAGE=60>>>
44 
 
Marsick and Volpe (1999) describe informal learning as experiential and integral to working 
tasks and routines, arising as individuals face problems or challenges, whilst Boud and 
Middleton (2003, pp. 194) depict it as ‘embedded in the practices and relationships of the 
workplace’. Similarly, Brown and Duguid (1991) portray informal learning as experiential, 
collaborative and highly contextual, stressing the integration of informal learning in the 
workplace, reflecting strong elements of interaction and engagement in practice. 
Whilst informal learning activities have been presented as intentional, encompassing high 
levels of self-directedness, Marsick and Watkins (2001) present incidental learning as a 
subcategory of informal learning, and describe it as the learning arising as a by-product of 
other activities, such as experimenting and interacting, often resulting in unconscious tacit 
knowledge. In exploring the array of learning modes in non-formal learning, Eraut (2000) 
makes a distinction on the basis of intentionality, presenting implicit learning in contrast to 
deliberate learning. Whilst the former arises without a purposeful intention and without 
awareness at the time of learning, the latter is the result of planned learning efforts (Eraut, 
2000). When an action is performed with reflection, informal learning is deliberatively 
performed with the objective to learn; whilst incidental learning is the side-product of 
activities performed without an intended learning goal (Mulder, 2013). 
Informal learning is often presented in terms of activities, defined by Marsick and Volpe 
(1999, pp. 4) as the ‘action containers’ of learning. In a longitudinal study on how early 
career professionals develop knowledge and skills, Eraut (2007) found informal learning to 
arise from consultations and collaborations within and outside the working group, and from 
the challenge of the work itself. In order to categorise the various informal learning activities 
identified, Eraut (2007) proposes a categorisation based on the principal object being either 
working or learning. Among activities classified as work processes with learning as a by-
product, Eraut (2007) identifies participation in group processes, challenging tasks and roles, 
engaging in problem solving and trying things out, working alongside others, or with clients. 
Activities classified as learning processes encompass being supervised, coached and 
mentored, shadowing and independent study. Additionally, Eraut (2007) distinguishes a 
series of learning activities part of both the work and the learning processes, including asking 
questions, getting information, listening and observing, engaging in reflection, and giving 
and receiving feedback.
<<<PAGE=61>>>
45 
 
As reported by Messmann and Mulder (2015), learning activities are also classified in terms 
of being physical (i.e. researching the internet for new information, reading a book) or 
cognitive (i.e. the mental construction of ideas, concepts or strategies). In stressing the 
distinction between these types of activities, Mulder (2013) argues that physical learning 
activities can lead to cognitive learning activities, but this is not always the case. Cognitive 
activities correspond to the internal acquisition process where knowledge is actively 
constructed through processes of accumulation, assimilation, accommodation and 
transformation (Piaget, 1952; Poortman et al., 2011). 
A further conceptualisation of informal learning considers it as an individual or a social 
activity. Whilst individual learning takes place without social interaction, arising from 
reflecting individually on work situations or interacting with media and cultural artefacts 
such as consulting manuals, social learning activities are classified as learning from others 
and learning together (Doornbos et al., 2004). The former involves a one-way developmental 
relation in which the individual learns from interacting with others, but the interaction does 
not necessarily contribute to the development of other part. Examples are receiving feedback 
and role modelling. The latter sees all parties learning from the interaction and being aware 
of the respective learning. Examples include group discussions reflecting on work situations, 
evaluating different perspectives and constructing shared meaning (Doornbos et al., 2004).  
Ultimately, Messmann and Mulder (2015) argue that informal learning activities are domain-
specific, in that the particular learning activity adopted is determined by the nature of the 
work tasks and the work environment. Accordingly, while in some situations engaging in 
discussions with colleagues would be the most suitable course of action for dealing with a 
work tasks, in other domains searching for information in relevant media would be the most 
suitable strategy.  
Whilst different categorisations of informal learning exist, the significance of informal 
learning in developing the competencies required by individuals to effectively operate in 
complex and increasingly changing work environments has been widely recognised (Bednall 
et al., 2014; van Rijn et al., 2013). Additionally, informal learning is by nature highly 
contextual, occurring ‘just in time’ when individuals face challenging situations or 
unanticipated needs (Marsick and Volpe, 1999), with the inherent advantage of eluding the 
issue of transfer of learning intrinsic to formal training.
<<<PAGE=62>>>

The theories of adult development such as andragogy (Knowles, 1980) and experiential 
learning (Kolb, 1984) can inform our understanding of informal learning through the 
constructs of self-directedness and reflection. The concept of self-directedness follows the 
humanist andragogical assumption that views individuals as autonomous and grow-oriented 
agents, with a mature orientation towards learning as a mean for facing work and life-related 
challenges with a self-development approach (Knowles, 1980, 1990). A central assumption 
of andragogy is the learner as proactive agent, capable of identifying learning needs and 
implementing learning strategies in a learner-centred approach (Knowles, 1990). While the 
principle of self-directedness has been popularised by Knowles (1980) as part of the 
andragogical approach to adult development as opposed to the traditional pedagogical 
approach, it provides valuable insight into informal learning in considering the individual 
agency in taking advantage of learning opportunities, directing learning needs, and 
developing the ability to learn as sustainable competence.  
Whilst Doornbos and colleagues (2004) argue that self-directed learning is an educational 
construct which assigns an explicit role to the learner in organising and planning the learning 
event, hence overlooking much of the learning occurring implicitly and unconsciously at 
work, the scholars acknowledge the relevance of the construct in the workplace in portraying 
the intention to take advantage of learning opportunities, involving a certain degree of 
control over one’s development. 
The experiential learning theory presents learning as a cyclical on-going process of 
experiences, reflection, conceptualisation and experimentation (Kolb, 1984), where the 
learner creates knowledge and adapts on the basis of concrete experiences. Such 
conceptualisation is strongly linked to the experiential dimension of informal learning, and 
is important in recognising the focal role of reflection in enabling the individual to move 
from the mere experiential stage to a conscious process of learning, engaging in generative, 
rather than adaptive learning (Senge, 1990), thus enhancing opportunities for competence 
development. As argued by Cheetham and Chivers (2001), theories of andragogy and 
experiential learning do overlap, however, the scholars acknowledge the possibility for 
individuals to engage in experiential learning without necessarily being self-directed and 
highly aware of one’s learning needs, but to recognise these in retrospect following the 
reflection process in the learning cycle.
<<<PAGE=63>>>
47 
 
Given that informal learning can be either planned or unplanned, with incidental learning 
resulting in the development of tacit knowledge, the process of reflection plays a central role 
in enabling individuals to probe and explore the experiences in insight, as in learning from 
mistakes or unsystematic processes of trial and error (Marsick and Watkins, 2001). As 
argued by van Woerkom (2004, pp. 182), ‘reflection is important in examining one’s 
experience to assess its effectiveness and to improve performance’, recognising the 
contribution to the individual in developing further knowledge and competencies, and to the 
organisation fostering continual improvements (Argyris and Schon, 1978). In a research 
project on critical reflection at work, van Woerkom (2003) operationalised the construct of 
critical reflective behaviour in seven work activities carried out individually or in interaction 
with others, finding these to positively affect individual competence development. The 
activities encompass reflection, experimentation, learning from mistakes, career awareness, 
critical opinion sharing, asking for feedback and challenging groupthink, and are strongly 
aligned with the informal learning activities identified in research. 
Informal learning is therefore defined as deliberate or reactive learning activities, taking 
place in the workplace, individually or in social interaction, and leading to competence 
development.  With numerous studies providing empirical evidence of how individuals 
develop job competence in the workplace through processes of social interaction and 
engagement in practice (i.e. Lave and Wenger, 1991; Eraut, 2007; Felstead et al., 2005 ; 
Janssens et al., 2017 ), informal learning is deemed pivotal to apprentices’ competence 
development.  
In line with situated learning theories, informal learning takes place in the workplace, as the 
social context presenting individuals with access to a wide range of resources encompassing 
social and physical circumstances, histories and social relations, allowing to experience 
learning in deep connection with the context in which it has meaning (Brown and Duguid, 
1991). As a result of the highly situated nature of workplace learning, Brown and Duguid 
(1991) contend that individuals are better placed to learn how to function in the community, 
understanding how to make appropriate use of the community’s practices and s hared 
repertoire. On a similar line, Brown and colleagues (2012) maintain that workplace learning 
presents complementarities in the learning of technical, social and networking skills, 
supporting the argument that informal learning contributes to functional, social and 
behavioural skills.
<<<PAGE=64>>>

On this basis, this research tests the association between informal learning and the 
development and application of behaviour- based competencies reflecting apprentices’ job 
competence and work and business skills.  
As represented in Fig. 2.1, formal training in apprenticeship is associated with the 
development of technical knowledge. Conversely, informal learning in the workplace is 
associated with the development of job competence and work and business skills.  Given the 
array of competencies developed through formal and informal learning activities, the 
following section introduces a categorisation of apprentices’ competencies, evaluating their 
relevance for apprentices’ performance.

2.4 A typology of apprenticeship competencies  
Having discussed the developmental quality of the apprenticeship in contributing to 
apprentices’ compete nce development, a typology of apprenticeship competencies is 
advanced. A typology is required in order to categorise the competencies developed through 
the apprenticeship, and test the association of each category with particular facets of the 
training intervention and the work environment. This enables the research to provide greater 
insight and understanding into how the apprenticeship contributes to competence
<<<PAGE=65>>>

development, by looking at specific performance behaviour-based competencies and 
exploring what factors are conducive to this end.  
This is an important step in advancing research as to my knowledge no other studies have 
sought to empirically examine the impact of the apprenticeship on the observable 
development of particular end-state competencies critical for effective performance (see 
Vaughan (2017) as an exception in considering the role of apprenticeship in cultivating soft 
skills and dispositions). The research builds on studies conducted on leadership development 
(i.e. De Rue and Wellmann, 2009; Dragoni et al., 2009), and explores the impact of formal 
and informal learning on the development of important competencies. In doing so, it 
addresses the limitations of previous studies which have only considered learning (i.e. 
learning activities) as outcome of interest (i.e. Messmann and Mulder, 2015) and provides 
greater understanding on what factors in the training intervention and the work environment 
are related to the development of meaningful competencies. Before presenting such a 
typology, a discussion of the concept of competency is warranted.  
2.4.1 Defining competencies  
The literature presents several interpretations of the term competence and various scholars 
have stressed the importance of clarifying the terminology as competency frameworks have 
increasingly been used in human resource management and development interventions 
(Garavan and McGuire, 2001; Moore, Cheng and Dainly, 2002). As the term competence 
and competency have been used interchangeably, Rowe (1995) advances a clarification 
presenting ‘competence’ as the standard o f performance reached, referring to what people 
can do, and ‘competency’ as the behaviours underlying such performance, referring to how 
the standard is achieved, presenting a clear interface between the two concepts, with suitable 
competence depending on appropriate competencies and vice versa. 
Competencies are here defined at individual level, as knowledge, skills and abilities required 
for effective job performance. As such, competencies represent a dynamic construct, which 
individuals progressively develop by means of training and experience, and are inherently 
multidimensional. A multi-dimensional view of professional competence was firstly 
advanced by Cheetham and Chivers (1996; 1998), who proposed a model integrating 
cognitive (know-that and know-why) and functional competencies (know-how), with 
ethical, personal (know how to behave) and meta-competencies, as in the ability to learn and 
reflect. The scholars presented professional competence as the product of various
<<<PAGE=66>>>
50 
 
interrelated components, whose presence and integration stands at the basis of effective 
performance (Le Deist and Winterton, 2005).  
A holistic model of competence was later advanced by Le Deist and Winterton (2005), 
arguing that a holistic typology better responds to the requirements of particular occupations, 
recognising that functional, cognitive, and behavioural competencies are core to any 
competence model. The scholars present a model featuring four main competencies and 
place meta-competence, intended as the ability to learn, at the centre of the model as the 
input required for acquiring further competencies. 
The remaining three competencies represent the conceptual knowledge and understanding; 
the functional skills, and the social attitudes and behaviours, and are all required for effective 
performance. Such perspective presents implications for competence development, since 
they are developed integrating educational and workplace learning and exploiting the 
synergy between formal and informal learning (Le Deist and Winterton, 2005). This angle 
provides insight in guiding the analysis of apprenticeship as in recognising the 
multidimensional configuration of the apprenticeship end-state competencies and the 
integrated approach underpinning apprentices’ development.  
2.4.2 Apprenticeship end-state competencies  
As a model of learning in employment, apprenticeships are designed to equip apprentices 
with job competence, technical knowledge and work and business skills (National 
Apprenticeship Service, 2014). This is reflected in the SASE (2017) setting out the minimum 
requirements to be included in any apprenticeship framework, comprising the competencies 
qualification required to demonstrate competence in performing the skill, trade or 
occupation; the technical knowledge qualification , required to demonstrate attainment of 
technical skills, knowledge and theoretical understanding underlying the occupation; 
functional skills in English, Mathematics, Information and Communications Technology 
(ICT), Employee Rights and Responsibilities (ERR) and Personal Learning and Thinking 
Skills (PLTS).  
On this basis, apprentices’ end-state competencies are classified into three main categories: 
- Job competence: as in the functional and operational skills required for delivering 
the job role effectively. Ski lls refer to ‘aspects of behaviour which are practiced in 
the work situation, and which individuals need to be able to perform at an acceptable 
level in order to do the job satisfactorily’ (Marchington and Wilkinson, 2008, pp.
<<<PAGE=67>>>
51 
 
344). Job competence in apprenticeship is usually accredited by National Vocational 
Qualifications (NVQ) on the basis of occupational standards of competence, as 
apprentices are assessed in a range of job-specific tasks against performance criteria 
establishing behaviours and vocational skills required to meet the apprenticeship 
standard. 
 
- Technical knowledge: refers to the theoretical knowledge underpinning the job role. 
Given the emphasis on advanced and high levels skills in today’s economy, the 
theoretical knowledge base is a fundamental component in any apprenticeship (Lee, 
2012), in providing individuals with the conceptual understanding for educational 
and occupational progression. It encompasses technical skills, knowledge and 
understanding of theoretical concepts and of the industry and markets relevant to the 
occupation (SASE, 2017).  
 
- Work and business skills: a category encompassing a vast range of skills and 
competencies intended to be transferable to other occupations and sectors, and 
therefore regarded as generic and fundamental for effective performance. The UK 
Governments have placed emphasis on ‘core skills’ intended as essential skills that 
ought to be included in any competence-based development programme (Cheetham 
and Chivers, 1996). Such core skills are referred to as Functional/Key skills in the 
SASE (2017) and include English, Math, ICT, ERR and PLTS.  
 
Whilst English, Math and ICT are not reviewed in this research, as they are under 
the remit of the educational system, PLTSs are considered as transferable work and 
business skills developed in the workplace. Among these feature skills of 
independent enquiry, creative thinking, reflective learning, team working, self-
management and effective participation (SASE, 2017).  
Whilst the new apprenticeship standards under development have adopted a slightly different 
terminology, referring to job competence as vocational skills, technical knowledge as 
academic knowledge, and work and business skills as occupational behaviours, this study 
maintains the terminology adopted by the National Apprenticeship Service in 2014 when the 
research project started to ensure clarity and consistency.
<<<PAGE=68>>>
52 
 
This multidimensional representation of the apprenticeship end-state competencies is 
aligned with the competence models presented in the literature, advancing professional 
competence as the product of various interrelated components whose integration is required 
for effective performance (Cheetham and Chivers, 1996, 1998; Le Deist and Winterton, 
2005). Job competence, technical knowledge and work and business skills are the outcomes 
of interest in the model of apprenticeship development, which analytically distinguishes 
between core elements constituting the basis for occupational performance (Le Deist and 
Winterton, 2005).   
 
2.5 Facilitative conditions for competence development  
Having presented the developmental quality of the apprenticeship and the end-state 
competencies associated with it, the focus now turns to the work environment as an 
important determinant of apprentices’ learning experiences. In introducing an organisational 
perspective to the study of apprenticeship, this research considers how facets of the work 
environment sustain apprentices’ development intertwining educational experiences with 
developmental activities inside the workplace. 
A focus on the work environment is justified by an epistemological consideration of the 
construct of competence, shedding light on the processes at the basis of competence 
development. The literature presents two main approaches to the notion of competence, with 
a rationalist positivistic approach presenting competence as an attribute-based phenomenon 
(i.e. Boyatzis, 1982), as in the knowledge and skills required for effective performance, 
viewing competence as context-independent; and an interpretivist approach, focusing on 
how people use competence at work, intended as the lived experience of work (Sandberg, 
2000). Whilst as attribute-based concept, the notion of competence is approached 
prescriptively and out of context, the interpretivist approach acknowledges its situational and 
context-dependent dimension, with implications for its tacit component (Sandberg, 2000).  
In recognising the tacit dimension of competence (Polany, 1967), the internal organisational 
context and employees’ experiences of w ork take centre stage (Garavan and McGuire, 
2001), contributing to identifying individual perceptions as antecedents of competence 
development and to recognise the importance of informal learning in addition to traditional 
training interventions. An interdisciplinary approach is therefore required to enhance the 
understanding of the processes at the basis of competence development, integrating the 
formal and informal learning literatures.
<<<PAGE=69>>>
53 
 
Given such interdisciplinary approach, the methodology of the traditional narrative review 
is adopted here, identifying key papers and relevant secondary studies in the two themes 
under consideration with the aim of evaluating relevant research findings and theoretical 
developments (MacPherson and Jones, 2010). The literature has traditionally presented two 
contrasting approaches to the study of employees’ development, with the conventional 
approach examining formal training interventions as a source of knowledge and expertise 
(Arthur et al., 2003) and the informal learning approach investigating employees’ 
development because of participation in work practices (Brown and Duguid, 1991; Marsick 
and Watckins, 2001). Considering the abundance of empirical studies, reviews and meta-
analysis on formal and informal learning (i.e. Bell et al., 2017 ; Cerasoli et al., 2018; 
Cheetham and Chivers, 2001; Conlon, 2004; Grossman and Salas, 2011; Massenberg et al., 
2017), this review is not intended to be comprehensive but rather aims to identify the most 
critical factors to inform the research hypotheses.  
2.5.1 Formal training review and hypotheses development 
Formal training refers to those activities initiated by the organisation in order to develop 
employees’ critical competencies for job performance, encompassing cognitive, behavioural 
and affective learning outcomes (Grossman and Salas, 2011). Researchers have long 
conceded that although individuals may learn from participating in formal training, such 
training cannot be considered effective unless the acquired knowledge and skills are 
transferred to the workplace resulting in changes in performance (Blume et al., 2010).  
Transfer of training is defined as generalisation and maintenance of acquired knowledge, 
skills and behaviours to the work context (Baldwin and Ford, 1988). As reported by Ford 
and Weissbein (1997), generalisation implies the ability of trainees to apply the trained 
behaviours in different settings, people and situations, whilst maintenance refers to the 
ability of maintaining the knowledge, skills and behaviours over time. In the context of 
apprenticeship, where formal training represents one of the processes leading to apprentices’ 
competence development, transfer of training is pivotal in enabling apprentices to take action 
based on the knowledge and skills acquired through formal instruction.  
Research on training transfer has been largely based on the Baldwin and Ford’s model 
(1988), which categorises the transfer process into input factors (trainee characteristics, 
training design and work environment), outcomes of training (learning and retention) and 
transfer (generalisation and maintenance of learning on the job). Comprehensive reviews 
have examined the variables factoring in each category, presenting extensive knowledge on
<<<PAGE=70>>>
54 
 
the factors exhibiting strong relationships with transfer (i.e. Blume et al., 2010; Bell et al., 
2017; Burke and Hutchins, 2007; Chen and Hampson, 2008; Grossman and Salas, 2011). 
Trainees’ individual factors encompass ability, skills, motivation and personality; training 
intervention factors comprise training methods and objectives, learning principles and 
opportunities for practice; whilst the work environment consists of transfer climate, peer and 
supervisor support, and opportunities to apply the new knowledge and skills on the job 
(Blume et al., 2010).  
Research into vocational education has recently drawn on this model to identify the factors 
facilitating or obstructing students’ transfer of knowledge between school and work (Pineda-
Herrero et al., 2015; Renta Davids et al., 2017), presenting it as a valid framework for 
examining the factors supporting learning transfer in the context of apprenticeships. As 
discussed by Renta Davids and her colleagues (2017), the framework advanced by Baldwin 
and Ford (1998) allows the simultaneous assessment of different factors within the transfer 
process, enabling the identification of critical factors facilitating or obstructing transfer of 
learning.  
Accordingly, as presented in Fig. 2.2, in investigating the developmental quality of the 
apprenticeship, this research focuses on the training intervention and the work environment 
factors that have shown strong and consistent relationships with transfer on the assumption 
that such input variables would sustain apprentices’ learning and contribute to the 
development of a robust knowledge base.

Training intervention: transfer design  
Studies on training delivery have focused on trainees’ need analysis (Arthur et al., 2003 ), 
instructional methods as behaviour modelling (Taylor et al., 2005) and goal setting 
techniques (Noe, 2008), to name only a few of the variables investigated as influencing 
learning transfer. As transfer of training is here discussed as contributing to a pprentices’ 
technical knowledge, its design is considered as a factor strongly related to the transfer and 
application of such knowledge in the workplace.  
Transfer design refers to the ‘degree to which 1) training has been designed and delivered to 
give trainees the ability to transfer learning to the job, and 2) training instructions match job 
requirements’ (Holton et al., 2000, pp. 345). Accordingly, transfer design encompasses 
activities and exercises devised to help trainees to understand how to apply new knowledge 
and skills on-the-job, sustaining training transfer. As discussed by Diamatidis and 
Chatzoglou (2014), trainees need to be guided during the training intervention in how to 
apply new knowledge and skills to the job. 
In terms of transfer generalisability, Laker (1990) presents two dimensions with implications 
for the design of the training intervention: near transfer refers to the extent to which trainees 
apply the acquired knowledge and skills to situations analogous to the training intervention; 
far transfer on the other hand, refers to the extent to which trainees apply the training content 
to novel and unrelated situations. Laker (1990) argues that the achievement of near or far 
transfer depends on the theoretical underpinnings of the training design. Specifically, Laker 
(1990) suggests that near transfer is influenced by the principles of identical-elements theory 
(Holding, 1965), in that learning transfer is maximised through a close physical and 
psychological representation of the work environment in the training settings; on the other 
hand, far transfer is underpinned by the Principles Theory (Goldstein, 1986), which stresses 
the understanding of underlying assumptions and their application to novel and abstract 
situations. 
Empirical research presents strong evidence of a positive relation between transfer design 
and training transfer when the former matches job requirements and provides trainees with 
the understanding of how to apply training on-the-job (i.e. Bates et al., 2000; Diamantidi s 
and Chatzoglou, 2014; Velada et al., 2007). Such evidence demonstrates that when training 
is delivered using techniques, activities, exercises and examples that reflect the applicability 
of the training content in the workplace, transfer of training is enhanced. Additionally, 
apprenticeship research has recently considered the alignment between the school and the
<<<PAGE=72>>>
56 
 
organisational environment. As discussed by Mulder, Messman and Konig (2015) alignment 
indicates that the learning processes at school and in the workplace are consistent and build 
upon each other. In a study on a sample of apprentices in Germany, Messmann and Mulder 
(2015) hypothesised that the integration of work tasks as examples in school learning 
processes along with discussions and elucidations into how school-based learning outcomes 
are applicable in the work context, would foster apprentices’ learning in the workplace. In 
finding work-oriented learning at school in positive association with apprentices’ enquiring 
in the workplace, their study presents preliminary evidence for the importance of school-
work alignment in apprenticeships.  
With research considering school- work alignment as determinant of apprentices’ 
engagement in workplace learning, it is important to examine the association between 
transfer design, representing both the relevance of training content to the job and the way 
the training is structured and delivered,  and learning transfer. The following hypothesis is 
therefore advanced:   
H1a Transfer design is positively related to the transfer of technical knowledge  
  
Work environment: support, feedback and opportunities  
The training literature is in strong agreement on the fact that the work environment following 
the training intervention significantly influences learning transfer encouraging the 
application of new knowledge and skills on the job (Holton et al., 2000; Tracey et al., 1995). 
With apprentices acquiring technical and theoretical knowledge off-the-job whilst being an 
integral part of the workforce, the work environment necessitates great consideration in 
contributing to widen and reinforce the apprentices’ knowledge base. Additionally, with 
apprentices developing generic work and business skills in formal training providing space 
for reflection (Fuller and Unwin, 1998), the work environment is important in facilitating 
the integration of such skills in apprentices’ daily activities.  
In 1988 Baldwin and Ford called for further conceptualisation and operationalisation of the 
work environment factors impacting on transfer. Over the years, advancements have been 
made in defining the work environment constructs of transfer climate, support and 
opportunity to use, and in demonstrating the influence of such factors over transfer (Ford 
and Weissbeim, 1997).
<<<PAGE=73>>>
57 
 
Transfer climate has been defined by Rouiller and Goldstein (1993) as the job situations that 
either inhibit or facilitate learning transfer, classifying the characteristics of transfer climate 
in situational cues and consequences. Whilst situational cues include manager goals, peer 
support and equipment availability, intended to remind trainees of their learning and 
providing them with opportunities to apply it, consequences entail punishment or positive or 
negative feedback following the application of learning on-the-job (Rouiller and Goldstein, 
1993). The effects of transfer climate have been examined in various studies, with Tracey 
and colleagues (1995) finding a direct relationship between transfer climate and post-training 
behaviours, and Colquitt and colleagues (2000) reporting climate to be moderately related 
to both motivation to learn and learning transfer. Additionally, the impact of transfer climate 
has been confirmed in a meta-analysis by Blume and colleagues (2010), finding climate to 
have the highest relationship with transfer (.27) in comparison to other work environment 
factors. 
Although support and opportunity to perform feature among the transfer climate situational 
cues, research has found these variables to uniquely impact training transfer (Burke and 
Hutchins, 2007). Supervisor’s feedback is a constant factor in learning transfer research 
(Clarke, 2002), with studies reporting a positive relationship between supervisor’s support 
and transfer (i.e. Blume et al., 2010; Lim and Johnson, 2002; Van den Bossche, Segers and 
Jansen, 2010; Xiao, 1996). As argued by Grossman and Salas (2011), supervisors provide 
support in multiple stages over the training process; prior to training, goal setting in the form 
of action plans or learning agreements between trainees and supervisors, can enhance 
commitment and motivation on both parts, resulting in greater transfer (Noe, 2008). 
Following training, supervisors need to provide employees with time, space and support 
required to transfer the newly acquired knowledge on the job (Diamantidis and Chatzoglou, 
2014), recognising the multidimensional role of the supervisor in adopting a variety of 
attitudes and behaviours over various stages in the training transfer process (Govaerts and 
Dochy, 2014). 
Despite the widespread agreement on the influence of supervisor support, some studies 
present non-significant relationships between supervisor support and transfer (i.e. Awoniyi 
et al., 2002; Chiaburu and Marinova, 2005; Velada et al., 2007) leading scholars to question 
the validity of the construct. A recent review on the role of supervisors in training transfer 
has revealed that a lack of conceptual clarity has led scholars to operationalise the construct 
of supervisor support differently, limiting opportunities for integration and generalisation of
<<<PAGE=74>>>
58 
 
previous findings (Govaerts and Dochy, 2014). Despite the contradictory evidence, this 
research maintains the dominant view in the transfer literature and following the approach 
taken by Chiaburu and Marinova (2005) conceptualises supervisor supports as 
encompassing a general view of employee development and more specific practical aspects 
as providing trainees with time for practicing new skills and offering reminders on the 
application of new knowledge and skills.  
With research into vocational education increasingly considering the role of the workplace 
supervisor in supporting training transfer (Pineda-Herrero et al., 2015; Renta Davids et al., 
2017), the following hypothesis is therefore advanced: 
H1b Supervisor support is positively related to the transfer of technical knowledge 
 
Peer support has also been consistently related with transfer (i.e. Cromwell and Kolb, 2004; 
Facteau et al., 1995; Hawley and Barnard, 2005; Xiao, 1996). In a study combining 
individual and contextual dimensions such as goal orientation, training self-efficacy, peer 
and supervisor support, Chiaburu and Marinova (2005) identified peer support as the 
variable having the only direct relationship with transfer. The scholars stress the importance 
of encouraging peer support in organisations through knowledge management and 
performance management systems rewarding knowledge sharing and mutual support 
(Chiaburu and Marinova, 2005). 
On the contrary, Blume and colleagues (2010) report peer support to have a weaker 
relationship (.14) than supervisor support (.31) with transfer, but acknowledge the findings 
to be based on small sample sizes. As ultimately argued by Grossman and Salas (2011), 
support from both peers and supervisors is important, and evidence is still limited on what 
factor exerts stronger influence. As reported by Van den Bossche, Segers and Jansen (2010), 
social support is a work environment factor strongly related with transfer, and referring to 
Russ-Eft (2002) the scholars maintain that whilst peers primarily support the use of learning 
on the job providing assistance and positive feedback, supervisors’ support is mainly related 
to providing reinforcement for learning on-the-job.  
Feedback from both peers and supervisors has been analysed as a support factor, with Velada 
and colleagues (2007) finding feedback on performance after training to significantly predict 
transfer. Feedback, positive and negative, features in transfer climate (Rouiller and
<<<PAGE=75>>>
59 
 
Goldstein, 1993), and feedback quality in terms of helpfulness as well as the number of 
feedback sources have been found in positive relation with transfer, proving that a diverse 
range of feedback sources benefits training transfer (Van den Bossche et al., 2010).  
In light of the positive evidence that feedback contributes to learning and performance, Salas 
and colleagues (2006) note that in order to be effective, feedback ought to meet specific 
criteria. These include being related to the performance of the task and not to the specific 
individual; providing information on how to improve learning in order to meet performance 
requirements; being perceived as relevant at all applicable levels, such as the individual and 
the team. 
In recognising the importance of feedback as support factor along with the importance of 
conceptualising support according to its source (i.e. peers and supervisor) (Chiaburu and 
Marinova, 2005), this research explores the association between apprentices’ job 
environment feedback request and training transfer. Following Diamantidis and Chatzoglou 
(2014), feedback from colleagues and feedback from supervisors is investigated as a factor 
that in enabling the intersection of formal and informal learning, contributes to the 
application of newly acquired knowledge and skills to the job. In light of compelling 
evidence that feedback seeking facilitates transfer of training (Sparr, Knipfer and Willems, 
2017), the following hypothesis are advanced: 
H1c C olleagues’ feedback is positively related to the transfer of technical knowledge 
H1d S upervisor’s feedback is positively related to the transfer of technical knowledge 
 
Finally, trainees need resources and plentiful opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills 
acquired off-the-job to the workplace (Burke and Hutchins, 2007; Grossmann and Salas, 
2011). A study of the factors influencing transfer within a human service agency identified 
limited opportunities to perform the newly acquired skills as the main barrier to transfer 
(Clarke, 2002), whilst interviews with trainees in a study conducted by Gilpin-Jackson and 
Bushe (2007) identified lack of time as the explanation for low transfer levels.  
Opportunity to use was identified as the main reason for transfer in a study on Korean 
organisations (Lim and Johnson, 2002), and features as an individual-level perception in the 
Learning Transfer System Inventory (LTSI) measuring ‘the extent to which trainees are 
provided with or obtain resources and tasks on the job enabling them to use training on the
<<<PAGE=76>>>
60 
 
job’ (Holton et al., 2000, pp. 345). In a study on the role of in terpersonal factors in the 
application of training, Bates and colleagues (2000) found opportunity to use to influen ce 
training transfer indirectly through its relationship with content validity, whilst Seyler and 
colleagues (1998) found opportunity to use to be a significant predictor of motivation to 
transfer.  
On the basis of the empirical and conceptual evidence reviewed, the following hypothesis is 
formulated: 
H1e O pportunity to use the knowledge and skills acquired in training is positively related 
to the transfer of technical knowledge 
 
2.5.2 Informal learning review and hypotheses development  
The situated nature of learning is the key theme running throughout the review of 
apprenticeship as model of learning, and of informal learning as source of competence 
development. However, despite the empirical and theoretical contributions of the situated 
perspective in recognising the social context as source of knowledge through interaction and 
participation in practice, the approach has been criticised for being restricted to a simple 
representation of how newcomers are socialised in the practices of the community (Cox, 
2005), and for overlooking the individual agency in adopting different forms of participation 
(Handley et al., 2006).  
The role of the individual in determining the engagement in workplace learning has been 
recognised by Billett (2001), who presents workplace learning as an inter-psychological 
process between workplace affordances and individual agencies, intended as how 
individuals select to engage in such affordances. In line with situated learning, Billett (2001) 
acknowledges the focal role played by the work environment as in providing opportunities 
to engage in practice and interactions, but stresses the mediating role of individual agency. 
Learning is therefore presented as the result of workplace experiences, mediated by both the 
contributions of the workplace and individual agency. The latter represents both how 
individuals decide to participate in learning opportunities, and what they construe from such 
experiences.  
Given that engagement in workplace learning is relatively under individual control, 
understanding the factors encouraging participation in informal learning is pivotal (Bednall 
et al., 2014).  Researchers have long examined the interplay between informal learning
<<<PAGE=77>>>
61 
 
activities, the work environment and individual characteristics of those engaging in such 
activities in order to further the understanding of how contextual and personal factors 
enhance or constrain informal learning (i.e. Boud and Middleton, 2003; Kwakman, 2003; 
Skule, 2004).  
Studies addressing individual characteristics have found self-efficacy and learning 
orientation to be positively related to activities such as reflection and feedback asking 
(Runhaar, Sanders and Yang, 2010), while van Rijn, Yang and Sanders (2013) identified 
career motivation to positively affect individuals’ engagement in activities as keeping up-to-
date, knowledge sharing and asking for feedback from supervisors, finding the former to be 
positively strengthened by individual self-construal. 
A conceptual model advanced by Doornbos, Bolhuis and Simons (2004) presents six work 
environment characteristics influencing work-related learning, encompassing managerial 
support, collegial support, opportunities to interact with different partners, task variation, 
work pressure and the level of individual autonomy. The scholars postulate that the level of 
attention, feedback, advice and support provided by managers and colleagues is expected to 
influence participation in workplace learning; additionally, the possibility to interact with a 
variety of partners and knowledgeable practitioners presents further opportunities to learn 
from and with others. Following Kwakman (2003), Doornbos and colleagues (2004) 
differentiate between work environment and task factors, identifying task variation and 
autonomy as conducive to intentional work-related learning.  
Empirical support for some of these factors was found in a study conducted on apprentices 
in Germany. Messmann and Mulder (2015) found apprentices perceiving work as complex, 
providing autonomy and support to more strongly engage in reflection on work-related 
challenges. Additionally, perceptions of work as complex were associated with apprentices’ 
engaging in reflective interactions with others, presenting evidence that work complexity, 
autonomy and social support facilitate informal learning in the workplace.  
Among studies investigating the work environment factors inhibiting participation in 
informal learning, Lohman (2000) identifies lack of time, lack of proximity to resources, 
lack of meaningful rewards for learning, and limited decision-making power as the main 
factors preventing teacher’s engagement in workplace learning. Similar findings were 
reported in a larger study conducted on public school teachers in the USA identifying lack 
of time, lack of proximity to colleagues’ work areas, and insufficient funds as the main
<<<PAGE=78>>>
62 
 
environmental inhibitors to learning (Lohman, 2006). Such findings are aligned with the 
model presented by Doornbos and colleagues (2004) and with the empirical findings 
presented by Kwakman (2003) in that collegial availability and support from colleagues 
were found to influence engagement in interactive learning activities.  
Furthermore, in a quantitative study surveying 1300 employees in the private sector and 200 
employees in the public sector in Norway, Skule (2004) identified seven conditions 
conducive to informal learning. These include exposure to changes, as in changes in 
technology and working methods; exposure to demands from customers, colleagues or 
managers; managerial responsibilities, as in task decision making or group projects; 
extensive professional contacts, as in participation in forums, trade fairs and occupational 
networks; superior feedback, as in learning from the results of work; management support 
for learning, as in feelings of encouragement from management; rewards of proficiency, as 
in monetary rewards or career opportunities. The empirical results of the study are strongly 
aligned with the theoretical model advanced by Doornbos and colleagues (2004) and with 
the findings of Eraut (2007), and introduce human resource policies such as reward and 
career opportunities as an additional factor. 
Factors affecting apprentices’ learning in the workplace  
The most salient factors influencing apprentices’ participation in informal learning are still 
unclear. Additionally, whilst research on formal training is widely established with a 
plethora of studies exploring factors supporting training transfer, several reviews and meta-
analysis (i.e. Artur et al., 2003; Bell et al., 2017; Burke and Hutchins, 2007; Grossman and 
Salas, 2011; Massenberg er al., 2017), and tested instruments for data collection (i.e. The 
Learning Transfer System Inventory by Holton and colleagues, 2000), research on informal 
learning is less consolidated. 
As discussed by Skule (2004), informal learning research faces a lack of indicators for 
measuring and comparing the quality of the learning environment. The scholar argues that 
most research on informal learning has adopted qualitative methods, which although 
insightful in identifying factors conducive to informal learning, is limited in generalisation 
hindering comparative studies across the economy. Additionally, parameters conventionally 
used to measure formal learning (i.e. level of qualification, number of hours of training 
attended) are not transferable to the informal learning domain.
<<<PAGE=79>>>
63 
 
In light of these considerations, Skule (2004) overcomes the difficulties in measuring 
informal learning directly, by developing and empirically testing a framework of the learning 
environment. The seven conditions conducive to informal learning identified in his research, 
although not exhaustive, are associated with learning intensive jobs and present the basis for 
measuring, comparing and assessing the quality of the workplace across industries and job 
types (Skule, 2004). This view is supported by Felstead and his colleagues (2005) who argue 
in favour of further examining the connections between learning and work design, and call 
on researchers to build ‘on the lessons of case studies which focus on how learning takes 
place in the work context’ (Felstead et al., 2005, pp. 361).  
When considering research on apprenticeship (i.e. Gijbels, Raemdonck and Vervecken, 
2010; Messmann and Mulder, 2015), the quality of the work environment has been assessed 
following the principles of the social psychological theory of work stress, also known as the 
Job Demand-Control Model (Karasek, 1979) and the Job Demand-Control-Support model 
(DCSM) (Karasek and Theorell, 1990).  According to the former, the interaction between 
job demand and job control can result in situations of strain (low strain or high-strain 
respectively). Alternatively, having decision latitude (i.e. job control) in situations of high 
psychological demand (i.e. mental workload, conflicting demands) can foster learning, 
motivation and the development of skills (Van der Doef and Maes, 1999). The DCSM 
introduces the dimension of social support and presents job characterised by high demand, 
low control and low support at risk of poor psychological well-being and poor health. 
Conversely, jobs providing an optimal balance of job demand, job control and social support 
are set to foster an active work orientation, enhancing opportunities for learning and 
development (Karasek and Theorell, 1990; Raemdonck, Gijbels and van Groen, 2014).  
Studies on apprenticeship have examined the work environment dimensions of work 
complexity, work autonomy and needs support as proxies for the dimensions of the DCSM 
(i.e. Messmann and Mulder, 2015), presenting evidence of how dimensions of the work 
environment facilitate apprentices’ engagement in informal learning. However, whilst the 
social psychological theory of work stress is insightful in turning the focus on situations of 
‘active learning’ and in addressing relevant facets of the work environment, such factors are 
inherently multidimensional and need to be operationalised carefully (Kwakman, 2003). 
Following Kwakman (2003) and Doornbos and colleagues (2004), this research 
differentiates between work environment and task factors and considers six constructs as 
contributing to apprentices’ competence development, as presented in figure 2.3:
<<<PAGE=80>>>
64

competencies  
 
Social Support 
As argued by Brown (2013), working and learning are social activities, and work 
relationships contribute to the development of knowledge and skills. Informal learning is 
indeed highly dependent on the quality of the human relationships in the workplace (Eraut, 
2004) and social and pedagogical relationships have been identified as pivotal in 
apprenticeship (Fuller and Unwin, 2003c).  
As postulated by Doornbos and colleagues (2004), the attention, feedback, advice and 
encouragement provided by colleagues and superiors, is likely to stimulate work-related 
learning. Social support, as in support from colleagues, has been found to influence 
participation in informal learning activities, although results presented by Kwakman (2003) 
indicate that the effects of support on participation in informal learning are relatively small. 
Evidence presented by Eraut and colleagues (2000) indicates that support from colleagues is 
important in building early career professionals’ levels of confidence in taking on 
challenging tasks, presenting a triangular relationship between confidence, support and 
challenges.  
When considering apprentices, as junior category of employees facing novel and challenging 
work situations, social support plays the role of psychological guidance in providing them 
with the resources required for remaining motivated (Messmann and Mulder, 2015). 
Evidence available on the role of social support in apprenticeship is however mixed. The 
study conducted by Gijbels and colleagues (2010) in Belgium did not find social support 
along with job control and job demand to predict work-related learning, although the
<<<PAGE=81>>>
65 
 
scholars ascribe the insignificant results to the structure of the data. On the other hand, 
Messman and Mulder (2015) researching apprentices in Germany found social support to 
significantly predict the informal learning activity of reflecting alone.  
Despite the limited and contradictory evidence available, this research follows the theoretical 
assumptions discussed above and advances the following hypothesis: 
H2a:     Social support is positively related to a) job competence; b) work and business skills 
Feedback 
In addition to support, research demonstrates the value of feedback in sustaining engagement 
in workplace learning and in supporting competence development. Specifically, Eraut 
(2007) found feedback to influence early career professionals’ levels of motivation and 
commitment, and recognised the importance of informal feedback, as in the feedback 
provided by the person on the spot rather than normative feedback from performance 
appraisal, over the first period of a new job. 
Additionally, research conducted by Mulder (2013) on the effects of feedback on informal 
learning found that 367 reported feedback incidents led to 913 informal learning activities. 
Among these feature reflection, discussions with colleagues and supervisors, and 
approaching colleagues for advice, indicating the relevance of feedback in stimulating both 
individual and social learning activities.  
Added to this, research on leadership development conducted by DeRue and Wellman 
(2009) found the availability of feedback to mitigate the diminishing returns of 
developmental challenges, enhancing individuals’ self -awareness and reducing stress. The 
findings are particularly important in recognising the value of feedback in helping 
individuals cope with the uncertainty associated with novel and challenging tasks. The 
scholar present sound evidence of the role of feedback in supporting individuals in highly 
developmental job assignments, demonstrating that in counterbalancing the levels of 
uncertainty associated with challenges, feedback allowed individuals to remain focused.  
On the basis of this evidence, and given the lack of research on feedback in the context of 
apprenticeship, the following hypothesis is advanced: 
H2b: Feedback is positively related to a) job competence; b) work and business skills
<<<PAGE=82>>>
66 
 
Problem solving and experimenting  
In the context of apprenticeship, a challenging work environment presents situations and 
tasks which require competence just over the level of existing apprentices’ competencies, 
hence activating learning in order to master the challenge at hand (Messmann and Mulder, 
2015). Evidence on the influence of challenging work in apprenticeship is contradictory, 
with Gijbels and colleagues (2010) finding no significant relation between job demand and 
workplace learning, and Messmann and Mulder (2015) finding work complexity to predict 
reflecting alone and reflecting with others.  
Whilst previous research operationalised work complexity as in the scope in planning, 
preparing and carrying out work tasks (i.e. Messmann and Mulder, 2015), here challenging 
work is operationalised as source of skill development. The challenges of the job have indeed 
been identified as main source of skill development in entailing engagement in problem 
solving, in activities requiring creativity and the exercise of judgement (Brown, 2009).  
Problem solving has been identified as learning opportunity in a study conducted by 
Brockman and Dirks (2006) on twenty manufacturing workers who associate problem 
solving with the construction of new knowledge contributing to enhanced performance and 
expertise. Problem solving is also classified as a working activity with learning as a by-
product by Eraut (2007), reflecting the experiential dimension of informal learning. 
Accordingly, problem solving is here considered as important component of challenging 
work experiences that in presenting novel and complex situations activates a learning 
response (Doornbos, Bolhuis & Simons 2004). 
Similarly, experimenting as in trying things out and engaging in trial and error has been 
identified as informal learning activitiy by Eraut (2007), Cheetham and Chivers (2001) and 
most recently Becker and Bish (2017). As argued by Van Woerkem and Croon (2008), 
experimenting reflects individual learning ‘by trying out new ways of working’ (pp. 320), 
and is associated with the last stage of the experiential learning cycle (Kolb, 1984) where 
individuals try out and test knowledge and skills acquired through reflecting on previous 
concrete experiences.  
Based on this evidence, problem solving and experimenting represent challenging and novel 
situations requiring apprentices to stretch their abilities and engage in learning. The 
following hypotheses are therefore advanced:
<<<PAGE=83>>>
67 
 
H2c:  Problem solving is positively related to a) job competence; b) work and business 
skills  
H2d: Experimenting is positively related to a) job competence and b) work and business 
skills  
 
Task autonomy 
Theory suggests that task autonomy is an important factor in determining individual 
engagement in informal learning. Doornbos and colleagues (2004) postulate that when 
granted autonomy, individuals are given discretion in selecting the most appropriate method 
for completing the task, providing opportunities to include learning goals. Felstead and 
colleagues (2005) who found job design to facilitate learning at work have provided 
empirical support for this proposition. Specifically, individual influence in organising, 
planning and checking the quality of the work is positively associated with both learning by 
acquisition (i.e. training courses) and learning by participation (i.e. work experience). 
Additionally, a recent meta-analysis investigating the antecedents of informal learning has 
found task autonomy in positive association with informal learning behaviours (Cerasoli et 
al., 2018).  
Added to this, Wood and de Menezes (2011) observed a strong relationship between 
enriched jobs, as in providing individuals responsibility in managing and executing the 
primary tasks, and well-being. Correspondingly, the scholars postulate that enriched jobs, in 
encompassing a certain degree of variety and autonomy, can increase opportunities for skills 
use and development. Conversely, other studies present contradictory evidence as Kwakman 
(2003) and Gijbels and colleagues (2010) did not find any association between work 
autonomy and workplace learning. These studies did not however dismiss the relevance of 
task factors in influencing participation in informal learning with Kwakman (2003) arguing 
that the effects of task and work environment factors may have been diminished because 
personal factors where simultaneously included in the analysis, suggesting a mediated effect.   
In particular, Messmann and Mulder (2015) discuss the importance of work autonomy in 
apprenticeship in empowering apprentices to ‘actively respond to cha llenges at work with 
learning activities they consider appropriate for the situation and task at hand’ (pp. 583), and 
present preliminary evidence for the association between work autonomy and apprentices
<<<PAGE=84>>>
68 
 
engagement in reflecting alone. Accordingly, this research advances the following 
hypothesis: 
H2e:  Task autonomy is positively related to a) job competence; b) work and business skills  
 
Task interdependence  
In line with situated learning, another aspect conducive to professional development is that 
of task interdependence. As discussed by Doornbos and colleagues (2004), the possibility to 
interact with a variety of interaction partners comprising managers, peers, clients, interns, 
suppliers presents opportunities for learning in the workplace. Empirical evidence is 
presented by Eraut (2007) who, researching early-career professionals as nurses, engineers 
and accountants, identified participation in group processes such as team working and 
collaborations as main source of learning.  
A comprehensive study on how professionals work in practice conducted by Cheetham and 
Chivers (2001) on 80 practitioners from 20 different professions presents similar evidence, 
identifying learning via interactions (i.e. observing others, shadowing, and working in teams, 
with clients) as important source of competence development. Learning from interactions 
within communities and networks has also been identified as pivotal in developing an 
understanding of the whole work process as well as developing expertise in a study on career 
adaptabilities conducted by Brown, Bimrose, Barnes and Hughes (2012).  
Additionally, Fuller and Unwin (2003b) present evidence of the influence of the scope, 
length and aim of apprentices’ participation in the workplace. The scholars argue that 
expansive apprenticeships entail a breadth of experience fostered by cross-company 
experiences built into the programme. Whilst the scholars refer to breadth of experience as 
in planned rotation (i.e. placements) within the company, interdependence is here considered 
as task factor, considering how the job is designed.  
Given that task interdependence provides individuals with a collaborative learning 
environment (Runhaar et al., 2016), it is expected that the level of collaboration and 
interaction among individuals to achieve the intended goals would positively influence 
apprentices learning experiences. Additionally, interacting with members of the same or 
different unit would contribute to knowledge sharing and opportunities for feedback, 
contributing to apprentices’ competence development.
<<<PAGE=85>>>
69 
 
With no research to my knowledge on the influence of task interdependence in 
apprenticeship, the following hypothesis is advanced: 
H2f:  Task interdependence is positively related to a) job competence and b) work and 
business skills  
 
2.6 Chapter summary and conclusion  
The chapter has developed a model of apprenticeship that specifies how formal and informal 
learning, conceptualised as facets of the training intervention and the work environment, 
contribute to the development of apprentices’ end-state competencies.  
Building on extant work on apprenticeships (i.e. expansive-restrictive framework), this 
research offers a holistic model that captures important factors critical for a positive and 
effective apprenticeship experience. In turning the spotlight onto the work environment, this 
research reconciles the polarised positions of learner-centred and teacher-centred approaches 
to pedagogy (see Fuller and Unwin, 1998) and recognises the apprentice as active recipient 
and constructor of knowledge.  
Whilst the expansive-restrictive framework of apprenticeship (Fuller and Unwin, 2013) 
considers the quality of the learning environment in terms of the a pprenticeship’s 
institutional and contextual arrangements, this study specifically addresses the combined 
influence of formal and informal learning in contributing to apprentices’ development. In 
doing so, this research draws on conceptual and empirical studies dominating the formal and 
informal learning literature to construct an apprenticeship development model. 
The contributions of the chapter are three-fold. Firstly, considering the integrated approach 
to formal and informal learning advocated in apprenticeship research, this study consider the 
respective contribution of these learni ng modes to apprentices’ development. In doing so, 
the research identifies specific categories of apprenticeship competencies (technical 
knowledge, job competence, work and business skills) as meaningful outcomes critical for 
individual performance.  
Secondly, focusing on the work environment this research identifies factors that support the 
transfer of knowledge acquired in formal training to the workplace, along with factors that 
encourage and enable apprentices’ engagement in informal learning. This has informed the 
design of a model of apprenticeship development that provides greater understanding on
<<<PAGE=86>>>
70 
 
which factors in the work environment are associated with meaningful competencies. By 
testing the model empirically, the research provides much needed insight for organisations 
and policy makers identifying key factors required for supporting apprentices’ development.  
Thirdly, whilst developing a model for apprenticeship development, the research contributes 
to inform workforce development more generally, showing that by intertwining educational 
experiences (i.e. formal training) with developmental activities inside the workplace (i.e. 
informal learning), organizations can achieve optimum value from key talent.

Chapter 3 
The influence of HRM and learning goal orientation on 
apprentices’ professional development 
 
 
3.1 Introduction 
Having introduced the apprenticeship development model in Chapter 2, pondering how 
formal and informal learning contribute to the development of apprentices’ end -state 
competencies, the focus now turns to critical boundary conditions at contextual and 
individual level. This is an important consideration as research indicates that both individual 
and contextual factors influence professional development (i.e. Dragoni et al., 2009; 
Runhaar, Sanders and Yang, 2010; Velada, Caetano, Michel, Lyons and Kavanagh, 2007). 
Turning the focus on higher-level organisational factors, this research addresses the 
limitations of the formal training literature, which in presenting a narrow focus on 
environmental factors as transfer climate and support (i.e. Govaerts and Dochy, 2014; 
Rouiller and Goldstein, 1993), overlooks the effects of non-training related factors at 
organisational level with potential implications for training transfer (Kontoghiorghes, 2004). 
As recently discussed by Sitzmann and Weinhardt (2018), in focusing on narrow 
components of the training domain, existing theories provide a limited understanding of the 
process. Similarly, informal learning research has at length considered situational factors 
enhancing participation in workplace learning with a limited focus on immediate 
environmental factors as the challenge of the job and opportunities for interactions (i.e. 
Doornbos et al., 2004; Eraut, 2007; Lave and Wenger, 1991).  
In line with recent research developments, where scholars as Ballesteros-Rodriguez, De Saa-
Perez and Dominguez-Falcon (2012) have investigated the influence of contextual factors 
as the organisational culture and HR practices on transfer of training, whilst Bednall, Sanders 
and Runhaar (2014) have examined the influence of the HRM system strength on 
participation in informal learning activities, this research adopts a macro-level of analysis . 
In doing so, this chapter introduces the principles of social exchange theory (Blau, 1964 ; 
Setton, Bennett and Liden, 1996) in combination with the communicative function of the 
HRM system (Guest, 2011) and investigates how the latter encourages apprentices’  
competence development by means of a quality employment relationship. Defining 
apprenticeships as investments in core talent, the high-commitment HR system is presented
<<<PAGE=88>>>
72 
 
as the strategy for managing a quality employment relationship with apprentices as high 
value employees (i.e. Lepak and Snell, 1999). Adopting the process approach to HRM 
(Bowen and Ostroff, 2004), the influence of the HRM system in apprenticeship is examined 
shifting the focus on the HRM system’s signalling function  (Ehrnrooth and Bjorkman, 
2012). Added to this, PA as distinctive HR practice is examined as facilitator of informal 
learning in apprenticeship. 
 
Additionally, in line with leadership development studies (i.e. Dragoni et al., 2009; DeRue 
and Wellmann, 2009), this research introduces a further consideration: the role played by the 
individual in the learning process. In doing so, the research presents a nuanced understanding 
of the apprenticeship in examining the interplay of formal and informal learning with a 
critical contingency, that of learning goal orientation, as discrete dimension that underlies 
apprentices’ learning behaviours and consequent competence development.  
As both formal and informal learning research indicates that learning goal orientation is a 
significant dimension in explaining both trainees’ motivation to learn and resultant outcomes 
(i.e. Klein, Noe and Wang, 2006), and employees’ engagement in informal learning activities 
(i.e. Runhaar, Sanders and Yang, 2010), it is here deemed an important determinant of 
apprentices’ responses to developmental opportunities a nd resultant competencies. 
Accordingly, the research explores how apprentices’ learning orientation influences the way 
apprentices respond to formal training at college or University, and approach informal 
learning in the workplace, expecting apprentices displaying high levels of learning 
orientation to benefit the most.  
Introducing these crucial boundary conditions in apprenticeship the chapter is structured in 
three parts. The first part presents a classification of apprentices as core employees and, 
drawing on the HR architecture model advanced by Lepak and Snell (1999), identifies the 
appropriate HR configuration for sustaining a positive employment relationship in 
apprenticeship. Adopting the process approach to HRM, the chapter outlines the hypothesis 
regarding the apprenticeship training, encompassing formal and informal learning, and the 
HRM system strength in facilitating apprentices’ competen ce development. Secondly, the 
chapter reviews PA as critical HR practice for developing and motivating apprentices and 
presents the hypothesis evaluating PA as facilitator of informal learning. The third part turns 
to the learning orientation literature and introduces the hypothesis evaluating the relevance
<<<PAGE=89>>>
73 
 
of the construct in apprenticeship as human capital development programme. Lastly, the 
empirical and theoretical contributions of the chapter are discussed.  
 
3.2 Apprentices as high value employees 
Drawing on the human resource architecture model of Lepak and Snell (1999, 2002), the 
apprenticeship is here conceptualised as internal development employment mode where 
human capital is developed in the organisation. With employers investing in apprenticeships 
to develop their talent pipeline, with a preference to train their own workforce and meet a 
close fit between skills and business needs (Hogarth et al., 2012a), apprentices are 
considered as core employees. Core employees are both strategically valuable and unique to 
the organisation, particularly in knowledge-intensive industries (Lepak and Snell, 2002). In 
being strategically valuable, core employees possess the skills required to contribute to the 
firm’s strategic objectives and competitive advantage; in being unique, core employees 
possess skills that are firm specific (Lepak and Snell, 1999). Given that organisations invest 
in apprenticeships to internally develop core and firm specific talent (Winterbotham et al., 
2012), apprentices are here presented as high value employees. As argued by Lepak and 
Snell (2002, pp. 520), the employment mode of core employees i s ‘structured around skills 
and competencies, rather than on the execution of programmed tasks and routines’. Such 
conceptualisation strongly reflects apprentices’ dual status of worker and learner (Fuller and 
Unwin, 2003c) where the execution of daily tasks is learning-driven to develop the 
knowledge and skills required to become proficient. Accordingly, apprentices are here 
presented as high value employees that organisations have decided to internally develop in 
order to create core talent. 
 
 
3.3 Apprenticeship HRM configuration  
Having presented the apprenticeship as human capital development programme reflecting 
the philosophy of internally developing the organisation’s talent as corporate resource allows 
to account for its embeddedness in an HRM system. HRM systems have been conceptualised 
at the highest level of abstraction as ‘the pattern of planned human resource deployments 
and activities intended to enable an organisation to achieve its goals’ (Wright and McMahan, 
1992, pp. 298), encompassing both the contingency and the configurational perspective 
(Delery and Doty, 1996). Scholars have long acknowledged that researching systems of 
practices is more appropriate than focusing on single practices in isolation (Delery, 1998;
<<<PAGE=90>>>
74 
 
Lepak et al., 2006), however research presents various classifications of the practices that 
make up such systems (i.e. Delery and Doty, 1996; Huselid, 1995).  
The configurational view of HRM is complicated in that lists of descriptors of HR practices 
tend to follow a universalistic approach and therefore lack to account for the contextual 
nature of the HRM system (Armstrong, 2008). Boxall and Mackey (2009) support this view, 
contending that constructing HRM systems on the basis of ‘best practices’ without 
accounting for the contextual settings is strongly debatable. Similarly, Lepak and colleagues 
(2006) argue that such lists of practices fail to justify the reasons why such practices have 
been included or excluded, neglecting to explain the relationship among practices and the 
mechanisms by which the HRM system functions and impacts on performance.  
Accordingly, Kinnie and his colleagues (2005) argue that the assumption that HR policies 
and practices are applied uniformly to different groups of employees needs to be questioned. 
The scholars advance the proposition of focusing research on ‘narrowly defined occupational 
groupings’ (pp. 23) and so identifying bundles of policies and practices reflecting the 
character of the particular employment group. In more general terms, Boxall and Macky 
(2009) suggest that a more significant representation of an HRM system ought to be based 
on the themes and philosophies at the basis of the management approach to work and 
employment practices.  
Following these propositions, the focus turns on identifying HRM systems associated with 
investments in human capital development, overcoming the limitations of the universalistic 
‘best practice’ approach in treating different groups of employees uniformly. As argued by 
Liao, Toya, Lepak and Hong (2009), HRM systems are differentiated across employee 
groups reflecting the status of different employee groups in relation to the respective 
contribution to the organisation’s strategy. Such differentiation results in variability in the 
levels of implementation of specific HR practices for certain categories of employees, 
indicating that ‘the most appropriate mode of investment in human capital will vary for 
different types of human capital’ (Lepak and Snell, 1999, pp. 32).  
Having established that organisations employ a heterogeneous workforce, an overview of 
what differentiates different approaches to HRM for various employment groups follows. 
As discussed by Lepak and Snell (1999), differences in employment are dependent on the 
strategic value and uniqueness of human capital, subsequently resulting in variations in the 
HR strategies used to manage specific employment groups. Accordingly, the HR architecture
<<<PAGE=91>>>
75 
 
model of Lepak and Snell (1999, 2002) identifies four HR configurations associated with 
four different employment modes. Firstly, when human capital is highly unique to the 
organisation but not strategically valuable to be internally employed, organisations are likely 
to rely on alliances and partnerships. Examples of alliances providing long-term customised 
services are legal consultants or research and development labs. A collaborative HR 
configuration is here adopted to foster trust, collaboration, cooperation and information 
sharing among the parts; practices as team building, job rotation, mentoring and group-based 
rewards are adopted. Secondly, when human capital is neither strategically valuable nor 
unique, organisations rely on contractual employment. Temporary employees performing 
low-level jobs as clerical and support are outsourced ensuring staff flexibility to the 
organisation. Given the short-term and transactional nature of the employment relationship, 
HRM systems fostering compliance are adopted. Rules, regulations and work protocols take 
centre stage.  
Thirdly, when human capital is highly valuable in terms of contributing to the organisation 
strategy but not firm specific, organisations internalise employment acquiring employees 
with existing generic skills that are widely available in the labour market. Examples are 
accountants hired to perform determined tasks.  This acquisition employment mode is 
associated with a market-based HR configuration whereby training and development 
practices are kept to a minimum and emphasis is placed on selective staffing and rewards. 
On the contrary, when human capital is both strategically valuable and unique, organisations 
internalise employment and internally develop talent with core skills. Examples are creative 
engineers constantly developing new technologies contributing to the organisation’s 
strategy. Given that the internal development employment mode has a long-term focus and 
involves important investments in creating core and specific talent, Lepak and Snell (1999) 
argue that organisations adopt a commitment approach to HRM in order to sustain a 
relational employment relationship. Practices as training and development, empowerment 
and developmental PA are adopted to foster commitment and a long-term orientation.  
In testing the HR architecture model empirically, Lepak and Snell (2002) present compelling 
evidence that different HR models tend to be used for different employment groups. In 
particular, the commitment-based HR configuration tends to be more commonly applied to 
core employees reflecting the knowledge-based employment mode, rather than to noncore 
employee groups. Among the jobs identified in the knowledge-based employment mode 
Lepak and Snell (2002) list engineers (design, mechanical), professional employees,
<<<PAGE=92>>>
76 
 
research and development employees and analysts. Similarly, commitment-based HR 
practices contribute to firm performance in manufacturing firms (Arthur, 1994), and a re 
critical for key knowledge workers such as scientists and engineers operating in high 
technology firms (Collins and Smith, 2006). Accordingly, having presented apprentices as 
high value core employees who are internally developed by the organisation in order to 
create strategic talent, the high commitment HR configuration is reviewed as the HR model 
for managing the employment relationship in apprenticeship.  
3.3.1 High-Commitment HRM  
A commitment-based HR configuration is characterised by the underlying theme of 
enhancing employees commitment to the organisation, rather than adopting policies and 
practices directed towards control and compliance (Boxall, 2012). Stemming from different 
underlying management philosophies, a commitment-based approach stands in stark contrast 
with a transaction-based approach to HRM. Whilst the transaction-based approach has a 
short term focus relying on the external labour market (Collins and Smith, 2006), is control-
oriented in order to minimise labour costs and increase efficiency, and uses narrow and well-
defined jobs, requiring low skills and minimal training (Lepak et al., 2006), a commitment-
based approach entails a long-term focus on developing the or ganisation’s internal labour 
market, valuing employees’ technical and social development and fostering motivation 
towards the organisation’s goals (Tsui et al., 1997). The high commitment HR configuration 
is focused on nurturing employee involvement, maxim ising employees’ contributions 
towards the organisation’s objectives and gaining maximum returns from investments in 
human capital development (Lepak and Snell, 1999).  
At the basis of the commitment approach to HRM is the alignment of the individual 
objectives with those of the organisation, and as reported by Arthur (1994:672), 
‘commitment human resource systems shape desired employee behaviours and attitudes by 
forging psychological links between organisational and employee goals’, underlying a 
relationship of mutuality and trust among the parts. Research indicates that in order to shape 
such a strong psychological connection, high commitment systems adopt bundles of 
practices such as selective staffing, career opportunities, performance appraisal and 
participation in decision making (Sanders, Dorenbosch and de Reuver, 2008). Similarly, 
Lepak and colleagues (2006) report that high-commitment systems implement practices as 
intensive training and development, socialisation, internal promotion and high levels of 
compensation.
<<<PAGE=93>>>
77 
 
Such practices are intended to foster a relational employment relationship where the 
expectations and obligations between the employer and the employee involve open-ended 
exchanges and long-term mutual investments (Tsui et al., 1997). For example, practices of 
recruitment and selection are based on the philosophy of growing the organisation’s talent, 
rather than acquiring sets of skills and expertise. Thus the recruitment and selection process 
are based on aptitudes and on the capacity to learn rather than achievement (Lepak and Snell, 
2002), while staffing decisions are likely to reflect employees’ potential in terms of cognitive 
abilities and attitudes, rather than technical knowledge (Lepak and Snell, 1999). Similarly, 
career development practices associated with an internal labour market and focus ed on 
continuous improvement are strongly related to employees’ commitment towards the 
organisation (Delery and Doty, 1996; Lepak et al., 2006). As demonstrated by Meyer and 
Smith (2000), career development practices are the best predictor of affective and normative 
commitment in signalling the active role of the organisation in supporting employees and in 
preparing them for career progression.  
Overall, such practices signal long-term investments in employees and support a relationship 
of mutuality between the employee and the organisation (Sun, Aryee and Law, 2007). 
According to the principles of social exchange (Blau, 1964), as organisations invest in 
employees’ development, such organisation’s inducements in turn foster employees’ 
reciprocation with contributions towards the organisation’s objectives and positive attitudes 
towards the employer. Research presents empirical evidence of the influence of social 
exchange principles in the employment relationship, indicating that when employees feel 
valued and supported by the organisation, their commitment and discretionary behaviours 
are enhanced (i.e. Chamber and Sobral, 2011; Settoon et al., 1996). Additionally, as 
discussed by Collins and Smith (2006), commitment-based practices are strongly associated 
with firm performance in creating an environment that, in line with the strategic view of 
HRM, fosters individuals’ attitudes and behaviours that support the organisation’s objectives 
(Bowen and Ostroff, 2004). 
Furthermore, research indicates that employees’ attributions that HR practices are motivated 
by the organisation’s concern for their continuous development and wellbeing are reflected 
in high quality exchange relationships. The model advanced by Nishii, Lepak and Schneider 
(2008) follows the social exchange principles and presents HR attributions in relation to 
perceptions of the organisation’s employee -oriented philosophy. The scholars demonstrate 
that in commitment-based HR systems (Arthur, 1994) employees are likely to feel valued
<<<PAGE=94>>>
78 
 
and reciprocate the organisation’s favourable treatments with positive attitudes. Similarly, 
employees interpreting HR practices as part of a quality HR strategy regarding human capital 
as a core organisational ass et and investing in employees’ deve lopment and wellbeing, are 
likely to reciprocate with high levels of commitment (Nishii et al., 2008).  
Moreover, when taking a micro contingency perspective, the quality of the employment 
relationship reflecting the principles of social exchange (Blau, 1964), is critical in explaining 
the effectiveness of developmental programmes. Research conducted by Kuvaas (2008) 
demonstrates that a high quality employment relationship is necessary in order for 
employees to positively respond to developmental opportunities in ways that benefit 
themselves and the organisation. In a study on 593 employees operating in 64 local savings 
bank in Norway, Kuvaas (2008) conceptualises the employee-organisational relationship 
(EOR) in terms of perceived organisational support (POS), affective commitment, 
procedural justice and interactional justice. Examining whether the quality of the EOR 
impacts on the relationship between perceived developmental HR practices (i.e. career 
development, training opportunities, and performance appraisal) and employee outcomes 
(i.e. work performance, turnover intensions), Kuvaas finds supporting evidence that the EOR 
positively moderates the relationship between perception of developmental practices and 
individual outcomes. The study presents important implications for organisations investing 
in human capital development, as employees’ perceptions of and responses to such 
investments are strongly dependent on the quality of the EOR.  
According to Kuvaas’ findings (20 08), employee s’ experiencing a quality employment 
relationship are more likely to make effective use of developmental HR practices developing 
their skills and improving their performance levels in reciprocation to the organisation’s 
investments in their development. On the contrary, those experiencing low quality 
employment relationships are reluctant to engage in developmental opportunities or tend to 
respond to these opportunistically, focusing on their own individual gains enhancing their 
skills and abilities in the labour market, rather than applying these for the organisational 
benefit. Given that apprenticeships are investments in human capital, the high-commitment 
HR system is critical in shaping and supporting a quality employment relationship of 
mutuality, interdependency and reciprocity (Sun, Aryee and Law, 2007) fostering 
apprentices to reciprocate the organisation with positive behaviours and contributions 
aligned with the organisation’s objectives.
<<<PAGE=95>>>
79 
 
The apprenticeship is thus characterised as a mutual investment employee-organisation 
relationship (Tsui et al., 1997) implying a social exchange between the parts rather a purely 
economic one (Blau, 1964). Social exchange relationships entail mutual investments with 
employers considering employees long-term well-being such as career opportunities within 
the firm, and with employees learning firm specific knowledge and skills and viewing the 
organisation’s objectives as their own (Tsui et al., 1997). Such mechanisms are evident in 
apprenticeships with employers investing in the organisation future talent, presenting 
apprentices with opportunities for employment, training and qualification, and apprentices 
in turn developing general and firm specific knowledge and skills and contributing to the 
organisation objectives as part of their daily work.  
Accordingly, the high-commitment HR strategy is expected to foster a positive employment 
relationship between the apprentice and the employing organisation, sustaining apprentices’ 
competence development. However, given that research indicates that in order for HR 
practices to elicit the intended attitudes and responses, they first need to be interpreted as 
intended by the organisation (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004; Nishii et al., 2008), attention is here 
directed at the communicative function of the HR system (Guest, 2011; Pereira and Gomes, 
2012) by means of the HR process approach.  
 
3.4 HRM implementation  
The HRM system has been described as set of communication processes between the 
organisation and its employees (Tsui et al., 1997). In early work on multi-level research in 
HRM, Ostroff and Bowen (2000, pp. 233) advance the proposition that HR practices 
‘communicate promises and future intents in the name of the organisation through types of 
hiring practices, rewar d practices, and developmental activities’, sending messages to 
employees about valued behaviours and mutual expectations. In recognising HR practices 
as the primary means through which the employee-organisational relationship is established 
(Lepak and Snell, 1999), recent theoretical and research developments have shifted the focus 
to the HRM process approach (i.e. Bowen and Ostroff, 2004; Nishii et al., 2008). In doing 
so, researchers have started to consider key aspects of the implementation of HR practices 
at the basis of the HRM system signalling and communicative function (Ehrnrooth and 
Bjorkman, 2012).
<<<PAGE=96>>>
80 
 
Whilst previous research focused on the content of HRM considering the virtues or vices 
associated with particular practices, the process view of HRM addresses the psychological 
processes through which employees interpret and attribute certain meanings to HRM 
(Sanders, Shipton and Gomes, 2014). This approach stems from the consideration that 
employees’ perceptions of HR practices determine their attitudes and behaviours (Kinnie et 
al., 2005; Wright and Nishii, 2007), drawing attention to the fact that in order for HR 
practices to elicit the desired attitudes and behaviours, they first need to be perceived and 
interpreted in ways that stimulate appropriate attitudinal and behavioural responses (Nishii 
et al., 2008). 
Such conceptualisation recognises the possibility that HR practices can be interpreted 
idiosyncratically (Katou et al., 2014) leading individual responses to vary depending on the 
attributions inferred about the reasons why such practices were implemented (Nishii et al., 
2008), or following the co-variation principle in attribution theory (Kelley, 1967), depending 
on causal attributions inferred from features of the contextual situation (Sanders and Yang, 
2016). The study conducted by Nishii and colleagues (2008) presents compelling evidence 
that individual attributions for the same HR practice differ (i.e. commitment-focused versus 
control-focused employee-oriented philosophy), with consequences for related attitudes and 
behaviours.  More recently, an experimental study and a field study conducted by Sanders 
and Yang (2016) found that when employees made sense of HRM as intended by 
management, in perceiving the HRM system with high levels of distinctiveness, consistency 
and consensus, the impact of high-commitment practices on affective organisational 
commitment was maximised.  
Whilst the former study focuses on the locus of causality, intended as the reasons why 
management implements specific HR practices (Sanders, Shipton and Gomes, 2014), and 
the latter adopts attribution theory derived from social psychology to investigate how 
employees make sense of HRM, both studies turn the focus on the way HR practices are 
enacted in the organisation drawing attention to the way the HRM system communicates the 
content and purpose of specific HR practices (Guest, 2011). As reported by Pereira and 
Gomes (2012), communication is key in the HRM process, recognising that the way the HR 
message is transmitted thro ugh the practices’ implementation, and how it is received by 
employees, affect the message interpretation and consequent response.
<<<PAGE=97>>>
81 
 
3.4.1 HRM process 
Introducing the process approach to HRM, Bowen and Ostroff (2004; see also Ostroff and 
Bowen, 2000; 2016) advance a differentiation between the HRM system content, intended 
as the policies and practices that make up the system to achieve a specific set of objectives, 
and the HRM system process, referring to the design and administration of the system 
through defining meta-features which communicate and signal expected behaviours and 
performance expectation to employees. Since the introduction of the process approach to 
HRM, this has been presented as ‘the way HR policies and practices are communicated to 
employees’ (Li, Frenkel and Sanders, 2011, pp. 1826), and it has been more specifically 
defined as the ‘features of the HRM system, such as its perceived relevance and validity, 
which should strengthen and clarify the signals it sends to employees about performance 
expectations’ (Ehrnrooth and Bjormann, 2012, pp. 1110).  
Recognising that appropriate employees’ reactions are dependent on employees perceiving 
and interpreting HR practices as intended by the organisation, Bowen and Ostroff (2004) use 
attribution theory (Kelley, 1967) to identify the features that would allow messages to be 
received and interpreted uniformly. The scholars theorise that individuals can make 
confident attributions about cause-effect relationships depending on situational aspects of 
distinctiveness, consistency and consensus (Sanders et al., 2008). Distinctiveness refers to 
features of the HRM system that attract employees’ attention and stimulate interest; 
consistency refers to features that present the cause-effect relationship as stable and constant 
over time, people and contexts; and consensus refers to shared agreement among employees, 
as well as shared agreement among policy makers, about the cause-effect relationship 
(Bowen and Ostroff, 2004).  
As reported by Ehrnrooth and Bjorkman (2012), the features of distinctiveness, consistency 
and consensus enable employees’ attributions of cause -effect relationships in the HRM 
system and enhance employees’ understanding of the organisational expected behaviours, 
aligning individual and organisational goals. Central to the model advanced by Bowen and 
Ostroff (2004) is the role of climate and the notion of situational strength, intended as a 
strong HRM system contributing to consistency and uniformity in attitudes and behaviours 
within the group (Pereira and Gomes, 2012). As argued by Bowen and Ostroff (2004; see 
also Ostroff and Bowen, 2016), the HRM process construct is based on the assumption that 
as employees interpret HR practices idiosyncratically, these result in individual level 
psychological climate perceptions; however, shared higher-level perceptions arise when the
<<<PAGE=98>>>
82 
 
HRM system presents meta-features of distinctiveness, consistency and consensus, resulting 
in the emergence of a strong climate. The scholars maintain that in a strong situation ‘HRM 
practices, as a system, can contribute to firm performance by motivating employees to adopt 
desired attitudes and behaviours that, in the collective, help achieve the organisation’s 
strategic goals’ (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004, pp. 204). 
Although the original conceptualisation of the HRM system strength maintains a group or 
organisational level of analysis, presenting employees’ shared perceptions as precursors of 
a strong organisational climate in turn leading to organisational performance (Sanders, 
Shipton and Gomes, 2014), researchers have explored the HRM process approach from 
different angles and at different levels. A review conducted by Wang (2015) identifies three 
approaches to the study of employees’ perceptions of HRM categorised in: rated HR M, 
examining employees’ perceptions of the ‘what’ of practices (i.e. Wright and Nishii, 2007); 
HRM strength, examining the features of HRM practices (i.e. Bowen and Ostroff, 2004); 
and attributed HRM, focusing on employees’ perceptions of the ‘why’ of HR practices (i.e. 
Nishii, Lepak and Schneider, 2008), often adopting an individual level of analysis (i.e. 
Bednall et al, 2014, Bednall and Sanders, 2016).  
In reviewing the HRM process literature Wang (2015) maintains that whilst these 
approaches investigate different dimensions of employees’ perceptions of HRM practices, 
they should not be considered as distinct, but as ‘facets of the same phenomenon’ (Wang, 
2015, pp. 16752). Acknowledging the complexity of the HRM construct, encompassing 
content, process and intent, this research adopts the HRM system strength approach focusing 
on the effects of perceived features of the entire HRM system in communicating messages 
to employees. This is an important consideration given the focus of the research on 
apprenticeship as human capital development strategy implementing the high-commitment 
HR system configuration, as features of a strong HRM system have been described as ‘the 
building blocks for linking the HRM activities together in a particular architecture’ (Ostroff 
and Bowen, 2016, pp. 15). As discussed by the original contributors to the HRM process 
approach, ‘the components of each HRM system that make up its architecture include 
philosophy (guiding principles and values about human resources), policies (guidelines 
about what is to be achieved with practices, e.g. skill development), practices (the practices 
needed to achieve the policy) and processes (how practices are implemented)’ (Ostroff and 
Bowen, 2016, pp. 15). The scholars maintain that processes, as in features of a strong HRM 
system, stand at the basis of the HR architecture in ensuring HR practices are appropriately
<<<PAGE=99>>>
83 
 
designed and implemented, resulting in shared consensus among employees on expected 
attitudes and behaviours. 
However, departing from the original conceptualisation of the process approach, this 
research maintains an individual level of analysis. Whilst Bowen and Ostroff (2004) present 
the construct of HRM strength as higher-level contextual variable, subsequent work has 
adopted an individual level of analysis treating the HRM system strength as individual 
difference variable, directing attention to individual perceptions of the HR system features 
(i.e. Delmotte, De Winne and Sels, 2012). Such approach stems from the consideration that 
although the collective-level influence of the HRM process plays a crucial role in securing 
organisational performance, research ought to further investigate the individual-level 
influence effects standing at the basis of higher-level influence (i.e. Ehrnrooth and 
Bjorkman, 2012; Nishii et al., 2008). Additionally, the individual has been identified as the 
most appropriate level of analysis and unit of measurement of employees’ perceptions and 
attributions (i.e. Bowen and Ostroff, 2004; Nishii et al., 2008). As discussed by Ostroff and 
Bowen (2016), the individual level of analysis follows the principles of social exchange 
theory (Blau, 1964) and presents the idiosyncratic processing of the social context at the 
basis of particular individual responses. Thus, adopting an individual level of analysis the 
next session discusses how the HRM system strength shapes employees understanding of 
the work situation with implications for competence development.  
3.4.2 HRM system strength  
In line with Bowen and Ostroff (2004), the HRM process has been presented as defining 
metafeatures of an HRM system that enable employees to appropriately interpret and 
respond to the messages conveyed by HR practices with desired attitudes and behaviours. 
HRM systems characterised by high levels of distinctiveness, consistency and consensus 
lead to strong situations, where messages are communicated unambiguously, allowing 
individuals to make confident attributions (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004). Ostroff and Bowen 
(2000, pp. 236) define situational strength  as ‘the degree of ambiguity presented in the 
context’, associating the strength of the HRM system with how effectively HR practices 
convey the strategic focus of the organisation and communicate the behaviours that are 
valued.  
Following Bowen and Ostroff (2000; 2004) this research conceptualises the HRM system 
strength as the effectiveness of the HRM system, when such system is characterised by high 
levels of distinctiveness, consistency and consensus, in communicating unambiguous
<<<PAGE=100>>>
84 
 
messages and in enabling the clear interpretation of such messages, as intended by the 
organisation. The effectiveness of the HRM system has however been presented as a 
function of the HR content and the HR process, with Bowen and Ostroff (2004, pp. 206) 
postulating that content and process are two interrelated features of an HRM system which 
‘must be integrated effectively in order for prescriptive models of strategic HRM actually to 
link to firm performance’. Accordingly, Ehrnrooth and Bjorkman (2012) advance an 
integrative HRM process theorisation presenting the HRM process as having both signalling 
effects on employees’ understanding and functional qualities of the HR content. In testing 
the model empirically on a sample of IT and management consultants the scholars found the 
HRM strength construct in positive relation with employees’ creativity, job performance and 
the level of workload.  
Similarly, Katou and her colleagues (2014) examined the effects of the HRM system, 
integrating content and process, on organisational performance. The study on 1250 
employees operating in 133 organisations in the private and public sector in Greece is 
innovative in demonstrating that both the content and process of HR practices impact on 
organisational performance through the mediating e ffects on employees’ reactions. An 
important contribution of the study is evidence of the moderating role of features of the HRM 
system (distinctiveness, consistency, consensus) on the relationship between rated HR 
practices (i.e. resources, training, rewards, relations) and employee outcomes (i.e. 
motivation, commitment, engagement, OCB). The results are aligned with previous studies 
which found climate strength, as in shared perceptions of HRM, to moderate the relationship 
between perceptions of consistency in HRM and affective commitment (Sanders, 
Dorenbosch and de Reuver, 2008), and the association between perceptions of HRM system 
features and employee attitudes as work satisfaction, vigour and intention to quit (Li, Frenkel 
and Sanders, 2011).  
More recently, Bednall and colleagues investigated the role of the HRM system strength in 
relation to employees’ participation in informal learning. In two studies the scholars present 
evidence that a strong HRM system strengthens the effects of performance appraisal 
(Bednall et al., 2014) and formal training (Bednall and Sanders, 2016) on participation in 
individual and collaborative informal learning activities over time. Overall, the literature 
presents compelling evidence of the role of the HRM system strength in moderating the 
relationship between HRM and employees’ reactions, indicating that strong situations 
characterised by little ambiguity strengthen the relationship between perceived HR practices
<<<PAGE=101>>>
85 
 
and employees’ outcomes. In keeping with this line of resea rch, following the covariation 
model of attribution (Kelley, 1967) a strong HRM system is defined by features of 
distinctiveness, consistency and consensus. As discussed by Sanders and Yang (2016) when 
applying the covariation principle to HRM, it is expected that in situations characterised by 
high levels of distinctiveness (HR practices are standing out), consistency (internal 
alignment of HR practices), and consensus (colleagues understand HR practices in the same 
way), employees are likely to attribute HRM to the management of the organisation, and so 
understand the organisation’s values, expectations and desired behaviours (Bowen and 
Ostroff, 2004).  
Having positioned the apprenticeship as internal development employment mode in a high-
commitment HR system, it is expected that a strong system would send clear and 
unambiguous messages and enable apprentices to make accurate attributions. More 
specifically, given that the high-commitment HR system is the strategy implemented by the 
organisation to sustain a long-term, high-quality exchange relationship with the apprentice 
(Tsui et al., 1997), a strong HRM system is expected to facilitate the interpretation of the 
HR content as intended by the organisation and support a relational employment 
relationship. There are several ways in which the HRM system strength can reinforce a 
positive long-term relationship between the apprentice and the organisation. First, high 
levels of distinctiveness would allow apprentices to become aware of developmental 
opportunities (Bednall et al., 2014); as career development is a crucial practice for sustaining 
a high-quality exchange relationship with the organisation (Meyer and Smith, 2000), making 
apprentices aware of career opportunities and internal labour markets within the firm through 
the distinctive implementation of career development practices, positively supports the 
employee-organisational relationship. 
Secondly, given that internal consistency affects the strength of the HRM system (Ostroff 
and Bowen, 2000), apprentices experiencing high levels of integration among HR practices 
and so receiving consistent messages and drawing consistent inferences, are expected to be 
more confident in their attributions. Internal consistency is advocated in the configurational 
approach to HRM (Delery and Doty, 1996) and has been found to be the principal feature of 
a strong HRM system in the study conducted by Katou and colleagues (2014), supporting 
the view that without consistent messages, the effects of distinctiveness and consensus may 
be less influential (Bowen and Ostoff, 2004). It is therefore expected that the more 
apprentices are exposed to HR practices signalling concern for their development and well-
<<<PAGE=102>>>
86 
 
being, the more they would construct positive attributions about the organisation (Nishii et 
al., 2008), sustaining a positive employment relationship. Thirdly, consensus among policy 
makers and line managers that continuous improvement is valued by the organisation has 
been positively related to engagement in informal learning (Bednall et al., 2014). In line with 
theories of POS (Eisenberger et al., 1990), consensus among key organisational figures about 
the value of apprentices and the importance of the apprentices’ development with the firm is 
expected to result in high levels of POS, sustaining a positive employment relationship. 
Overall, it is reasonable to expect that the strength of the HRM system enables apprentices 
to interpret the HR practices as motivated by a commitment focus, sustaining a positive 
employment relationship.  
Given that the employee-organisational relationship influences how employees respond to 
developmental opportunities such as training (Kuvaas, 2008), the HRM system strength 
plays a crucial role in ensuring that apprentices feel valued, supported and part of a mutual 
relationship (Tsui et al., 1997). It follows that when experiencing a positive employment 
relationship, apprentices are more likely to make effective use of the apprenticeship training, 
extensively engaging in formal and informal learning for the development of their 
competencies. On the basis of this evidence, it is expected that the apprenticeship will have 
the greatest impact on apprentices’ end-state competencies when embedded in a strong HRM 
system. 
Based on the proposition that apprentice s’ interpretation of the work situation through 
features of the HRM system will influence their engagement with formal and informal 
learning, this research hypothesises an interaction between HRM system strength and the 
apprenticeship training: 
 
Hypothesis 3:  HRM system strength positively moderates the relationship between the 
apprenticeship training, encompassing formal and informal learning, and 
apprentices’ end-state competencies. 
 
3.5 Performance appraisal 
Having considered the influence of the high-commitment HR system by means of the HRM 
system strength on the effectiveness of apprenticeships, attention is here directed at PA. The 
HR practice of PA is central to the high-commitment HR configuration (Lepak and Snell,
<<<PAGE=103>>>
87 
 
1999; Lepak et al., 2006) and is a particularly valuable practice for professional employees. 
In aligning individual and organisational interests, PA fosters professionals’ commitment to 
the organisation (Kinnie et al., 2005), emerging as critical HR practice for high value 
employees as apprentices. Additionally, quality PA has been found to promote participation 
in informal learning activities such as reflection, knowledge sharing and innovative 
behaviour over time (Bednall, Sanders & Runhaar, 2014), emerging as facilitator of informal 
learning. Accordingly, PA is deemed particularly important for apprentices as core 
employees who are developing professionally in the workplace.  
While in testing the role of the HRM system this study assumes a broad perspective 
exploring how apprentices’ per ceptions of the HRM system strength influence the formal 
and informal learning processes inherent to apprenticeships, PA is investigated as  facilitator 
of informal learning. In so doing, PA is presented as mechanism for developing and 
motivating employees that fosters apprentices’ engagement with the informal learning 
factors of the work environment.   
PA is here considered as formal event entailing the evaluation and communication of 
individual performance feedback in face- to-face meetings between the employee and the 
supervisor (Elicker, Levy & Hall 2006). As discussed by Bednall and colleagues (2014), PA 
allows supervisors to provide employees with valuable feedback, to support them in 
approaching mistakes as learning opportunities and more generally encouraging knowledge-
sharing among team members. Whilst employees are expected to receive regular informal 
daily feedback on-the-job, PA is more formal in nature. Specifically, PA is more broadly 
focused on delivering normative feedback on performance and assessing whether 
organisational expectations have been met (DeNisi and Sonesh, 2010). Notably, both regular 
daily feedback and formal PA feedback have been found to benefit employees, with Kuvaas 
(2011) demonstrating that the effects of PA feedback on emplo yees’ performance are 
contingent on high levels of daily informal feedback.  
Additionally, research demonstrates that reactions to PA influence employees’ attitudes and 
behaviours with implications for resultant performance. A study investigating how 
perceptions of PA use relate to employee satisfaction with the appraisal and the appraiser, 
demonstrates that perceived developmental appraisals result in positive attitudes toward the 
appraisal and the appraiser (Boswell and Boudreau, 2000). The results reveal that when PA 
is focused on identifying individual training needs, strength and weaknesses, along with
<<<PAGE=104>>>

providing performance feedback, its use is consistent with communicating to employees 
their value and future in the organisation (Boswell and Boudreau, 2000). Similarly, a study 
conducted on 593 employees from 64 organisations found PA satisfaction in direct 
association with affective commitment and turnover intentions (Kuvaas, 2006). Perceived 
helpfulness of PA was associated with affective commitment in a subsequent study on a 
sample of 803 employees in Norway (Kuvaas, 2011). Overall research indicates that PA 
focused on continuous development and performance improvements contributes to 
employees’ perceptions of the organisation’s investments in their development and enhances 
participation in informal learning. 
Given th at employees’ perceptions of PA  are indicative of their relationship with the 
organisation (Lepak and Snell, 1999), satisfaction with PA is expected to sustain a positive 
employment relationship in apprenticeship. In line with the principles of social exchange 
theory (Blau, 1964), perceptions that the organisation is ‘taking care’ of employees result in 
engendered beneficial consequences (Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005), hence apprentices’ 
satisfaction with PA reflecting a quality employment relationship, is set to positively impact 
on their learning behaviour. This can be explained given that apprentices’ perceptions of 
developmental PA are likely to communicate the organisation’s willingness to invest in their 
development and provide them with the knowledge and skills required for career progression 
(i.e. Kuvaas, 2006).  
In investigating PA as facilitator of informal learning, this study draws on the Job Demand-
Control-Support model (Karasek and Theorell, 1990; Messman and Mulder, 2015) and 
examines how PA influences apprentices’ engagement with the informal learning factors of 
problem solving, task autonomy and feedback. The relevance of these factors in sustaining 
apprentices’ competence deve lopment has been discussed in Chapter 2. Here, in line with 
the principles of social exchange (Blau, 1964), apprentices experiencing PA satisfaction are 
expected to engage in problem solving as a mean to develop professionally. Similarly, PA 
satisfaction is expected to strengthen the effects of task autonomy and informal daily 
feedback from colleagues and supervisors on apprentices’ competencies, as these are viewed 
as learning opportunities. 
Based on the proposition that apprentices’ satisfaction with PA will positively influence their 
engagement with the informal learning factors of the work environment, this research 
hypothesises an interaction between PA and problem solving, task autonomy and feedback:

Hypothesis 4:  PA satisfaction positively moderates the relationship between a) problem 
solving, b) task autonomy, c) feedback and apprentices’ end -state 
competencies 
 
3.6 Learning goal orientation  
Having discussed the significance of the HRM system in apprenticeship, the chapter turns 
to the individual l evel construct of learning goal orientation as determinant of apprentices’ 
competence development. According to the argument presented here, the individual 
difference of learning goal orientation is proposed to influence apprentices’ responses to 
formal and informal learning activities with implications for their competence development.  
Goal orientation, defined as the goals pursued by individuals in achievement situations, 
forms the basis for deeper motivational processes which determine how the individua l 
approaches the learning event, influencing affective, behavioural and cognitive reactions 
(i.e. Kozlowski et al., 2001; Porath and Bateman, 2006). The construct has proven insightful 
in explaining individual differences in response to challenging and demanding tasks 
(VandeWalle, 1997) and presents potential to explain variation in learning behaviours and 
competence development in apprenticeship.  
As argued by Gong and Fan (2006), goal orientation theory (Dweck, 1986; Dweck and 
Leggett, 1988), presents implications for the motivation underlying individual behaviours in 
achievement situations. Next, a review of goal orientation theory addresses how different 
goal orientations are associated with particular patterns of behaviours in achievement 
situations. Attention is directed at four aspects of these patterns as particularly relevant for 
discussing the role of goal orientation in developmental programmes as apprenticeships.  
3.6.1 Goal orientation theory 
Adaptive and Maladaptive motivational patterns   
According to goal orientation theory, the goals pursued by individuals create a framework 
within which they interpret and react to events, determining different patterns of behaviours 
(Dweck and Leggett, 1988). Dweck (1986) presents goal orientation as an individual 
disposition towards developing or demonstrating ones abilities, identifying two major 
classes of goals: performance goals in which individuals strive to gain favourable judgement 
or to avoid negative judgement of their competence; and learning goals in which individuals
<<<PAGE=106>>>
90 
 
endeavour to increase their competence and master new knowledge and skills. Such 
dispositions result in maladaptive and adaptive patterns of behaviours in achievement 
situations, with performance oriented individuals assuming maladaptive responses with the 
tendency to adopt defensive strategies, avoiding challenges and withdrawing in face of 
difficulties; and learning oriented individuals assuming adaptive responses, purposely 
seeking challenges and persisting when encountering difficulties. 
Implicit theories of ability  
Individuals’ predispositions toward learning or performance goals has been associated with 
individuals’ self-conception of their intellectual abilities. Dweck and Leggett (1988) propose 
than individuals hold implicit theories about their ability, regarding their intelligence either 
as a fixed entity, or as a malleable attribute. Those regarding their intellectual ability as fixed, 
believe that such ability is difficult to develop and perceive performance as dependent on 
their innate ability; conversely, those regarding their ability as incremental, believe that such 
ability can be further developed through effort and experience (Dweck and Leggett, 1988). 
Accordingly, individual beliefs about ability are associated with either learning or 
performance orientation, influencing behavioural responses as performance oriented 
individuals seek to demonstrate their ability, and learning oriented individuals strive to 
develop their ability. 
Views of effort expenditures  
Accordingly, assumptions about one’s ability and the related goal orientation present 
implications for how individuals interpret effort in achievement situations. As reported by 
Vandewalle (1997, 2003), learning oriented individuals view effort as an instrumental 
strategy for developing their abilities, while performance oriented individuals view effort as 
signalling the inadequacy of their ability, resulting in maladaptive responses to challenges 
and obstacles. Consequently, individuals’ self -conceptions affect behavioural responses in 
face of challenging tasks or task failure, with learning oriented individuals being energised 
by challenges and exerting efforts to progress, and performance oriented individuals 
avoiding and withdrawing from challenges in order to avoid display of low ability (Dweck 
and Leggett, 1988; Vandewalle, 1997).  
Dispositional, situational and dimensional traits  
Research has debated the dimensionality of goal orientation, with scholars conceptualising 
it as a single bipolar trait with the two orientations (learning and performance) as ends of a
<<<PAGE=107>>>
91 
 
continuum (i.e. Dweck, 1986), and others presenting learning and performance orientation 
as two separate and uncorrelated dimensions (i.e. Button et al., 1996).  
The construction of goal orientation as a single continuum (Dweck, 1986) implies that 
individuals display either a learning or a performance orientation, and precludes the 
possibility to hold neither or both dispositions simultaneously. However, studies conducted 
by Button and his colleagues (1996) present strong evidence of learning and performance 
orientation as two separate and uncorrelated constructs, validating the possibility that 
individuals hold high or low levels of learning and performance orientation at the same time. 
This line of research has subsequently been adopted in other studies (i.e. Ford et al., 1998, 
Kozwloeski et al., 2001; Pintrich, 2000; VandeWalle and Cummings, 1997), upholding the 
conceptualisation of learning and performance goal orientation as two separate constructs.  
Additionally, while research has focused on goal orientation as dispositional trait, it has been 
established that situational factors can activate particular learning or performance responses. 
The study conducted by Button and colleagues (1996) found dispositional and situational 
goal orientation to be distinct, maintaining that while individuals are predisposed to a certain 
goal orientation from their general disposition (i.e. Dweck, 1986), situational cues may lead 
them to a different or less intense orientation response. Accordingly, when the situation does 
not provide cues about the preferred goals, the dispositional orientation will prevail; 
however, strong situational cues may offset dispositional orientations (VandeWalle, 2003).  
The conceptualisation of goal orientation as dispositional and situational presents important 
implications for organisations investing in human capital development for several reasons. 
As discussed by VandeWalle (2003), a learning orientation may be a valid selection criterion 
for jobs that are complex, dynamic, learning-focused, requiring individuals to self-regulate 
to secure performance. Secondly, while individuals are expected to join any training 
programme with a learning orientation, perceived situational cues may affect their responses 
inducing a performance orientation (Button et al., 1996) and negatively affecting learning 
outcomes. Additionally, given the value of on-going learning for both individual and 
organisational performance (Bednall et al., 2014), organisations would benefit from 
encouraging employees to hold an incremental view of their ability supporting an orientation 
towards developing competence (Brett and VandeWalle, 1999; Vandewalle and Cummings, 
1997; Vandewalle et al., 2001). More specifically, the promotion of a learning environment 
conducive to competence development may be sustained by practices as developmental
<<<PAGE=108>>>
92 
 
performance appraisals that foster learning rather than comparison with others (Vandewalle, 
2003). In light of these considerations, a discussion on the influence of goal orientation on 
learning and development activities follows.  
3.6.2 The influence of goal orientation on skill acquisition  
Goal orientation is an important individual difference in training situations, with 
implications for the design of training interventions intended to develop complex knowledge 
structures. This is the case since goal orientation has an influence on individuals’ motivation 
to learn, on the learning strategies adopted, as well as on training self-efficacy (i.e. Chiaburu 
and Marinova, 2005; Ford et al., 1998; Vandewalle et al., 2001).  
Research presents compelling evidence of the influence of particular orientations on training 
outcomes. Kozlowski and colleagues (2001) predicted performance goal orientation to 
hinder the learning of complex skills, given that trainees striving to demonstrate their 
abilities and avoid negative judgement would tend to limit themselves to the basic and 
superficial aspects of the task, failing to address a deeper understanding of the concepts and 
underlying principles. Conversely, trainees holding a learning orientation would be more 
effective in learning complex skills, striving to investigate and understand the complexities 
of the task, approaching errors as opportunities to learn, and developing a broad 
understanding required for task proficiency. In testing the propositions empirically, 
Kozlowski and colleagues (2001) found dispositional learning goal orientation in 
combination with situational mastery training goals to support the development of complex 
knowledge structures, validating their model.  
Additionally, a study conducted by Ford and colleagues (1998) found positive associations 
between learning goal orientation and metacognitive activities as in strategies requiring 
considerable cognitive effort, leading to deep understanding of the task. The results are 
insightful in presenting learning goal orientation as crucial in training interventions where 
individuals are allowed a certain degree of control over learning of complex tasks. Generally, 
both studies indicate that goal orientation is significant for the mastery of complex and 
substantial knowledge in encouraging individuals to approach the learning process with high 
motivation levels, in fostering curiosity and a tendency to explore the task and subject under 
investigation, and securing high levels of understanding. Given that mastery of complex 
knowledge structures requires high levels of motivation and resilience in face of difficulties 
encountered during the learning process, learning goal orientation is related to self-efficacy,
<<<PAGE=109>>>
93 
 
a critical factor in situations where the knowledge and skills acquired need to be transferred 
and adapted to different situational demands (Kozlowski et al., 2001).  
Goal orientation and self-efficacy  
Research has investigated the relationship between goal orientation and self-efficacy (i.e. 
Ford et al., 1998; Kozlowski et al., 2001; Runhaar et al., 2010; VandeWalle, Cron and 
Slocum, 2001) however with little consensus on the causal direction between the two 
constructs (Gong and Fan, 2006).  
Self-efficacy is conceived as judgements and assumptions individuals hold about their ability 
to perform a given task, affecting individual reactions in face of challenges (Bandura, 1982). 
As argued by Bandura (1982), individuals with low levels of self-efficacy react negatively 
to challenges and obstacles, diverting their attention towards concerns about failure, rather 
than focusing on how to best tackle the task. Conversely, individuals with high levels of self-
efficacy direct their energy and attention on the challenging event exerting efforts to meet 
the task requirements. 
Studies conducted by Kozwloski and colleagues (2001) and Vandewalle and colleagues 
(2001) demonstrate that learning orientation leads to task performance as the adaptive 
patterns of behaviour contribute to developing and sustaining high levels of self-efficacy in 
the training situation. The assumption is that learning goal orientation is related to 
maintenance of self-efficacy during the learning process, as adaptive individuals approach 
setbacks and negative feedback as opportunities for improvement (Gong and Fang, 2006).  
Other studies (i.e. Runhaar et al., 2010) assume a broad concept of self-efficacy as related to 
an individual conception of ability (i.e. Dweck and Leggett, 1988). The assumption is that 
individuals holding an incremental view of their abilities possess high levels of occupational 
self-efficacy, corresponding to the belief that with effort and application one can successfully 
approach situational demands. Accordingly, self-efficacy is viewed as antecedent to learning 
goal orientation, intended as the motivation to improve oneself (Runhaar et al., 2010).  
As argued by Gong and Fan (2006), the causal link between learning goal orientation and 
self-efficacy is particularly evident when goal orientation is presented as trait-like variable 
and self-efficacy is intended as domain-specific variable. Following the industrial 
organisational psychology scholars (i.e. Kozlowski et al., 2001; VandeWalle et al., 2001), 
Gong and Fan (2006) find corroborating evidence of dispositional learning orientation as an 
exogenous variable influencing self-efficacy in the competence acquisition process.
<<<PAGE=110>>>
94 
 
Keeping with this line of research, as the apprenticeship is a developmental programme 
encompassing novel and challenging tasks, learning goal orientation presents the mental 
framing for sustaining individuals’ beliefs in their abilities to develop their competencies 
(VandeWalle et al., 2001), in turn sustaining apprentices’ self-efficacy during the learning 
process. Having established the assumed linkage between goal orientation and self-efficacy 
in this research, the focus turns to the impact of learning goal orientation in apprenticeship.  
3.6.3 Learning goal orientation in apprenticeship  
The literature indicates that learning goal orientation is an exceptional predictor of individual 
level outcomes. This is particularly so in situations where the training requires the mastery 
of substantial knowledge (i.e. Kozwloski et al., 2001), where the individual is granted control 
over the learning process (i.e. Ford et al., 1998), where development is strongly dependent 
on feedback-seeking behaviours (i.e. Vadewalle and Commings, 1997) and where 
knowledge and skills need to be transferred back to the workplace (Chiaburu and Marinova, 
2005). 
With the apprenticeship encompassing formal training activities to develop substantial 
knowledge, along with informal learning activities as engagement in challenging tasks and 
interactions with others, it is important to examine how apprentices’ learning orientation 
impacts on competence development. As discussed in the introductory chapter (Chapter 1), 
failing to address such an important individual construct may lead to the assumption that 
developmental assignments promote the development of competent professionals under all 
individual conditions (Dragoni et al., 2009).  
Apprentices’ learning goal orientation 
According to goal orientation theory (Dweck, 1986), learning oriented individuals strive 
towards continuous improvement and highly value experiences presenting opportunities for 
growth and development. As demonstrated by Lisa Dragoni and her colleagues (2009), 
managers with high levels of learning orientation tend to pursue highly developmental 
assignments validating this adaptive pattern of behaviour. Correspondingly, as apprentices 
have made an active choice to pursue qualifications and develop professionally with an 
apprenticeship, it is reasonable to expect that they would hold an incremental view of their 
ability, associated with a dispositional orientation towards learning (Dweck and Leggett, 
1988). Additionally, as learning oriented individuals perceive success as dependent on 
interest and effort (Duda and Nicholls, 1992), it is sensible to predict that apprentices, who
<<<PAGE=111>>>
95 
 
have committed themselves to develop professionally by means of formal training and work 
experience, would hold a disposition towards learning. 
Accordingly, the belief that competence can be developed by means of learning, application 
and effort provides the foundation for a dispositional orientation towards learning, 
supporting the prediction that apprentices hold high levels of learning orientation. Moreover, 
the high-commitment HR system embedding the apprenticeship is likely to convey the 
organisation’s focus on growing talented individuals, hence signalling that learning is 
valued. In line with the argument advanced by Dragoni (2005), whereby situational cues 
signal the preferred achievement orientation and compel individuals to adopt an appropriate 
state goal orientation, the high- commitment HR system is expected to sustain apprentices’ 
disposition towards learning. 
Given that individuals can hold different orientations simultaneously (Button et al., 1996), 
as apprentices are expected to join the programme with a dispositional learning orientation, 
the high-commitment HR system is envisaged to sustain such disposition, preventing any 
individual motivation to demonstrate competence in highly competitive environments to 
divert attention from the learning process. This research therefore predicts apprentices to 
hold high levels of learning orientation, as an individual disposition sustained by situational 
cues, and in light of the focus on human capital development makes no prediction with 
regards to performance orientation. 
As apprentices develop multidimensional competencies via means of formal and informal 
learning, a consideration of the influence of learning orientation on both processes is 
warranted.  
Formal learning  
The apprenticeship development model advanced in this research illustrates formal learning 
as contributing to apprentices’ technical knowle dge. Central to the model is the transfer of 
learning from instructional to work settings in order to secure performance through the 
application and maintenance of a newly acquired knowledge-base (Grossman and Salas, 
2011). 
Research presents evidence of a positive association between learning goal orientation and 
pre-training motivation, with implications for training transfer. A study conducted by 
Chiaburu and Marinova (2005) found mastery approach oriented individuals to display high 
levels of pre-training motivation and consequent training transfer, indicating that learning
<<<PAGE=112>>>
96 
 
oriented individuals approach the training event positively and transfer the acquired 
knowledge and skills to the workplace. Additionally, research has demonstrated that learning 
goal orientation contributes to the development and maintenance of self-efficacy in the 
competence acquisition process (i.e. Gong and Fang, 2006; Ford et al., 1998), in turn 
predicting transfer of learning (i.e. Ford et al., 1998; Velada et al., 2007). Adopting Holton 
and colleagues (2000) conceptualisation of performance self-efficacy as in the individual 
belief that one is able to change his or her own performance when desired, Velada, Caetano, 
Michel and others (2007) found performance self-efficacy to strongly predict transfer of 
learning to the work context. Accordingly, given the high levels of pre-training motivation 
and self-efficacy displayed by learning oriented individuals, it is expected that apprentices’ 
learning goal orientation would support the transfer of knowledge and skills acquired at 
college or University to the workplace.  
Additionally, as formal training encompasses also self-directed study, as apprentices engage 
in activities such as working on case studies, reading additional material and writing reports, 
learning goal orientation is set to play an important role in self-regulatory behaviours. 
Research in academic settings presents evidence of the relation between goal orientation and 
students’ motivational beliefs and self-regulated learning, finding learning oriented students 
to focus on mastering the study material and to display adaptive motivational beliefs such as 
self-efficacy and extensive cognitive engagement (Wolters, Yu and Pintrich, 1996). 
Similarly, learning goal orientation has been presented as yielding beneficial results when 
trainees approach the learning of complex tasks (Kozlowski et al., 2001), and when engaged 
in self-directed activities aimed at developing skills and mastering the discipline (Ford et al., 
1998). It is therefore reasonable to predict that learning oriented apprentices would actively 
engage in self-directed study, exerting discipline and self-direction for mastering an 
extensive knowledge base.  
Informal learning  
The apprenticeship development model portrays informal learning as contributing to 
apprentices’ job competence and work and business skills. Apprentices develop these critical 
competencies on-the-job through processes of social interaction, such as team working and 
shadowing, and when undertaking novel and challenging tasks (Eraut, 2007). As learning 
orientation is an important factor in situations where the individual is in control of the 
learning activity (Ford et al., 1998), it is deemed critical for informal learning in the 
workplace. This is so given the unstructured nature of informal learning and the discretionary
<<<PAGE=113>>>
97 
 
position of the individual who can decide either to actively engage or not to engage in 
activities such as reflection, knowledge sharing and innovative behaviours (Bednall et al., 
2014). 
As learning oriented individuals value competence development and are oriented towards 
self-improvement (Kozlowski et al., 2001), they are expected to actively pursue informal 
learning activities as in strategies for expanding their knowledge and skills. An incremental 
assumption of ones’ intelligence and ability, associated with the belief tha t effort and 
application lead to competence development, has indeed been positively associated with 
selection and engagement in challenging tasks (Dweck and Leggett, 1998; Dragoni et al., 
2009) and with developmental experiences as performance feedback (VadeWalle and 
Cummings, 1997). 
With apprentices developing critical competencies on-the-job when trying things out, 
engaging in problem solving and undertaking novel tasks, an adaptive response to 
achievement situations where mistakes and setbacks are viewed as learning opportunities 
and where effort it conceived as strategy to grow and develop (Dweck, 1986), is expected to 
positively sustain apprentices’ development. Additionally, given that engagement in 
activities involving decision-making, problem solving, team-working and communication 
has been associated with the development of higher levels of skills (Brown, 2009), a focus 
on mastering challenging situations and persevering in face of obstacles (Dweck and 
Leggett, 1988) is predicted to enhance the skills acquired as a result of participation in 
practice. 
Additionally, as apprentices learn by engaging in practice, feedback from the outcomes and 
feedback from colleagues and superiors on their level of performance is a valuable resource 
for improving on errors and weaknesses (VandeWalle et al., 2001). Research indicates that 
learning orientation is an important construct for explaining individuals’ decisions to seek 
feedback based on perceived costs and value of feedback seeking. Specifically, Vandewalle 
and Cummings (1997) present compelling evidence that learning oriented individuals, 
perceiving feedback as valuable diagnostic information, engage in feedback seeking 
behaviours as in strategic efforts towards task mastery.  
Given the situated nature of the apprenticeship where individuals learn by participating in 
practice and interacting with knowledgeable practitioners (Lave and Wenger, 1991), high 
levels of learning goal orientation are expected to foster apprentices’ participation in social
<<<PAGE=114>>>
98 
 
exchanges as in activities of feedback seeking (i.e. VandeWalle and Cummings, 1997), 
enabling apprentices to extract valuable lessons from such engagements. Additionally, as 
learning goal orientation promotes resilience in face of negative feedback, apprentices are 
envisaged to respond to difficulties and challenges positively, exerting further effort to 
improve their abilities and develop the competencies required to perform effectively in their 
role. 
Overall, learning oriented apprentices are expected to make an effective use of formal and 
informal learning activities with a positive impact on their end-state competencies. The 
adaptive patterns of behaviours associated with learning goal orientation, entailing effort and 
application as instrumental strategies for personal development and valuing feedback as 
diagnostic information to improve performance (VadeWalle and Cummings, 1997; 
Vandewalle et al., 2001), foster apprentices’ engagement in learning and sustain the 
development of resultant competencies. 
Based on the proposition that learning oriented apprentices display adaptive patterns of 
behaviours influencing their engagement in formal and informal learning activities, this 
research hypothesises an interaction between learning goal orientation and the 
apprenticeship training:  
 
Hypothesis 5:  The positive relationship between the apprenticeship and resultant        
competencies is stronger when apprentices have high levels of learning goal 
orientation.  
 
3.7 Chapter summary and conclusions 
 
This chapter has introduced important boundary conditions in the apprenticeship 
development model accounting for the influence of contextual and individual factors on 
apprentices’ competence development. 
At contextual level, the influence of the HRM system embedding the apprenticeship has 
been identified as pivotal for developing and maintaining a quality employment relationship. 
As indicated in the literature (i.e. Kuvaas, 2008), the latter is critical is ensuring that 
apprentices positively respond to development opportunities and reciprocate the 
organisation with effective performance behaviours.
<<<PAGE=115>>>
99 
 
Similarly, the individual construct of goal orientation plays an important role in influencing 
apprentices’ dispositions towards formal and informal learning activities. As learning 
oriented individuals are adept at self-improvement and self-regulation, apprentices 
displaying high levels of learning orientation are expected to effectively engage in formal 
and informal learning, considerably improving their end-state competencies. 
The contributions of the chapter are threefold; linking the HRM system and PA as distinctive 
HR practice with formal and informal learning, the study introduces a macro-level approach 
to learning and development research. In doing so, the study addresses extant research 
limitations whose underlying epistemological assumption treats learning as non-systemic 
phenomenon (Kontoghiorghes, 2004) and introduces employees’ perceptions of HRM as 
key environmental consideration with implications for the effectiveness of formal and 
informal learning. 
Secondly, whereas research has demonstrated the impact of employees’ perceptions of HR 
practices on their attitudes and behaviours (Katou et al., 2014; Sanders et al., 2008; Sun, 
Aryee and Law, 2007), limited studies have addressed the influence of HRM on individual 
learning. Building on the work of Bednall and colleagues (2014; 2016), the first to examine 
the effect of HRM perceptions on participation in informal learning, this study adds 
knowledge on the influence of HR perception s on employees’ competence development. 
Addressing this issue, the study contributes to the HRM-performance link debate (Guest, 
2011), shedding light on how participation in formal and informal learning enhances 
performance. 
Thirdly, this study adds knowledge on the influence of learning goal orientation on 
performance in workplace settings. It does so extending the understanding on the interplay 
of learning goal orientation and formal and informal learning, providing further evidence of 
the value of the goal orientation construct in organisational research. Introducing the 
individual difference of learning goal orientation in the apprenticeship development model, 
the study presents a nuanced understanding of the types of apprentices who learn the most 
from formal and informal learning.  
Finally, in testing the model in the field the research provides empirical evidence that 
apprentices’ ability to learn and develop varies depending on thei r understanding of HR 
practices and on their individual characteristics.

Chapter 4: Research design and method 
 
 
4.1 Introduction 
To test the hypotheses proposed in Chapters 2 and 3, an empirical study was conducted with 
a sample of 233 apprentices employed in two organisations in England. Before reporting the 
results, this chapter presents how the study was designed and conducted.  
The chapter is structured into two sections. The first section discusses the research paradigm 
positioning the study within the apprenticeship research context, whilst the second section 
provides a detailed account of the design of the field study, the procedure for data collection, 
the characteristics of the sample, the ethical considerations and the measures adopted in the 
study. Additionally, the chapter discusses the procedures adopted for the quantitative and 
qualitative data analysis and presents an overview of the emergent themes.  
 
4.2 Research methodology 
The purpose of this study is to understand how apprentices’ competence development can 
be supported turning the focus to the work environment. To this end, given that the choice 
of research design and method is determined by the research question investigated (Bryman 
and Bell, 2011), this study adopts a positivist paradigm and advances and empirically tests 
a theoretically derived apprenticeship development model.  
In so doing, following the work of Felstead and colleagues (2004) on workplace learning, 
this study aims to develop a survey that captures the sources of learning associated with 
apprenticeship, so identifying the conditions conducive to apprentices’ development. It does 
so building on previous case studies on apprenticeship and informal learning (i.e. Eraut, 
2007; Fuller and Unwin, 2003b; Gijbels et al., 2010) in operationalising and testing the 
factors contributing to learning in the workplace. Given that distinctive epistemological and 
ontological positions typify the methodological approach adopted in survey and case study 
research, a deliberation of the positivist and interpretivist paradigms is here called for.  
Research meth odology refers to ‘the procedural framework within which the research is 
conducted’ (Remenyi, Williams, Money and Swarts, 1998, pp. 28), underpinned by 
theoretical and philosophical assumptions informing the research design. Distinctive 
epistemological and ontological positions stand at the basis of particular research paradigms
<<<PAGE=117>>>
101 
 
as positivism and interpretivism. With epistemology relating to what should be considered 
acceptable knowledge in a particular discipline, the positivist paradigm posits that only 
observable phenomena constitute credible data. This view is linked with objectivism as an 
ontological position viewing reality as external and independent of social actors (Saunders, 
Lewis and Thornhill, 2009). Accordingly, positivist researchers observe social phenomena 
that are independent of those who observe, and posit that methods of the natural sciences are 
applicable to the study of the social sciences. Therefore, organisations are viewed as concrete 
entities beyond the researcher’s influence and about which data can be collected on the basis 
of observations (Bryman and Bell, 2011). Within an objectivist conception, social reality is 
measured quantitatively through the operationalisation of concepts employed in hypotheses 
testing. In following the principle of deductivism, positivists develop and empirically test 
hypotheses on the basis of a particular domain of knowledge related to the research question 
under investigation. Accordingly, experimental and survey research strategies are employed 
to test theory and confirm or refute hypotheses (Bryman and Bell, 2011). 
Conversely, the interpretivist paradigm rests on the assumption that there is no objective 
social reality but reality is socially constructed. A subjectivist view of the nature of reality 
considers social phenomena as resulting from perceptions of social actors and being in a 
continuous state of revision (Brymann and Bell, 2011). Recognising reality as subjective, 
the interpretivist paradigm does not seek to explain reality but to rather understand it 
considering humans as social actors embedded in specific and unique situational contexts. It 
follows that research adopts an empathetic approach in exploring subjective meanings 
therefore recognising different interpretations and multiple perspectives of reality (Saunders, 
Lewis, Thornill, 2009).  
Unlike the positivist paradigm that views reality as independent of the observer, 
interpretivism assumes that the researcher is an intrinsic part of the researched phenomenon 
(Remenyi et al., 1998), and in entering the social world seeks to gain a rich understanding 
of the research context and of the meanings social actors attach to it. Accordingly, in-depth 
investigations based on small samples and qualitative methods for data collections are 
generally employed. Thus, case studies represent real-life events set in particular contexts 
and are particularly useful when the research seeks to understand the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of a 
particular phenomenon over which there is limited control (Yin, 1994). Within this research 
strategy, interviews allow to explore the social reality through people’s knowledge, opinions, 
interpretations and personal experiences, whilst observations enable the collection of
<<<PAGE=118>>>
102 
 
multidimensional data on the physical, spatial and temporal dimensions of the context and 
on the social interactions, norms and behaviours that take place within it (Mason, 2002). 
Such rich data are ultimately used in an inductive approach for the development of theories 
and concepts (Brymann and Bell, 2011). With most apprenticeships studies adopting the 
interpretivist paradigm, a brief discussion on how these have provided valuable insights and 
have informed the current study follows. 
4.2.1 Research methods in apprenticeship research   
Apprenticeship research has been dominated by the interpretivist paradigm. A review of 
apprenticeship studies published in the Journal of Vocational Education and Training  
reveals a clear division among those discussing the apprenticeship’s institutional 
arrangements on the basis of national statistics and policy reviews (i.e. Abdel-Wahab, 2012; 
Chankseliani and Relly, 2012; Hogarth, Gambin and Hasluck, 2012b) and those presenting 
empirical investigations into apprenticeships as model of learning (i.e. Chan, 2015; Dismore, 
2014). Whilst the former focus on topics as participation rates, costs, benefits and reforms 
considering apprenticeships as an instrument of government policy, the latter examine a 
multitude of topics ranging from learning methods to educational progression.  
Empirical studies following an interpretivist paradigm have made significant contributions 
to apprenticeship research providing insight into real life contexts and giving voice to 
apprentices as central social actors. Whilst based on limited samples, these studies present 
rich accounts of apprentices’ learning experiences and quality theoretical inferences about 
factors critical to apprentices’ development. As such, ethnographical studies investigated the 
socio-cultural aspects of learning in apprenticeship (i.e. Lave and Wenger, 1991) shedding 
light on the relationships and processes contributing to competence development. Within 
these, Chan (2015) adopted a phenomenological approach to investigate the role of 
observation in contributing to learning a trade. Rich data collected via interviews allowed to 
understand apprentices’ learning experiences through their perspective, evaluating 
observation as an essential process in trades learning. Similarly, an ethnographic case-study 
encompassing interviews with apprentices and participant observation in college and at the 
workplace was conducted by Brockmann (2010) to explore the role of the apprenticeship in 
shaping young people learner identity.  
Additionally, in examining how novice apprentices are guided and supported by experienced 
colleagues in the workplace and how guidance and support are distributed within teams, 
Filliettaz (2011) employed an ethnographic and discursive methodology where interactions
<<<PAGE=119>>>
103 
 
between apprentices and their colleagues were videotaped. Analysis of interactions provided 
insight into the pedagogical qualities of the workplace suggesting how a positive learning 
environment is dependent on experienced workers’ pedagogical skills and awareness. Also, 
in a comprehensive study on workplace learning in initial VET, Poortman, Illeris and 
Nieuwenhuis (2011) investigated how different factors related to the cognitive, social and 
emotional dimensions of learning influence the learning process and the related outcomes. 
Rich data collected via interviews, observation and document analysis allowed to assess the 
influence of learner characteristics and the learning environment on apprentices’ competence 
development.  
Within the English apprenticeship system, in-depth case studies in the steel industry present 
insight into different company approaches to apprenticeships related to expansive and 
restrictive characteristics (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b); using a range of methods for data 
collection including interviews, observation and weekly learning logs, Fuller and Unwin 
(2003b) investigated opportunities for and barriers to learning in different learning 
environments. Additionally, whilst exploring the social and pedagogical relationships in the 
workplace, the information collected in weekly learning logs contributed to revisiting the 
pedagogical relationships between apprentices and older employees (Fuller and Unwin, 
2003c). A subsequent study on organisations operating within the public and private sector 
furthered the understanding of best practices in apprenticeships interviewing training 
personnel within organisations on the rational for providing apprenticeships, the costs and 
benefits involved, the structure of the training provided and the links with career progression 
(Fuller and Unwin, 2007).  
Overall, in-depth case studies are influential in identifying factors contributing to successful 
apprenticeships and in explaining how and why apprentices engage in workplace learning. 
As discussed by Felstead and colleagues (2004) case-study research contributes to 
identifying the sources of learning related to daily experiences in the workplace however, 
although extensive research on apprenticeships has been carried out, most studies have 
tended to focus on limited aspects in specific organisational and occupational contexts. It 
follows that the generalisability of much research is problematic. Additionally, few studies 
have investigated apprenticeships in a systematic way, hence a comprehensive 
understanding of how the apprenticeship contributes to resultant competencies is still 
lacking. A generalised conceptualisation of the contextual factors that enhance apprentices’ 
competence development is therefore called for.
<<<PAGE=120>>>
104 
 
An attempt in this direction was made by Messman and Mulder (2015) who investigating 
apprenticeships in Germany quantified the association between work characteristics and 
school-work alignment on one side and apprentices’ engagement in workplace learning on 
the other. The study is however based on a small sample, and fails to consider individual 
factors as important determinants of professional development. Building on this line of work, 
this research adopts a positivist paradigm to examine the relationship between the 
apprenticeship, the HR system embedding the programme, apprentices’ learning goal 
orientation a nd apprentices’ resultant competencies. In examining causal relationships 
between independent and dependent variables with a focus on the social embeddedness of 
the phenomenon a quantitative approach is adopted. 
With a positivist epistemology the research follows the principle of deductivism 
investigating the extant literature to generate hypotheses to be tested gathering empirical 
data (Bryman and Bell, 2011). The review of the literature has informed the development of 
a comprehensive framework that conceptualises the quality of the learning environment in 
apprenticeship and in testing it empirically allows to: 1) identify the relevant importance of 
different sources of learning and 2) establish the association between these and apprentices’ 
resultant competencies. A survey was therefore developed to collect quantitative data and 
test the apprenticeship development model advanced from the literature. Additionally, an 
open question positioned at the end of the survey allowed the collection of qualitative dat a 
in form of statements allowing cross-checking of findings. Quantitative and qualitative data 
were collected simultaneously, and whilst analysed separately they form an integrated data 
corpus providing a strong basis for data triangulation. As discussed by Johnson, 
Onwuegbuzie and Turner (2007), a dominant quantitative mixed method research relies on 
a positivist view of the research process while at the same time recognising the benefits of 
additional qualitative data. Accordingly, this study adopts a multi-method design in the data 
collection and data analysis, however under the same paradigm, that of positivism.  
Details of the research design are discussed in the following section, followed by a 
description of the quantitative and qualitative data analysis.  
 
4.3 Research design  
Important methodological considerations have informed the design of the field study. Firstly, 
since the early 2000s, HR research has recognised the importance of investigating multi-
<<<PAGE=121>>>
105 
 
level phenomena, taking into account the fact that HR practices designed at the 
organisational level influence employees' attitudes and behaviours at the individual level, 
which in turn influence performance at the organisational level (i.e. Bowen and Ostroff, 
2004). As discussed by Sanders, Cogin and Bainbridge (2013) this presents implications for 
designing research models based on strong theoretical assumptions, implementing valid and 
reliable measures and adopting sound analytical techniques. 
Thus, following the argument advanced by Wright and Nishii (2007), as this study considers 
apprentices as particular category of employees, the analysis focuses on HR practices at the 
level of the job group. The HR architecture model advanced by Lepak and Snell (1999) has 
led to the identification of the high-commitment HR system as embedding the apprenticeship 
as model of learning in employment, on the assumption that such practices are uniformly 
applied to the apprentices’ job group. However, considering the multi -level dimension of 
organisations, it is acknowledged that HR practices at the job group are experienced and 
perceived subjectively at the individual level, with potential for variance (Wright and Nishii, 
2007). 
As ignoring the multi-level dimension in HRM research may lead to the problem of 
misspecification of the measured level in comparison to the theoretical level, negatively 
impacting construct validity (Sanders et al., 2013), the issue has been addressed studying the 
phenomenon at the individual level and identifying the individual apprentice as the focal unit 
of analysis. Collecting data from apprentices rather than HR staff or line managers enables 
capturing individual-based perceptions of the quality of the apprenticeship, the HR system 
and learning goal orientation, as strong determinants of ap prentices’ competence 
development. In so doing, this research captures apprentices’ perceptions and experiences 
of HR practices, rather than the intended and espouses HR policies and practices as portrayed 
by managers (Kinnie et al., 2005).  As argued by Arthur and Boyles (2007), the level-based 
assumptions behind the constructs under investigation ought to guide the choices about 
whom to survey and the types of questions to ask, hence surveying apprentices as 
respondents allows insight into the learning experiences and the factors potentially hindering 
or enabling apprentices’ competence development. 
Additionally, as single-informant designs are prone to issues of common method variance 
scholars recommend to collect data on the dependent and independent variables from 
different sources (Chang et al., 2010). Accordingly, the original set up of the study intended
<<<PAGE=122>>>
106 
 
to collect data on the independent variables from apprentices and data on the dependent 
variables from line managers. However, given that the apprenticeship is structured in 
placements with apprentices rotating regularly among departments, the tracking of line 
managers to match respective apprentices in Company B was impractical. While Company 
A agreed to line managers taking part in the study, the low number of responses from this 
category (N= 18 out of 30) precluded any analysis of the data. Accordingly, given that a 
multi-actor design for the field study was impractical, self-report measurements were 
deemed appropriate and steps were taken in the survey design to minimise the issue of 
common method bias.  
Specifically, issues that relationships between self-reported variables are routinely upwardly 
biased have been challenged as misconceptions (i.e. Conway and Lance 2010; Fuller et al., 
2015) upholding the view that multi-actor research is not necessarily superior to single-actor 
reports. Empirical studies suggest that self-reports are accurate performance measurements. 
In particular, Shalley, Gilson and Blum (2009, p. 495) have adopted self-reports for assessing 
creative performance in that employees are best placed to report on creativity for being 
‘aware of the subtle things they do in their jobs that make them creative’. Similarly, research 
on training transfer has extensively relied on self-reports (i.e. Chiaburu and Marinova, 2005; 
Facteau et al., 1995, Tesluk et al., 1995) as no evidence suggests that trainees cannot 
accurately report on this outcome. As discussed by Velada and colleagues (2007), given that 
the results of studies on training transfer adopting self-reports are consistent with those of 
studies which implement both self-reports and supervisor performance rating, self-reports 
are deemed adequate and accurate performance measures. Additionally, measures employed 
to minimise the issue of common method bias in designing the questionnaire included 
reverse coding some of the items and adopting different anchors to measure different 
constructs. As discussed by Aulack and Gencturk (2000) such ex ante steps can minimise 
the effects of common method bias. Similarly, guaranteeing anonymity and confidentiality 
in the data collection process is expected to contribute to the accuracy of the data (Chang et 
al., 2010).  
Another important consideration in HRM research is that of internal validity, here 
questioning how confident can we be that the apprenticeship development model is partly 
responsible for variation in apprentices’ competencies. Scholars have long discussed the 
insufficient methodological rigour of cross-sectional studies in providing a foundation for 
inferring causality calling for advanced methodologies as longitudinal and experimental
<<<PAGE=123>>>
107 
 
designs (Sanders et al., 2013). In testing a theoretically derived framework that 
conceptualises the quality of the learning environment in apprenticeship, this research adopts 
a cross-sectional and a longitudinal design.  
Whilst originally set up as a longitudinal study based on panel data collected over two waves, 
issues of sample attrition reduced the sample size to 90 observations, limiting the power for 
statistical inference tests (Hair et al., 2014). Although an exclusive longitudinal design would 
have allowed insight into the time order of variables and so enabled strong inferences about 
causality (Bryman and Bell, 2015), the restricted sample size precludes this methodology. 
Accordingly, this research is centred on a cross-sectional study based on the observations 
collected over the first wave (N= 233) and is complemented by a longitudinal study based 
on the observations collected over the second wave (N= 90). Whilst the former seeks to 
explain patterns of associations between factors conducive to apprentices’ development and 
resultant competencies, the latter seeks to determine social change over time providing a 
preliminary basis for inferring causality (Brymann and Bell, 2011). In light of an emerging 
consensus in the informal learning (Cerasoli et al., 2018) and the apprenticeship literature 
(Fuller and Unwin, 2003b; Messman and Mulder, 2015) over the factors conducive to 
workplace learning, the cross-sectional study allows to test whether an association exists 
among such factors and apprentices’ resultant competencies. Added to this, the longitudinal 
study allows identifying changes in perceptions of the apprenticeship development model 
and apprentic es’ performance over time, along with providing preliminary insights for 
inferring causality. 
As discussed by Bednall (2013), longitudinal research presents methodological and 
logistical challenges in comparison to cross-sectional studies which should inform the 
research design. Following his guidelines, the time frame of the study was established 
considering the nature of the research question along with practical considerations such as 
funding and the timeframe available. Accordingly, data was collected on two assessments 
spaced about 10 months apart; the spacing of assessment was defined on the account that 
apprenticeships are learning intensive programmes involving accelerating development and 
expected to result in changes in competences in a relatively short-time space. Although 
Bednall (2013) discusses the limitations of two spaced assessments as in failing to 
differentiate true change from measurement error and to identify nonlinear change, in the 
context of this research it was deemed appropriate. Here the collection of panel data allowed 
the investigation of both stability and change in considering whether factors related to the
<<<PAGE=124>>>
108 
 
apprenticeship development model remained stable over time, and whether apprentices’ 
competencies varied. Additionally, the availability of data collected at different points in 
time allowed to tentatively explore relationships of causality on the assumption that earlier 
events influenced subsequent events and not vice-versa (Keeves, 1997).  
4.3.1 Research context 
Two main issues were considered in selecting the organisations participating in the study. 
Firstly, they would be operating in the engineering sector, as this presents a long standing 
tradition of offering high quality apprenticeships and it is leading the way in England in the 
delivery of Higher Apprenticeships (Lee, 2012). Secondly, they would extensively provide 
Advanced (Level 3) and Higher (Level 4 and above) Apprenticeships, rather than 
Intermediate (Level 2) qualifications.  
In order to identify companies meeting such requirements, the researcher consulted news (i. 
e. BBC news), social media (i.e. LinkedIn and Twitter), academic publications (i.e. Lee, 
2012; Ryan et al., 2007) and Government reports listing the top 100 Apprenticeship 
employers. In order to promote the research project, a brief cover letter describing the 
research objectives and the beneficial insights offered by the study was circulated via email 
among fifteen large organisations. Given the popularity of apprenticeships as research topic, 
access for data collection proved problematic. Although interested in the project, most high 
profile organisations had already agreed to other apprenticeship studies and were reluctant 
to engage in an additional research project on the subject. Ultimately, two large engineering 
organisations agreed to participate in the study, here presented as Company A and Company 
B. Whilst the researcher negotiated access to Company A independently, access to Company 
B was facilitated by the existing contacts of the Nottingham Business School. Altogether the 
companies employed nearly 500 apprentices studying towards Level 3, 4 and 5 thus 
presenting an illustrative profile of the apprenticeships qualifications.  
Company A 
Company A is one of the world largest independent manufactur ers of generators. The 
company has been a key figure within Electrical Engineering for over 130 years producing 
a wide range of electrical machines including turbo generators, power transformers and 
power management systems. The company trades worldwide within utility, oil, 
petrochemical, coal, steel and rail industries. Originally established in the UK in 1876, over 
the years the company experienced a series of integrations growing globally. Since the early 
2000s the company acquired subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Czech Republic and the USA.
<<<PAGE=125>>>
109 
 
The integrated companies now operate as one group employing around 5000 employees 
globally. Company A strives towards ongoing investments on the implementation of modern 
technology through research and product development.  
Data collection at Company A was conducted in its UK site employing around 500 staff of 
which 30 apprentices. Apprentices employed at company A attend a four-year programme 
within the manufacturing department. The apprenticeship is offered in cooperation with a 
local college where apprentices attend formal training courses leading to nationally 
recognised technical qualifications. Whilst the first 16 weeks of the apprenticeships are spent 
full-time at college to gain initial engineering technical knowledge, the remaining period is 
spent on-the-job with one day a week spent at college. Once in the workplace apprentices 
spend the first 12 months rotating among key manufacturing and support business areas to 
gain foundational knowledge covering manufacturing and production awareness along with 
product knowledge. Over the course of the second year apprentices are assigned to a specific 
department where in-depth technical skills training takes place. A comprehensive personal 
development programme complements the academic and vocational aspects of the 
apprenticeships and enables apprentices to gain key personal skills such as effective 
communication, leadership behaviours, presentation skills and career management.   
Company B 
Company B is a world leading industrial technology company creating power and propulsion 
systems for use on land, at sea and in the air. The company strives to globally lead the move 
to a low carbon economy. Pioneering cutting-edge technologies the company operates in 
five business units: civil aerospace, defence aerospace, power systems, marine and nuclear. 
Operating in 50 countries, Company B employs around 50,000 employees worldwide, of 
which 22,500 are based in the UK. 6,200 employees are based in the USA, 1000 in Canada, 
10,600 in Germany, 3,000 in Nordic countries and 6,700 in the rest of the world. 18,245 of 
the global employees are engineers specialised in electrical, manufacturing, design and 
service engineering. Company B is continually developing its employee base to ensure core 
skills and capabilities are developed to support its strategy. In 2017, 31.2 million were 
invested in training and development in subjects ranging from health and safety, quality, 
product safety, export control and ethics.  
Company B has more than a century engagement with apprenticeships and regularly 
employs around 500 apprentices in the UK. Data collection at Company B was conducted in
<<<PAGE=126>>>
110 
 
the UK surveying over 450 apprentices based in seven sites around the country. Level 3 
Apprenticeships range from practical roles as mechanical fitters, welders and machinists to 
more technical engineering roles. Although geared towards different careers, all programmes 
follow the same format: the first year is spent off-the-job gaining broad understanding of 
engineering principles and technologies at college or in the company’s training academy. 
The second year is based in the workplace and entails numerous placements within the 
business areas to gain real depth of knowledge, whilst in the third year apprentices are 
assigned to a specific role and further refine their knowledge and skills.  
Level 4 and above Apprenticeships last around 4 years and lead to Degree qualifications and 
relevant professional qualifications in areas ranging from Business, Digital Technologies, 
Engineering, Management, Supply Chain and Accounting and Manufacturing. These 
involve placements within relevant business areas complemented by block releases at 
University to complete the relevant technical qualification. As in Company A, apprentices 
employed in Company B develop personal skills as team working, self-confidence and 
communication as part of an apprenticeship bespoken personnel development programme.  
Although the apprenticeships investigated in Company A and B take place in various sites 
and are geared towards different curriculums and careers, they follow a standardised format. 
In all cases, apprentices are expected to work towards attainment of the technical certificate, 
relevant NVQ diploma and key skills. Accordingly, apprentices need to successfully 
complete academic assignments and examinations, workplace tests and other assessment 
specified by the Apprenticeship framework. Additionally, both companies provide 
comprehensive professional development programmes, competitive salaries, rewards and 
benefits. Given that both companies operate in the engineering sector, focus on innovation 
and present apprentices with equally structured programmes, for the purpose of this study 
respondents from company A and company B are treated as one sample.  
4.3.2 Data collection 
Before conducting the field study I consulted with the HR manager (Company A) and the 
Apprenticeship manager (Company B) in either company to present the scope of the research 
and the benefits involved. Both expressed interest in learning what factors contribute to 
apprentices’ development and were supportive of the research in presenting them with 
different insights from their internal evaluations. Before agreeing to the study, both 
managers reviewed the survey to ensure the questions were relevant and of no sensitive 
nature.
<<<PAGE=127>>>
111 
 
A pilot study was then conducted with a focus-group of 8 apprentices in order to test the 
validity of the questionnaire. In the focus-group, apprentices were asked to look at the survey 
in pairs, with the opportunity to discuss it among each other before reporting their comments 
to the researcher. As part of the pilot, the researcher invited apprentices to comment on 
clarity of instruction and layout, any questions which appeared unclear or ambiguous, any 
topics which could make them uneasy, any repetitions and major topic omissions (Saunders 
et al., 2009).  
The pilot allowed the identification of few items containing unclear terminology, providing 
the researcher the opportunity to discuss alternative wording with the group before finalising 
the final version of the survey. Overall the feedback from respondents was very positive, 
confirming the relevance of the constructs of interest in the context of the apprenticeship and 
validating the instrument. Additionally, two line managers read the scales adopted to 
measure apprentices’ performance and confirmed their validity.  
Next, an internal communication was distributed by the HR and Apprenticeship manager in 
either organisation to inform apprentices of the study and to invite them to promptly respond 
to the survey once received. The survey was then distributed via email to each individual 
apprentice. The email informed participants of anonymity of their responses and provided 
them with a unique identifier which they could use if they wished to withdraw their responses 
within two weeks of completing the survey. The email included a link to an online survey 
and provided the researcher’s contact details for those participants who wished to enquire 
about the survey or discuss it further.  
The online survey included an information sheet and a consent form (Appendix 1). The 
former explained the purpose of the study, the topics investigated and the time required to 
complete the questionnaire (about 20 minutes). It also assured participants of confidentiality 
of their responses, explaining that these would not be disclosed to anyone within and outside 
the organisation. The voluntary nature of the survey was also emphasised, informing 
participants of their right to withdraw at any time when completing the questionnaire. The 
researcher contact details along with those of the Director of Study and those of the School 
Director of Research at Nottingham Trent University were also included.  
The online survey was adopted as the apprentices’ population was geographically distributed 
(N= 495) as well as for the inherent advantages of the online tool in allowing apprentices to 
complete the survey in their own time and without social pressures. Email reminders with
<<<PAGE=128>>>
112 
 
voucher incentives were further distributed to boost the response rate. It has indeed become 
common practice to offer participants rewards for taking part to the project and increase 
participants’ recruitment and retention (Bednall, 2013). Inducements were offered in the 
form of shopping vouchers (£10 - £25) allocated via a lottery system and distributed via 
email once the data collection was completed.  
The first wave of data collection took place between March and June 2016, whilst the second 
wave of data collection took place in March and April 2017. As advised by Bednall (2013), 
a relationship management system was designed to manage the administration of the survey 
and record contacts with participants. A database with participants’ contact details and 
unique identifiers allowed to record the dates of the survey distribution, details of those who 
responded, and track reminders to non-respondents. Such system enabled the administration 
of the survey in the second wave of data collection, targeting only those apprentices who 
completed the survey the first time, and enabled the distribution of the lottery vouchers. 
4.3.3 Ethical issues  
The research has been conducted in accordance with the ethical framework endorsed by 
Nottingham Trent University. As the project involved the collection and analysis of data 
related to living human beings, ethical approval from the University’s College Research 
Ethic Committee was required.  
Among the ethical principles promulgated by the University, the research ensured to protect 
confidentiality and anonymity of participants and security of the research data during and 
after the project. These principles were integrated in the research procedure by storing all 
data in anonymised form and linking participants to their data only through unique 
identifiers. Data were saved on digital files, stored with password protection and accessible 
only by the researcher. Additionally, no individual or organisation has been and will be 
named in any publication discussing the empirical findings unless consent is given by the 
party concerned. 
According to the principle of informed consent all relevant information related to the 
research project and the data collection procedure should be communicated to the research 
participants. This should include any risks and benefits associated with their involvement 
and should stress the voluntary nature of their participation. In so doing, detailed and clear 
information should be presented so that participants are fully informed of the nature and 
objectives of the research. Correspondingly, apprentices were informed of the research
<<<PAGE=129>>>
113 
 
project by the HR manager and the Apprenticeship manager in either organisation; 
subsequently, an information sheet and a consent form were read and agreed upon by all 
respondents before completing the questionnaire.  
As particular attention should be given to the capacity to give valid consent, the researcher 
acknowledged the possibility that with Apprenticeships being available to anyone aged 16 
and above, a proportion of respondents may have been aged under 18. However, being 
classed as full-time employees these were deemed capable of deciding whether to 
participate. Additionally, the representatives of the organisation (i.e. the HR manager and 
the Apprenticeship manager) introduced apprentices to the project, drawing attention to the 
voluntary nature of the study, further stressed in the information sheet introducing the 
questionnaire.  
Ultimately, payments to participants in the form of shopping vouchers distributed with a 
lottery system were also subjected to approval of the University’s Research Committee. This 
ensured that participants were rewarded for their participation to the project and not for a 
particular outcome. It also ensured that the value of the rewards was not at a level at which 
participants would take part to the study against their interest, and did not present the risk of 
skewing the data.  
4.3.4 Sample 
On the first wave of data collection completed and usable questionnaires from 233 
apprentices were received. The data collection targeted all apprentices employed in 
Company A (N= 33) and all apprentices employed in Company B (N= 465). 30 responses 
came from Company A (response rate= 90%) and 203 responses came from Company B 
(response rate= 44%).  Overall, this represented a response rate of 47%. The second wave 
of data collection targeted only apprentices based in Company B who had responded to the 
survey the first time, resulting in 90 responses (response rate 44%).  
Among respondents, 69% are male and 18% are female. Whilst national statistics present an 
even split with 54% of women and 46% of man starting an apprenticeship in 2016 when 
considering the overall apprenticeship population (House of Commons Library, 2018), the 
gender distribution in this sample is typical of the engineering sector that has traditionally 
attracted predominantly male apprentices (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b).  
A vast proportion of respondents is aged between 20 and 24 (49%), whilst 27% are aged 
between 16 and 19, and only around 10% are over 25. The demographic distribution of the
<<<PAGE=130>>>
114 
 
sample is particular to the Engineering sector, whilst the overall apprenticeship population 
presents 46% of apprentices aged 25 and over (House of Commons Library, 2018).  
When considering the apprenticeship level, nearly half of respondents (47%) are studying 
towards a Level 3 qualification, whilst 25% are studying towards a Level 4 qualification and 
15% towards a Level 5 qualification. The sample is representative of the apprenticeship 
levels with half of respondents undertaking an Advanced Apprenticeship and half 
undertaking a Higher Apprenticeship. The majority of respondents are studying towards an 
Engineering qualification, with others taking a Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Project 
Management qualification. It is important to note that the advance and higher levels are 
typical of the engineering sector, whilst 53% of the overall Apprenticeship population 
studies towards an Intermediate (Level 2) qualification. 
When considering the organisation’s tenure, only 15% of respondents hav e been employed 
for less than 1 year; 60% have been employed between 1 and 3 years and only 10% ha ve 
over 3 years work experience with the company. 55% of respondents reported to be 
employed on a permanent contract, 30% on a temporary contract, whilst 15% did not provide 
this information. The overwhelmingly majority of the sample (90%) reported that the 
apprenticeship was voluntary, in that it was their decision to apply for the programme; whilst 
only 10% indicated that the apprenticeship was mandatory, as in required by the 
organisation.  
4.3.5 Measures  
Existing scales with proven reliability were selected for measuring the constructs of interest. 
The items were identical across the two waves of the study.  
The following section presents the scales adopted to measure factors related to formal and 
informal learning, the HR system strength, performance appraisal, learning goal orientation 
and apprentices’ competencies.  
Formal learning  
Transfer design  
I used a 4-item scale developed by Diamantidis and Chatzoglou (2014) to measure transfer 
design intended as ‘the degree to which a training programme (1) has been designed and 
delivered in such a way that provides trainees the ability to transfer learning back to the job 
and (2) match job requirements (tasks and activities)’ (ibidem, pp. 158).
<<<PAGE=131>>>
115 
 
Whilst the original items were written in the past tense in order to measure training 
programmes attended over the previous years, the items were here presented in the presen t 
tense given that training in apprenticeship is ongoing. Additionally, some information was 
added to reflect the particular nature of the apprenticeship training as in encompassing 
courses at either college, university, the local training academy, and in including individual 
study.  
Sample items are ‘ During the training process (attending formal courses at college, 
university, local training academy) several examples are given about the ways to use learning 
on my daily job activities’ and ‘During the training process the activities and exercises I 
undertake (in class or as part of my individual study) help me understand how to apply 
learning on the job’. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly 
agree’.  
Supervisor support 
I used a 7-item scale employed by Chiaburu and Marinova (2005) in a study on the 
antecedents of pre-training motivation and skill transfer to measure supervisor support. The 
scholars adopt a 5-item scale from Yarnall (1998) measuring supervisor support for career 
development and developed two additional items specifically related to learning transfer. 
The scale measures the extent to which the supervisor 1) encourages the application of newly 
acquired knowledge and skills and 2) assists employees with improving performance and 
with career development. 
Sample items are ‘My supervisor provides me with the time I need to practice the skills 
learned in training’, ‘My supervisor provides me with constant reminders on how to apply 
the acquired skills’ and ‘My supervisor utilises a variety of methods to assist me wit h my 
development’. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Supervisor’s feedback 
I used a 3-item scale developed by Diamantidis and Chatzoglou (2014) to measure 
supervisor feedback. The scale measures the degree to which employees ask their 
supervisors about the extent to which they support and reinforce the use of newly learned 
knowledge and skills on the job. Sample items read ‘After completion of the training 
programme I often discuss with my supervisor the possible ways to apply training on the 
job’ and ‘After completion of the training programme I often discuss with my supervisor the
<<<PAGE=132>>>
116 
 
problems in using training on the job’. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ 
to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Colleagues’ feedback  
I used a 3-item scale developed by Diamantidis and Chatzoglou (2014) to measure 
colleagues’ feedback. The scale measures the degree to which employees ask their 
colleagues about how well they perform their job after participation in a training programme. 
Sample items include ‘After completion of the training programme I have post -training 
conversations with my colleagues about how to improve job performance’ and ‘After 
completion of the training programme I ask my colleagues how well I apply the training 
content on my job’. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly 
agree’. 
Opportunity to use the knowledge and skills acquired in formal training 
Opportunity to use the knowledge and skills acquired in training was measured with two 
items adopted from the scale developed by Ballesteros-Rodriguez and colleagues (2012). 
The items were originally developed to measure the application of training content on the 
job as part of a multidimensional scale measuring training success. The items read ‘I have 
incorporated much of the skills learned in the training course to my daily work activities’ 
and ‘I have often used at work, knowledge and skills learned’. In the apprenticeship survey 
the items were phrased in the present tense to reflect the ongoing nature of formal training; 
additionally following the pilot study the second item included an example of formal training 
to clarify terminology. The items in the survey read: ‘I can incorporate much of the skills 
learned in the training cours e in my daily work activities’ and ‘I can use at work, the 
knowledge and skills learned off-the- job (at college)’. Response options ranged from (1) 
‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’. 
 Informal learning  
Social Support 
In order to measure social support I used a 6-item scale developed by Morgeson and 
Humphrey (2006) as part of the Work Design Questionnaire, reflecting the extent to which 
the job presents good relationships among colleagues and provides the opportunity to obtain 
information from oth ers and seek help when required. Sample items read ‘I have the 
opportunity to meet with others in my work’ and ‘People I work with take a personal interest 
in me’. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.
<<<PAGE=133>>>
117 
 
Feedback  
I used a 3-item scale developed by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) as part of the Work 
Design Questionnaire to measure the availability of feedback in the workplace. The scale 
measures the extent to which others, as in colleagues and supervisors, provide ongoing 
feedback on performance. Sample items are ‘I receive a great deal of information from my 
manager and colleagues about my job performance’ and ‘I receive feedback on my 
performance from other people in my organisation (such as my manager and colleagues)’. 
Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) strongly agree’.  
Problem solving 
I used a 4-item scale developed by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) as part of the Work 
Design Questionnaire to measure problem solving as this exhibits the knowledge, skills and 
ability demands placed on individuals as a function of the job requirements. Sample items 
include ‘The job often involves dealing with problems that I have not met before’ and ‘The 
job requires unique ideas or solutions to problems, Response options ranged from (1) 
‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.   
Experimenting 
I used a 3-item scale developed by Van Woerkom and Croon (2008) to measure 
experimenting as in the extent to which the job allows to engage with experimenting with 
methods, techniques and tools. The scale items read ‘I like to try things out, even if it 
sometimes leads nowhere’, ‘I experiment with other working methods’ and ‘I try out new 
working methods’. These were adapted to measure apprentices’ perceptions of the extent 
their job allows them to engage in experimenting and following the pilot test the first item 
was rephrased to enhance respondents’ understanding of terminology. The 3 -items in the 
survey read: ‘In my job I have the opportunity to try things out, even if it  does not directly 
support the progress of the job’, ‘In my job I have the opportunity to experiment with 
different working methods’ and ‘In my job I have the opportunity to try out new techniques 
or tools’. The last item referred to ‘new techniques and tools’ rather than ‘working methods’ 
to cover a greater variety of activities contributing to informal learning (i.e. Lohman, 2006). 
Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Task autonomy 
Following Wood and de Menezes (2011) task autonomy is measured as in the extent to which 
the job presents employees with responsibility and discretion in managing and executing the
<<<PAGE=134>>>
118 
 
primary tasks using a 5- item scale adopted from the WERS2004 (Britain’s Workplace 
Employment Relations Survey). Apprentices rated their influence on their jobs on a four-
point scale (none; a little; some; a lot). Sample items include ‘the tasks you do in your job’, 
‘the pace at which you work’ and ‘how you do your work’.  
Task interdependence 
I measure task interdependence with a 7-item scale developed by Dean and Snell (1991) 
measuring to the extent to which the job requires interaction and collaboration with others 
to achieve the intended goals. The scholars measured task interdependence along with task 
variety and task complexity as job characteristics dependent on integrated manufacturing. 
Whilst the original items referred to work carried out in units (i.e. ‘How much do people in 
this unit rely on people in other units’ and ‘How much do people in this unit h ave to 
coordinate work with others’), here the items were phrased to refer to the individual level. 
Sample items are ‘How much does your work require you to coordinate with others’, ‘To 
what extent is dealing with other people part of your job’ and ‘How much does your success 
depend on cooperating with others’. Response options ranged from (1) ‘not much’ to (5) ‘a 
great deal’.  
HRM system strength  
Following Bednall, Sanders and Runhaar (2014), the HRM system strength was measured 
as a composite of three subscales measuring the constructs of distinctiveness, consistency 
and consensus (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004). I adopted the same 16 items from the Delmotte, 
De Winne and Sels’s measurement (2012) to capture the dimensions of each subscale and 
created a composite measure of the HRM system strength. Sample items for distinctiveness 
are ‘When one ask the HR department for help, they provide clear answers’ and ‘The HR 
department undertakes exactly those actions that meet our needs’. Sample items for 
consistency are ‘HR practices in this organisation achieve their intended goal’ and ‘The HR 
instruments for staff appraisal succeed in reinforcing the desired behaviours’. Sample items 
for consensus are ‘Employees consider promotions as fair in this organisation’ and ‘If  
employees perform well, they get the necessary recognition and rewards’. Response options 
ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Performance appraisal satisfaction 
I used a 6-item scale developed by Kuvaas (2006) to measure the construct of performance 
appraisal satisfaction. The scale was designed to measure employees’ perceptions of the 
organisation’s commitment to conduct developmental performance appraisal. Sample items
<<<PAGE=135>>>
119 
 
are ‘My organisation is good at providing recognition for good performance’ and ‘The 
feedback I receive on how I do my job is highly relevant’. Response options ranged from (1) 
‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Learning goal orientation   
I used a 5-item scale developed by VandeWalle (1997) to measure the construct of learning 
goal orientation. The scale was specifically designed for the work domain and has been 
largely adopted in management research (i.e. Dragoni et al., 2009; Runhaar, Sanders and 
Yang, 2010). Sample items are ‘I am willing to select a challenging work assignment that I 
can learn a lot from’, ‘I enjoy challenging and difficult tasks at work where I will learn new 
skill’, and ‘For me, development of my work ability is important enough to take risks’.  
Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Apprentices’ end-state competencies  
As discussed in Chapter 2, apprentices’ end -state competencies have been classified into 
three categories (technical knowledge; job competence; work and business skills) according 
to the statutory requirements indicated in the SASE (2017). In order to evaluate the 
application of these competencies, I measure the following constructs: 
Training transfer as proxy for technical knowledge  
I used a 6-item scale developed by Xiao (1996) to measure training transfer as proxy for 
technical knowledge. This scale has been widely adopted in studies on transfer of training 
with high reliability (i.e. Awoniyi, Griego, Morgan, 2002; Chiaburu and Marinova, 2005; 
Scaduto et al., 2008; Zumrah and Boyle, 2015) and operationalises transfer as in output of 
transfer behaviour (i.e. increased performance). Sample items are ‘Using the new 
technical/theoretical knowledge has helped me improve my work’ and ‘I have accomplished 
my job tasks faster than befor e attending the training’ and ‘The quality of my work has 
improved after using the new technical/theoretical knowledge’. Whilst the original scale 
referred to KSA (knowledge, skills, abilities) here the phrase ‘technical/theoretical 
knowledge’ was adapted to strongly reflect the expected outcome of formal training in 
apprenticeship. Response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Formalised and emergent work role behaviours as proxies for job competence and work and 
business skills  
Apprentices’ job competence and work and business skills are measured in terms of work 
role behaviours conceptualised as proficiency, adaptivity and proactivity, at the individual, 
team and organisational level.
<<<PAGE=136>>>
120 
 
I used a 27 item-scale developed by Griffin, Neal and Parker (2007) which differentiates 
among particular work role behaviours and the level of contribution. Accounting for 
contextual features of uncertainty and interdependence, Griffin and his colleagues developed 
a model of work role performance which considers formalised and emergent work role 
behaviours contributing to the effectiveness of the individual, the team and the organisation. 
Specifically, interdependence determines the extent to which work roles are embedded in 
social systems and defines whether individuals need to support the broader social context of 
the organisation (Griffin et al., 2007). In light of increasingly interrelated work environments 
both task and contextual performance (Borman and Motowidlo, 1993) are organisationally 
valuable. Whilst the former refers to behaviours prescribed by role requirements and 
contributing to individual effectiveness, the latter refers to behaviours contributing to the 
psychological, social and organisational context of work, and so facilitating the effectiveness 
of the team and the organisation as a whole (Motowidlo and Kell, 2003). Building on this 
distinction, Griffin, Neal and Parker (2007) categorise work role behaviours according to the 
level of contribution in: individual task-, team member-, and organisation member- 
behaviours. 
Additionally, in light of increasingly dynamic work contexts the scholars postulate that work 
role behaviours require certain levels of flexibility. In distinguishing between formalised and 
emergent behaviours Griffin and colleagues (2007) present proficiency, adaptivity and 
proactivity as sub-dimensions of work role performance. Whilst proficiency describes the 
role requirements that can be formalised in stable and predictable circumstances, adaptivity 
and proactivity refer to behaviours that are emergent in dynamic situations. Specifically, 
adaptivity refers to behaviours responsive to externally initiated changes in task 
requirements and the work environment, and proactivity refers to self-initiated behaviours 
directed at changing task requirements or the work environment.  
When considering apprentices’ end-state competencies, the cross-classification of work role 
behaviours presented by Griffin, Neal and Parker (2007) is reflective of apprentices’ job 
competence and important work and business skills. Job competence in referring to the skills 
required to deliver the job role reflects the behaviours underlying individual task proficiency. 
In measuring individual task proficiency, resembling the degree to which an individual meets 
the formalised behaviours specified in job descriptions, apprentices’ underlying job 
competence is assessed. As discussed by Brockman and colleagues (2009), the notion of job 
competence within the English vocational system is conceptually related to the performance
<<<PAGE=137>>>
121 
 
of tasks. Accordingly, measuring individual task proficiency allows the assessment of 
apprentices’ job competence.  
Team member proficiency  considers the behaviours required when working in a group 
context, encompassing helping colleagues and cooperating with others, and reflects team 
working skills. The latter feature as critical work and business skill that apprentices need to 
demonstrate as part of the PLTS. Organisation member proficiency  refers to behaviours 
contributing to the organisational effectiveness including supporting and defending the 
organisational objectives and promoting the organisational image. Such construct resembles 
skills of effective participation, indicated in the SASE (2017) as the ability to actively engage 
with issues affecting oneself and those around, playing a full part in the life of the 
organisation by taking responsible actions to bring improvements to others and oneself. 
Individual task, team member and organisation member adaptivity  represent how 
individuals cope with, respond to and support change affecting their work role, their role as 
team members, and as members of the organisation. The constructs is closely related to the 
core skill of self-management, as in the ability to take responsibility, embrace change, cope 
with challenges and positively respond to demanding situations and new requirements 
(SASE, 2017).  
Individual task, team member and organisation member proactivity  refer to self-starting, 
future-oriented behaviours directed at changing the individual work role, the way the team 
operates, and the way the organisation works respectively. Proactivity emphasises self-
directed behaviours and thus reflects skills of creative thinking in generating and exploring 
ideas and making original contributions (SASE, 2017).  
Table 4.1 reports the constructs with the operational definition and the related underlying 
competencies. All items were measured using a 5-point Likert scale, asking respondents to 
rate the frequency of the behaviour over the last 12 months (1= not much; 2= little; 3= 
somewhat; 4= much; 5= a great deal). An overview of the constructs adopted to measure 
apprentices’ end-state competencies is presented in Table 4.2.

Open question 
The survey ended with an open question stating: ‘The following question will give you an 
opportunity to tell us more about your experience as an apprentice. Please respond openly 
and truthfully’. 
Control variables 
As discussed by Dysvik and Kuvaas (2008), predicting the outcome of training and 
development is complicated in that several variables can influence the relationship between 
training and performance. A number of demographic and control variables were therefore 
included in the analysis.  
I controlled for age, as commonly done in studies investigating employee development (i.e. 
Runhaar, Sanders and Yang, 2010; van Rijn, Yang and Sanders, 2012). I compute d 
dichotomous variables such that 0 represented ‘younger than 20’ and 1 represented ‘older 
than 20’. The decision of coding age around the value of 20 was based on the fact that this 
presented an approximately even split of the sample.  
Following Ehrnrooth and Bjorknan (2012) I controlled for tenure as this may influence both 
work performance and individuals’ perceptions of the HR process. Additionally, Dragoni 
and colleagues (2009) controlled for job assignment tenure and organisation tenure in order 
to isolate the effects of the developmental quality of managerial assignments. Similarly, 
DeRue and Wellman (2009) differentiated between organisational tenure and job tenure 
whilst Dysvik and Kuvaas (2008) differentiated between overall work experience and

specific job tenure. As apprenticeships may be undertaken by existing employees I collected 
data on both organisational tenure and apprenticeship tenure. However, given that for the 
overwhelmingly majority of respondents organisational and apprenticeship tenure 
coincided, I controlled for organisation tenure. This was coded as dichotomous variable so 
that 0 represented ‘less than 1 year’ and 1 represented ‘more than 1 year’. 
As staff position and formal education level have been identified as control variables (i.e. 
Dysvik and Kuvaas, 2008; Kuvaas, 2008; Sanders et al., 2008) I controlled for level of 
apprenticeship. A dichotomous variable was created so that 0 represented ‘level 3’ and 1 
represented ‘level 4 and above’. Ultimately, as done in other studies I controlled for type of 
contract (i.e. Sanders et al., 2008). This was identified as relevant within the context of 
apprenticeship given that research conducted by Vivian and colleagues (2012) for the 
Department of Business, Innovation and Skills found that apprentices employed on a fixed-
term contract were less satisfied with the programme than those employed on a permanent 
contract. Contract was presented as dichotomous variable so that 0 represented ‘temporary 
contract’ and 1 represented ‘permanent contract’.  
 
4.4 Quantitative data analysis
 
A number of statistical data analysis techniques were employed to analyse the data. 
Exploratory factor analysis  
Before considering the proposed hypotheses, the accuracy of the measurement model was 
examined. Although existing validated scales were employed to measure relevant constructs, 
minor adaptations were required to better capture the constructs under investigation in the 
context of apprenticeships. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was therefore conducted to 
assess the dimensionality of the survey for the dataset and assess the extent to which each 
variable represented a separate construct.  
As argued by Holton and colleagues (2000), by definition EFA generally does not make 
assumptions about the number of factors investigated, although these are normally derived 
from a conceptual framework; in practice however, EFA performs a confirmatory function 
when employed to confirm loosely constructed models underlying data. Here, EFA is 
utilised as an analytical technique to explore and confirm clumps of theoretically derived 
related variables, prior conducting regression analysis. 
As the purpose of EFA is to ascertain the suitability of the survey for apprentices, principal 
component analysis (PCA) was chosen as appropriate factor extraction technique for 
uncovering the probable number and nature of factors (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1989). To aid 
factors interpretability, varimax rotation was adopted as the most suitable and widely applied
<<<PAGE=142>>>
126 
method of orthogonal rotation, which in constraining factors to be uncorrelated presents a 
solution with the best simple structure (Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum and Strahan, 1999). 
Cross-sectional regression analysis  
Hierarchical regression was used to test the relationships between constructs. Such technique 
allows to examine how variance in performance (DV) is partitioned among predictors, 
assessing the ability of the IVs to explain variance in the DV. Such application is consistent 
with the use of regression for explanatory purposes, where the researcher examines the 
regression coefficients of the IVs, considering their magnitude, sign and significance, 
endeavouring to advance functional or theoretical reasons for the effects of the IVs on the 
DV (Hair et al., 2014).  
In testing the hypotheses related to formal training (Hypotheses H1a, H1b, H1c, H1d, H1e), 
the order of entrance of variables was determined by their logical and temporal sequence in 
the actual training intervention (Bates et al., 2000). After controlling for apprenticeship level, 
age, tenure and contract; transfer design was entered first, as this is the first factor 
encountered by apprentices when undergoing training. Supervisor support was entered 
second, as this reflected the relationship with the supervisor in sustaining appre ntices’ 
development; supervisor feedback was entered third to determine how much variance this 
variable accounts for over and above that explained by supervisor support; colleagues 
feedback was entered fourth, and lastly opportunity to use was entered. This allowed to 
partition the variance in transfer of training that was accounted for by each successive set of 
variables over and above the influence of the preceding sets. Accordingly, examination of 
the R² series estimated the proportion of variance accounted for by each set of variables, and 
examination of the ΔR² assessed the unique contribution of each variable.  
Whilst in testing formal training the order of entrance of variables was based on a logical 
temporal sequence with variables pertaining to the training event entered before variables 
related to the work environment, when considering informal learning the sequence of 
entrance is less clear. In testing the hypotheses related to informal learning (Hypotheses H2a, 
H2b, H2c, H2d, H2e, H2f), decision on the order of entrance of variables in hierarchical 
regression was based on the correlations identified between the predictors and the criterions. 
The variables with stronger correlations with the criterion were entered first, followed by 
those presenting weaker correlations with performance behaviours. After controlling for 
level, age, tenure and contract, social support was entered at step 1, followed by feedback at 
step 2. Problem solving and experimenting were then entered at step 3 and step 4 
respectively, followed by task autonomy at step 5 and task interdependence at step 6. 
Although task interdependence presented stronger correlations with the criterions compared
<<<PAGE=143>>>
127 
to task autonomy, it was entered last as studies suggest that autonomy is an important 
determinant of informal learning (Felstead et al., 2005; Messmann and Mulder, 2015). 
Regression analysis was also run with task interdependence entered at step 5 and task 
autonomy entered at step 6, but as the results did not differ the proposed order of entrance 
was retained.  
Preliminary analyses were conducted to ensure no violation of the assumptions of normality, 
linearity, multicollinearity and homoscedasticity. The sample size for the analysis ranged 
from N= 175 to N= 198; on the basis of the formula advanced by Tabachnick and Fidell: N 
>50 + 8 x m (m = number of independent variables) (2007, pp. 123) the sample size 
requirements for conducting regression analysis with 9 (formal training) and 10 (informal 
learning) predictors were met. In order to examine the influence of control variables, dummy 
variables were created for the categorical variables of age, level, tenure and contract. 
Longitudinal regression analysis  
Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses using Time 1 and Time 2 
data following the principles of change score models (Bednall, 2013). Such model is useful 
for investigating the determinants of change in the criterion allowing to assess whether non-
experimental factors are associated with change over time (Bednall, 2013). This procedure 
is consistent with studies conducted by Bednall, Sanders and Runhaar (2014) and Coyle-
Shapiro, Morrow, Richardson and colleagues (2002). The former study, as an example, 
accounted for initial levels of participation in informal learning to assess change in 
participation over a year. Accordingly, the autoregressive relationship was performed, 
regressing the criterion at Time 2 on its baseline assessment at Time 1, allowing to test the 
other predictors as determinants of change (Bednall, 2013). 
Testing for moderation  
Moderated regression was used to test the moderating role of the HR system strength 
(Hypothesis 3), PA (Hypothesis 4) and learning goal orientation (Hypothesis 5) respectively 
on the relationship between the apprenticeship training and resultant competencies. 
As discussed by Baron and Kenny (1986, pp. 1174), a moderator is a variable that ‘affects 
the direction and/or strength of the relation between an independent or predictor variable and 
a dependent or criterion variable’. Investigating moderation hypotheses extends research on 
associations to a deeper understanding of the boundaries conditions under which such 
associations occur (Hayes, 2014).

Fig. 4.1 Simple moderation model 
 
As depicted in figure 4.1, the effect of a moderator is generally represented as a conceptual 
diagram where the effect of the predictor (X) on the outcome variable (Y) is influenced by 
or dependent on the moderator (M). A simple linear moderation model is expressed in an 
equation as: 
Ŷ= i
₁ + b₁ X + b₂ M + b₃ XM 
where the effects of the independent variable (X) on the dependent variable (Y) are 
dependent, or conditional, on the moderator (M) (Hayes, 2014).  
As discussed by Baron and Kenny (1986) statistically when the interaction between the 
predictor and the moderator is significant (a significant b ₃ in the equation above), a 
moderation effect is said to occur; whilst the predictor and the moderator may be respectively 
significant, the test of moderation depends on the significance of the interaction between X 
and M. In that when an interaction effect is present, the effect of the independent variable X 
on the dependent variable Y will differ depending on values of the moderator M (Jaccard 
and Turrisi, 2003). Alternatively, when the interaction coefficient is non-significant, a more 
parsimonious model would present the effects of X on Y to be unconditional on M (Hayes, 
2014).  
Accordingly, in investigating the influence of boundary conditions in apprenticeships, three 
models were tested whereby in the first step the control variables were entered (Model 1); in 
the second step the main predictor (X) and the moderator (M) were entered (Model 2); in the 
third step the interaction term between the predictor and the moderator (XM) was entered 
(Model 3). To aid interpretation, the independent variables, the moderator and the interaction 
term were mean centred (i.e. put in deviation scores so that their means are zero) so that all 
outputs are based on mean-centred metrics of the predictor and the moderator (Hayes, 2014).  
Additionally, the pick-a-point or simple slope approach was adopted to probe the interaction 
(Aiken and West, 1991), and ascertain where in the distribution of the moderator (M) the 
independent variable X has a significant effect on the dependent variable Y. Following the 
X Y 
M
<<<PAGE=145>>>
129 
pick-a-point approach implemented by regression centering, the effects of X on Y were 
probed at moderate (mean levels), relatively low (a standard deviation below the mean) and 
relatively high (a standards deviation above the mean) levels of the moderator (Hayes, 2014).  
In order to test for moderation, composite measures for formal learning and informal 
learning were created aggregating the individual variables pertaining to each construct (i.e. 
Formal learning: transf er design, supervisor support, supervisor feedback, colleagues’ 
feedback, opportunity to use; Informal learning: social support, feedback, problem solving, 
experimenting, task autonomy, task interdependence).  Composite measures were also 
created for performance behaviours aggregating items measuring proficiency, adaptivity and 
proactivity at relevant levels: individual performance behaviours; team performance 
behaviours; organisation performance behaviours. Composite measures, where items 
tapping multiple dimensions are averaged, have been largely used to capture constructs such 
as performance and satisfaction where multiple dimensions make up the construct under 
investigation. As an example, Behrman and Perrault (1984) designed a composite measure 
of performance of sales representatives based on the average of 31 items measuring: success 
in achieving sales objectives; development and use of technical knowledge; providing 
information; controlling expenses; making effective sales presentations. Similarly Churchill 
and colleagues (1974) created a composite measure of sales representatives’ job satisfaction 
as an average score of 95 items measuring satisfaction with: the job itself; fellow workers; 
supervision; company policies and support; pay; opportunities for advancement; customers.  
 
4.5 Thematic data analysis  
Qualitative data was collected via an open question in the survey. The question gave 
respondents the opportunity to talk openly about their experience as apprentices giving them 
freedom to discuss any topic they felt relevant. Out of 323 questionnaires collected over two 
waves, 140 included responses to the open question. Responses varied in length, with some 
giving brief statements and others elaborating on their experience. As the open question was 
positioned at the end of the survey, many respondents commented on topics they had been 
asked about such as formal training, the role of the supervisor, the challenges experienced at 
work and their knowledge of the HR system.  
Before analysing the data, I engaged in repeated readings of the quotes collected in wave 1  
(N= 90) and those collected in wave 2 (N= 50) to investigate whether there were significant 
differences which would require a separate analysis for each data set. However, as the quotes 
collected over time were consistent with each other, I decided to treat them as a single data 
set.
<<<PAGE=146>>>
130 
With data consisting of statements, thematic analysis was chosen as appropriate analytic 
method. As reported by Braun and Clarke (2006, pp. 79), ‘thematic analysis is a method for 
identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes) within data.’, and in being applicable 
to a range of theoretical and epistemological approaches, is congruent with the positivist 
paradigm adopted in this research. Accordingly, qualitative data analysis followed an 
objectivist orientation. In this respect, thematic analysis was adopted as ‘essentialist or realist 
method, which reports experiences, meanings and the reality of participants’ (Braun and 
Clarke, 2006, pp. 81), assuming a straightforward link between language and experience. 
The process was driven by the research question guiding the study and focused on the 
semantic or explicit level of the data.  
In so doing, I followed the step- by-step guide advanced by Braun and Clarke (2006) and 
analysed the data with the following procedure: 
- I familiarised myself with the data, reading the scripts several times and generating 
an initial list of ideas of interesting themes.  
- Secondly, I coded segments of the data on the basis of semantic content and guided 
by the theoretical framework of the study. In so doing, I coded for features of the 
data related to the apprenticeship training, the work environment and the HR system. 
Once all data extracts were coded, I collated them together under specific codes.  
- Thirdly, I collated codes along with the relevant data extract into themes. This 
process was theoretically-driven and resulted in the identification of several themes. 
- Fourthly, following a revision process in which some themes were merged and others 
deleted, I identified six main themes with related subthemes (Table 4.3).  
- Guided by the theoretical framework, themes were defined and named. Some of the 
themes contained sub-themes, which were particularly useful for clearly presenting 
and analysing themes encompassing various dimensions such as informal learning.  
- Whilst the analysis of the entire data set identified six main themes, the findings 
reported and discussed relate only to five of these: formal learning; informal learning; 
feeling valued; end-state competencies; HRM. In so doing, a detailed account of 
themes strongly linked to the research question was adopted instead of a broad 
representation of the overall data set.

Chapter 5 
Testing the apprenticeship development model: how formal and 
informal learning contribute to competence development  
 
 
5.1 Introduction  
This chapter reports the results of two studies testing the validity of the apprenticeship 
development model. A number of statistical data analysis techniques supplemented by 
qualitative data was used to test the study’s hypotheses. The first section of the chapter 
reports the results of Study 1 cross-sectional analysis complemented by qualitative findings. 
The second section reports the results of Study 2 longitudinal analysis based on panel data.  
 
5.2 Study 1: cross-sectional data analysis  
The first study aims to investigate the association between the apprenticeship development 
model and apprentices’ end-state competencies. Specifically, the study seeks to empirically 
test the apprenticeship development model advanced in Chapter 2 demonstrating the 
association between formal and informal learning factors and apprentices’ competencies 
categorised as technical knowledge, job competence and work and business skills.  
To this end, data was collected from a sample of 233 apprentices providing rich information 
on apprentices’ perceptions on the quality of the programme and self -performance ratings. 
In line with the hypotheses advanced in Chapter 2, this study tests the association of formal 
training factors with apprentices’ technical knowledge and the association of informal 
learning factors with apprentices’ job competence and work and business skills.  
5.2.1 The association between formal training and apprentices’ competencies  
Exploratory Factor Analysis 
Before considering the proposed relationships (Hypotheses H1a, H1b, H1c, H1d, H1e), the 
accuracy of the measurement model was examined. PCA followed by varimax rotation was 
performed on 25 survey items relating to the formal training constructs and to the training 
transfer construct. Kaiser measure of sample adequacy (KMO) for the data set was .872, 
exceeding the recommended value of .6 (Kaiser, 1970, 1974) and Bartlett’s Test of 
Sphericity (Bartlett, 1954) was significant, indicating that the data set was appropriate for 
factor analysis.  
Initial examination of eigenvalues greater than one suggested the presence of five factors, 
accounting for 62.6% of the total variance. As reported in Table 5.1, varimax rotation 
revealed a clear structure with each rotated component loading above, or very close to, the
<<<PAGE=149>>>
133 
critical value .45 (Hair et al., 2014). Inspection of the rotated component matrix revealed 
that loadings on major factors ranged from .83 to .44, with few items loading weakly and 
loading on more than one factor. Item 1 and item 2 measuring opportunity to use were found 
to cross-load weakly (less than .5) on factors of transfer design and supervisor feedback 
respectively, hindering the model interpretability. 
Whilst the theoretical model anticipated the presence of six factors, statistical analysis did 
not identify a sixth factor with the 2 items measuring opportunity to use. When considering 
the failure of the opportunity to use construct to emerge from PCA, Raubenheimer (2004) 
suggests that the number of items per factor is pivotal, with at least four items required for 
the identification of a one-factor scale. The scholar argues that in multidimensional scales a 
minimum of three items ought to load significantly on each factor in order for all the 
subscales to be successfully identified, reporting that only exceptionally scales with more 
than one factor may be identified with only two items per factor.  
However, maintaining that theory should guide the decision related to the number of 
underlying factors (Hair et al., 2014), and given that the content of the two items making up 
the opportunity to use scale is commensurate with the theoretical construct represented (i.e. 
Holton et al., 2000; Seyler et al., 1998), the two items have not been discarded for further 
analysis.  
Constructs validity  
Overall the results of PCA are consistent with the extant literature and allow a parsimonious 
representation of the factors under investigation. The final instrument retains 25 items 
assessing six constructs closely aligned with the theoretical model anticipated. As reported 
in Table 5.1, factor 1 loads items related to training transfer; factor 2 loads items related to 
supervisor support; factor 3 loads items related to transfer design; factor 4 loads items related 
to supervisor feedback; factor 5 loads items related to colleagues feedback. As previously 
discussed, a sixth factor did not emerge however opportunity to use  was retained as sixth 
factor given that it is a theoretically valid construct.  
Reliability coefficients for the constructs are reported in the diagonal of Table 5.2. As argued 
by Churchill et al. (1974), alpha coefficients are useful in providing a summary measure of 
the homogeneity of a set of variables, with high alpha coefficient indicating that the variables 
included relate to a single underlying construct, validating internal reliability. Cronbach 
alpha reliability is satisfactory for most constructs, with only the scales measuring 
colleagues’ feedback (α= .51) and opportunity to use (α= .50) below .70.

When considering the internal reliability of these measures, it is apparent that as Cronbach’s 
alpha is in positive relationship with the number of items in the scale (Hair et al., 2014), 
scales containing few items commonly yield low reliability values. As reported by Pallant 
(2010) scales with less than ten items normally report reliability in the range of .50.  In 
addition, the low reliability of the constructs may be ascribed to the fact that the scales were 
originally developed for different contexts and different populations. The study conducted 
by Diamantidis and Chatzoglou (2014) researched professionals with over ten years of 
experience, employed full time in a variety of organisations, whilst the population of this 
study is made of apprentices with less than 3 years of experience who are emergent 
professionals.  
Although low reliab ility can potentially impact a measure’s relationship with other 
constructs, the constructs of colleagues’ feedback and opportunity to use, being theoretically 
grounded, have been retained for completeness’ purposes, as previously done in other studies 
(i.e. Behrman and Perreault, 1984).   
Checks for common method variance 
Given that data were collected at the same point in time and from a single data source, some 
measures were taken to minimise the possible effects of common-method variance. Firstly, 
as done in other studies some items in the survey were reversed coded and different anchors 
were adopted to measure different constructs (Aulakh and Gencturk, 2000). Secondly, 
Harman’s one-factor test using varimax rotation was performed on the variables of interest 
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). The results showed 5 factors with eigenvalues greater than 
one accounting for 62.6% of variance. With the first factor accounting for 31.9% of total 
variance (less than 50%), common method variance was not identified as problematic.  
Added to this, Fuller, Simmering, Atinc and colleagues (2015) presented evidence through 
a data simulation study that common method bias occurs only at relatively high levels of 
common method variance, whilst low and moderate levels of common method variance do 
not inflate correlations. The scholars maintain that although certain levels of common 
method variance are typical in survey research this is generally low, not invalidating the 
findings. Accordingly, common method bias was not deemed problematic.
<<<PAGE=152>>>
136 
Hypothesis testing: the relationship between formal training and technical knowledge  
Means, standard deviations and correlations are presented in Table 5.2. Descriptive statistics 
indicate that apprentices have an adequate perception of transfer design (Mean= 3.53), 
opportunity to use (Mean= 3.57) and supervisor support (Mean= 3.68). Respondents report 
a moderate perception of supervisor feedback (Mean= 3.22) and colleagues feedback 
(Mean= 3.37). Apprentices self-assess their technical knowledge (training transfer) as a 
result of formal training as acceptable (Mean= 3.60).  
When exploring the correlations between predictors and the dependent variable a large 
positive correlation is observed between transfer design and training transfer (r= .50, p< .01), 
and between opportunity to use and training transfer (r= .51, p< .01); A medium positive 
correlation is observed between supervisor support and training transfer (r= .39, p< .01), 
whilst supervisor feedback and colleagues feedback present small positive correlations with 
transfer (r= .25, p< .01; r= .22, p< .01 respectively). When considering the control variables, 
tenure presents a small negative correlation with transfer (r= -.14, p< .05), indicating that the 
longer apprentices are employed in the organisation, the less relevant the formal training 
becomes for their performance. In general, results indicate that all independent variables are 
positively and significantly related with training transfer, providing preliminary support for 
the relationship suggested.  
Additionally, the independent variables present positive correlations, with transfer design 
having a large correlation with opportunity to use (r= .54, p< .01), and medium correlations 
with colleagues’ feedback (r= .32, p < .01) and supervisor support (r= .35, p< .01). 
Colleagues’ feedback presents medium correlations with supervisor feedback (r= .44, p < 
.01), supervisor support (r= .44, p< .01) and opportunity to use (r= .30, p< .01). Supervisor 
support presents medium correlations with opportunity to use (r= .38, p< .01) and supervisor 
feedback (r= .37, p< .01). Small negative correlations are present between transfer design 
and tenure (r= -.16, p< .05) and between supervisor support and tenure (r= -.27, p< .01). 
Contract is significantly and positively correlated with opportunity to use (r= .15, p< .05).
<<<PAGE=153>>>
137 
Results 
Hierarchical regression was used to test the proposed hypotheses. As reported in Table 5.3, 
the control variables do not significantly predict transfer of training. The results of step 1 
show that transfer design significantly predicts transfer of training (β= .48, p< .01). The 
results of step 2 show that supervisor support significantly predicts transfer of training (β= 
.24, p< .01), however supervisor feedback and colleagues feedback entered at step 3 and step 
4 respectively, do not account for a significant proportion of variance in training transfer. 
Ultimately, results of step 5 show that opportunity to use significantly predicts transfer of 
training (β= .28, p< .01). Overa ll, these variables explain 36.7% of the total variance in 
transfer of training. 
 
Summary of results 
On the basis of the results obtained from the analysis conducted above the following can be 
concluded.  
Hypothesis 1a is confirmed: transfer design is associated with technical knowledge 
Hypothesis 1b is confirmed: supervisor support is associated with technical knowledge 
Hypothesis 1c is not confirmed: supervisor’s feedback is not significantly associated with 
technical knowledge  
Hypothesis 1d is not confi rmed: colleagues’ feedback is not significantly associated with 
technical knowledge  
Hypothesis 1e is confirmed: the opportunity to use the knowledge and skills acquired in 
formal training is associated with technical knowledge

5.2.2 The association between informal learning and apprentices’ competencies 
 Before considering the proposed relationships (Hypotheses H2a, H2b, H2c, H2d, H2e, H2f), 
the accuracy of the measurement model has been examined. Exploratory factor analysis 
(EFA) was conducted on 28 survey items measuring the constructs of social support, 
feedback, problem solving, experimenting, task autonomy and task interdependence.  
Exploratory Factor Analysis 
The 28 items were subjected to principal component analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin 
value was .807, exceeding the recommended value of .6 (Kaiser, 1970, 1974) and Bartlett’s 
Test of Sphericity (Bartlett, 1954) reached statistical significance, supporting the 
factorability of the correlation matrix. PCA revealed the presence of eight components with 
eigenvalues exceeding 1, explaining 23%, 12%, 8.5%, 6.4%, 5.2%, 4.5%, 4%, 3.6% of the 
variance respectively. As this solution was far from the hypothesised factors, the data was 
further reviewed. An inspection of the rotated solution revealed that some of the items of the 
scales representing task autonomy  and  task interdependence  loaded on two factors 
respectively, resulting in an uninterpretable solution.  
Guided by the conceptual framework underlying the set of variables, a six-factor solution 
was forced, explaining 59.6% of variance. Inspection of the rotated solution revealed several 
cross-loadings, with item 5 measuring task autonomy and item 4 measuring social support, 
loading weakly (less than .50) on two factors. Deletion of these items resulted in an improved 
6-factor solution, which however presented item 7 measuring task interdependence to cross-
load weakly on three factors. This item was therefore removed and a 6-factor solution was 
reconsidered.  
This resulted in a model explaining 64.3% of variance, presenting a satisfactory criterion for 
the number of factors extracted (Hair et al., 2014). The six factor solution reflected the 
theoretical model anticipated and was therefore retained. As reported in Table 5.4, varimax 
rotation revealed a clear structure with each rotated component loading above the critical 
value of .50; the only exception is item 1 measuring experimenting, loading on three factors. 
As the item loaded at .486 on the construct representing experimenting, it was retained as 
the loading was considered close enough to the cut-off of .50.

Constructs validity  
Overall the results of PCA are consistent with the extant literature and allow a parsimonious 
representation of the factors under investigation. The final instrument retains 25 items 
assessing six constructs closely aligned with the theoretical model anticipated. As reported 
in Table 7, factor 1 loads items related to social support; factor 2 loads items related to task 
interdependence; factor 3 loads items related to problem solving; factor 4 loads items related 
to feedback; factor 5 loads items related to task autonomy, and factor 6 loads items related 
to experimenting.   
When considering the items deleted, it is apparent that these did not seem relevant for the 
sample under investigation. Item 5 measuring task autonomy  asked to rate the level of 
influence on the time apprentices started or finished their working day.  Item 7 measuring 
task interdependence  asked how often apprentices worked by themselves, whilst item 4 
measuring social support rated  how apprentices felt that their supervisors were concerned 
about the welfare of other people working for them. The irrelevance of these items for the 
apprentices’ sample suggests that as a junior category of employees, apprentices do not have 
discretion on their working hours, and tend not to work in isolation. Additionally, the 
supervisor’s concern for the welfare of others does not appear as germane with regards to 
how apprentices’ feel supported. 
Given the exploratory approach taken in the data collection instrument, which relied on work 
design and learning measurements as indicators of the quality of the learning environment, 
EFA has confirmed the suitability of these constructs in the context of the apprenticeship.  
Cronbach alpha reliability is satisfactory for all constructs, above the 0.6 threshold (Hair et 
al., 2014; Malhotra, 1999) for all factors, and is reported in the diagonal of Table 5.5.  
Checks for common method variance 
In order to address the issue of common method variance, Harman’s one -factor test 
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986) was performed using varimax rotation. The result identified 14 
factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 accounting for 70.7% of variance and the first factor 
accounting for 21.4% of total variance. As reported by van Rijn, Yang and Sanders (2013), 
researchers have suggested that if the first factor accounts for 20 to 25% of total variance, 
common method variance should not be a concern (i.e. Aulakh and Gencturk, 2003; Tansky 
and Cohen, 2001). Accordingly, common method variance was not deemed problematic.

Hypothesis testing: the relationship between informal learning and job competence and 
work and business skills  
Means, standard deviations and correlations are presented in Table 5.5. Descriptive statistics 
indicate that apprentices have a positively high perception of social support (Mean= 4.29), 
problem solving (Mean= 4.00), experimenting (Mean= 3.86) and task autonomy (Mean= 
3.06). Apprentices report a moderate perception of feedback (Mean= 3.62) and task 
interdependence (Mean= 3.58).  
When considering apprentices’ performance, respondents report high  levels of proficiency 
in conducting their job (individual task proficiency: Mean= 4.26), and in operating as part 
of a team (team member proficiency: Mean= 4.25). Apprentices indicate good levels of 
adaptivity at individual, team and organisational level (individual task adaptivity: Mean= 
4.06; team member adaptivity: Mean= 4.02; organisation member adaptivity: Mean= 3.95), 
whilst the lowest scores were reported for proactivitiy (individual task proactivity: Mean= 
3.53; team member proactivity: Mean= 3.05; organisation member proactivity: Mean= 2.76).  
The results suggest that apprentices are equipped with the functional skills required to deliver 
the job and are well engaged in team working. Their adaptivity, as in the ability to cope with 
change and deal with challenges is adequate, whilst their proactivity, reflecting creative 
thinking skills is less developed.  
When exploring the relationship between predictors and the criterions, the overall 
correlations pattern suggests that the informal learning factors are important for all the 
proposed performance outcomes. In particular, social support and feedback present the 
strongest associations with proficiency performance measures (social support and individual 
task proficiency: r= .36, p< .01; social support and team member proficiency: r= .30, p< .01; 
social support and organisation member proficiency: r= .41, p< .01; feedback and 
organisation member proficiency: r= .40, p< .01).  
When considering the associations between the informal learning factors, problem solving 
and experimenting present medium positive correlations with social support and feedback 
(problem solving and feedback: r= .31, p< .01; experimenting and social support: r= .39, p< 
.01; experimenting and feedback: r= .46, p< .01). Additionally, task autonomy, presents 
small positive correlations with problem solving (r= .24, p< .01) and experimenting (r= .21, 
p< .01). Ultimately, task interdependence presents small positive correlations with social 
support (r= .17, p< .05) and problem solving (r= .24, p< .01).
<<<PAGE=160>>>
144 
Negative correlations are present among tenure and social support (r= -.19, p< .01), feedback 
(r= -.24, p< .01), and experimenting (r= -.22, p< .01). On the other hand, task 
interdependence and task autonomy are positively correlated with tenure (r= .38, p< .01; r= 
.19, p< .01 respectively). Apprenticeship level is also positively associated with social 
support (r= .22, p< .01), whilst age is correlated with task interdependence (r= .36, p< .01) 
and task autonomy (r= .19, p< .01).  
Results  
Hierarchical regression was used to test the proposed hypotheses. Results of the final step of 
each regression analysis along with the R² are presented in Table 5.6.  The results indicate 
that social support is significantly and positively associated with a range of performance 
behaviours, including apprentices’ proficiency at conducting their job (individual task 
proficiency: β= .37, p< .01), proficiency in operating as part of a team (team member 
proficiency: β= .20, p< .05) and proficiency in operating as valid members of the 
organisation (organisation member proficiency: β= .31, p< .01). Additionally, social support 
is significantly and positively associated with adaptivity in relation to changes affecting ones 
job (individual task adaptivity: β= .24, p< .05) and with adaptivity in relation to changes to 
the way the organisation operates (organisation member adaptivity: β= .28, p< .01). 
Similarly, feedback is positively associated with proficiency at conducting ones job 
(individual task proficiency: β= .19, p< .05) and proficiency as members of the organisation 
(organisation member proficiency: β= .28, p< .01). Feedback is significantly and positively 
associated with adaptivity in relation to changes at the team level (team member adaptivity: 
β= .18, p< .05). Moreover, feedback is significantly correlated with apprentices displaying 
proactivity in relation to one’s job (individual task proactivity: β= .25, p< .01) and in 
contributing to the team effectiveness (team member proactivity: β= .24, p< .01). 
Problem solving and experimenting do not present any significant association with the 
criterions. Task autonomy is positively and significantly associated with apprentices 
displaying adaptivity to changes at organisational level (organisation member adaptivity: β= 
.16, p< .05) and with apprentices displaying proactivity in conducting ones job (individual 
task proactivity: β= .19, p< .01) and in contributing to the organisation effectiveness 
(organisation member proactivity: β= .24, p< .01).

Ultimately, task interdependence is positively and significantly associated with proficiency 
in conducting ones job (individual task proficiency: β= .17, p< .05) and proficiency in 
operating as part of a team (team member proficiency: β= .25, p< .01). Additionally, task 
interdependence is positively and significantly associated with adaptivity in relation to 
changes at team level (team member adaptivity: β= .26, p< .01). 
When considering the control variables, level is significantly and negatively correlated with 
individual task proficiency (β= -.16, p< .05) suggesting that apprentices studying towards 
higher qualifications (level 4 and above) report lower levels of proficiency in conducting 
their job. Similarly, age is significantly and negatively correlated with team member 
proficiency (β= -.21, p< .01) and with org anisation member adaptivity (β= -.20, p< .05) 
suggesting that older apprentices report lower levels of proficiency in operating as part of a 
team, and lower levels of adaptivity in relation to changes affecting the organisation.

5.3 Qualitative data analysis  
Qualitative data was collected via an open question positioned at the end of the survey. This 
gave respondents the opportunity to comment on any topic they felt relevant. By not 
presenting apprentices with a specific question, but by inviting them to discuss what they 
felt relevant, rich data was collected on the apprenticeship experience. The quotations 
provide further insight into factors enhancing competence development and complement 
Study 1 cross-sectional analysis supporting the apprenticeship development model.  
Formal learning  
Among the themes identified in the apprentices’ quotes, the quality and relevance of formal 
training is dominant. The majority of respondents comment on the training received at 
college, at the company’s training academy and at university presenting various levels of 
satisfaction with training ranging from poor, unorganised, to excellent and outstanding. 
Despite variability in satisfaction, examination of the quotes clearly suggest that apprentices 
value both the quality and relevance of training, with most remarks considering  whether the 
training is applicable, relevant, current, and valuable.  
This finding validates the results of the quantitative analysis which has identified transfer 
design in positive association with apprentices’ technical knowledge, and substantiates the 
validity of transfer design in apprenticeships indicating that formal training needs to match 
job requirements (i.e. being relevant, current, valuable), and provide apprentices with the 
ability to transfer it to the job (i.e. applicable).  
When considering the work environment factors supporting training transfer only three 
respondents comment directly on factors facilitating the application of knowledge and skills 
acquired off-the-job:  
‘Although I enjoy what we learn at university generally (Materials engineering), very li ttle can 
be applied back to my work directly and there is not that much emphasis on applying it back at work.’ 
 
‘Most courses are relevant and can have an impact on the way I work but little is done in the 
actual workplace to encourage sharing of the new skills/knowledge from a course and how it can be 
implemented’. 
 
‘Sometimes it can be difficult with the amount of work you and your supervisor have, to properly 
reflect on training and skills identified at university and apply these in the workplace. A lthough most 
people I have worked with are advocates of new ideas and are generally up for trying new methods.’ 
 
Whilst not a prevalent theme, these quotes substantiate the importance of workplace support 
factors such as the opportunity to reflect with supervisors and share knowledge and skills 
with colleagues in sustaining training transfer. As discussed in the following section, the
<<<PAGE=165>>>
149 
quality of the learn ing environment in supporting apprentices’ development dominates 
apprentices’ statements and emerges as critical for emergent professionals.  
Informal learning 
Among the other themes identified: developmental opportunities, a supportive learning 
environment and level of responsibility are highly relevant. With regards to the former, 
examination of the quotes indicates that apprentices see challenges and novel tasks as 
positive developmental experiences. As exemplified in the following quote there is a distinct 
link between challenges and learning: 
‘My day job has given me far more responsibility than I thought an apprentice would get and has  been 
very challenging at times. This has triggered a response towards learning for me so I feel I have good 
experience and skills possibly better than I expected.’ 
Challenges are reported to ‘push oneself’ to develop personally, technically and 
academically, and are associated with improved knowledge and performance, indicating that 
apprentices identify novel and challenging tasks as contributing to their skillset. Other 
factors associated with learning are ‘opportunities to do new things’, ‘taking on 
developmental roles’, ‘experiencing new things’ and ‘opportunities to improve’. When 
considering apprentices’ viewpoint, th e quotes depict positive experiences indicating that 
apprentices enjoy and welcome challenges as developmental opportunities. Additionally, as 
exemplified by the following quotes, the level of challenge is counterbalanced by appropriate 
support and autonomy facilitating constructive learning experiences: 
 ‘It is great to be fully involved into a project. You are given your own part of that project and are 
expected to finish it on time, with the help of peers and other resources.’ 
 
 ‘The responsibility given during work placements was at a level at which you can learn but are 
not left to just fend for yourself.’ 
 
The level of responsibility is reflective of apprentices’ autonomy in carrying out their tasks 
and emerges as critical factor for sustaining apprent ices’ engagement in informal learning. 
Correspondingly, support from both colleagues and supervisors is crucial for ensuring a 
positive learning experience. Specifically, when considering apprentices’ illustration of the 
learning environment, support from supervisors is presented as ‘support for development’ as 
in enabling apprentices to engage with developmental opportunities as challenging and novel 
tasks, as clearly exemplified in the following quotes: 
‘Overall I am an advocate of the scheme but feel apprentices could be better supported when in 
placements with more focus on their development, sometimes it feels like we are perceived as an  
opportunity to fill gaps in the workforce.’
<<<PAGE=166>>>
150 
‘There are some placements which do not encourage apprentices to learn in  ways such as 
challenging assignments or interesting engagements and where apprentices are used more as an extra 
resource over someone who is exposed to critical projects/areas. However, there are placements where 
this is not the case.’ 
Whilst support from supervisors is crucial in providing apprentices with developmental 
opportunities, support from colleagues emerges as critical for assisting apprentices with their 
development. Apprentices describe how they feel ‘welcomed’, ‘well looked after’ and 
‘comfortable to ask for advice and feedback’. Additionally, support from colleagues emerges 
as paramount in ‘providing insight into their role’, ‘lending you their knowledge’ and 
‘showing you how to do the job and being patient with you during training’. The role of 
colleagues is thus presented as allowing apprentices to become legitimate peripheral 
participants having access to the practices of the community (Lave and Wenger, 1991), and 
assisting apprentices as new learners in developing knowledge and skills.  
Overall, the findings support the Demand-Control-Support-Model (Karasek and Theorell, 
1990) revealing that when apprentices are exposed to developmental opportunities 
(Demand) and are granted responsibility (Control) in a supportive learning environment 
(Support), they are able to learn and develop a wide range of skills. Notably, apprentices 
report gaining ‘breadth of knowledge’ and ‘invaluable skills’, ‘building up character, 
confidence and experience’ in turn contributing to their performance.  
Ultimately, whilst learning is pervasive throughout the quotes generally supporting the 
apprenticeship development model advanced in this research, Karasek and Theorell (1990) 
argue that an optimal balance between factors of demand, control and support is required for 
activating and sustaining learning. This is exemplified in the following quote, drawing 
attention to the pivotal role of supervisors in presenting apprentices with the right level of 
challenge and responsibility: 
‘My experience as an apprentice has been q uite varied. Most managers have taken the time to plan my 
workload to meet my development needs. Some have seen me as extra ‘expert’ resource and expected me 
to be at a level way higher than my ability and become frustrated when I have failed t o meet their 
standards. The opposite has been true with others who have not trusted me to perform anything other than 
basic tasks. My experience could have been improved if more people across the business knew what a 
higher apprenticeship was, what it entailed and the entry requirements.’ 
 
Whilst practical and theoretical implications will be discussed in the forthcoming chapter, 
analysis of qualitative data has validated and enriched the apprenticeship development model 
in several ways. Firstly, the quality and relevance of formal training has been confirmed as 
pivotal for apprentices’ development. Secondly, a focus on the work environment has been
<<<PAGE=167>>>
151 
justified by apprentices extensively discussing how supportive, challenging and empowering 
work situations contribute to the development of a wide range of skills. Thirdly, close 
inspection of apprentices’ comments has revealed how support from supervisors and support 
from colleagues distinctively contributes to their development.   Lastly, apprentices’ reports 
of a wide range of knowledge and skills acquired through formal and informal learning has 
endorsed the apprenticeship as valid tool for human capital development, shedding light on 
focal aspects sustaining competence development.  
 
5.4 Study 2: Longitudinal data analysis  
This study seeks to more explicitly determine the causal link between formal and informal 
learning in apprenticeship and the development of apprentices’ competencies. A particular 
strength of this study is the availability of data collected over time, providing insight into 
how individuals change over time. Panel data (N=90) collected in two assessment spaced 
eight to ten months apart allow to determine the extent of change from an initial baseline 
assessment. In addition, panel data allow to draw preliminary inferences about causality 
investigating the determinants of change.  
Paired-sample T-test  
In order to explore the rate of change over time, a T-test was performed. Paired-sample T-
test are used to compare means scores for the same group of people on two different 
occasions. As reported in Table 5.7, inspection of the data reveals that the mean scores of 
the variables under consideration did not change substantially over time, but remained stable. 
However, when considering the formal learning factors there was a statistically significant 
decrease in supervisor support scores from Time 1 (Mean = 3.79, SD = .65) to Time 2 (Mean 
= 3.54, SD = .86), suggesting that with time apprentices experience less support from 
supervisors in transferring the knowledge and skills acquired off-the-job to the workplace. 
Similarly, there was a statistically significant decrease in training transfer scores from Time 
1 (Mean = 3.64, SD = .75) to Time 2 (Mean = 3.22, SD = 1.19), indicating that with time 
apprentices tend to make less use of the knowledge and skills acquired off-the-job in the 
workplace. Conversely, data revealed a statistically significant increase in apprentices 
displaying proactivity at team level, with team member proactivity scores significantly 
increasing from Time 1 (Mean = 2.95, SD = 1.03) to Time 2 (Mean = 3.29, SD = 1.19).

A longitudinal examination of the impact of formal training on apprentices’ 
competencies  
Following the principles of change score models (Bednall, 2013), longitudinal data was 
analysed performing the autoregressive relationship of performance at Time 2 on its baseline 
assessment at Time 1. In testing the hypotheses, I entered the controls (level) and the Time 
1 assessment for the criterion in step 1, followed by the hypothesised predictors. Hence, 
transfer design was entered at step 2; supervisor support at step 3; supervisor feedback at 
step 4; colleagues’ feedback at step 5; and opportunity to use at step 6.  
Results  
When considering the imp act of formal training on apprentices’ technical knowledge, the 
correlation between training transfer at Time 1 and training transfer at Time 2 is small and 
non-significant. Additionally, as reported in Table 5.8, the criterion (training transfer T2) is 
not significantly correlated with any of the predictors at Time 1. This lack of correlation i s 
reflected in the hierarchical regression results which are non-significant, indicating that the 
model of formal training fails to predict training transfer at Time 2 (Table 5.9).

A longitudinal examination of the impact of informal learning on apprentices’ 
competencies 
The same procedure was adopted for analysing data related to the impact of informal learning 
on apprentices job competence and work and business skills.  Hierarchical regression 
analyses were conducted controlling for level and performance at Time 1.  In step 1 social 
support was entered, followed by feedback in step 2. In step 3 problem solving was entered 
and experimenting was entered in step 4. Finally, task autonomy was entered in step 5 
followed by task interdependence in step 6. 
Results  
As reported in Table 5.10, a large number of significant small and medium correlations 
between performance behaviours at Time 1 and Time 2 is observed. Specifically, individual 
task proficiency at Time 1 (r= .43, p< .01), individual task adaptivity at Time 1 (r= .48, p< 
.01) and team member adaptivity at Time 1 (r= .35, p< .01) are moderately correlated with 
their counterpart at Time 2. With the exception of individual task proactivity at Time 1 which
<<<PAGE=171>>>
155 
is not significantly correlated with its counterpart at Time 2, all the other performance 
behaviours have small correlations with their counterparts at Time 2. 
When considering the correlations between the predictors and the criterions (performance 
behaviours at time 2), social support is significantly and positively correlated with the ability 
to perform ones job (individual task proficiency: r= .35, p< .01), and with adaptivity at team 
and organisational level (team member adaptivity: r= .26, p< .05; organisation member 
adaptivity: r= .23, p< .05). Problem solving is also significantly and positively correlated 
with the ability to adapt to changes affecting the team and the organisation (team member 
adaptivity: r= .24, p< .05; organisation member adaptivity: r= .29, p< .01). Additionally, 
problem solving is significantly correlated with proactivity in improving the effectiveness 
of the team (team member proactivity: r= .27, p< .05), and with behaviours contributing to 
the effectiveness of the organisation (organisation member proficiency: r= .25, p< .05). 
Feedback is positively correlated with the ability to perform the job (individual task 
proficiency: r= .27, p< .05) and with proactivity in initiating better ways of doing ones job 
(individual task proactivity: r= .25, p< .05). When considering the control variables, age is 
significantly and negatively correlated with organisation member proactivity (r= .28, p< .01) 
indicating that older apprentices are less likely to engage in self-directed behaviours aimed 
at improving the efficiency of the organisation. Correlations are reported in Table 5.11. 
Hierarchical regression analysis results indicate that performance at Time 1 is the only 
significant predictor of individual task proficiency (β= .33, p< .05), individual task adaptivity 
(β= .52, p< .01) and team member adaptivity (β= .32, p< .05) at Time 2. When considering 
the hypothesised predictors, feedback is positively and significantly associated with 
apprentices exhibiting proactivity in initiating better ways of doing core tasks (individual 
task proactivity: β= .31, p< .05). Similarly, problem solving is significantly and positively 
associated with proactivity in advancing suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the 
organisation (organisation member proactivity: β= .29, p< .05) and with adaptivity to 
changes affecting the way the organisation operates (organisation member adaptivity: β= 
.29, p< .05). The other predictors are not significantly associated with performance at Time 
2. Results of the final step of each regression analysis along with the R² are presented in 
Table 5.12.

Summary of results  
On the basis of the results obtained from the longitudinal data analysis, we can confidently 
conclude that: 
- The availability of feedback in the workplace from both colleagues and supervisors 
contributes to the development of work and business skills such as creative thinking 
in performing ones tasks.  
- Problem solving leads to work and business skills such as self-management and 
creative thinking in contributing to the organisation effectiveness.

5.5 Chapter summary and conclusion 
This chapter has presented the results of two studies empirically testing the apprenticeship 
development model advanced in Chapter 2. Overall, the findings provide compelling support 
for the apprenticeship development model indicating that both formal and informal learning 
contribute to apprentices’ competencies. With regards to the former, transfer design, 
supervisor support and opportunity to use the knowledge and skills acquired in formal 
training are associated with apprentices transferring technical knowledge to the workplace. 
Given that transfer design accounts for most variance in training transfer, this factor calls for 
particular consideration. Additionally, the role of the supervisor is important in assisting 
apprentices with transferring the knowledge acquired at college and university and in 
providing them with opportunities for applying such knowledge in the workplace.  
When considering the factors supporting apprentices’ engagement in informal learning, 
results of Study 1 cross-sectional analysis confirm the significance of social support and 
feedback in contributing to apprentices’ job competence and work and business skills, whilst 
task autonomy is associated only with work and business skills. Surprisingly, problem 
solving and experimenting are not associated with apprentices’ competencies, however 
inspection of qualitative data reveals that these factors are relevant for apprentices. 
Apprentices’ statements clearly indicate a link between challenging tasks and learning, 
suggesting that although the cross-sectional analysis did not find problem solving and 
experimenting to be significant, these factors should not be discarded.  
Additionally, the results present preliminary evidence of the significance of task 
interdependence as structural factor in contributing to both apprentices’ job competence and 
work and business skills. Generally, the results of Study 1 cross-sectional analysis 
complemented by qualitative data present strong insight into the training intervention and 
work environment factors contributing to particular apprentices’ competencies. 
Notably, whilst Study 1 cross-sectional analysis sought to investigate the association 
between the apprenticeship development model and resultant competencies, Study 2 
longitudinal analysis sought to more explicitly determine a causal link between the two. 
Considering the results, although in Study 1 cross-sectional analysis an association is 
apparent between most training intervention and work environment factors and apprentices’ 
performance-based competencies, this association disappears in Study 2 longitudinal 
analysis once previous performance levels are taken into account. However, whilst the 
results of Study 2 longitudinal analysis do not present sufficient evidence to prove that the
<<<PAGE=177>>>
161 
 
factors investigated cause apprentices’ competence development, these results do not 
dismiss the findings of Study 1 cross-sectional analysis.  
Given that prior levels of performance are identified as main significant predictors in Study 
2 longitudinal analysis, there is the possibility that the effects of training intervention and 
work environment factors may have already accrued, hence being apparent in Study 1 cross-
sectional analysis but not in Study 2 longitudinal analysis. As discussed by Guest, Michie, 
Conway and Sheehan (2003) if the gains from implementing HR practices have already 
accrued, no further change will be detected when exploring causal relationships over time.  
Additionally, problem solving, non-significant in Study 1 cross-sectional analysis but 
significant in Study 2 longitudinal analysis when controlling for prior performance levels, 
may suggest that the effects of this factor become apparent over time. This finding is 
consistent with research examining how long the effects of HR practices take to emerge 
resulting in performance improvements. In a longitudinal study on the effects of HR 
practices on company productivity, Birdi, Clegg, Patterson and others (2008) found 
compelling evidence that different time lags exist for specific HR practices before their 
effects translate to organisational performance. Whilst the effects of empowerment became 
evident from 1 to 4 years after implementation, the effects of teamworking took 6 to 9 years 
to result in productivity improvements. Although this study investigated the effects of HR 
practices on organisational performance it is reasonable to expect similar ti me lags for the 
effects of the apprenticeship factors on individual performance.  
Overall, the findings presented in this chapter are consistent with the theoretical model 
anticipated and on balance predominantly positive. Implications for theory and practice will 
be discussed next.

Chapter 6 
The role of the HRM system strength, performance appraisal 
and learning goal orientation in apprenticeship 
 
6.1 Introduction 
This chapter investigates the influence of contextual and individual boundary conditions on 
the apprenticeship development model. At contextual level, the role of the HRM system 
strength (Hypothesis 3) and PA (Hypothesis 4) in the apprenticeship learning process are 
tested. At individual level, the role of learning goal orientation (Hypothesis 5) is examined.  
In so doing, the chapter investigates whether such boundary conditions have an impact on 
the formal and informal learning factor s associated with apprentices’ competence 
development. Statistical analysis supplemented by qualitative data is used to test hypotheses.  
 
6.2 Hypothesis 3: the role of the HRM system strength in apprenticeship  
Preliminary analysis 
Before considering the moderating effect of the HRM system strength on the relationship 
between the apprenticeship training and performance behaviour-based competencies, some 
considerations are warranted. Whilst the cross-sectional sample resulted in 233 responses, a 
lower number of responses on the HRM system constructs of distinctiveness, consistency 
and consensus reduced the sample size for the moderation analysis to 84 observations. As 
indicated in Table 6.1, missing data in scales measuring distinctiveness, consistency and 
consensus resulted in a reduced sample when the scales were aggregated to compute an 
average measure of the HRM system strength.  
As the extent of missing data significantly exceeds the generally tolerated proportion of 
missing items below 10% (Peyre, Leplege and Coste, 2011), no imputation method was 
considered suitable and only complete cases were retained for the analysis. Furthermore, as 
the data are not missing at random but are rather concentrated on particular questions, further 
tests are required to exclude biased results. Following Tabachnick and Fidell (1989), a test 
of mean differences on variables of interest between those who did and those who did not 
report perceptions of the HRM system where conducted in order to establish any particular 
patterns in the missing data.

An independent-sample t-test was performed to compare performance scores for those who 
did and those who did not report perceptions of HRM system strength. As reported in Table 
6.2 there was no significant difference in scores for respondents and non-respondents, 
indicating no critical patterns associated with respondents’ reluctance to rate the H RM 
system. This analysis allowed to establish that no systematic association between missing 
and valid data is present, excluding the possibility of biased results.

Further inspection of the missing data revealed that respondents chose to answer ‘do not 
know’ when asked to rate t he HRM system, suggesting that the refusal to respond was due 
to no opinion or insufficient knowledge on the question (Hair et al., 2014). This finding is in 
line with the multivariate and qualitative analysis results discussed next pointing to the 
triviality of the HRM system for apprentices as particular category of employees.  
Data analysis: testing for moderation  
In testing for moderation the analysis considered the association between formal and 
informal learning respectively and apprentices’ competencies. In so doing, in this study four 
main moderated relationships were tested:  
- the interaction effect of the HRM system strength and formal learning on:  
1) training transfer 
- the interaction effect of the HRM system strength and informal learning on: 
2) Individual performance behaviours 
3) Team performance behaviours 
4) Organisation performance behaviours  
As previously discussed, the sample size for the analysis did not meet the recommended 
requirements of 15 participants for predictor (Stevens, 1996), however a complete model 
controlling for the effects of level, tenure and age is equally essential for valuable results.  
6.2.1 The association between formal training and apprentices’ competencies: the role 
of the HRM system strength  
In line with the hypotheses tested in Chapter 5 (H1a, H1b, H1c, H1d, H1e), this study 
investigates the association between formal training factors and training transfer as proxy 
for apprentices’ technical knowledge.  
Table 6.3 reports correlations and reliability coefficients for the constructs of interest. All 
variable scales exhibit acceptable reliability (α> .70) and significant correlations are 
observed between the predictors and the criterions. Whilst both formal and informal learning 
are positively and significantly correlated with all criterions, formal learning displays the 
largest correlation with training transfer (r= .55, p< .01), while informal learning displays 
the largest correlations with individual (r= .46, p< .01), team (r= .49, p< .01) and organisation 
(r= .41, p< .01) performance behaviours. The HRM system strength presents small 
significant correlations with formal learning (r= .27, p< .05), training transfer (r= .24, p< 
.05) and organisation performance behaviours (r= .28, p< .05). Of the control variables, 
tenure is negatively and significantly correlated with formal learning (r= -.20, p< .01); level
<<<PAGE=181>>>
165 
 
is positively and significantly correlated with informal learning (r= .15, p< .05), and age and 
tenure are significantly and negatively correlated with the HRM system strength (r= -. 26, 
p< .05; r= -.31, p< .01 respectively). Whilst the positive correlations between formal and 
informal learning with the criterions were expected, the small and non-significant 
correlations of the HRM system strength with the criterions along with the negative 
correlation with tenure and age were unanticipated.

Formal training and training transfer  
In order to test the moderating role of the HRM system strength, three models were 
considered. Based on Model 1, all control variables fail to predict transfer of knowledge 
acquired at college or university to the workplace. Model 2 indicates that formal training is 
positively and significantly associated with training transfer (β= .55, p< .01), whilst the 
HRM system strength is non-significant. Model 3 reveals that the HRM system strength does 
not moderate the relationship between formal training and training transfer as the interaction 
coefficient is non-significant (Table 6.4).
<<<PAGE=182>>>
166 
 
Notably, the relationship between formal training and performance is not influenced by 
HRM system strength, suggesting that the effects of training on performance for apprentices 
are likely to be independent of the HR system.

6.2.2 The association between informal learning and apprentices’ competencies: the 
role of the HRM system strength  
 
Informal learning and individual-, team-, organisation-performance behaviours  
In testing the influence of the HRM system strength on the association between informal 
learning and apprentices’ competencies, individual, team and organisation performance 
behaviours are regressed onto informal learning. As hypothesised in the apprenticeship 
development model, learning in the workplace contributes to developing the skills and 
behaviours required to perform a particular role (i.e. job competence) along with general and 
transferable skills required in any occupation (i.e. work and business skills).
<<<PAGE=183>>>
167 
 
As reported in Table 6.5, when considering individual performance behaviours, Model 1 
indicates that tenure, level and age are non-significant predictors; in Model 2 informal 
learning is significantly associated with the criterion (β= .54, p< .01), while t he interaction 
term in Model 3 is non-significant indicating that the HRM system strength does not 
moderate the relationship between informal learning and individual performance behaviours.  
Similarly, when considering team performance behaviours, the control variables in Model 1 
are non-significant and informal learning in Model 2 is significantly associated with the 
criterion (β= .50, p< .01); in Model 3 the interaction term is non -significant while informal 
learning and tenure are significantly associated with team performance behaviours (β= .46, 
p< .01; β= .41, p< .05 respectively).  
When considering organisation performance behaviours, in Model 1 age is significantly and 
negatively associated with the criterion (β= -.35, p<.05). In Model 2 age (β= -.36, p< .05), 
informal learning (β= .39 , p< .01) and the HRM system strength (β= .23, p˂ .05) are 
significant predictors, while Model 3 indicates that the interaction term between HR M 
system strength and informal learning is non-significant.  
In light of the HRM system strength being significant in relation to organisation performance 
behaviours (Model 2: β= .23, p<.05) (Table 6.5), further moderated regression analyses were 
conducted to explore whether the HRM system strength had an influence on the individual 
variables forming the informal learning construct. In testing the association of individual 
variables with specific organisation performance behaviours (i.e. proficiency, adaptivity, 
proactivity), the HRM system strength was found to significantly and negatively moderate 
the relationship between social support and organisation member proficiency.  
As reported in Table 6.6, Model 1 indicates that the control variables are not significant 
predictors. In Model 2 social support (β= .37, p< .01) and the HRM system strength (β= .30, 
p˂ .01) are significantly associated with organisation member proficiency. Model 3 indicates 
that the interaction term is significant (β= -.74, p< .05) hence the HRM system strength 
significantly and negatively moderates the relationship between social support and 
organisation member proficiency.

The negative interaction indicates a compensating effect whereby when the HRM system 
strength is low, social support exerts a stronger effect on organisation member proficiency, 
whilst when the HRM system strength is high, social support does not influence organisation 
member proficiency. This becomes evident when probing the interaction with the slope test 
which reveals that social support has a larger effect on organisation member proficiency at 
relatively low levels of the HRM system strength (β= 1.10, p< .01), and ceases to be 
significant at relatively high levels of the HRM system strength (Table 6.7).  
As organisation member proficiency resembles constructs of organisational loyalty and 
support (Griffin, Neal and Parker, 2007), the moderation suggests a compensation effect of 
social support for low levels of HRM system strength. Specifically, in situations of low HRM 
system strength, where apprentices do not perceive the HR message as intended by the 
organisation (i.e. the organisation valuing their development and wellbeing), social support 
more strongly contributes to apprentices engaging in behaviours that support the 
organisation’s effectiveness. 
Generally, informal learning contributes to individual, team and organisation performance 
behaviours and its effects are independent of the HRM system strength. As for formal 
training, the findings reveal that the HRM system strength does not influence the relationship 
between informal learning and performance, with the exception of the association between 
social support and organisation member proficiency. The latter appears to be the only 
outcome sensible to HRM, suggesting a compensation effect whereby social support 
contributes to organisation member proficiency when the HRM system strength is weak.

6.3 Qualitative data analysis  
Inspection of qualitative data provides further insight into the role of the HRM system 
strength in apprenticeships. Following the HR process approach (Ostroff and Bowen, 2000, 
2016; Bowen and Ostroff, 2004) the research analyses the communicative function of the 
HRM system, considering how implementation of HR practices allows apprentices to make 
confident attributions about the attitudes and behaviours expected by the organisation. As 
discussed by Bowen and Ostroff (2004), HRM systems characterised by high levels of 
distinctiveness, consistency and consensus lead to strong situations where messages are 
communicated clearly.  
Whilst it was hypothesised that a strong HRM system would make apprentices feel part of a 
high-quality employment relationship with the organisation (Tsui et al., 1997) portraying 
concern towards apprentices’ development and wellbeing and in turn augmenting the impact 
of the apprenticeship training on performance, the results of moderation analysis indicate 
that the effects of learning are independent of HRM.  
The findings indicate that the HRM system strength does not influence apprentices’ 
competence development in strengthening the positive effects of formal and informal 
learning on performance. Surprisingly, the results suggest that for apprentices as particular  
category of employees, the HRM system embedding the apprenticeship does not influence 
competence development. However, before further discussion some considerations are 
warranted.  
Moderated analysis was based on a small sample (N= 84) which may have affected the power 
for statistical inference tests (Hair et al., 2014); additionally, measures of HRM process ar e 
relatively new and in need of further development and validation (Ehrnrooth and Bjorkman, 
2012; Sanders, Shipton and Gomes, 2014). As recently discussed by Ostroff and Bowen 
(2016), the field is in need of a comprehensive measure of the HRM system strength intended 
as higher-level construct representing a contextual property of a unit or the organisation. The 
scholars maintain that, diverting from the original conceptualisation of the HRM system 
strength (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004), most research up to date has operationalised the 
construct as individual level perceptions, treating it as an individual-difference variable 
rather than a higher-level contextual variable (Ostroff and Bowen, 2016). In referring to the 
measure developed by Delmotte and colleagues (2012) in particular, Ostroff and Bowen 
(2016) consider the operationalisation of the HRM system strength as idiosyncratic 
perceptions of individual interpretations of the social context, rather than shared perceptions
<<<PAGE=188>>>
172 
 
at unit or organisational level. The scholars maintain that inconsistencies in operationalising 
the construct have led to an indirect use of the HRM system strength concept, which although 
meaningful in explaining how individual perceptions relate to individual outcomes, differ 
from the original theorisation. 
Additionally, when considering the particular items making up the scale measuring the HRM 
system strength construct (Delmotte et al., 2012), it is evident how some may appear 
extraneous to apprentices. Items reading ‘HR practices in this organisation achieve their 
intended goals’ and ‘One can have faith that the HR practices realise the goals for which 
they were designed’ may seem vague and ambiguous to junior employees. Furthermore, the 
items tend to present general statements referring to policies and practices applicable to all 
employees (i.e. ‘The procedures and practices developed by HR are easy to understand’; 
‘The HR instruments for staff appraisal succeed in reinforcing the desired behaviours’), 
however apprentices as subgroup of employees may only be exposed to particular practices, 
and may have a dedicated department running independently of HR. Accordingly, 
apprentices’ perceptions of their relationship with the organisation may not be well 
represented by the HRM system strength construct, but may result from other factors.  
Inspection of qualitative data collected via an open question in the survey has shed light onto 
apprentices’ perceptions of the HR M system. Apprentices’ statements indicate that whilst 
the immediate context as in the learning environment where the apprenticeship takes place 
is crucial for their development, the HRM system appears secondary. As exemplified in the 
following quotes, apprentices perceive the HRM system as distant and remote and have 
limited knowledge about the function: 
‘I have had no contact with my HR department that I know of, I do not know who the H R 
representative is for me and nor do any of the other apprentices who are based on the same site as me. 
This was highlighted at a recent apprentice forum.’ 
 
‘As a planning and control apprentice I know very little about HR. I am not sure (apart from 
recruitment, redundancy, performance ratings) what they are responsible for. We have not really been 
informed of what the function does.’ 
 
‘As an apprentice, some of the questions, I think become more applicable the further I go in my 
career – I struggle to give an opinion on something, I know very little about the HR function and the 
opinions of others.’ 
 
‘I do not have a lot of knowledge on the HR department and it is a reflection of my role and the 
company as a whole.’ 
 
This finding is consistent with the low number of responses on the scales measuring the 
constructs of distinctiveness (N= 132), consistency (N= 124) and consensus (N= 112) as
<<<PAGE=189>>>
173 
 
many responden ts refused to answer the question or chose to answer ‘do not know’ 
indicating limited knowledge on the topic.  
When considering the role of the HRM system strength from a social exchange perspective 
(Blau, 1964), a strong HRM system was expected to communicate to apprentices that the 
organisation values their development and well-being. Inspection of apprentices’ statements 
reveals that apprentices do feel valued, however this feeling of appreciation and recognition 
stems from the immediate learning environment, as exemplified in the following quotes: 
‘I have really enjoyed my first year of my apprenticeship. I’ve always felt  like a valued, 
significant member of the team and the company.’ 
‘As an apprentice in the training school you are treated like a child more than a working 
individual. However, when entering the business you are treated from day one like a member of the 
team and you are accepted, and given proper meaningful jobs whether they be individua l or team 
jobs.’ 
‘The opportunities the company provides are brilliant, and being an apprentice usually does 
not get in the way of this. I have never felt disadvantaged or overlooked by my colleag ues as an 
apprentice, and my opinions and inputs are always listened to and considered.’  
 
Generally, apprentices feel valued by the organisation and this positive perception derives 
from having meaningful roles within the team, being given adequate levels of responsibility 
in carrying out tasks and in contributing toward projects. Whilst team working and job 
involvement appear significant for apprentices in feeling as valued members of the 
organisation, HR practices as career development do not seem to contribute to a relational 
employment relationship with the organisation, as exemplified in the following quotes:   
‘Unorganised, poor planning towards our future.’ 
‘The fact that my career direction has been decided – without me being able to have an input, 
or anyone listening to my concerns – has led me to look for another career at the earliest opportunity.’ 
‘I am a practical apprentice and have had a varied training programme that has allowed me 
a breadth of knowledge in different aspects of practical machining but in te rms of my eventual job 
role I have had no idea what that could be and when I have continually asked it was com pletely 
vague.’  
Uncertainty around and poor planning of career progression emerges as a prevalent theme, 
with several respondents expressing dissatisfaction with their ability to influence their career 
and with poor planning and communication with regards to job progression within the 
company. Overall, results of quantitative and qualitative data analyses suggest that content 
as in the apprenticeship training is crucial in making apprentices feel valued whilst process, 
as in the HRM system strength emerges as secondary.  As discussed in the previous chapter,
<<<PAGE=190>>>
174 
 
apprentices consider the work environment as critical for securing positive learning 
experiences, valuing the challenges, the support and the autonomy provided. On the other 
hand, the HRM system is perceived as distant given the limited exposure to practices as 
career development and little contact with the HR function.  
Apprentices’ views of the HR M system strength may be further explained by considering 
the items measuring the HRM strength construct (Delmotte et al., 2012). Whilst the HR 
process approach focuses on the way HR practices are administered (Bowen and Ostroff, 
2004) turning the spotlight onto how they are implemented by line management (Guest, 
2011), most items used to measure the HRM system strength construct refer to the HR 
department and HR employees. Items reading ‘In general the HR employees in this 
organisation are highly appreciated’ and ‘When one asks the HR department for help, they 
provide clear answers’ focus exclusivel y on the HR function with no reference to line 
management, providing a limited representation of how practices are implemented.  
Generally, the measure employed to assess apprentices’ perceptions of the HR M system 
strength may not fully represent how HR practices are implemented; relatedly, the measure 
may not fully portray the communicative function of the HRM system in sustaining a 
relational relationship with the organisation (Tsui et al., 1997). Whilst it was hypothesised 
that a strong HRM system would communicate the organisation’s commitment towards 
apprentices, qualitative data reveals that apprentices have little exposure to the HRM system. 
Conversely, the learning environment emerges as paramount in making apprentices feel 
valued.  
Nonetheless, the findings suggest that apprentices engage with the formal and informal 
learning opportunities provided regardless of the relationship with the organisation as 
portrayed by the HRM system strength. This would indicate that as junior category of 
employees apprentices are mainly concerned with the apprenticeship training as this appears 
to satisfy the short-term objectives and immediate needs of getting a qualification, gaining 
work experience and stepping into employment. Additionally, apprentices appear to rely on 
colleagues, peers and supervisors both at college and within the company as important 
sources of support.  
Overall, the findings suggest that the HRM system may need to be formally introduced to 
apprentices in order to sustain a positive relational employment relationship and have a
<<<PAGE=191>>>
175 
 
positive impact on the apprenticeship training. Practical and theoretical implications are 
discussed in the following chapter. 
 
6.4 Hypothesis 4: the influence of performance appraisal on the informal 
learning factors of problem solving, task autonomy and feedback 
In testing the moderating effects of PA on the relationship between the informal learning 
factors of a) problem solving; b) task autonomy and c) feedback and apprentices 
competencies, nine moderated relationships were tested:  
- the interaction effect of PA and problem solving on:  
1) Individual task proficiency 
2) Team member proficiency  
3) Organisation member proficiency  
- the interaction effect of PA and task autonomy on: 
4) Individual task proficiency  
5) Team member proficiency  
6) Organisation member proficiency  
- The interaction effect of PA and feedback on: 
7) Individual task proficiency 
8) Team member proficiency 
9) Organisation member proficiency  
In so doing, this study examines the influence of PA on the learning processes contributing 
to developing job competence (individual task proficiency), team working skills (team 
member proficiency) and effective participation skills (organisation member proficiency).   
 
The association between problem solving and apprentices’ competencies: the  role of 
PA 
Table 6.8 reports correlations and reliability coefficients for the constructs of interest. All 
scales present acceptable reliability (α> .70) and significant correlations are observed 
between predictors and criterions. PA is positively and significantly correlated with both 
problem solving (r= .28, p< .01) and feedback (r= .57, p< .01), and presents small significant 
correlations with individual task performance (r= .19, p˂.01) and organisation member 
performance (r= .39, p˂.01). When considering the control variables, age is negatively and
<<<PAGE=192>>>
176 
 
significantly associated with PA (r= -.29, p< .01) suggesting that older apprentices are less 
satisfied with it. Similarly, tenure is negatively and significantly associated with feedback 
(r= -.26, p< .01) and with PA (r= -.38, p< .01) suggesting that apprentices employed for 
longer than one year receive less regular feedback from colleagues and supervisors and are 
less satisfied with PA.  
In testing for moderation three models were considered. To test the direct effects, the 
considered performance outcome was first regressed onto the control variables (Model 1). 
In a second step the investigated predictor (problem solving, task autonomy and feedback 
respectively) and PA were included. To test for moderation, the interaction term between 
PA and the considered predictor was included in a third step (Model 3). The sample size for 
the analysis ranged between N= 154 and N= 173, meeting the minimum requirements for 
conducting regression analysis with six predictors (Tabanick and Fidell, 2007).   
Based on Model 1, all control variables failed to predict the performance outcomes. Based 
on Model 2, problem solving is positively and significantly associated with team member 
proficiency (β= .24, p< .01) and organisation member proficiency (β= .16, p< .05). Model 3 
reveals that PA positively and significantly moderates the relationship between problem 
solving and team member proficiency (β= .21, p< .01)  and between problem solving and 
organisation member proficiency (β= .25,  p< .05). Regression analysis results are reported 
in Table 6.9 and the significant interaction effects are shown in Fig. 6.1 and 6.2.

The association between task autonomy and apprentices’ competencies: the role of PA 
When considering the association between task autonomy and the considered performance 
behaviours, Model 1 reveals that the control variables are not significant predictors. Based 
on Model 2, task autonomy is positively and significantly associated only with 
organisation member proficiency (β= .16, p˂ .05). Model 3 reveals that the interaction 
between task autonomy and PA is non-significant. Regression analysis results are reported 
in Table 6.10   
 
The association between feedback and apprentices’ competencies: the role of PA 
When considering the association between feedback and the considered performance 
behaviours, Model 1 indicates that the control variables are not significant predictors. Based 
on Model 2, feedback is positively and significantly associated with individual task 
proficiency (β= .23, p< .05), team member proficiency (β= .32, p< .01) and organisation 
member proficiency (β= .31, p< .01).  
Model 3 reveals that PA satisfaction positively and significantly moderates the relationship 
between feedback and team memb er proficiency (β= .16, p< .01). For this  outcome, the 
positive effects of feedback are stronger when PA satisfaction is high. Regression analyses 
results are reported in Table 6.11 and the significant interaction effects are shown in Figure 
6.3.

Significant interaction effects of feedback and PA satisfaction on 3) team member 
proficiency 
Fig. 6.3 Team member proficiency 
 
 
 
Summary of results  
Overall, the findings indicate that problem solving is associated with team working and 
effective participation skills. Additionally, the effects of problem solving on proficiency in 
operating as an effective team and organisational member are stronger when PA satisfaction 
is high.  
Similarly, feedback is associated with the whole spectrum of competencies including job 
competence, team working and effective participation skills. Notably, the effects of feedback 
on the ability to operate as effective team member are stronger when satisfaction with PA is 
high.  
Task autonomy is only associated with the work and business skills of effective participation 
and its effects are not influenced by PA satisfaction.

6.5 Hypothesis 5: the role of learning goal orientation in apprenticeship  
Moderated regression was conducted to test the influence of learning goal orientation as 
individual determinant of apprentices’ responses to formal and informal learning, o n the 
relationship between the apprenticeship training and resultant competencies. 
In so doing, in this study the following main moderated relationships were tested:  
- the interaction effect of learning goal orientation and formal training on:  
1) Training transfer 
- the interaction effect of learning goal orientation and informal learning on: 
2) Individual performance behaviours  
3) Team performance behaviours  
4) Organisation performance behaviours  
In testing for moderation, the same procedure adopted for testing the influence of the HRM 
system strength on the apprenticeship training was applied. The sample size for the analysis 
ranged between N= 166 and N= 188, meeting the minimum requirements for conducting 
regression analysis with 10 predictors (Tabanick and Fidell, 2007). 
   
6.5.1 The association between formal training and apprentices’ competencies: the role 
of learning goal orientation 
Table 6.12 reports correlations and reliability coefficients for the constructs of interest. All 
scales present acceptable reliability (α> .70) and significant correlations are observed 
between predictors and criterions. Learning goal orientation is significantly and positively 
correlated with both formal training (r= .17, p< .05) and informal learning (r= .36, p< .01), 
displaying a larger correlation with the latter. When considering the outcome variables, 
learning goal orientation is positively and significantly correlated with all four outcomes, 
presenting a small correlation with training transfer (r= .23, < .01), and medium correlations 
with individual performance behaviours (r= .41, p< .01), team performance behaviours (r= 
.37, p< .01) and organisation performance behaviours (r= .37, p< .01). No significant 
correlations are observed between learning goal orientation and the control variables.

Formal training and training transfer 
In line with the procedure followed to test the previous hypotheses, training transfer is 
regressed onto formal training as proxy for apprentices’ technical knowledge.  In testing the 
moderating role of learning goal orientation three models were considered. Based on Model 
1, tenure, level and age fail to predict transfer of knowledge and skills acquired at college or 
university to the workplace. Model 2 indicates that formal training is positively and 
significantly associated with training transfer (β= .55, p<.01), while learning goal orientation 
is not significant. Model 3 reveals that no moderation occurs between learning goal 
orientation and formal training as the interaction coefficient is non-significant (Table 6.13).  
Moderated regression analysis was also conducted for each formal training factor to assess 
whether LGO influenced the relationship between individual factors and training transfer, 
however the analysis did not detect any significant interaction.

Summary of results 
Overall, the findings do not provide support for the influence of learning goal orientation on 
the relationship between formal training and apprentices ’ technical knowledge. 
Additionally, when considered as predictor, learning goal orientation is not significantly 
associated with training transfer.  
 
6.5.2 The asso ciation between informal learning and apprentices’ competencies: the 
role of learning goal orientation 
In testing the influence of learning goal orientation on the relationship between informal 
learning and apprentices’ competencies, individual, team and o rganisation performance 
behaviours were regressed onto informal learning as proxies for job competence and work 
and business skills. Although no moderation was detected when considering informal 
learning as composite measure, further tests were conducted to explore whether learning 
goal orientation had an influence on particular variables forming the informal learning 
construct.
<<<PAGE=203>>>
187 
 
In testing the association of individual informal learning factors with specific organisation 
performance behaviours (i.e. proficiency, adaptivity, proactivity) at individual, team and 
organisational level, learning goal orientation was found to influence the association of a) 
social support; b) feedback; c) task autonomy; d) task interdependence with a spectrum of 
performance behaviours.  
Table 6.14 reports the correlations between the constructs of interest. Learning goal 
orientation is positively associated with all performance outcomes and presents positive 
significant correlations with all informal learning factors with the exception of problem 
solving and task interdependence.  
 
Social support  
Moderated regression analysis reveals that the relationship between social support and team 
member adaptivity is influenced by learning goal orientation (Table 6.15).  
Based on Model 1, all control variables fail to predict team member adaptivity. Model 2 
reveals that social support (β= .24, p< .01) and learning goal orientation (β= .15, p< .05) are 
positively and significantly associated with the predicted outcome. Model 3 indicates that 
learning goal orientation positively and significantly moderates the relationship between 
social support and team member adaptivity (β= .42, p< .05). 
As reported in Table 6.16, the slope test reveals that social support is positively and 
significantly associated with team member ada ptivity at average (β= .25, p< .01) and 
relatively high levels of learning goal orientation (β= .46, p< .01), indicating that as learning 
goal orientation increases so does the strength of the association between social support and 
team member adaptivity.

Feedback  
Similarly, the effects of feedback on team member adaptivity are moderated by learning goal 
orientation. As reported in Table 6.17, Model 1 indicates that the control variables are not 
associated with team member adaptivity. Based on Model 2, both feedback (β= .27, p< .01) 
and learning goal orientation (β= .16, p< .05) are positively and significantly associated with
<<<PAGE=206>>>
190 
 
the criterion. Model 3 reveals that learning goal orientation positively and significantly 
moderates the relationship between feedback and team member adaptivity (β= .19, p< .05).  
These findings are supported by the slope test which reveals that the effects of feedback on 
team member adaptivity are stronger for individuals with higher levels of learning goal 
orientation. As reported in Table 6.18, at average levels of learning goal orientation the 
effects of feedback on team member adaptivity are β= . 21, p< .01; whilst at relatively high 
levels of learning goal orientation the effects of feedback on team member adaptivity 
increase to β= .31, p< .01.

Task autonomy  
Surprisingly, learning goal orientation was found to negatively interact with task autonomy 
on individual task proficiency, team member proficiency and organisation member 
adaptivity. As for the former (Table 6.19), Model 1 reveals that the control variables are not 
significant predictors. Based on Model 2, learning goal orientation is positively and 
significantly associated with the criterion (β= .27, p< .01) whilst autonomy is non -
significant. Model 3 reveals that learning goal orientation negatively and significantly 
moderates the relationship between autonomy and individual task proficiency (β= -.33, p< 
.05). When probing the interaction (Table 6.20), the slope test indicates that the effect of 
autonomy on individual task proficiency is positive and significant only at low levels of 
learning goal orientation (β= .25, p< .05), whilst at average and high levels is non-significant 
and potentially negative. 
Similarly, when considering team member proficiency, Model 2 reveals that only learning 
goal orientation is positively and significantly associated with the criterion (β= .20, p< .01) 
whilst autonomy is non-significant. Based on Model 3, learning goal orientation negatively 
and significantly moderates the relationship between autonomy and team member 
proficiency (β= -.31, p< .05). As confirmed in the slope test (Table 6. 21), the effects of 
autonomy on team member proficiency are positive and significant only at low levels of 
learning goal orientation (β= .28, p< .01), whilst at average and high level the association is 
not significant and potentially negative.  
Ultimately, organisation member adaptivity presents similar results. Based on Model 1, the 
controls are not significant predictors. Model 2 reveals that only learning goal orientation is 
positively and significantly associated with organisation member adaptivity (β= .23, p< .01). 
Based on Model 3, learning goal orientation negatively and significantly moderates the 
relationship between autonomy and organisation member adapt ivity (β= -.39, p <.05). The 
slope test (Table 6.22) indicates that autonomy is positively and significantly associated with 
organisation member adaptivity at averag e (β= .22, p<.05) and  low levels of learning goal 
orientation (β= .42, p< .01), whilst at high levels is non-significant.  
Overall, the findings suggest that task autonomy is significant in predicting individual task 
proficiency, team member proficiency and organisation member adaptivity only when 
learning goal orientation is low. Accordingly, low learning-oriented apprentices appear to 
benefit from task autonomy, whilst for high learning-oriented apprentices the effects of task 
autonomy are non-significant and potentially negative.

Task interdependence 
Learning goal orientation was found to positively and significantly moderate the effects of 
task interdependence on a range of emergent performance behaviours. 
As reported in Table 6.23, when considering individual task proactivity based on Model 1, 
the control variables are not significant predictors. Model 2 indicates that task 
interdependence is not significantly associated with the criterion whilst learning goal 
orientation presents a positive and significant association with individual task proactivity 
(β= .25, p< .01). Model 3 reveals that learning goal orientation p ositively and significantly 
moderates the relationship between task interdependence and proactivity in conducting ones 
job.  
Specifically, when probing the interaction (Table 6.24), the effects of task interdependence 
on individual task proactivity are significant only for individuals with relatively high levels 
of learning goal orientation (β= .44, p< .01), whilst for individuals with average or low levels 
of learning orientation the effects of task interdependence are not significant. The findings 
suggest that the effects of task interdependence on individual task proactivity are contingent 
upon high levels of learning goal orientation. 
Similar results were found for the outcome of organisation member proactivity. As reported 
in Table 6.23, Model 2 reveals that only learning goal orientation is significantly associated 
with organisation member proactivity (β= .30, p< .01) whilst task interdependence is not 
significant. Model 3 indicates that learning goal orientation positively and significantly 
moderates the relationship between task interdependence and organisation member 
proactivity (β= .56, p< .05). Correspondingly, the slope test ( Table 6.27) shows that task 
interdependence is positively and significantly associated with organisation member 
proactivity only for individuals displaying relatively high levels of learning goal orientation 
(β= .43, p< .01).  
When considering adaptive performance behaviours, learning goal orientation is found to 
moderate the effects of task interdependence on both team member and organisation member 
adaptivity. With regards to the former, based on Model 2 both task interdependence (β= .30, 
p< .01) and learning goal orientation (β= .17, p< .05) are positively and significantly 
associated with team member adaptivity. Model 3 reveals that learning goal orientation 
positively and significantly moderates the relationship between task interdependence and the 
criterion (β= .34, p< .05). As indicated by the slope test ( Table 6.25), the effects of task
<<<PAGE=211>>>
195 
 
interdependence on team member adaptivity are stronger for individuals with higher levels 
of learning goal orientation (β= .44, p< .01). 
Equally when considering organisation member adaptivity, Model 2 reveals that only 
learning goal orientation is positively and significantly associated with the criterion (β= .24, 
p< .01) whilst task interdependence is non-significant. Model 3 indicates that learning goal 
orientation positively and significantly moderates the relationship between task 
interdependence and organisation member adaptivity (β= . 28, p< .05). The slope test 
reported in Table 6.26 indicates that the association between task interdependence and 
organisation member adaptivity is positive and significant at average (β= .16, p<.05) and 
relatively high (β= .31, p<.01) levels of learning goal orientation, but not at relatively low 
levels. This reveals that apprentices with higher levels of learning goal orientation gain more 
from task interdependence in terms of resultant performance than those with lower levels of 
learning orientation.

Summary of results  
Overall the results present partial support for Hypothesis 5. Although learning goal 
orientation was expected to enhance the relationship between informal learning and 
apprentices’ performance outcomes, no moderation was detected when informal lear ning 
was considered as composite measure.  
When considering the informal learning variables individually, learning goal orientation 
emerges as critical personal factor affecting the instrumentality of social support, feedback 
and task interdependence for competence development. The former are work environment 
factors influenced by learning goal orientation in relation to the ability to adapt to changes 
affecting ones role as team member. The latter is a task factor particularly sensitive to 
learning goal orientation in relation to behaviours of adaptivity and proactivity at all 
considered levels of contribution.  
The negative interaction between learning goal orientation and task autonomy suggest that 
contrary to expectations, providing autonomy to learning-oriented individuals may nullify 
the effects of their motivational disposition towards learning on resultant performance. 
Conversely, low learning-oriented individuals appear to benefit from the provision of 
autonomy to enhance performance.  
The results generally reveal positive relationships for apprentices with high learning goal 
orientation validating the importance of nurturing this personal factor to maximise the 
impact of informal learning on resultant performance.

6.6 Chapter summary and conclusion  
This chapter has considered the influence of important boundary conditions on the 
apprenticeship development model presenting a nuanced understanding on factors affecting 
competence development. At contextual level, Hypothesis 3 considered the role of the HRM 
system strength as determinant of a positive employment relationship, and Hypothesis 4 
examined PA as facilitator of informal learning. At individual level Hypothesis 5 considered 
the role of learning goal orientation as apprentices’ favourable disposition towards learning. 
 
Whilst it was hypothesised that under these conditions the impact of the apprenticeship 
training on apprentices’ end-state competencies would be stronger, the results present mixed 
evidence. The HRM system strength did not moderate the relationship as expected and in 
contrast was found to contend with informal learning factors on particular outcomes. On the 
other hand, PA satisfaction was identified as important determinant of apprentices’ 
responses to feedback and problem solving, revealing that the effects of these informal 
learning factors on apprentices’ resultant performance are stronger when PA satisfaction is 
high.  
Additionally, learning goal orientation was found to strengthen the association of informal 
learning factors wi th apprentices’ performance behaviours and to significantly predict 
apprentices’ job competence and work and business skills.  
Although not all in the expected direction, the results present strong insight into the influence 
of particular boundary conditio ns on apprentices’ competence development shedding li ght 
on the role of HR practices in apprenticeship and on the impact of learning goal orientation 
on particular informal learning factors. Implications for theory and practice are discussed in 
the following chapter.

Chapter 7: Discussion 
 
 
7.1 Introduction 
This study was driven by the fact that in spite of extensive investments in apprenticeships 
both on an international scale (Fuller and Unwin, 2011; Sappa et al., 2016) and locally in 
England (Lee, 2012; Rowe et al., 2017; Saraswat, 2016), knowledge on the factors enhancing 
apprentices’ professional development is still limited (Gambin and Hogarth, 201 5; Moon, 
2018). Organisations investing in apprenticeships as strategy for talent development need to 
better understand how to support apprentices’ competence development considering the 
learning potential of the work environment. Accordingly, this study aims to understand how 
apprentices’ competence development can be supported turning the spotlight onto the work 
environment. Considering apprenticeships as models of learning rather than instruments of 
Government policy (Lewis, 2014), this study sought to achieve two main objectives: firstly, 
to develop and empirically test an apprenticeship development model that relates formal and 
informal learning factors to apprentices’ resultant competencies; secondly, to investigate 
whether important boundary conditions at contextual and individual level influence 
professional development.  
The hypothesised relationships were tested with empirical data from 233 apprentices 
operating in two large engineering organisations in England collected at two points in time. 
The results suggest that the work environment is an important determinant of professional 
development and identify specific factors related to apprentices’ end -state competencies. 
Additionally, the results evidence that contextual factors such as HR practices and individual 
factors such as learning goal orientation influence how apprentices respond to the learning 
opportunities provided by the immediate work environment with consequences for resultant 
performance. This chapter discussed theoretical, practical and policy implications arising 
from this study, drawing attention to its limitations and suggesting directions for future 
research. Lastly, the chapter presents an overall conclusion evaluating the study.

7.2 Theoretical implications 
Overall, introducing an organisational perspective to the study of apprenticeship this 
research turns the focus to the work environment and presents three important implications 
for the apprenticeship literature. First, adopting an integrative approach accounting for the 
formal and informal learning processes contributing to apprentices’ professional 
development, this study provides a comprehensive theoretically derived and empirically 
tested apprenticeship development model.
 As exemplified in Chapter 2, adopting a situated 
perspective on learning which assumes knowledge as socially distributed among actors, tools 
and the structure of work (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Nielsen and Pedersen, 2011), this study 
turns the focus to the work environment as determinant of professional development. In 
accordance with the conceptualisation of apprenticeships as paid jobs incorporating training 
on- and off-the-job (House of Commons Library, 2016), the study focuses on theories of 
training transfer (Baldwin and Ford, 1998; Baldwin, Ford, Blume, 2017) and theories of 
workplace learning (Cerasoli et al., 2018; Eraut, 2007; Skule, 2004) to discern pertinent 
training intervention and work environment factors contributing to apprentices’ professional 
development. In so doing, the study identifies critical factors supporting apprentices to learn 
the knowledge and skills required for effectiveness. 
 
Secondly, following the apprenticeship statutory requirements (SASE, 2017) this study 
advances a categorisation of apprentices’ competencies encompassing job competence, 
technical knowledge and work and business skills. Whilst effective performance requires the 
integration of such interrelated components (Le Deist and Winterton, 2005), a 
multidimensional representation allows investigating the association between particular 
formal and informal learning factors and specific resultant competencies. Table 7.1 presents 
an overview of the apprenticeship formal and informal learning factors and the associated 
competencies. Accordingly, in testing the association of specific formal and informal 
learning factors with apprentices’ competencies as outcome of interest,  this study extends 
research that previously considered only learning as outcome of interest (i.e. Messman and 
Mulder, 2015; Raemdonck et al., 2014 ). In so doing, the study adds knowledge to the 
apprenticeship domain which scarcely investigated the relationship between learning 
conditions and learning outcomes intended as changes in competencies. Given that different 
learning conditions may be related to different learning outcomes, insights into this relation 
are valuable in identifying the formal and informal learning factors that are most important 
for apprentices’ professional development (Clarke, 2005; Janseens et al., 2017).

Thirdly, in accounting for contextual factors such as the HRM system (Bowen and Ostroff, 
2004; Kuvaas, 2008; Lepak and Snell, 1999) and individual differences such as learning goal 
orientation (Dweck and Leggett, 1988) this study identifies important boundary conditions 
that influence apprentices’ competence development. In considering the former, this study 
extends knowledge on apprenticeship presenting much needed insight on the influence of 
HRM lacking in prior research. Whilst commentators have discussed the potential influence 
of HR practices on the success of apprenticeships (Hogarth, Gambin and Hasluck, 2012b ; 
Lewis, 2014), this relationship has been mainly assumed rather than tested.  
Building on research which found HRM effectiveness to be contingent on the nature of 
specific employment groups (Kinnie et al., 2005; Liao et al., 2009), this study identifies the 
high-commitment HRM system as the strategy for managing the employment relationship 
with apprentices as high value employees (Lepak and Snell, 1999; 2002). In testing the 
influence of the HRM system strength (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004) and PA (Kuvaas, 2006 ) 
on apprentices’ competen ce development, this study provides empirical support for the 
notion that the employment relationship as portrayed by HR practices influences the success 
of the programme (i.e. Kuvaas, 2008).  
Added to this, in including individual differences as important boundary conditions this 
study addresses the limitations of prior research that only considered contextual factors as 
determinants of learning (i.e. Messman and Mulder, 2015). In so doing, it answers calls for 
professional development research integrating the learner and the context as inextricably 
interrelated factors (Webster-Wright, 2009). Accounting for the construct of learning goal 
orientation this study identifies an important personal factor explaining variation into how 
apprentices respond to critical informal learning factors.  
In particular, in finding PA satisfaction and learning goal orientation to foster apprentices’ 
engagement with informal learning, this research lends support to an interactionist approach 
to the study of informal learning. As discussed by Jeong and colleagues (2018), the 
relationships between informal learning factors and engagement in informal learning 
behaviours are complex and interrelated. Accordingly, the scholars advocate a multi-level 
examination of the individual, group and environmental factors influencing engagement in 
informal learning. The joint-effects of PA (at organisational level) and learning goal 
orientation (at individual level) with critical informal learning factors identified in this study 
provide novel insight into meaningful cross-level interactions. The result is a nuanced
<<<PAGE=220>>>
204 
 
understanding of how best to facilitate informal learning and support apprentices’ 
professional development in the workplace.  
Overall, this research reveals critical formal and informal learning factors contributing to the 
developmental quality of apprenticeships and identifies contextual and individual boundary 
conditions influencing apprentices’ responses to the learning opportunities provided in the 
workplace.  
In sum, when considering formal learning in apprenticeship, three factors have emerged as 
pivotal for supporting apprentices in transferring and applying the technical knowledge 
acquired at college and University to the workplace: transfer design, supervisor support and 
opportunity to use knowledge and skills. When considering informal learning, the work 
environment factors of social support, feedback, problem solving, task autonomy and task 
interdependence are critical in fostering apprentices’ job competence and work and business 
skills. 
At individual level, the results of the study reveal that learning goal orientation is a critical 
personal factor affecting the instrumentality of informal learning, fostering apprentices’ 
professional development in the workplace. At contextual level, while the HRM system 
strength did not influence apprentices’ responses to formal and informal learning factors, PA 
emerged as important HR practice facilitating apprentices’ engagement with informal 
learning.

7.2.1 Formal learning in apprenticeship  
The results of this study reveal the training intervention and work environment factors that 
contribute to apprentices transferring and applying the technical and theoretical knowledge 
acquired at college and University in the workplace. This is an important consideration given 
that learning at college and University is not enough to render the apprenticeship effective, 
but needs to be transferred and applied to the workplace resulting in improved performance.  
In exploring the factors promoting transfer of learning across education and work this 
research identifies the mechanisms required in order to foster the link between vocational 
and higher education and develop higher skills levels necessary for future economic 
prosperity (Lee, 2012). As reported by Brown (2009), engaging with a substantive 
knowledge base is crucial for developing higher levels of skills, however the transfer of 
knowledge between contexts is problematic. This study thus presents compelling evidence 
on the factors that help apprentices to transfer knowledge and skills to the workplace 
improving performance, and in turning the focus onto the work environment identifies 
crucial actors (i.e. supervisor and colleagues) who play a critical role in supporting this 
process. In so doing, the study contributes to growing research on the relationship between 
school and work in VET (Pineda-Herrero et al., 2015; Mulder, Messman and Konig, 2015 ; 
Renta Davids et al., 2017), providing additional evidence to the view that learning across 
sites needs to be purposely connected and integrated in order to contribute to the 
development of valuable knowledge (Sappa, Choy and Aprea, 2016). Added to this, 
considering the training intervention factor of transfer design, the study responds to recent 
calls for research investigating instructional methods that explicitly aim at transfer rather 
than learning as outcome of interest (Baldwin, Ford and Blume, 2017). 
Training intervention: transfer design  
In particular, the results of this study point to the importance of the training intervention 
factor of transfer design (Holton et al., 2000) for the development and application of a strong 
knowledge base. With transfer design accounting for most variance in training transfer, this 
study supports the notion that the way formal training is designed and delivered is critical 
for securing positive results in apprenticeships. This indicates that training should not only 
deliver the knowledge and skills underpinning the occupation, but should also foster the 
understanding of how that knowledge relates to practice (Laker, 1990; Velada et al., 2007). 
In finding transfer design in positive association with training transfer, this study presents 
evidence of the importance of providing training content aligned with the job, and of
<<<PAGE=223>>>
207 
 
providing apprentices with an understanding through examples and exercises of how 
knowledge and skills are implemented in the workplace.  
This finding is in line with previous research on training transfer (i.e. Velada et al., 2007) 
and can be explained considering the impact of transfer design on self-efficacy. In finding a 
direct relation ship between transfer design and trainees’ self -efficacy, Diamantidis and 
Chatzouglou (2014) suggest that when training is designed to reflect job requirements and 
to guide trainees in the application of knowledge and skills in the workplace, trainees’ sel f-
confidence is sustained in turn resulting in higher knowledge transfer to the job.  
Additionally, this finding supports and extends research on apprenticeships that found the 
integration of work-oriented learning at school in positive association with apprentices 
engaging in learning activities at work. Specifically, the study conducted by Messman and 
Mulder (2015) found that when organisational case studies were integrated as examples in 
formal learning at school along with elucidations on how the learning content can be applied 
to accomplish work tasks, apprentices would approach challenging tasks with enquiring, 
thus engage in further learning. Evidence of this process is reflected in the positive 
correlations between transfer design and both colleagues ’ and supervisor’s feedback, 
indicating that learning relevant and applicable knowledge at college or University 
encourages apprentices to request feedback in the workplace. Although this research 
considers only direct effects and does not investigate possible intervening mechanisms such 
as increased self-efficacy and further engagement in workplace learning, in finding a positive 
association between transfer design and training transfer this study demonstrates that an 
alignment between school and work in a pprenticeship fosters apprentices’ application of 
knowledge and skills in the workplace resulting in increased performance.  
Work environment post-training   
Turning the focus onto the work environment is imperative because even well designed and 
delivered training programmes will not produce positive results if the work environment 
post-training does not support the transfer of knowledge and skills (Grossman and Salas, 
2011).  Extant research has investigated the work environment as either an aggregate 
construct or considering variables independently in order to capture the different effects that 
each variable may exert on transfer (Burke and Hutchins, 2007). In line with the latter 
conceptualisation, this study hypothesised that supervisor support, the availability of 
feedback from both colleagues and supervisors, and the opportunity to apply the knowledge
<<<PAGE=224>>>
208 
 
and skills acquired in training in the workplace would support apprentices in transferring 
knowledge and skills to the workplace resulting in increased performance.  
Supervisor support  
Among the work environment factors, supervisor support emerged as significant predictor 
of training transfer suggesting that the supervisor plays an influential role in facilitating 
apprentices in transferring the knowledge and skills acquired at college and University to the 
workplace. Consistent with prior research (Bates et al., 2000; Cromwell and Kolb, 2004; 
Lim and Johnson, 2002; Van den Bossche et al., 2010), supervisors are a proximal source of 
support that positively affect training transfer. Extant research has explored both the direct 
effects of supervisor support on transfer (Bates et al., 2000) and the indirect effects via the 
influence of supervisor support on trainees’ self -efficacy, learning goal orientation and 
motivation to transfer (Chiaburu, Van Dam and Hutchins, 2010; Facteau et al., 1995). 
Contrary to studies which did not find a significant relationship between supervisor support 
and training transfer (Awoniyi et al., 2002; Chiaburu and Marinova, 2005), this study 
provides evidence of a direct and positive effect drawing attention to the role of th e 
supervisor in the context of apprenticeships.  
Specifically, given that the construct of supervisor support has been operationalised 
differently in transfer research (Burke and Hutchins, 2007; Govaerts and Dochy, 2014), this 
study measured particular behaviours that yield positive transfer results. The dominant 
conceptualisation of supervisor support in transfer research encompasses behaviours that 
reinforce the use of learning on the job (Holton et al., 2000), however without specifying 
when such supportive behaviours should occur (Govaerts and Dochy, 2014). In line with 
Chiaburu and Marinova (2005), supervisor support is here operationalised encompassing a 
general view of employee development as part of a supervisor managerial role along with 
specific behaviours such as providing trainees with reminders and time for practice. 
Accordingly, this study evidences that apprentices benefit from both immediate supervisor 
support for and reinforcement of training on the job (Holton et al., 2000) and from general 
supervisor support for career development (Yarnall, 1998). An important implication is that 
supervisors need to have key competencies for supporting apprentices’ development in order 
to maximise training transfer. Among these, supervisors need to show attitudes and 
behaviours as coaching apprentices in their general development; providing feedback on 
general performance; along with opportunities to practice and apply the newly learned 
knowledge in the job (Govaerts and Dochy, 2014).
<<<PAGE=225>>>
209 
 
Whilst the latter behaviours refer to the post-training time period, those related to career 
development are important throughout the apprenticeship, presenting further evidence on the 
notion that supervisors influence transfer before, during and after the training programme 
(Grossman and Salas, 2011). The negative correlation between supervisor support and tenure 
is therefore alerting suggesting that apprentices who have been employed for more than one 
year experience lower levels of supervisor support, with potential implications for training 
transfer. As evidenced by the negative correlation between tenure and training transfer, the 
application of knowledge and skills acquired in formal training to the workplace declines 
over time, drawing attention to the role of the supervisor for maintaining knowledge and 
skills over time (Ford and Weissbein, 1997).  
Feedback from colleagues and supervisors  
In addition to supervisor support, this study examined the influence of feedback as particular 
support-mechanism for training transfer. Whilst interpersonal support in the form of co-
workers and supervisor support is generally viewed as important determinant of transfer 
(Bates et al., 2000), the influence of feedback in particular has been under-researched (Va n 
den Bossche et al., 2010). In line with research conducted by Diamantidis and Chatzoglou 
(2014), this study explored whether the degree of feedback from peers and supervisors 
influenced app rentices’ training transfer. The assumption is that apprentices engaging in 
discussions with peers and supervisors about the application of training on the job and 
receiving information and encouragement regarding the execution of tasks would positively 
sustain training transfer. 
Surprisingly, this study found a non- significant relationship between both supervisor’s and 
colleagues’ feedback and training transfer, indicating that apprentices’ application of the 
knowledge base in the workplace is not associated with job environment feedback. A 
possible explanation for the non- significant association between colleagues’ feedback and 
transfer is that apprentices depend more on their supervisors for training outcomes than on 
support from colleagues. When considering the non-significant result of supervisor 
feedback, this should be viewed with caution given that supervisor support, encompassing 
also behaviours as the provision of feedback on performance (Chiaburu and Marinova, 2005; 
Yarnall, 1998), presents a positive association with training transfer.  
Additionally, when considering the operationalisation of the constructs, feedback from the 
work environment is conceptualised as feedback request suggesting that trainees feel
<<<PAGE=226>>>
210 
 
comfortable in seeking information from colleagues and supervisors about their actual 
performance (Diamantidis and Chatzoglou, 2014). The study conducted by Diamantidis and 
Chatzoglou (2014) identified a strong relationship between trainees’ self-efficacy and work 
environment feedback request, indicating that the proactive request of feedback may be 
dependent upon adequate levels of self-efficacy. Given that apprentices are emergent 
professionals, attention should be given to fostering a positive disposition towards feedback 
as supportive learning factor. Whilst in this study feedback has not emerged as salient work 
environment factor, the findings do not discard the importance of interpersonal support for 
training transfer (Grossman and Salas, 2011). Research indeed suggests that feedback from 
various sources on the application of newly acquired knowledge and skills in the workplace 
can help to close the gap between current and desired performance, validating the 
significance of this factor for training transfer (Sparr, Knipfer and Willems, 2017; Van den 
Bossche et al., 2010).  
Opportunity to use knowledge and skills on-the-job  
Finally, consistent with prior research (Lim and Johnson, 2002; Bates et al., 2000; Seyler et 
al., 1998), this study provides empirical support for the notion that opportunities to use the 
newly acquired knowledge and skills in the workplace enhance training transfer resulting in 
higher performance. Whilst extant research measured the construct of opportunity to use as 
in having resources, tools and information required to apply the training content along with 
being allowed to use the training on the job (Seyler et al., 1998), here opportunity to use is 
measured as in the actual application of training content on the job. Apprentices rated the 
incorporation of knowledge and skills in their daily work activities and the frequent 
application of these in their work. As discussed by Blume and colleagues (2010), using the 
knowledge and skills is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for effective transfer 
given that the latter involves performance improvements.  
In finding a positive association between the application of training content on the job and 
training transfer, this study provides further evidence on the fact that positive training 
outcomes (i.e. improved performance) are largely dependent on the application of training 
content on the job (Ballesteros-Rodriguez et al., 2012; Diamantidis and Chatzoglou, 2014). 
This is an important finding in the context of the apprenticeship in validating the 
effectiveness of investments in formal training for improved performance. In finding a 
positive association between the application of training content in the workplace and
<<<PAGE=227>>>
211 
 
apprentices’ increased performance, this study draws attention to the work environment as 
catalyst for training transfer.  
Notably, the positive correlation between the opportunity to use knowledge and skills 
acquired in formal training and supervisor support points to the crucial role of supervisors 
in sustaining training transfer. As reported by Clarke (2002) managers play an important role 
in modifying trainees’ normal workload in order to enable the opportunity to apply the newly 
acquired knowledge and skills in the workplace. Added to this, the positive correlation 
between opportunity to use knowledge and skills in the workplace and transfer design 
indicates that a strong match between training content and the job role fosters the opportunity 
to apply the newly acquired competencies to the job (Lim and Johnson, 2002).  
Training transfer over time 
When considering the longitudinal examination of how formal training contributes to 
apprentices’ development and application of the technical knowledge-base, the results of this 
study reflect the challenging nature of training transfer (Chiaburu et al., 2010). In line with 
extant research, the results of the T-test reveal that over the course of ten months the transfer 
of knowledge and skills to the workplace decreased significantly. This finding is consistent 
with a study conducted by Saks and Belcourt (see Zumrah and Boyle 2015 p. 237) where 
only 44 per cent of employees was using the knowledge acquired in training after a six 
months period, and only 34 per cent after a one year period. Similar findings were reported 
by Wexley and Latham (see Diamantidis and Chatzoglou 2014, p. 150) suggesting that as 
time passes trainees may be less motivated or less able to maintain and apply the knowledge 
acquired in formal training in their job (Velada et al., 2007). Relatedly, the significant 
decrease of supervisor support for career development and for training transfer over the 
course of ten months is alerting, suggesting that support mechanisms need to be retained in 
order to fully benefit from investments in training.  
On the other hand, the decrease in training transfer over time is consistent with a large scale 
study conducted by Felstead and colleagues (2005) on a sample of 1943 employees based in 
the UK. The survey revealed that formal training courses and the related accreditations were 
rated as least helpful for improving work performance, in comparison with the informal 
learning arising from the workplace. As discussed by the scholars, this finding suggests that 
‘codified knowledge is at its most useful when gaining initial competence at work, but its 
potency declines as a means of improving performance’ (Felstead et al, 2005, p. 368). When
<<<PAGE=228>>>
212 
 
applying this interpretation to the context of apprenticeships, the decrease in training transfer 
may suggest that the technical knowledge base is most valuable for the first stages of the 
apprenticeship when apprentices refer to the knowledge acquired at college and University 
as platform for performing in the workplace. Conversely, as apprentices progress through 
the programme the application of the knowledge-based acquired in formal training becomes 
less relevant for performance effectiveness.  
Additionally, the lack of correlation between training transfer measured at Time 2 and the 
considered predictors (transfer design; supervisor support; supervisor feedback; colleagues’ 
feedback; opportunity to use) measured at Time 1 is consistent with meta-analysis results 
reported by Blume, Ford, Baldwin and Huang (2010). In investigating whether the time 
between the end of training and the timing of the transfer measure affects the relationship 
between the predictors and the criterion, the scholars found a significant negative 
moderation, revealing that as the amount of time increases, the strength of the relationship 
between post-training knowledge and post-training self-efficacy with transfer decreases 
(Blume et al., 2010). Whilst the meta-analysis did not find the relationship between work 
environment factors and training transfer to be conditional upon time measurement, overall 
the results suggest that when transfer is measured immediately after the training the 
relationships with the predictors are stronger than when a time lag is introduced (Blume et 
al., 2010). In light of this evidence and considering that the reduced sample size of the 
longitudinal sample (N= 90) may have affected the power for statistical inference tests (Hair 
et al., 2014), these non-significant results should be viewed with caution.  
7.2.2 Informal learning in apprenticeship  
In turning the focus onto informal learning as determinant of apprentices’ job competence 
and work and business skills, this study draws on the assumption that learning is embedded 
in the processes, tasks and social relations of the workplace (Pirrioni, Shipton, Wu, 2016). 
This conceptualisation is aligned with an increasing scholarly focus on the workplace as 
resource for learning (Froehlich, Beausaert and Segers 2017) and with a growing field of 
research considering the triggers and antecedents of informal learning at work (Cerasoli et 
al., 2018; Jeong et al., 2018; Segers, Messman and Dochy, 2018). In turning the spotlight to 
the work environment, this study adds knowledge on the contextual factors fostering 
professional development building on studies that considered the influence of job 
characteristics on workplace learning (Gijbels et al., 2010; Raemdonck et al., 2014). In line 
with this strand of research, the developmental quality of the apprenticeship is
<<<PAGE=229>>>
213 
 
conceptualised as dependent on the configuration of the work environment in providing 
apprentices with an optimal balance of challenges, autonomy and support (Messman and 
Mulder, 2015). Accordingly, this research identifies specific factors contributing to creating 
positive learning experiences fostering apprentices’ professional development.  
Social support  
Social support is here operationalised as in the degree to which the social environment 
provides apprentices with opportunities for advice and assistance. By demonstrating a 
positive relationship between social support and apprentices’ job competence (task 
proficiency) and skills such as team working, effective participation and self-management, 
this study substantiates the importance of social relationships in the workplace (Brown, 
2013; Eraut, 2007). In finding social support in association with competence development, 
this study complements results presented by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) who identified 
social support in negative association with training requirements. As suggested by the 
scholars, the ability to rely on positive relationships in the workplace fosters workplace 
learning, lowering the requirements for formal training to improve employees’ performance.  
In particular, the influence of social support on the development of a wide range of 
competencies can be explained in light of the quality of human relationships in the workplace 
(Eraut, 2004). Attention, encouragement and advise from colleagues and supervisors are set 
to foster engagement in informal learning (Doornbos et al., 2004) resulting in competence 
development. This is reflected in the positive correlation between social support and both 
problem solving and experimenting, suggesting that helpful social relationships promote 
apprentices’ perceptions of challenging and novel tasks as learning opportunities. 
Additionally, in line with extant research (Eraut, 2007) social support is important in 
nurturing a proactive learning orientation through its impact on confidence. It follows that 
when apprentices experience social support they feel confident in accessing a support 
network of experts and peers for seeking help, sharing knowledge and receiving feedback 
whilst doing their job.   
Feedback  
This study provides evidence that feedback from colleagues and supervisors contributes to 
apprentices’ job competence (task proficiency) and skills such as effective participation, 
creative thinking and self-management. The positive association of feedback with the 
spectrum of end-state competencies is consistent with research that found feedback to
<<<PAGE=230>>>
214 
 
positively affect performance (Kluger and DeNisi, 1996). This finding supports the 
proposition that feedback from managers and colleagues stimulates workplace learning 
(Doornbos et al., 2004) and underlines the value of regular day-to-day feedback for emergent 
professionals (Eraut, 2007).  
The association between feedback and the range of end-state competencies has at least two 
interpretations. Firstly, regular feedback from colleagues and supervisors consistently leads 
to reflection (Bednall et al., 2014), an important informal learning activity where individuals 
assess the effectiveness of their experience in order to improve performance (Van Woerkom 
and Croon, 2008). Secondly, regular feedback from colleagues and supervisors helps 
apprentices to cope with the challenges and the uncertainties faced as emergent professionals 
learning a trade (DeRue and Wellman, 2009). Feedback is therefore an important support 
mechanism in both enhancing engagement in informal learning activities (Mulder, 2013) and 
in sustaining apprentices’ motivation to learn (Eraut, 2007).  
Remarkably, whilst both social support and feedback are positively associated with job 
competence (task proficiency) and effective participation (organisation member 
proficiency), they differ in their association with skills of self-management and creative 
thinking. Specifically, the positive association of social support with individual task 
adaptivity and organisation member adaptivity indicates that positive social relationships in 
the work environment sustain apprentices’ displaying self -management skills as in 
embracing change and positively responding to new priorities. Conversely, the positive 
association of feedback with individual task proactivity and team member proactivity 
suggest that the regular day- to-day feedback from colleagues and supervisors enhances 
apprentices’ creative th inking, as in generating innovative ideas to improve effectiveness. 
The findings thus reveal that positive social relationships need to be complemented by 
regular feedback in order to foster the development of a spectrum of competencies required 
for apprentices’ effectiveness.  
Notably, the negative correlation between tenure and both social support and feedback 
reveals that as time passes, apprentices receive lower levels of support and regular feedback 
from colleagues and supervisors. This finding is in line with the negative correlation between 
tenure and supervisor support for formal training discussed above, and may indicate that 
having developed a certain level of proficiency, apprentices are less dependent on 
interpersonal support structures. Whilst on one hand this finding has a positive connotation
<<<PAGE=231>>>
215 
 
revealing that as apprentices develop into competent professionals they tend to rely less on 
the support network, on the other hand it may indicate that support structures lose traction 
over time with potential negative implications for professional development. In light of the 
positive correlation between feedback and both problem solving and experimenting it is 
important that support mechanisms remain in place over time to capitalise on the learning 
opportunities presented by challenging and novel tasks.  
Problem solving 
When considering the challenges presented by the work environment, problem solving was 
here regarded as important component of challenging work experiences that in presenting 
novel and complex situations activates a learning response (Doornbos et al., 2004; Messman 
and Mulder, 2015), resulting in the development of critical end-state competencies (Dragoni 
et al., 2009). Whilst problem solving did not emerge as significant in the cross-sectional 
analysis when considered along the other informal learning predictors, the longitudinal study 
reveals that problem solving is positively associated with work and business skills of self-
management and creative thinking. As previously discussed, this finding may indicate that 
the effects of problem solving on the development of critical competencies become apparent 
over time (i.e. Birdi et al., 2008) validating the benefits of presenting apprentices with 
challenges in order to develop professionally.  
This finding is indeed supported by the qualitative data revealing a clear link between 
challenging tasks and learning, and is consistent with studies exploring the influence of 
challenging job demands on employees’ creativity. Specifically, Zhou, Hirst and  Shipton 
(2012) identified problem-solving demand in positive association with employees’ creative 
performance uncovering how the cognitive requirements of the job promote skill 
development and new solutions to problems. It follows that in experiencing novel and 
unexpected events apprentices undergo challenging situations that foster learning in the 
workplace (Doornbos et al., 2004). This in turn leads to the development of skills required 
to deal with the constant changes affecting the work contexts (van Rijn, Yang and Sanders, 
2013) and to anticipate or initiate change to bring about performance improvements (Griffin, 
Neal and Parker, 2007).  
Additionally, turning the focus on the direct effects of problem solving when considered 
along PA as predictors of work-role behaviours (Model 2), other positive associations have 
emerged. In particular, problem solving presents a positive association with work-role
<<<PAGE=232>>>
216 
 
behaviours of team member and organisation member proficiency, embodying team working 
and effective participation skills. These relationships can be interpreted through an indirect 
effect on apprentices’ psychological state of perceived responsibility. As discussed by 
Pearce and Gregersen (1991), when individuals feel responsibility towards the organisation 
and their colleagues, they are more likely to engage in extra role behaviours as helping 
others. Whilst research has linked task autonomy and task interdependence with felt 
responsibility (Hackman & Oldham, 1975; Pearce and Gregersen, 1991), problem solving 
in requiring unique ideas and solutions to complex situations may also lead to felt 
responsibility for work outcomes. 
Overall, this study identifies a job characteristic conducive to professional development that 
is more specific than the broad construct of challenging work (i.e. Messman and Mulder, 
2015) and expands knowledge on the behaviours potentially stimulated by problem solving. 
Experimenting  
Based on experiential learning theory (Kolb, 1984), I predicated that experimenting as in 
trying things out and engaging in trial and error would be associated with the development 
of critical competencies. The assumption is that learning arises from experience in a cyclical 
process where the learner moves from a concrete experience to a stage of observation and 
reflection, followed by generalisation and abstract conceptualisation, leading onto active 
experimentation (Kolb, 1984). Contrary to expectations, the results of this study did not find 
experimenting in association with the investigated work-role behaviours, rejecting the 
hypothesised relationships. A possible explanation for this finding is that the reflection 
process standing at the basis of active experimentation requires a certain amount of built 
expertise on which to reflect before becoming effective. As reported by Cheetham and 
Chivers (2001), whilst reflection is a valuable process for ongoing professional performance, 
it appears less relevant for initial employee development. The scholars thus argue that the 
reflection process cannot be fully effective until emergent professionals have developed 
sufficient experience on which to reflect (Cheetham and Chivers, 2001). When applying this 
interpretation to apprentices, it is apparent that as emergent professionals learning a trade 
they may not benefit from active experimentation with working methods and techniques, but 
they may benefit from methods as observation, shadowing and working alongside others 
(Eraut, 2007) to develop initial competencies.
<<<PAGE=233>>>
217 
 
Task autonomy  
An important work characteristic for professional development is that of task autonomy. 
Whilst originally widely examined in relation to motivational work design approaches (i.e. 
Hackman and Oldman, 1976), autonomy has recently been investigated as predictor of 
workplace learning (Cerasoli et al., 2018; Kwakman, 2003; Fealsted et al., 2005). In line 
with research conducted by Messman and Mulder (2015), this study predicated that granting 
apprentices with autonomy would contribute to perceptions of empowerment, 
counterbalancing the demands of challenging work situations (Karasek and Theorell, 1990). 
Additionally, granting apprentices with discretion in conducting their job would enable them 
to approach challenging work with the learning activities deemed appropriate, thus fostering 
engagement in workplace learning (Doornbos et al., 2004).  
In testing the relationship between task autonomy and performance, this study identified a 
positive association between the former and work-role behaviours of adaptivity and 
proactivity, embodying skills of self-management and creative thinking. In particular, 
examination of the beta weights reveals that task autonomy is strongly related with 
proactivity, as in apprentices’ self-directed behaviours aimed at initiating change to improve 
their individual work tasks and to enhance the functioning of the organisation. This finding 
is in line with studies which found autonomy in relation with role breadth as in the extent 
individuals integrate a variety of tasks in their focal role (Morgeson, Delaney-Klinger and 
Hemingway, 2005). As discussed by Morgeson and colleagues (2005) when granted 
autonomy, employees are given the discretion required to integrate a variety of job aspects 
in their job, enticing them to perform work tasks beyond formal job requirements. In line 
with this interpretation, when apprentices have discretion in performing their tasks, they are 
more likely to engage in emergent self-started and future-oriented behaviours to bring about 
performance improvements.  
Additionally, autonomy is set to promote a sense of responsibility for work outcomes 
(Hackman and Oldman, 1976), in turn fostering apprentices’ proactivity to initiate 
constructive change. The critical psychological state of felt responsibility has indeed been 
found in positive association with performance behaviours of taking charge (Morrison and 
Phelps, 1999), revealing that employees feeling responsibility tend to engage in constructive 
efforts aimed at improvement. These interpretations are reflected in the positive correlation 
between autonomy and problem solving, indicating that empowered apprentices are more 
likely to engage with challenging situations to generate performance improvements. In
<<<PAGE=234>>>
218 
 
finding task autonomy in positive association with work-role behaviours of proactivity, this 
study extends research on apprenticeship that identified autonomy as predictor of reflection 
as particular informal learning activity (Messman and Mulder, 2015), providing preliminary 
evidence of the influence of this task characteristic on specific performance outcomes.  
Overall, the findings support the proposition that a work environment providing an optimal 
balance of challenges, autonomy and support enhances an active work orientation, fostering 
engagement in informal learning (Karasek and Theorell, 1990; Messman and Mulder, 2015). 
The positive correlations between support factors (social support and feedback), challenges 
(problem solving) and autonomy (task autonomy) demonstrate that when demanding work 
situations are counterbalanced by autonomy and support, constructive learning experiences 
arise. Additionally, the association of each factor with particular apprentices’ end -state 
competencies presents a nuanced understanding of the relative contribution of the work 
environment factors to apprentices’ professional development.  
Task interdependence 
Lastly, this study explored whether the interdependent nature of the job would influence 
apprentices’ competence development resulting in increased performance. Task 
interdependence is a situational variable represent ing the ‘connectedness’ of jobs to each 
other (Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006), reflecting the extent to which performance of one 
depends on the successful performance on the other (Kiggundu, 1983). As such, task 
interdependence is a multidimensional construct encompassing a) initiated interdependence, 
as in the extent to which work flows from one job to other jobs; and b) received task 
interdependence, as in the extent to which a job is affected by work from other jobs 
(Kiggundu, 1983). As discussed by Van der Vegt, Emans and Van de Vliert (1998), 
interdependence among team members influences individuals’ attitudes and responses 
presenting implications as motivational work factor.  
In investigating the association between task interdependence and apprentices’ work-role 
behaviours this study identifies a job characteristic conducive to apprentices’ competence 
development and presents evidence on the fact that a challenging, empowering and 
supportive work environment (Karasek and Theorell, 1990; Messman and Mulder, 2015) 
does not uniquely explain professional development. In fact, adding task interdependence to 
the informal learning factors discussed above appears to result in an increase in the amount 
of explained variance in reported job competence, team member and self-management skills.
<<<PAGE=235>>>
219 
 
When considering the former, in finding a positive association between task interdependence 
and individual task proficiency embodying job competence, this study presents evidence on 
the fact that jobs entailing collaboration and interaction among team members facilitate 
competence development. Although the degree of task interdependence varies among jobs, 
within roles and tasks, as well as over time (Van der Vegt and Van de Vliert, 2005), it 
emerges as critical structural factor for facilitating informal learning. This finding is in line 
with those of Cheetham and Chivers (2001) who found team working and collaborations to 
benefit the learning of professionals, and those of Eraut (2007) reporting how nurses, 
engineers and accountants identified group working as crucial source of learning.  
The finding can be explained considering task interdependence as structural factor that 
influences knowledge sharing in team settings, contributing to competence development. As 
discussed by Staples and Webster (2008), situations of high interdependence where team 
members rely on each other facilitate knowledge sharing enhancing learning processes. 
Knowledge sharing encompasses activities such as the exchange of ideas among colleagues, 
the discussion of problems and the request for advice (Bednall et al., 2014). Thus, when 
apprentices operate in interdependent systems, they benefit from interactions within their 
network and in being exposed to the sharing of tacit knowledge, gain competencies required 
for effectiveness. 
Additionally, the association between task interdependence and team member behaviours of 
proficiency and adaptivity is in line with the conceptualisation of work-role performance 
advanced by Griffin, Neal and Parker (2007). As discussed by the scholars, interdependence 
is pervasive to organisations and in determining the extent to which work roles are embedded 
in social systems, it defines whether individuals need to support the broader social context 
of the organisation. With organisations increasingly adopting team-based structures (Han 
and Williams, 2008) this study demonstrates that emergent professionals can learn how to 
operate as effective team members early in their career.  
The association between task interdependence and work role behaviours contributing to team 
effectiveness is in line with research that found task interdependence in positive relationship 
with helping behaviour in work teams (Van der Vegt and Van de Vliert, 2005). This finding 
can be explained considering that the interactive nature of work in interdependent contexts 
stimulates employees’ experienced responsibility for others’ team member outcomes 
(Kiggundu, 1983; Pearce and Gregersen, 1991). Correspondingly, when operating in
<<<PAGE=236>>>
220 
 
conditions of high interdependence apprentices internalise a sense of obligations towards 
colleagues and the team, and engage in behaviours contributing to the team effectiveness. 
Thus, an interpretation for this finding is that task interdependence influences apprentices’ 
team work-role behaviours through its effects on the cognitive state of felt responsibility 
(Pearce and Gregersen, 1991).  
In sum, this study presents preliminary evidence for the argument that structural features of 
the work environment such as task interdependence can support professional development. 
In so doing, this research extends scholarly knowledge on apprenticeships identifying task 
interdependence along with features promoting a challenging, empowering and supportive 
work environment as determinants of competence development. The positive association 
between informal learning factors and apprentices’ performance is consistent with meta -
analysis results demonstrating that informal learning behaviours explain a significant 
amount of variability in performance (Cerasoli et al., 2018), providing renewed evidence of 
the positive impact of informal learning for organisational effectiveness.  
Apprentices’ professional development over time 
When considering the longitudinal examination of the informal learning factors, the results 
of the T-test indicate that the drivers of informal learning remain stable over time, 
contributing to a positive environment for apprentices’ professional development. Notably, 
over the course of ten months apprentices report a significant increase in team member 
proactivity indicating that as they develop professionally, they engage more in self-initiated 
behaviours to bring about changes directed at improving the effectiveness of their team. This 
finding substantiates the relevance of regular day- to-day feedback from colleagues and 
supervisors for developing apprentices’ creative thinking skills. Feedback has indeed 
emerged as significant factor in relation to apprentices’ proactivity in both the cross -
sectional and the longitudinal study, validating its importance in relation to professional 
development.  
7.2.3 HRM system strength  
Based on the HRM process approach (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004), I posited that the HRM 
system strength would intensify the relationship between the apprenticeship training, 
encompassing formal and informal learning, and resultant competencies. The non-
significant results of this study are in contrast with prior research which found the HRM 
system strength to enhance the positive relationship between PA and participation in 
informal learning activities (Bednall et al., 2014) and between formal training and
<<<PAGE=237>>>
221 
 
subsequent participation in informal learning (Bednall and Sanders, 2016). As discussed in 
the previous chapter, the unanticipated results are however ascribed to the peculiarity of the 
sample under investigation and to the operationalisation of the HRM system strength 
construct.   
In particular, when considering apprentices transferring the knowledge and skills acquired 
at college and University to the workplace, the HRM system strength does not appear to 
influence training transfer in isolation. Additionally, the HRM system strength does not 
appear to influence the relationship between formal training and training transfer, suggesting 
that the impact of formal training on apprentices’ technical knowledge is independent of the 
HRM system. These findings are consistent with extant research on training transfer where 
job and career variables appear unrelated to the transfer process. Whilst some studies have 
found positive relationships between organisational commitment and training transfer 
(Kontoghiorghes, 2004), others have found non-significant relationships (Facteau et al., 
1995). As reported by Cheng and Hampson (2008), no solid evidence exists to suggest that 
variables as job involvement and career commitment present a significant relationship with 
training transfer.  
Additionally, the lack of influence of the HRM system strength on apprentices’ transferring 
the technical knowledge to the workplace can be interpreted in light of the dual status of 
worker and learner (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b) whereby apprentices are an integral part of 
two communities such as the organisation and the educational institution. As indicated by 
the qualitative data, apprentices appear to rely on colleagues, peers and supervisors both at 
college and within the company as important sources of support, whilst the HRM system 
emerges as distant. Accordingly, given that apprentices determine to which social group they 
should refer, these referent others (i.e. peers, college instructors, workplace supervisors) 
rather than the HRM system appear to play a determinant role in the transfer process (Cheng 
and Hampson, 2008). As argued by Cheng and Hampson (2008), in order to enhance training 
transfer salient referent others should be identified. Applying the principle of subjective 
norm, Cheng, Sanders and Hampson (2015) argue that in order to be effective the factors 
enhancing the transfer behaviour need to be valued by trainees, suggesting that the effec ts 
of support factors are hindered when trainees do not hold them as relevant. Consistent with 
this interpretation, the non-significant effect of the HRM system strength can be explained 
in light of apprentices not perceiving HR as salient referent group. Accordingly, the HRM 
system may need to be formally introduced to apprentices in order to sustain a positive
<<<PAGE=238>>>
222 
 
relational employment relationship (Tsui et al., 1997) and enhance the effects of formal 
training on performance.  
Similarly, the effects of informal learning on apprentices’ work -role performance have 
emerged as independent of the HRM system strength. The latter influences only the 
relationship between social support and organisation member proficiency, however in the 
negative direction. The negative interaction between social support and HRM system 
strength suggests a compensation effect whereby social support contributes to organisation 
member proficiency when the HRM system strength is weak. This finding can be explained 
considering the peculiarity of the outcome in relation to HRM. As discussed by Griffin, Neal 
and Parker (2007), organisation member proficiency refers to behaviours that contribute to 
the organisational effectiveness including supporting and defending organisational 
objectives (Borman and Motowidlo, 1993) and promoting the organisational image 
(Podsakoff et al., 2000). It is a construct closely related to organisational loyalty (Podsakoff 
et al., 2000), strongly resembling HR-related outcomes as commitment and organisation 
citizenship behaviours (Katou et al., 2014; Nishii et al, 2008). Given that such attitudes and 
behaviours are generally influenced by the HRM system (Huselid, 1995; Nishii and Wright, 
2008), the results of this study indicate that informal learning factors take prominence in 
situations of low HRM system strength compensating for low HR influence. This mechanism 
is aligned with the principles of substitutes for leadership theory (Kerr and Jermier, 1978; 
Podsakoff, MacKenzie and Bommer, 1996) in presenting a competing and complementing 
effect. According to the theory, a variety of situational variables related to the subordinate, 
the task and the organisation may substitute, neutralise or enhance the leaders’ influence on 
employees’ performance. As argued by the original  contributors, in situations where these 
variables are scarce, leadership becomes important; conversely, in situations where these 
variables are present, leadership becomes irrelevant (Kerr and Jermier, 1978). 
Correspondingly, social support is a prominent factor in contributing to organisation member 
proficiency in situation of low HRM system strength, acting as substitute for HRM.  
7.2.4 Performance appraisal satisfaction  
Although the HRM system strength did not emerge as instrumental for the apprenticeship 
effectiveness, this study presents original insight in establishing the influence of HRM on 
apprentices’ competence development by means of PA satisfaction. In so doing, this study 
provides empirical support for the notion that a positive employment relationship (Tsui et
<<<PAGE=239>>>
223 
 
al., 1997) as portrayed by the HR practice of PA strengthens the effects of informal learning 
on apprentices’ competence development.  
Observing the interaction between PA as a mechanism for developing and motivating 
employees and the considered work environment factors, this study reveals that apprentices 
experiencing PA satisfaction approach problem solving and feedback as learning 
opportunities. The findings support extant research on early career professionals which 
identified the significance of long-term strategic feedback on general progress (Eraut, 2007), 
explaining why this matter in relation to apprentices engaging with informal learning. This 
can be explained considering that apprentices experiencing developmental PA feel part of a 
relational employment relationship characterised by open-ended exchanges and long-term 
mutual investments (Lepak and Snell, 1999) in turn fostering their reciprocation by making 
greater use of informal learning opportunities.  
This interpretation is aligned with the principles of social exchange (1964), where 
organisations’ investments in employees’ development in turn foster employees’ 
reciprocation with positive attitudes and behaviours (Eisenberger et al., 1990; Setton et al., 
1996). It follows that PA satisfaction engenders apprentices’ in experiencing a feeling of 
organisational support contributing to a positive employment relationship (Kuvaas, 2008; 
Tsui et al., 1997). Consecutively, apprentices feel obliged to reciprocate the organisation for 
investing in their development by making greater use of the developmental opportunities 
provided by the immediate work environment. As revealed by this study, apprentices’ 
experiencing PA satisfaction approach problem solving as mean for competence 
development and make greater use of the informal day- to-day feedback received from 
colleagues and supervisors. 
Additionally, in uncovering a moderating effect of PA satisfaction on the relationships 
between both problem solving and feedback and apprentices’ work -role behaviours 
contributing to the team and the organisational effectiveness, this study identifies PA as 
potential mechanism in converting individual learning to better functioning of the team and 
the organisation. This cross-transfer of benefits (Aguinis and Kraiger, 2009) can be 
explained considering that PA entails the communication of organisational strategies, goals 
and vision (Kuvaas, 2006). In so doing, PA has the potential to elucidate how the work of 
the individual is related to team and organisational goals (Kuvaas, 2011) and to uphold the 
identification of the individual with the organisation and the team (Levy and Williams,
<<<PAGE=240>>>
224 
 
2004). It follows that, given that performance is a cross-level construct in that individual 
performance influences team and organisational performance (Den Hartog, Boselie and 
Paauwe, 2004), PA fosters apprentices’ understanding of the interdependency of their role 
within the organisation and so helps them to understand how their role supports the broader 
social context (Griffin, Neal and Parker, 2007). This finding is insightful in illustrating the 
influence of PA on contextual performance, as in behaviours that support the broader 
organisational, social and psychological environment (Borman and Motowidlo, 1993) and 
in so doing responds to previous calls for an investigation of the influence of PA on different 
types of performance (Kuvaas, 2006).  
Overall, the findings underscore the importance of positive appraisal reactions (Kuvaas, 
2006) and extend research by demonstrating that PA influences how employees respond to 
the learning potential of the work environment. In so doing, the findings provide novel 
insight into the many unanswered questions about the effectiveness of performance 
management (Schleichter et al., 2018). In particular, the findings complement research that 
found regular daily feedback from multiple sources to contribute to a positive relationship 
between PA reactions and performance (Kuvaas, 2011). More specifically, the positive 
interaction between PA and feedback is consistent with the argument that feedback needs to 
be provided regularly between PA activities (Kuvaas, Buch and Dysvik, 2017) and 
demonstrates how PA satisfaction fosters engagement with daily feedback and problem 
solving as learning opportunities. Additionally, identifying PA as the mechanism fostering 
contextual performance (Borman and Motowidlo, 1993), this research enhances the 
understanding of how individual learning results in better functioning of the team and the 
organisation (Aguinis and Kraiger, 2009) providing novel insight into the effectiveness of 
PA.   
7.2.5 Learning goal orientation 
Extant research has established that learning goal orientation is consistently associated with 
learning and performance (i.e. Kozlowski et al., 2001; VandeWalle et al., 1999). This study 
extends knowledge by empirically testing how the motivational trait of learning goal 
orientation interacts with work environment factors to influence apprentices’ competence 
development and resultant performance. The results are insightful in revealing that learning 
goal orientation is particularly critical for emergent performance behaviours such as 
adaptivity and proactivity (Griffin, Neal and Parker, 2007) illustrating how apprentices with 
high learning goal orientation make greater use of social support, feedback from colleagues
<<<PAGE=241>>>
225 
 
and supervisors and task interdependence. The effects of these informal learning factors on 
apprentices’ adaptivity and proactivity are indeed stronger when apprentices display high 
levels of learning goal orientation. 
In uncovering the moderating role of learning goal orientation between work environment 
factors and emergent performance behaviours, this study explains why some apprentices are 
more likely to engage in work-role behaviours of adaptivity and proactivity than others are. 
Accordingly, learning goal orientation is a crucial individual dimension for engaging in 
emergent change-oriented behaviours critical for effectiveness (Griffin, Neal and Parker, 
2007).  As discussed by Griffin, Parker and Mason (2010), adaptivity and proactivity are 
emergent behaviours that differ between each other in relation to the locus of change. Whilst 
the former reflects a successful response to an externally initiated change, the latter reflects 
self-initiated efforts to change the self or the environment (Griffin, Parker and Mason, 2010). 
Given that both behaviours are initiated by the individual, rather than imposed or 
standardised (Griffin, Neal and Parker, 2007), learning goal orientation is critical to explain 
how these behaviours emerge. 
Learning goal orientation and adaptivity  
The effects of goal orientation on adaptive performance are well established (Baard et al., 
2014; Pulakos et al., 2000; Pulakos et al., 2002). As discussed by Baard, Rench and 
Kozlowski (2014), learning goal orientation has emerged as salient individual difference that 
in affecting the self-regulatory mechanisms in the learning process contributes to adaptive 
performance. In particular, learning goal orientation has been found to hold important 
implications for both cognitive and affective self-regulatory processes such as self-
evaluation activities (Kozlowski and Bell, 2006), feedback seeking (VandeWalle and 
Cummings, 1997) and emotional control (Porath and Bateman, 2006). Here, this study 
demonstrates how the motivational disposition of learning goal orientation interacts with 
work environment factors to enhance apprentices’ adaptivity. 
In finding the relationships between both social support and feedback from colleagues and 
supervisor with team member adaptivity influenced by learning goal orientation, this study 
illustrates how the effects of a supportive work environment on competence development 
may differ depending on individuals’ goal orientation. Specifically, learning goal orientation 
is important for strengthening the effects of social support and regular day- to-day feedback 
from colleagues and supervisors on apprentices’ self-management skills, as in the ability to
<<<PAGE=242>>>
226 
 
adapt to changes affecting their role as team members. This finding suggests that learning-
oriented apprentices try to establish high quality exchanges with colleagues and supervisors 
and to take advantage of informal feedback in order to develop competence and skills.  
In line with research conducted by Janssen and Van Yperen (2004) learning goal orientation 
shapes the way individuals interpret and react to the interpersonal context in achievement 
situations. Consistent with results presented by Janssen and Van Yperen (2004) where 
employees with stronger learning orientations were more effective on their job because they 
established high-quality exchanges with their supervisors, goal orientation here explains 
why apprentices engage differently with relevant social actors. Accordingly, given that 
learning oriented apprentices strive towards competence development, colleagues and 
supervisors are perceived as valuable sources of knowledge and expertise. Similarly, the 
moderating effect of learning goal orientation on the relationship between task 
interdependence and team member- and organisation member- adaptivity reveals how 
learning-oriented apprentices take greater advantage of this structural factor benefitting from 
knowledge sharing in interdependent systems (Runhaar et al., 2016; Staples and Webster, 
2008).  
The moderating effect of learning goal orientation on apprentices’ adaptivity has at least two 
interpretations. Adaptivity represents how individuals cope with and support changes that 
affect the task or the work environment (Griffin, Neal and Parker, 2007) and in manifesting 
a response to an externally initiated change involves efforts to develop new competencies in 
order to successfully respond to the new situation (Shoss, Witt and Vera, 2012). Given that 
learning-oriented individuals hold an incremental view of their abilities, as malleable 
attribute that can be further developed through effort and experience (Dweck and Leggett, 
1988), they are more adept at adaptivity as effort is perceived as the strategy required for  
task mastery (Bell and Kozlowski, 2002).  
Secondly, research has established that learning goal orientation helps to increase or 
maintain self-efficacy (i.e. Bell and Kozlowski, 2002; Button et al., 1996; Ford et al., 1998) 
and is a motivational factor leading to persistence in face of difficulties (Dweck, 1986; 
Dweck and Leggett, 1988). In particular, self-efficacy is central to adaptability given that 
adaptable behaviours depend on having the confidence to perform such behaviours (Griffin 
and Hesketh, 2003) and has been found to predict performance adaptability emerging as 
important determinant of self-regulation when changes in task demands occur (Kozwloski
<<<PAGE=243>>>
227 
 
et al., 2001). Similar findings arose in the social domain, where scholars investigated the 
influence of learning goal orientation in situations of cross-cultural adjustment where new 
norms, skills and behaviours need to be learnt in order to function effectively. Gong and Fan 
(2006) present compelling evidence that learning goal orientation leads to the development 
and maintenance of self-efficacy during the cultural acquisition process, in turn leading to 
successful cultural adjustment.  
When applying these interpretations to the context of apprenticeships, learning-oriented 
apprentices are adept at adaptivity because in perceiving effort as in the strategy required for 
task mastery, they draw on the support provided by their social network to develop their 
knowledge and skills. Additionally, learning-oriented apprentices hold high levels of self-
efficacy, which enables them to remain focused and persevere when facing challenges in the 
competence acquisition process (Bandura, 1982; VandeWalle et al., 2001). 
Learning goal orientation and proactivity  
The moderating effect of learning goal orientation on the relationship between task 
interdependence and both individual task- and organisation member- proactivity, identifies 
the conditions under which informal learning drivers contribute to emergent performance 
behaviours embodying skills of creative thinking. The finding is consistent with research 
that found learning goal orientation in direct association with proactive behaviour (Belschak 
and Den Hartog, 2010; Parker and Collins 2010), innovative behaviour (Janssen and Van 
Yperen, 2004; Runhaar et al., 2016) and creativity (Hirst, Van Knippenberg and Zhou, 
2009).  
The moderating effects of learning goal orientation on apprentices’ proactivity has several 
interpretations. Firstly, given that proactivity reflects self-initiated change to actively 
transform oneself or the environment (Griffin, Parker and Mason, 2010), learning goal 
orientation is critical in shaping apprentices self-regulatory proactive behaviours. As 
reported by Porath and Bateman (2006), learning orientation predicts proactive behaviour 
encompassing actions leading to constructive change rather than passive adaptation, 
resulting in higher job performance. Secondly, given that learning goal orientation is 
associated with a preference for challenging and demanding tasks leading to self-
improvement (VandeWalle, 1997), learning-oriented individuals tend to view proactive 
behaviours as worthwhile developmental opportunities (Parker and Collins, 2010).
<<<PAGE=244>>>
228 
 
Similarly, learning-oriented individuals are more strongly motivated to pursue creative 
activities involving uncertainty and potential for failure (Hirst et al., 2009).  
Consistent with research exploring the influence of goal orientation on the relationship 
between task conflict and creativity (De Clercq, Rahman and Belausteguigoitia, 2015), this 
study provides evidence that a strong learning orientation fosters the learning potential of 
interdependent systems resulting in proactive behaviours required for effectiveness. In 
particular, a learning orientation increases the person’s ability to extricate knowledge from 
social exchanges typical of team working settings (Staples and Webster, 2008). It also fosters 
feedback seeking behaviours as a means to gather information and develop skills 
(Vandewalle and Cummings, 1997), sustaining apprentices in taking advantage of social 
interactions in interdependent systems.  
Additionally, research presents compelling evidence that self-efficacy predicts proactive 
behaviours as taking charge (Morrison and Phelps, 1999). In particular, role-breadth self-
efficacy defined as the individual beliefs in ones’ abil ities to carry out broader and more 
proactive roles (Parker, 1998) has been found to directly influence behaviours of taking 
charge (McAllister, Kamdar, Morrison and Turban, 2007). In a subsequent study, leader 
vision was associated with increases in proactivity over time when individuals displayed 
high role breadth self-efficacy illustrating how individuals with strong self-efficacy respond 
to the challenges presented by the leader by proactively taking charge (Gr iffin, Parker and 
Mason, 2010). Overall, se lf-efficacy has emerged as important determinant of proactive 
performance and can explain why learning-oriented apprentices tend to benefit from working 
in interdependent systems developing the competencies required to engage in proactive 
work-behaviours. In sum, these findings demonstrate that learning goal orientation is a 
motivational characteristic with significant implications for apprentices’ competence 
development in informal and unstructured learning processes. Correspondingly, the findings 
suggest that the informal learning drivers of the work environment may not be universally 
beneficial for individuals in fostering the competencies required for engaging in proactive 
and adaptive work-role behaviours.  
Learning goal orientation and task autonomy 
Conversely, the negative interaction of learning goal orientation and task autonomy on 
individual task proficiency, team member proficiency and organisation member adaptivity 
was unexpected. The results suggest that although learning goal orientation is a significant
<<<PAGE=245>>>
229 
 
predictor of the considered performance outcomes, when interacting with task autonomy, its 
effects are nullified. This finding is consistent with the proposition that situational 
characteristics can restrict the expression of individual traits and limit their influence on 
performance. As argued by Meyer, Dalal and Hermida (2010), the simultaneous and 
interactive study of individual differences and situational characteristics enables to discern 
the conditions under which individual traits are important predictors of performance, 
providing evidence on the relative utility of various predictors.  
Accordingly, in this study learning goal orientation emerges as significant predictor only 
when unrelated to task autonomy, suggesting that learning-oriented individuals do not 
benefit from autonomy for specific performance outcomes. In particular, the findings 
illustrate that task autonomy is positively and significantly related to performance 
(individual task- and team member-proficiency) only for individuals with low levels of 
learning goal orientation. On the contrary, for learning-oriented individuals the effects of 
task autonomy on proficient work-role behaviours are non-significant and potentially 
negative. Additionally, when considering the outcome of organisation member adaptivity, 
task autonomy has a significant effect only for individuals with average or low levels of 
learning goal orientation, and its effect increases for apprentices scoring low on the 
motivational trait of learning orientation. In general, the negative interaction suggest that 
providing autonomy to apprentices produces different results depending on their learning 
orientation. Specifically, apprentices displaying low levels of learning goal orientation 
appear to benefit from the provision of autonomy, whilst learning oriented apprentices do 
not appear to value task autonomy or perceive it negatively. 
The positive association between task autonomy and work-role performance behaviours for 
low learning-oriented apprentices can be explained considering the influence of autonomy 
on self-efficacy (Bandura, 1982). The positive influence of autonomy on self-efficacy has 
been demonstrated by Wang and Netemeyer (2002) illustrating how providing employees 
with autonomy sends the message that the organisation has confidence in their abilities to 
carry out the job successfully in turn enhancing employees’ self -confidence. Accordingly, 
presenting low learning-oriented apprentices with discretion and control in carrying out their 
jobs positively influences their efficacy judgements, with implications for performance 
outcomes. Additionally, given that in situations of high autonomy, positive work outcomes 
are dependent on individuals’ efforts and initiatives (Hackman and Oldman, 1976),
<<<PAGE=246>>>
230 
 
providing low-learning oriented apprentices with autonomy is likely to entice them to exert 
efforts to achieve effective performance. 
On the other hand, learning-oriented apprentices do not appear to benefit from autonomy as 
they are by disposition confident in their ability to expand their competencies through effort 
and experience (Dweck and Leggett, 1988). The nullified and potentially negative effect of 
task autonomy for learning-oriented apprentices can be interpreted in light of the attributions 
apprentices make concerning the use of such practice. Highly learning-oriented apprentices, 
striving towards developing knowledge and skills, may perceive the organisation efforts to 
provide them with autonomy as motivated by self-interest rather than concern for their 
development. Apprentices may thus perceive that the organisation provides them with 
autonomy in order to exploit them as in getting more out of them in terms of productivity. 
As demonstrated by Nishii and colleagues (2008), attributions that HR practices reflect 
management intentions to exploit employees, rather than investing in employees’ 
development and wellbeing, are negatively related to employees’ commitment and 
satisfaction. Accordingly, learning-oriented apprentices are likely to perceive high 
autonomy as a deterrent to their competence development, which in constraining them to 
secure productive results limits their learning processes. Overall, the findings suggest that 
when empowering apprentices, organisations need to consider their learning orientation a s 
the effects of task autonomy vary among individuals depending on the motivational 
disposition. 
Learning goal orientation and formal learning  
Although learning goal orientation emerged as important personal factor in fostering 
professional development in the work environment, when considered in relation to formal 
training at college and University the results were non-significant. Learning goal orientation 
neither predicted transfer of knowledge and skills to the workplace in isolation, nor 
reinforced the effects of formal training on training transfer. The results suggest that learning 
goal orientation is a critical trait in unstructured situations where engagement in informal 
learning is dependent on individual initiative (Billett, 2001; Bednall et al., 2014), and is less 
relevant in highly structured settings such as formal training. Although this finding is in 
contrast with prior research which found learning goal orientation in positive relationship 
with training transfer (i.e. Chiaburu and Marinova, 2005), meta-analysis results presented 
by Blume and colleagues (2010) found learning goal orientation to present only small 
correlations (.14) with training transfer. Additionally, the scholars report how most studies
<<<PAGE=247>>>
231 
 
investigating learning goal orientation examined transfer in laboratory settings with little or 
no time lag between training and the transfer measurement yielding consistently stronger 
relationships than studies where a time lag was introduced (Blume et al., 2010). Overall, the 
motivational factor of learning goal orientation is a critical contingency associated with 
apprentices’ benefitting from informal learning in the workplace, illustrating how 
apprentices’ ability to learn from the experiences provided by the work environment may 
vary.  
 
7.3 Practical implications 
Implications for organisations  
This study offers a number of practical implications for organisations investing in 
apprenticeship and for promoting employees’ development more generally. First, 
management can foster the transfer of knowledge and skills acquired at college and 
University securing alignment between formal training and work. In this respect, the content 
of training should be inspired by the actual job description, reflecting current and prospective 
roles and responsibilities. As advocated by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and 
Development (2017) apprenticeships should be embedded in a workforce planning approach 
whereby the training is structured around the knowledge and skills required for the role 
profile envisioned for the apprentice. Additionally, training should present practical 
examples and exercises through case studies or consultancy projects facilitating apprentices’ 
understanding of the application of technical knowledge in practice.  In identifying transfer 
design as crucial for securing returns on investments, this study evidences that when 
selecting the training provider for delivering the apprenticeship technical knowledge, 
organisations should consider whether the training content is relevant for practice, and 
whether it includes activities and exercises supporting the transfer of training to the 
workplace.  
Furthermore, having identified the role of the supervisor as critical for sustaining apprentices 
in transferring the knowledge acquired in formal training to the workplace, this study draws 
attention to the role of line managers. These are key figures that should be included in 
discussions related to the choice of training content and in setting out a plan for supporting 
apprentices in the transfer process. As reported by Grossman and Salas (2011), goal setting 
can significantly enhance transfer, enabling trainees to agree proximal and distal goals with
<<<PAGE=248>>>
232 
 
their supervisors and work towards these in a supportive environment. Notably, the goal 
setting process should involve both managers and apprentices, with the former establishing 
predetermined goals and the latter actively participating to the goal –setting process. As 
discussed by Gibb (2014), involvement of the individual is critical to ensure self-regulation 
in achieving the intended behaviours given the motivational processes brought into place 
when individuals take ownership of the goals. 
Added to this, line management involvement is beneficial to ensure high quality training in 
apprenticeship given that line managers are critical figures with an all-embracing 
understanding of both the organisational and the individual needs (Gibb, 2003). 
Accordingly, involving line managers in the design and delivery of apprenticeships is 
essential for ensuring app renticeships contribute to the organisation’s long -term strategy 
providing the skills required for responding to current and future business needs, and for 
securing their commitment. As reported by Shipton, Pirrioni and Wu (2016), close 
involvement of line managers allows organisations to secure the best results possible and to 
develop talent aligned with the business strategy. This is particularly important in the context 
of Degree Apprenticeships where line managers are deemed critical support figures in 
integrating academic and workplace learning (Rowe et al., 2017).  
Secondly, organisations can adopt a number of interventions to promote apprentices’ 
competence development in the workplace. A supportive work environment characterised 
by positive relationships among colleagues and superiors and regular day- to-day informal 
feedback is particularly important for developing job competence, team working and 
effective participation skills. Added to this, challenging work experiences that in presenting 
novel and complex situations activate a learning response towards the task are valuable to 
develop creative thinking and self-management skills. Likewise, the structure of work in 
both empowering apprentices with autonomy in conducting their job and in presenting a 
certain degree of interdependence within the work system increasing interpersonal contacts 
is crucial for enabling professional development. Attention to the allocation and structure of 
work is therefore crucial for enhancing the quantity and quality of learning in the workplace 
(Eraut, 2007). Again, the role of the line manager is critical in designing apprentices’ 
workload to ensure the right level of challenge, autonomy, interdependence and support. As 
discussed by Cheetham and Chivers (2001) and echoed by Becker and Bish (2017), although 
learning in the workplace is a natural process, planning and structuring work experiences is 
important in ensuring trainees gain maximum benefit from informal learning.
<<<PAGE=249>>>
233 
 
In particular, given the relevance of regular feedback from colleagues, line managers ought 
to prepare existing employees in sustaining apprentices’ development sharing experience, 
imparting knowledge and recognising apprentices’ expected contributions. Additionally, a 
positive learning environment should present apprentices with opportunities to seek help and 
assistance when required, whilst operating in interdependent systems should enable 
apprentices to acquire valuable tacit knowledge. Notably, when designing apprentices’ 
workload, line managers should be attentive to individuals’ dispositional goals in 
achievement situations. Specifically, when empowering apprentices in providing them with 
discretion in carrying out tasks and setting objectives, line managers should be aware that 
apprentices might respond differently depending on their learning orientation. As suggested 
by the findings, only low learning-oriented apprentices rather than high learning-oriented 
apprentices are likely to positively perceive task autonomy, as a means to boost their self-
efficacy and sustain performance. On the other hand, high learning-oriented apprentices may 
perceive high autonomy as pressure to perform, constraining them from expanding their 
knowledge and skills. Accordingly, when providing task autonomy to foster competence 
development, management should ensure a fit between the level of task autonomy and 
individual differences in terms of learning goal orientation.  
Another important practical implication arises from the finding that satisfaction with PA 
moderates the relationship between problem solving and regular day- to-day feedback 
respectively and performance. The findings reveal that apprentices benefit the most from 
informal learning if constructive PA is in place, drawing attention to the role of line managers 
in delivering high quality appraisals. In order to obtain satisfaction with PA apprentices need 
to perceive the appraisal as developmental practice aimed at developing competent 
professionals (Kuvaas, 2006). The delivery of normative feedback should thus be 
contextualised into communicating development plans related to apprentices’ career 
progression in the organisation. Additionally, as reported by DeNisi and Sonesh (2011 ), 
factors determining employees’ satisf action with PA include trust towards the evaluator, 
two-way communication, perceptions that the appraisal fosters future improvements, 
identification of individuals’ strengths and weaknesses, and frequent and consistent 
feedback. These are important consideration given that PA satisfaction contributes to 
maintaining a positive employment relationship between the apprentice and the employer in 
turn fostering engagement with informal learning.
<<<PAGE=250>>>
234 
 
Overall, the role of the line manager emerges as critical in both crafting apprentices’ 
workload to ensure positive learning experiences and in delivering high quality PA. 
Consequently, enhancing supervisor’s ability to support apprentices’ professional 
development should be integrated into management training programmes. Alternatively, 
mentoring of line managers with more experienced colleagues or HR professionals could 
support the development of competencies required for delivering effective apprenticeships. 
Accordingly, organisations investing in apprenticeships should give priority to develop line 
management competencies for supporting apprentices featuring them in management 
development programmes and in management appraisals.  
Additionally, the moderating role of the individual disposition of learning goal orientation 
on the relationship between task interdependence and performance indicates that apprentices 
may benefit differently from the learning potential of the work environment. For high 
learning-oriented individuals, task interdependence provides an opportunity to learn in 
knowledge-sharing settings, whilst for low learning-oriented individuals, task 
interdependence may be less effective in terms of acquiring knowledge and skills. Similarly, 
the effects of feedback and social support on competence development are likely to differ 
depending on apprentices’ lear ning orientation. Accordingly, managers need to facilitate a 
learning orientation so that apprentices can better self-regulate and effectively benefit from 
the learning potential of the work environment.  
Ultimately, the results highlight that practitioners need to consider both individual 
dispositions and contextual factors as boundary conditions influencing the learning potential 
of the immediate work environment. On the individual level, learning goal orientation can 
be considered during the selection process as relevant criteria in apprenticeships (i.e. 
VandeWalle et al., 1999). Additionally, given that learning goal orientation is a malleable 
trait with both situational and dispositional aspects (Button et al., 1996), it presents potential 
for being stimulated by managerial interventions. As reported by DeRue and Wellman 
(2009), organisations can evoke and reinforce a learning orientation emphasising that errors 
and mistakes are an ordinary aspect of learning and should be viewed as cues for further 
development. Similarly, line managers placing emphasis on development, encouraging 
learning from mistakes and measuring progress using learning goals, can prime a learning 
goal orientation (Dragoni, 2005). Socialisation processes are also pivotal is influencing 
apprentices’ orientation towards competence development, and changing apprentices’ 
attributions about ability and performance can positively influence their learning orientation
<<<PAGE=251>>>
235 
 
(VandeWalle, 2003). Additionally, practices such as developmental PA can maintain a 
learning orientation in identifying learning needs and setting development goals (Elicker, 
2006) rather than encouraging competition and interpersonal comparisons which can 
encourage a performance orientation and detract from learning (VandeWalle, 2003).  
On the contextual level, HR practices such as developmental PA communicate the 
organisation’s intent towards the apprentice and contribute to establishing a high -quality 
relationship based on mutuality and trust. Given the influence of satisfaction with PA on 
apprentices’ responses to problem solving and feedback as informal learning drivers, this 
study draws attention to the communicative function of the HR system (Guest, 2011). In 
particular, the benefits of PA have emerged as exceptionally salient for emergent 
professionals in both establishing a relational employment relationship with the 
organisation, and in elucidating how the role of the individual apprentice contributes to team 
and organisational goals. It follows that investments in HR practices should be viewed as 
the strategy for building and managing the high quality employment relationship required 
for securing maximum returns from apprenticeships. This is particularly important in 
ensuring apprentices positively respond to the learning opportunities provided by the 
immediate work environment in ways that benefit themselves and the organisation (Kuvaas, 
2008) and in securing apprentices’ retention  in the long term. Overall, this study presents 
insights into how organisations investing in apprenticeships can maximise emergent 
professionals’ development and benefit from a productive and committed workforce.  
Implications for apprentices  
Lastly, the study presents practical implications for apprentices as learners. Firstly, high er 
and degree apprenticeships are valid alternatives to traditional university programmes, 
particularly in relation to increasing discussions over the work readiness of university 
graduates (Lowden et al., 2011; Tomlinson, 2012). In combining higher education with a 
job, higher and degree apprenticeships offer the opportunity to develop transferable skills 
and professional competence whilst gaining high level qualifications, tackling issues related 
to employability (Rowe et al., 2017). However, when considering lower level 
apprenticeships (Level 2 and 3), the review of the literature has revealed how approaches to 
apprentices development range from expansive to restrictive (Fuller and Unwin, 2003b) 
resulting in great variability for career and educational progression. Accordingly, when 
choosing an apprenticeship at intermediate or advanced level, attention should be given to
<<<PAGE=252>>>
236 
 
the extent the programme provides apprentices with the skills and qualifications required for 
future career and educational progression.  
When in the workplace, apprentices should approach challenges as positive developmental 
opportunities. In particular, engaging in problem solving is beneficial for developing the 
ability to adapt to constant changes as well as the ability to proactively initiate chan ges 
bringing performance improvements. These skills are exceptionally valuable in knowledge-
intensive industries where innovation and development are central and are increasingly 
required in the workplace. Additionally, apprentices should strive to learn from daily 
feedback provided from colleagues and supervisors as well as to extricate knowledge from 
informal daily interactions. In sum, approaching work with a learning orientation can foster 
the development of critical competencies enabling apprentices to fully develop 
professionally.  
 
7.4 Policy implications  
This study presents implications for policy that in light of the current apprenticeship reform 
can improve the quality of the programme. Transfer design has emerged as critical factor for 
securing returns from investments in formal training delivered at College and University. 
This finding underscores the importance of school-work alignment in apprenticeships 
(Messman and Mulder, 2015; Pineda-Herrero et al., 2015; Renta Davids et al., 2017) and 
points to the need to develop synergies between employers and the education system (Lee, 
2012). Accordingly, in order to ensure that colleges and Universities design and deliver 
training in ways that promote transfer, transfer design should become a mandatory criterion. 
Employers and training providers (colleges and Universities) should discuss and agree a 
training transfer strategy to ensure the delivery of training content aligned with the job along 
with activities elucidating how theory relates to practice. Such ex ante measure, can furthe r 
the alignment between school and work and secure returns from investments in formal 
training.  
Added to this, given that line managers are critical figures in designing and delivering 
effective apprenticeships, training of line managers should become mandatory for 
organisations relying on public funds. Correspondingly, organisations recruiting apprentices 
should invest in line management capacity to ensure the organisation has the capabilities to 
deliver quality apprenticeships. Line management training should cover areas as designing
<<<PAGE=253>>>
237 
 
apprentices’ workload, delivering inductions and PA, managing career development, 
fostering a learning orientation and supporting training transfer. Making line management 
training a mandatory requirement for drawing on public funds has the potential to increase 
consistency among apprenticeships and improve the quality of the programme.  
 
7.5 Limitations and directions for future research  
Although this study made significant contributions to the apprenticeship literature, it 
presents some limitations. Firstly, the cross-sectional design precludes any inferences about 
causality. Whilst a second wave of data collection was conducted to introduce a longitudinal 
design, the restricted sample size limited the power for inference test (Hair et al., 2014). 
Future research is needed to validate the results with a larger sample size adopting a 
longitudinal approach to examine causality. Additionally, although apprenticeships follow a 
standardised format and the survey was designed to be generic and applicable over a range 
of job types, this study is based exclusively on apprentices operating in the engineering 
sector. Cross-validation of the results with apprentices operating in other sectors such as 
health and social care, business and administration, media and construction would be 
valuable. Equally, given that the study is based on survey data complemented by qualitative 
data in the form of statements, further data sources may be useful. Interviews may provide 
further insight into the understanding of how and why various factors hinder or enhance 
apprentices’ competence development.  
Secondly, the use of self-report measurements presents a limitation of the study. Although 
appropriate steps were adopted in the research design in order to minimise common method 
bias and Harman’s one -factor test (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986) revealed that common 
method bias was not problematic, future research may improve the research design by 
collecting data from different sources. For example, data on the independent and moderator 
variables may be collected from apprentices, whilst data on the dependent variables may be 
collected from supervisors. Additionally, introducing a time lag in the data collection of the 
predictors and the criterion can limit the possibility of reverse causality. Supposedly, 
apprentices performing well may be granted more autonomy in conducting their jobs; 
alternatively, high performers may report a positive perception of feedback availability. As 
suggested by Morrison and Bies (1991) individuals are more likely to seek feedback when 
they perform well (see VandeWalle, 2003 pp. 586) indicating that highly performing 
apprentices may perceive the availability of feedback from colleagues and supervisors more
<<<PAGE=254>>>
238 
 
positively. Accordingly, collecting data on the independent and the dependent variables in 
subsequent waves can rule out similar eventualities.  
Despite these limitations, the study presents an empirical basis for theoretical advances on 
the factors faci litating emergent professionals’ development. In particular, this study 
considered the direct relationship between the a pprenticeship programme and apprentices’ 
resultant performance without investigating the mechanisms underlying this process. 
Multiple mediators can explain the relationship between the independent and dependent 
variables, thus future research can further the understanding of the mechanisms linking the 
formal and informal learning factors with resultant performance. When considering the 
former, research could examine whether the relationship between transfer design and 
training transfer is mediated by work environment feedback request (Diamantidis and 
Chatzoglou, 2014). Additionally, this mechanism could potentially be moderated by the role 
of the supervisor, as individuals perceiving high levels of supervisor support (Chiaburu and 
Marinova, 2005) may be more likely to engage in requesting feedback on their application 
of knowledge and skills acquired in training.  
When considering the influence of the informal learning factors on performance several 
mechanisms could be investigated. Firstly, research could examine the mediating effects of 
particular informal learning activities on performance. For example, the relationship 
between task interdependence and performance could be mediated by knowledge-sharing 
with colleagues (Bednall et al., 2014). Similarly, reflection on daily activities (Bednall and 
Sanders, 2016) may mediate the relationship between task autonomy and performance. 
Secondly, psychological states such as felt responsibility (Pearce and Gregersen, 1991) and 
self-efficacy (Wang and Netemeyer, 2002) may mediate the relationship between task 
autonomy and problem solving with performance. Exploring these mechanisms may provide 
an enhanced understanding of the complex processes at the basis of emergent professionals’ 
development.  
Additionally, this study investigated only two boundary conditions that influence the 
relationship between the apprenticeship and apprentices’ resultant competencies (i.e. HRM 
system and individual learning goal orientation). Further research is needed to identify 
potential contextual and individual factors that may interact with the formal and informal 
learning factors to affect apprentices’ performance. For example, cognitive ability has been 
identified as significant predictor of training transfer (Burke and Hutchins, 2007) in that
<<<PAGE=255>>>
239 
 
individuals high in cognitive ability can more easily acquire and apply new competencies 
(Grossman and Salas, 2011). Given the well-established relevance of cognitive ability in 
formal training contexts, this variable presents potential implications for the success of less 
structured learning programmes such as apprenticeships. Investigating cognitive ability as 
moderator of the relationship between informal learning factors and resultant performance 
may provide a clearer understanding of the individuals who may benefit the most from 
workplace learning. Added to this, individual predispositions such as personality and 
propensity factors have been associated with engagement with informal learning behaviours 
(Cerasoli et al., 2018; Noe, Tews and Marand, 2013). Accordingly, Raemdonck and 
colleagues (2014) have called for studies investigating the moderating role of proactive 
personality on the relationship between job characteristics and learning outcomes.  
At contextual level, this study measured HR practices (i.e. PA) as determinants of a high 
quality employment relationship. The latter may however be measured in terms of perceived 
organisational support, affective organisational commitment, procedural and interactional 
justice as different indicators of the employment relationship (Kuvaas, 2008). In so doing, 
particular attitudes and attributions could illustrate why individuals engage differently with 
the learning opportunities presented in the immediate work environment.  
Ultimately, whilst this study focused on apprentices as emergent professionals, the findings 
present valuable implications for employee development more generally. Given that the 
apprenticeship development model draws on theories of training transfer (Baldwin and Ford, 
1988), workplace learning (Eraut, 2007; Raemdonck et al., 2014; Skule, 2004) and the well-
established Demand-Control-Support Model (Karasek and Theorell, 1990), the findings are 
relevant for human resource development in general and could be replicated in other 
contexts.  
 
7.6 Conclusion  
This research introduced an organisational perspective to the study of apprenticeship turning 
the focus to the work environment as enabler of competence development. In so doing, it 
constructed and empirically tested a model for apprenticeship development that specifies 
how formal and informal learning contribute to the development of apprentices’ 
competencies. In testing the association of formal and informal learning factors with 
particular competencies, the study demonstrates that by intertwining educational experiences
<<<PAGE=256>>>
240 
 
with developmental activities inside the workplace, organisations can achieve optimum 
value from key talent. Additionally, in incorporating both contextual and individua l 
boundary conditions into the apprenticeship development model this study provides a 
nuanced understanding of 1) the situations where the apprenticeship produces the strongest 
results and 2) the types of individuals who benefit the most from the learning opportunities 
provided by the immediate work environment.  
The study presents significant theoretical and practical implications. As for the former, this 
research introduces a comprehensive model that integrating the formal and informal learning 
literatures within the apprenticeship context exemplifies the factors contributing to th e 
developmental quality of apprenticeships. In so doing, the research illustrates the factors 
associated with apprentices’ competence development, revealing how particular factors are 
associated with specific competencies. In particular, transfer design and supervisor support 
have emerged as significant in supporting the development and application of appre ntices’ 
technical knowledge. Conversely, social support and feedback from colleagues and 
supervisors in the workplace are related to apprentices’ job competence and work and 
business skills as team working, effective participation, self-management and creative 
thinking. Similarly, problem solving has emerged as critical for the development of a range 
of work and business skills, whilst task autonomy has emerged as significant for skills of 
self-management and creative thinking. Ultimately, task interdependence has emerged as 
important determinant of job competence and work and business skills such as team working 
and self-management.  
In addition, this research is informative regarding the role of HRM in apprenticeship 
providing novel insight into the influence of HR practices as determinant of a positive 
employment relationship for emergent professionals. In particular, the moderating effect of 
PA satisfaction on the relationship between problem solving and feedback with resultant 
performance demonstrates a boundary condition that influences the impact of particular 
informal learning factors on apprentices’ competence development. The findings reveal how 
PA satisfaction can foster a positive employment relationship in turn enhancing apprentices’ 
engagement with informal learning. Additionally, the research identifies PA as potential 
mechanism for converting individual learning to better functioning of the team and the 
organisation. Overall, the study presents first hand evidence of the influence of HRM in 
apprenticeship providing much needed insight for practitioners and academics.

Moreover, the moderating effects of learning goal orientation on the association between 
social support, feedback from colleagues and supervisors, task autonomy and task 
interdependence respectively with resultant performance shows that the influence of 
particular informal learning factors is contingent upon individual motivational dispositions. 
In so doing, the findings provide a nuanced understanding of the type of apprentices that 
learn the most from the learning potential of the work environment. 
Based on the findings, organisations are advised to adopt appropriate interventions to support 
apprentices’ competence development. Among these, regular interpersonal support and 
challenging tasks complemented by task autonomy and interdependence present apprentices 
with a positive learning environment conducive to professional development. At the same 
time, organisations are advised to view investments in HR practices as strategy for building 
and sustaining a high quality employment relationship, paying particular attention to 
apprentices’ satisf action with PA. Similarly, managers ought to nurture apprentices’ 
orientation towards learning promoting competence development in a positive learning 
environment. In sum, an organisational perspective has introduced a holistic view on 
apprenticeship that accounting for both formal and informal learning, the HRM system and 
the individual disposition of learning goal orientation, presents novel insight into the 
phenomenon.

We are therefore interested in your opinions about the quality of the apprenticeship training, 
about your learning experiences as part of your daily job, and about the HRM practices used 
in your organisation. 
We hope you will take between 15 to 20 minutes to complete the survey. 
All information will be held in the strictest confidence and will remain anonymous. 
Responses to individual questionnaires will only be seen by the research team and will not 
be disclosed to your line manager, colleagues and superiors.  
Participating in the survey is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw at any time when 
completing it. The email has presented you with a unique identifier which you can use to 
withdraw from the survey if you wish to do so within two weeks of completion.

Appendix 2: 
Sample of qualitative data extracts 
 
Formal learning: quality and relevance 
 
‘The quality of the training at college was excellent. Experienced and knowledgeable 
lecturers were used, however some content maybe was not as relevant to the job as it could.’  
‘In regards to the degree, it is very theoretical, and I do not think it can be applie d fully in 
the way that this questionnaire intended (i.e. vocationally); but this is not to say it has not 
been useful. It was done a lot to understand things contextually and improve the quality 
and awareness of my work.’ 
‘The training completed through college is unorganised, irrelevant and difficult to apply to 
the tasks I complete at work.’ 
‘The only issue I have had is with the formal training provided – it is often delivered by a 
college at a very low standard in comparison to all other elements of the apprenticeship’. 
‘The training school does not reflect what the business is truly like.’ 
‘There is an enormous difference between the training received at the company academy 
and that of the local college. The academy training was first rate and I learnt a lot from 
people that were current in their skills. The college training was awful! The tutors often did 
not have recent or relevant experience and the subjects we learnt were often irrelevant. 
College was a giant box ticking exercise that was rushed through to get ‘bums on seats’. 
The tutors were often very against the way we were being taught and had little to no power 
to change it. Waste of my time and the company’s money!’ 
‘The training provided related to my job and developed the skills that I need to do my job. 
It has also allowed me to transition into my second substantive role now using the skills 
that I developed.’ 
‘Generally the training I have received during my apprenticeship has been very good and 
helped me carry out my job role effectively while on business placements. However I do 
feel that some of the courses which we are required to attend do not add value to the 
apprenticeship and take up lot of time.’ 
‘I was taught the core skills needed for the second year in which I have expanded those 
skills in real life situations.’
<<<PAGE=305>>>
289 
 
Formal learning: quality and relevance (continued) 
 
‘Off-the-job training is enjoyable but often not directly applicable to the job I am doing in 
work. As a fitter, great emphasis was placed on machining at the initial stages of the 
training, whereas I think it would have been a better use of time to be learning practical 
fitting skills and less machining. I have heard of sites which have their own training 
academy, and I think having more job specific training would be of great benefit although 
it could be difficult to implement. Job related courses such as manual handling, gas 
turbine, etc. personal integrity have all proved to be useful’.  
‘University provides broad knowledge that at present does not impact how I perform at 
work, however I can see the benefit long term as I progress through the organisation.’
<<<PAGE=306>>>
290 
 
Informal learning: learning environment  
 
‘Working with people on the shop floor i.e. machinists, fitters, beam weld operators etc. 
has been the best experience for me as it has been on the job training where I have worked 
with a team of people that have had a major influence in me in a positive way.’ 
‘Well received on each placement and help always there when needed.’ 
‘My experience as an apprentice has been very good, I have managed to gain a lot of 
knowledge from the people surrounding me as well as undertaking knowledge in my own 
time to make me more available for the tasks I may have to accomplish in the future.’ 
‘When learning the procedures alongside the more experienced and knowledgeable 
colleagues I am able to develop my personal learning faster’. 
‘Really enjoyed my experience as an apprentice so far learning from those more experience 
than myself.’ 
‘I get lots of support and help from everybody I interact with through the business.’ 
‘The support from both training and areas of the business is outstanding.’ 
‘I have enjoyed being an apprentice so far –  the people I work with are lovely, and I feel 
well looked after.’ 
‘Tradespersons on the shop floor are superstars at showing you how to do the job and being 
patient with you during your training.’ 
‘As an apprentice you are treated with respect and people are willing to help you out and 
lend you their knowledge. It was difficult coming out of the training school and straight 
into the business but people are always willing to help you out and support you.’ 
‘Managers taking on placements have become more accommodating and employees have 
been extremely good at providing insight into their roles, helping my training and 
mentoring me through what things are needed for the job.’ 
‘Some days are great when you have people who enjoy to teach you their knowledge. 
However, you will occasionally find people who make themselves very difficult to 
approach for knowledge and guidance. This makes them appear hostile and unapproachable 
in terms of being concerned to ask them questions which they may either think you should 
know the answer to or feel they have already told you, making it very difficult to progress 
past that point.’
<<<PAGE=307>>>
291 
 
Informal learning: learning environment (continued) 
 
‘Being an apprentice can bring very mixed responses to you within the organisation. Some 
people recognise your ability and help you to develop, others automatically assume that 
you don’t know what you are doing.’ 
‘I do feel there are different challenges throughout and that we can cope due to the 
assistance from apprenticeship supervisors, tradesman on the shop floor and also our 
colleagues and trainers from college.’ 
 
 
 
Informal learning: development opportunities  
 
‘So far this apprenticeship has pushed me to my limits but that’s only improved my 
performance and knowledge of a working life which is good for me and it has made me 
mature and strengthen my understanding of what needs to be done in order to do a good 
job.’ 
‘Being an apprentice can be challenging, but ultimately it is extremely rewarding and has 
allowed me to grow as a person as well as develop my skillset.’ 
‘I really enjoy a challenge and I think a little bit of pressure and difficulty  keeps me 
interested and also helps me push myself to develop myself personally, technically and 
academically.’ 
‘The overall experience has been very good. There has been a large amount of opportunities 
to learn and do new things and the benefit of learning on the job quickly becomes apparent.’ 
‘There is opportunity to push and develop as an individual in a placement. I have not yet 
had the opportunity to do that on a wider scale in terms of the organisation as a whole.’ 
‘The apprenticeship has widened my knowledge and experience and allo ws me to 
experience new things which help me improve my work.’ 
‘I have a good indication of what my strengths and weaknesses are from the projects I have 
been tasked by ‘good’ placements managers and supervisors’.  
‘Sometimes have to push for opportuni ties to develop as supervisors can underestimate 
abilities.’
<<<PAGE=308>>>
292 
 
Informal learning: development opportunities (continued) 
 
‘Very good experience. Plenty of chances to expand knowledge, test and improve myself’ 
‘I enjoy my apprenticeship and the people I work with. I have had the opportunity to do 
many things so far that have taught me a lot.’ 
 ‘It has been interesting. Some managers treat you better than others in the type of work 
they give you and the opportunity to develop’.  
‘I really enjoy work and am constantly challenged with new work/problems which I often 
have to work with others to solve (shop floor and office staff).’  
‘Overall it is a prestigious, challenging and prosperous programme to be on.’  
‘Changing job roles every 6 months maintai ns a fast pace and ensures that I am 
continuously challenged and always learning something new.’  
‘The work given is challenging and very interesting.’  
‘Overall being an apprentice within this organisation has given me some excellent 
opportunities and some challenging times, both of which I am grateful for.’ 
 
 
 
Informal learning: level of responsibility  
 
‘I feel like I am treated fairly and given a range of responsibilities within my work.’ 
‘I feel I have been treated fairly and learnt a great deal. I enjoy that I have responsibility to 
carry out the tasks I am given.’ 
‘I find the experience both highly motivating in some placements due to the responsibilities 
and respect/achievement that we receive’. 
‘Nothing is consistent across the business, one area will let you do something and in another 
it is completely disallowed.’ 
‘Amount of responsibility and therefore opportunity to develop varies placement by 
placement.’
<<<PAGE=309>>>
293 
 
Informal learning: level of responsibility (continued) 
 
‘The further into m y apprenticeship I get, the more tasks I am able to take on as well as 
an increase of responsibility.’  
‘It has been more varied than expected and the responsibility I have been given has 
increased throughout my apprenticeship which means I am always engaged.’ 
‘I have been given enormous scope to work how I want, to do things differently, to create 
new ways of doing things as an organisation, and to work at my own pace’. 
 
 
 
 
Feeling valued  
 
‘I have really enjoyed my first year of my apprenticeship. I’ ve always felt like a valued, 
significant member of the team and the company.’ 
‘As an apprentice in the training school you are treated like a child more than a working 
individual. However, when entering the business you are treated from day one like a 
member of the team and you are accepted, and given proper meaningful jobs whether they 
be individual or team jobs.’ 
‘As an apprentice at this company I have felt valued at the company within my placements.’ 
‘I find the experience both highly motivating in some placements due to the responsibilities 
and respect/achievement that we receive.’  
‘The opportunities the company provides are brilliant, and being an apprentice usually does 
not get in the way of this. I have never felt disadvantaged or overlooked by my colleagues 
as an apprentice, and my opinions and inputs are always listened to and considered.’  
‘I feel like I am treated fairly, and given a range of responsibilities within my work.’ 
‘I feel I have been treated fairly and learnt a great deal. I enjoy that I have the responsibility 
to carry out the tasks I am given.’ 
‘I am treated as part of a team, with my opinion valued.’
<<<PAGE=310>>>
294 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
End-state competencies  
 
‘Overall the apprenticeship has been a positive and rewarding opportunity with lots of 
benefits towards my knowledge, skills and experience. I have picked up skills in a number 
of areas and not just the area that I am working in (project management), which is useful 
in having a good breadth of understanding.’ 
‘The apprenticeship was well tailored towards Project Management roles and provided key 
domain knowledge. After finishing the apprenticeship scheme and moving into my first 
role, I can see how the information, knowledge and skills I acquired during the three years 
have helped me to adapt and cope with the role’. 
‘As an apprentice I have learnt new skills and techniques to develop myself to further my 
career. I have learnt hands on manual skills on machinery and expanded my knowledge 
through my college course and workshop work.’ 
‘The apprenticeship is good for teaching you many different skills and developing yourself 
personally.’ 
‘I feel although it initially got off to a slow start the apprenticeship has built up my 
character, confidence and skills to make me a well suited employee for the business.’ 
‘Being an apprentice is fantastic. I have been able to develop my knowledge, skills and 
overall confidence by receiving a range of opportunities from training and placements, to 
opportunities like presenting career opportunities externally.’ 
‘Being an apprentice can be challenging, but ultimately it is extremely rewarding and ha s 
allowed me to grow as a person as well as develop my skillset.’
<<<PAGE=311>>>
295 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HRM: Career development  
 
‘As an apprentice I feel that more could have been done to push and challenge me – more 
could have been done to identify areas of strength and talent, and then to channel said areas 
into specific roles that would benefit the individual and the organisation. The company I 
work for has done a good job of putting talented individuals into roles that are too 
easy/administrative.’ 
‘Unorganised, poor planning towards our futures.’ 
‘The fact that my career direction has been decided –  without me being able to have an 
input, or anyone listening to my concerns – has led me to look for another career at the 
earliest opportunity.’ 
‘The communication between apprentice staff and apprentices themselves has been very 
poor at times, and some are left in limbo in terms of being given a job because of this.’ 
‘Negative responses are due to recent issues with career direction; the direction my career 
is moving in is not what I wished when I joined the company. The allocation of the business 
department is not made with any input from apprentices, which goes against the grain of 
the often repeated ‘it is your career to manage’. 
‘I don’t like the uncertainty of jobs in my work area especially after having given so much 
of my time and effort.’ 
‘In my experience very little care has been taken towards my development during and  or 
after my apprenticeship, which has been extremely frustrating as myself and my employer 
have different ideas about where my career is going.’

HRM: Performance management  
 
‘Apprentices performing above expectations are rarely rewarded for their efforts, and those 
that coast or fail to meet the standard are not taken to task on the issue. This depletes morale 
and motivation, and such a style of working quickly becomes contagious (everyone is on 
the same pay band, for others to put in more work and effort, without due reward, feels 
distinctly unfair and hence people stop putting in that extra effort.’ 
 ‘Some apprentices ‘hide’ behind the tile of apprentices, taking the view that they are there 
to observe and not to be accountable for tasks or take on responsibility. This is frustrating 
as there is a spectrum of performance amongst people on the same scheme yet management 
do not appear to be: 1. Noticing the high performing individuals and praising them. 2. 
Exerting pressure on the lower performing apprentices to encourage more learning.’  
‘Little emphasis is made on personal performance which often leads to little recognition 
and reward to those who achieve which I find reduced motivation to go the extra mile.’  
‘I feel that rewards/pay should be more closely linked to performance, rather than being a 
‘9 months after you start you get this’ kind of structure. The current system encourages 
mediocrity, doing the minimum required to pass, etc.’ 
 
HRM: knowledge of HR 
 
‘ As a planning and contro l apprentice I know very little about HR. I am not sure (apart 
from recruitment, redundancy, performance ratings) what they are responsible for. We have 
not really been informed of what the function does’ 
‘I have had no contact with my HR department that I know of, I do not know who the HR 
representative is for me and nor do any of the other apprentices who are based on the same 
site as me. This was highlighted at a recent apprentice forum.’  
‘As an apprentice, some of the questions, I think become more  applicable the further I go 
in my career – I struggle to give an opinion on something, I know very little about the HR 
function and the opinions of others.’ 
‘I do not have a lot of knowledge on the HR department and it is a reflection of my role 
and the company as whole.’

On-the-job learning 
On-the-job learning has gained relevance in the postmodern society where globalized 
markets and technological advancements require individuals and organizations to 
continuously learn and adapt to constantly changing environments. While traditional 
education and vocational training continue to play an important role equipping individuals 
with core knowledge and skills, the workplace has been recognized as a prolific site for 
learning (Illeris, 2011). 
As learning and working are interdependent (Billett, 2001), on-the-job learning is 
embedded in the processes, tasks and social relations of the workplace. As such, learning in 
the workplace is situated, occurring as participation in social practices (Lave and Wenger, 
1991), and is strongly dependent on access and exposure to sources of knowledge in the 
form of social partners and artefacts (Billett, 2004). 
Given the participatory nature of on-the-job learning, high-impact learning activities 
include work shadowing, allowing observation of more experienced workers providing 
insight into new practices and perspectives (Eraut, 2007), and challenging tasks, such as 
roles involving processes of decision-making, problem-solving, supervisory and managerial 
responsibilities (Brown, 2009), stretchin g individuals’ practical, cognitive, emotional and 
relational capabilities. 
On-the-job learning is highly dependent on the qualities of the workplace as a 
supportive learning environment. Job design, in terms of the allocation and structuring of 
work, is a central contextual factor influencing the extent to which the job presents 
challenging features, the degree of individuality or collaboration, and the opportunities to 
work in contact with other actors (Eraut, 2007). The configuration of work is thus central for 
providing individuals with opportunities to stretch their capabilities in a variety of tasks 
presenting novel challenges, and to secure access to a support network of experts and peers 
for interaction and regular feedback.
<<<PAGE=314>>>
298 
 
Despite the centrality of the qualities of the workplace as an environment conducive 
to learning, it has been argued that learning is an inter-psychological process, entailing a 
dual and reciprocal relationship between the individual and the social sources of knowledge 
(Billett, 2004). As such, the quality of learning experiences is mediated by both workplace 
affordances, in the form of opportunities for participation and interaction, and the level of 
guidance provided, and by an individual’s agency and intention to engage in such activities 
and interactions (Billett, 2004). This assumption represents a shift towards the learner’s 
ownership of the process, as individuals act as autonomous and self-directed agents, who 
engage in learning when this is perceived as relevant for their job and of value when the 
required support and guidance are in place and, consequently, organizations are thus able to 
enhance informal learning as a resource for their human capital and their competitive 
advantage.

HR Review, 19 th September 2016. Available at

news/strategy-news/helen-shipton-developing-talent-apprenticeships/101114 
Long gone are the days when an apprenticeship meant a fresh-faced 16 year old on a building 
site. A changing economy means that apprenticeships in England are undergoing reform, 
and more businesses across a variety of sectors will be developing their workforce through 
these programmes. 
The Government has confirmed its commitment to apprenticeships by setting a target of 
three million new starts by 2020, and will double spending in comparison to 2010-11 – 
raising £3 billion in the UK with the newly introduced levy. The reform aims to ensure 
apprenticeships are high quality, placing employers in charge of the design and delivery, and 
positioning the relationship between the apprentice and the employer at the core. 
Replacing the current standards will be levels of skills, knowledge and competency required 
in an occupation, which have been identified by the 140 employer-led groups known as 
‘trailblazers’. As part of these c hanges, an increasing number of Higher Apprenticeships 
have been launched in a range of career areas, such as aerospace engineering, nuc lear, 
construction, accounting and management. 
This growth means that more businesses will be thinking about how they can use 
apprenticeships to develop the talent they need in their organisations, including the up-
skilling of existing employees. But for these schemes to be properly effective for businesses, 
the apprentice must get the best learning experience possible in the workplace. 
To explore this issue, we recently surveyed 250 Advanced and Higher apprentices to provide 
insight into how they are managed in the workplace and what this means for their learning, 
performance, underlying job competence and core skills. When looking at the findings, it 
became apparent that a challenging, supportive and empowering work environment is a 
crucial element of apprentices’ learning and one factor influenced their experience more than 
others – the role of their line manager.  
Supervisor support was considered essential when it came to transferring the theoretical 
knowledge learned at university or college to formal training in the workplace. As key 
figures in presenting apprentices with a positive learning environment, it is important that 
line managers are involved in the planning and delivery of the apprenticeship. This not only
<<<PAGE=316>>>

fosters a commitment to the programme, but their close involvement also helps organisations 
to secure the best results possible and develop talent aligned with the business strategy. 
Affirming the advice of the CIPD’s 2014 Apprenticeships That Work report, the role of the 
line manager should include giving the apprentices work which will stretch their abilities 
and in turn identify potential skills which align with business needs. Similarly, providing 
apprentices with the right level of responsibility and independence can support them in 
developing their skills and grow into competent professionals. 
When it comes to new or inexperienced employees joining the organisation as apprentices, 
the findings showed that support from other colleagues is also an exceptionally important 
factor in contributing to their performance. This includes sharing experiences and 
recognition of what the apprentice was expected to contribute to the team. There is also a 
positive association between support and challenges. In a supportive environment, 
apprentices are more likely to perceive challenging tasks involving problem solving and 
experimenting as positive developmental opportunities. 
The availability of feedback and good levels of communication are also important to the 
apprentices we questioned. They value the opportunity to ask questions and receive 
constructive feedback on a regular basis as part of their learning and developmen t. 
Investment in this type of formal training can be a considerable amount, particularly when 
it comes to Higher Apprenticeships where university tuition fees need to be covered, so it’s 
imperative that apprenticeships work for the business. 
With the current reform placing employers in the driving seat of the design of apprenticeship 
standards to guarantee that training is responsive to business needs, organisations must 
address front line management involvement to maximise apprentices’ learning in the 
workplace. The most telling – and we would argue, crucial – implications of our work are as 
follows: 
• The senior team needs to involve line managers in the planning and delivery of 
apprenticeship programmes 
• Line managers and more experienced colleagues should offer plenty of 
opportunities for apprentices to ask for and receive constructive feedback 
• The management team has to craft each apprentice’s workload to ensure the right 
level of challenge, responsibility and autonomy
<<<PAGE=317>>>

• Help apprentices to understand the values and goals of the organizational as a 
whole, to allow them to align their skills with business needs

performance: the combined influence of the work environment and performance 
appraisal. Accepted as paper presentation at the HRIC conference 2019, Human 
Resource Division of the Academy of Management.  
This study investigates how organisations can foster apprentices’ professional 
development considering the joint effects of the work environment (problem solving 
and feedback) and performance appraisal on a range of work role behaviours. A study 
on a sample of 172 apprentices operating in the engineering sector in England 
demonstrates that problem solving and regular feedback from colleagues and 
supervisors are positively associated with performance, whilst appraisal’s satisfaction 
positively moderates these relationships. The findings underscore the importance of 
appraisal’s satisfaction for professional developmen t in fostering engagement in 
informal learning. Additionally, conceptualising performance in work role behaviours 
that contribute to team and organisational effectiveness, this study identifies 
performance appraisal as potential factor for facilitating a cross-level transfer of 
benefits so that individual learning contributes to better functioning of the team and 
the organisation. The findings are innovative in integrating the apprenticeship and the 
HRM literature and present insightful implications for both communities.  
 
Introduction  
In rapidly changing work contexts characterised by advances in technology, globalisation 
and new work roles, learning and development are essential for both individuals and 
organisations (Sonnentag, Niessen & Ohly, 2004). Whilst research has largely focused on 
professionals, a paucity of studies has considered how emergent professionals such as 
apprentices can be supported in learning their job and in engaging with professional 
development throughout their career (Messman & Mulder, 2015). In light of growing 
consensus that learning in the workplace contributes to professional development (Eraut, 
2007) and informal learning activities are associated with performance (Enos, Kehrhahn & 
Bell, 2003), it is important to understand how the work environment can enhance 
competence development and resultant performance. Building on the work of Messman and 
Mulder (2015) who demonstrated how work environments providing an optimal balance of 
challenges, autonomy and support foster apprentice s’ engagement with informal learning, 
we investigate the association between problem solving and feedback as drivers of informal
<<<PAGE=318>>>
302 
 
learning and apprentices’ performance. In so doing, we extend research by empirically 
examining the impact of the work environment on apprentices’ performance addressing the 
limitations of studies that only considered learning as outcome of interest (i.e. Messman & 
Mulder, 2015). This is an important consideration in light of extensive investments in 
apprenticeships on an international scale (Fuller & Unwin, 2011) providing further evidence 
on the learning potential of the work environment as driver of professional development.  
Additionally, although extensive research has documented the factors contributing to 
successful apprenticeships (i.e. Fuller & Unwin, 2003), little is known about the role of the 
human resource management (HRM) system in supporting apprentices’ development. With 
commentators arguing that the benefits of successful apprenticeships may be dependent upon 
high performance work practices in place in organisations (Hogarth, Gambin & Hasluck, 
2012), we present an original insight considering the influence of performance appraisal 
(PA) on apprentices’ professional development. In light of compelling ev idence that high-
quality PA promotes increased participation in informal learning activities such as reflection, 
knowledge sharing and innovative behaviour over time (Bednall, Sanders & Runhaar, 2014), 
PA is here deemed critical for explaining apprentices’  engagement with the work 
environment and resultant variation in performance. In so doing, we provide empirical 
evidence for the influence of HRM on apprenticeships and in integrating these two areas of 
study we present novel theoretical and practical implications for both communities.  
Furthermore, with research indicating that learning contributes to individual, team and 
organisational performance, Aguinis and Kraiger (2009) have called for studies that foster 
the understanding of how individual learning results in better functioning of the team and 
the organisation. In considering this cross-level transfer of benefits, this study investigates 
the joint effects of the work environment, by means of problem solving and feedback, and 
PA on a classification of work role behaviours contributing to the team and the organisation 
effectiveness (Griffin, Neal & Parker, 2007). In light of the multidimensionality of the 
construct of performance (Campbell, 1990) we consider formalised and emergent work role 
behaviours relevant for team and organisational level outcomes. In so doing, we provide 
preliminary evidence of how distinctive performance behaviours can be facilitated, shedding 
light on PA as mechanism for transferring individual learning to benefit the team and the 
organisation.

Informal learning drivers and work role performance in uncertain and interdependent 
contexts 
Performance refers to behaviours that contribute to organisational goal achievement 
(Borman & Motowidlo, 1993). Whilst several conceptualisations of performance exist 
(Campbell, 1990; Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Paine & Bachrach, 2000; Pulakos, Arad, Donovan 
& Plamondon 2000), all tend to convene on the multidimensionality of the construct. In light 
of increasingly dynamic and interrelated work contexts (Han & Williams, 2008) situational 
features of uncertainty and interdependence shape and determine the valued performance 
behaviours (Griffin, Neal & Parker, 2007). Interdependence is pervasive to organisations 
and in determining the extent to which work roles are embedded in social systems it defines 
whether individuals need to support the broader social context of the organisation (Griffin, 
Neal & Parker, 2007). Following Borman and Motowidlo’s (1993) concept of contextual 
performance, we consider work role behaviours that contribute to the effectiveness of the 
team and the organisation. In so doing, rather than focusing on task performance as in 
behaviours prescribed by role requirements and contributing to individual effectiveness, we 
consider a range of behaviours contributing to effectiveness at higher levels, namely team 
and organisational. With organisations increasingly adopting team-based structures (Han & 
Williams, 2008), it is important that emergent professionals learn how to operate as effective 
team members. Following Griffin and colleagues (2007), team member proficiency is here 
considered as in behaviours required when working in a group context, encompassing 
helping colleagues (Podsakoff et al., 2000) and cooperating with others. Organisation 
member proficiency refers to behaviours that contribute to the organisational effectiveness 
including supporting and defending organisational objectives (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993) 
and promoting the organisational image (Podsakoff et al., 2000). Although the citizenship 
literature (Podsakoff et al., 2000) presents these behaviours as discretionary, Griffin, Neal 
and Parker (2007) identify team member and organisation member proficiency as formalised 
behaviours expected in interdependent work systems.  
Whilst proficiency behaviours can be anticipated and thus formalised, Griffin, Neal and 
Parker (2007) argue that uncertainty is pervasive in increasingly dynamic and changing 
contexts, causing work role behaviours to emerge requiring certain levels of flexibility. The 
scholars identify adaptivity as emergent work role behaviour taking prominence in contexts 
of uncertainty where individuals need to respond to changes. Adaptivity represents how 
individuals cope with, respond to and support changes affecting the tasks, the team and the
<<<PAGE=320>>>
304 
 
organisation. As discussed by Shoss, Witt and Vera (2012), adaptive performance manifests 
a response to an externally initiated change and involves competency acquisition in 
reflecting efforts to develop new competencies in order to respond to change. In light of the 
dynamic environments in which organisations operate, we consider how individuals respond 
to and support changes affecting their role as team members ( team member adaptivity) and 
as organisation members (organisation member adaptivity) (Griffin, Neal & Parker, 2007). 
In so doing, we account for adaptive work role behaviours that contribute to team and 
organisational effectiveness.  
Whilst research on performance antecedents in Organisational Psychology has generally 
focused on cognitive ability and personality traits (Motowidlo & Kell, 2003) and research 
on adaptability has largely investigated individual difference factors overlooking how 
contextual factors may affect adaptive performance (Baard, Rench & Koxlowski, 2013), 
here we turn the spotlight onto problem solving and feedback as drivers of informal learning. 
Preliminary evidence on the importance of situational variables for adaptive performance 
was presented by Griffin and Hesketh (2006), whose findings demonstrated how those 
employees who rated the work environment as challenging and supportive were rated by 
their supervisors as displaying high levels of adaptive performance. Additionally, studies on 
professional development have found challenging and supportive work environments in 
association with participation in informal learning activities as reflection (Messmann & 
Mulder, 2015) and with the development of critical end-state competencies (Dragoni, Tesluk 
& Russell 2009). Accordingly, problem solving is here considered as important component 
of challenging work experiences that in presenting novel and complex situations activates a 
learning response (Doornbos, Bolhuis & Simons 2004). Problem solving has indeed been 
recognised as working activity with learning as a by-product (Eraut, 2007) and studies 
present evidence of an association between problem solving and increased performance and 
expertise (Brockman & Dirks, 2006). In light of this evidence, we test the association 
between problem solving with formalised and emergent work role behaviours and 
hypothesise the following: 
Hypothesis 1: Problem solving is positively related to a) team member proficiency; b) 
organisation member proficiency; c) team member adaptivity; d) 
organisation member adaptivity
<<<PAGE=321>>>
305 
 
When considering facets of supportive work environments, research indicates that day- to-
day and regular feedback is particularly valuable in supporting competence development 
(Eraut, 2007) and in enhancing engagement in informal learning activities (Mulder, 2013). 
Additionally, regular feedback from colleagues and supervisors has been found to support 
employees in developmental assignments, counterbalancing the levels of uncertainty 
associated with challenging tasks (DeRue and Wellman, 2009), and is increasingly viewed 
as critical factor for performance enhancement (Mulder, 2013). Accordingly, this study 
hypothesises the following: 
Hypothesis 2: Feedback is positively related to a) team member proficiency; b) 
organisation member proficiency; c) team member adaptivity; d) 
organisation member adaptivity  
Performance appraisal satisfaction  
PA is here considered as formal and particular event, part of a broader performance 
management system striving to improve organisational performance (DeNisi & Sonesh, 
2011). Central to PA is the evaluation and communication of individual performance 
feedback, usually in face- to—face meetings between the employee and the supervisor 
(Elicker, Levy & Hall 2006). As reported by Bednall and colleagues (2014), PA allows 
supervisors to provide employees with valuable feedback, supporting them to approach 
mistakes as learning opportunities and more generally encouraging knowledge-sharing 
among team members. Whilst employees are expected to receive regular informal feedback 
from colleagues and supervisors, PA is deemed crucial for delivering normative feedback 
on performance and evaluating whether organisational expectations have been met (DeNisi 
and Sonesh, 2010).  
PA satisfaction is an important predictor of employees’ attitudes and behaviours (Kuva as, 
2006). Research indicates that perceptions of PA’s use relate to employees’ satisfaction 
suggesting that developmental PA, focused on identifying individual training needs, 
strengths and weaknesses along with providing performance feedback, is consistent with 
communicating to employees their value and future in the organisation (Boswell & 
Boudreau, 2000). Similarly, Kuvaas (2006) presents compelling evidence that PA 
satisfaction is directly associated with affective commitment and turnover intentions, 
revealing that developmental PA contributes to employees’ perceptions of the organisation’s 
investments in their development.
<<<PAGE=322>>>
306 
 
In presenting PA as a mechanism for developing and motivating employees, we posit that 
apprentices may react differently to the work environment depending on PA satisfaction. It 
follows that apprentices’ PA satisfaction may explain why some apprentices gain more from 
engaging with the learning opportunities provided by the immediate work environment 
resulting in higher resultant performance. This can be explained considering that employees’ 
perceptions of the organisation’s commitment in conducting developmental PA are 
associated with employees’ feeling valued (i.e. Boswell & Boudreau, 2000). As discussed 
by Kuvaas (2006), perceptions of developmental PA are related to the organisation’s 
perceived investments in employees development in providing the knowledge and skills 
required for career progression. Similarly, research indicates that employees’ attributions 
that HR practices are mo tivated by the organisation’s concern for their development and 
wellbeing are reflected in high quality exchange relationships (Nishii, Lepak & Schneider, 
2008). The latter is particularly important given that high quality employee-organisational 
relationships reflecting social exchanges (Blau, 1964) are critical for the effectiveness of 
developmental programmes (Kuvaas, 2008).  
According to the principles of social exchange (Blau, 1964) as organisations invest in 
employees’ development such inducements in turn foster employees’ reciprocation with 
positive attitudes and behaviours. It follows that apprentices experiencing organisational 
support are likely to feel an obligation to repay the organisation for its investments in their 
development by making greater use of the developmental opportunities provided by the 
immediate work environment. Consequently, apprentices experiencing PA satisfaction are 
expected to engage in problem solving activities as means to competence development. 
Similarly, PA satisfaction is expected to increase the effects of informal day-to-day feedback 
from colleagues and supervisors as this provides apprentices with developmental 
opportunities.  
Additionally, given that PA entails the communication of organisational strategies, goals and 
visions (Kuvaas, 2006), it has the potential to elucidate how the work of the individual is 
related to team and organisational goals (Kuvaas, 2011). This is deemed particularly 
important for emergent professionals in fostering the understanding of superordinate goals 
and in aligning individual and organisational goals (DeNisi & Sonesh, 2011). Accordingly, 
in upholding the identification with the organisation and the team (Levy & Williams, 2004), 
PA is predicated to enable emergent professionals to understand how their role contributes 
to higher team and organisational level outcomes. Given that performance is a cross-level
<<<PAGE=323>>>
307 
 
construct in that individual performance influences the performance of the team and the 
organisation (Den Hartog, Boselie & Paauwe, 2004), PA can heighten emergent 
professionals’ understanding of the interdependency of their job role within the organisation, 
so facilitating the understanding of how their role supports the broader social context (i.e. 
Griffin, Neal & Parker, 2007).  
In finding the relationship between PA satisfaction and performance as mediated by intrinsic 
motivation, Kuvaas (2006) argues that task performance is more likely to be influenced by 
skills and abilities, rather than PA satisfaction. In so doing, Kuvaas calls for research on the 
impact of PA on different levels of performance maintaining that the HR practice may be 
more relevant for influencing contextual performance as in behaviours that support the 
broader organisational environment. In answering this call, the current study considers the 
influence of PA on formalised and emergent work role behaviours relevant for team and 
organisational effectiveness and hypothesises the following: 
Hypothesis 3:  PA satisfaction moderates the relationships between a) problem solving and 
team member proficiency; organisation member proficiency; team member 
adaptivity; organisation member adaptivity; and b) feedback and team 
member proficiency; organisation member proficiency; team member 
adaptivity; organisation member adaptivity.  
Method 
In order to test the advanced hypotheses a cross-sectional study with 172 apprentices 
operating in two engineering organisations in England was conducted. Existing scales with 
proven reliability were selected for measuring the constructs of interest. Unless otherwise 
stated, response options ranged from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (5) ‘strongly agree’.  
Problem solving was measured with a 4-item scale developed by Morgeson and Humphrey 
(2006) measuring problems solving as in the generation of ideas and innovative solutions to 
problems as function of job requirements; the scale reliability was α= .81. Feedback was 
measured with a 3-item scale developed by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) measuring the 
extent to which colleagues and supervisors provide ongoing feedback on performance; the 
scale reliability was α= .83.  PA was measured with a 6-item scale developed by Kuvaas 
(2006) to measure employees’ satisfaction with PA activities, the adequacy of feedback 
provided and the organisation’s commitment to conduct developmental PA; the scale 
reliability was α= .86. Finally,  work role performance  was measured with a 12-item scale
<<<PAGE=324>>>
308 
 
developed by Griffin, Neal and Parker (2007) which differentiates between work role 
behaviours of proficiency and adaptivity at team and organisational level. All items were 
measured using a 5-point Likert scale asking respondents to rate the frequency of the 
behaviour over the last 12 months (1= not much; 2= little; 3= somewhat; 4= much; 5= a 
great deal). All performance measures presented adequate reliability. Additionally, we 
controlled for tenure (0= less than 1 year; 1= more than 1 year), level of apprenticeship (0= 
level 3; 1= level 4 and above), age (0= younger than 20; 1= older than 20). 
Findings  
Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. To test the direct effects (Hypotheses 1 
and 2) the dependent variables were first regressed onto the control variables (Model 1). In 
a second step, the investigated predictor and PA were entered (Model 2). To test for 
moderation (Hypothesis 3), the interaction term between PA and the considered predictor 
was included in a third step (Model 3).  
Based on Model 1, all control variables failed to predict the performance outcomes. Based 
on Model 2, problem solving was positively and significantly associated with team member 
proficiency (β= .24, p< .01); organisation member proficiency (β= .16, p< .05) and team 
member adaptivity (β= .22, p< .01). Feedback was positively and significantly associated 
with team member proficiency (β= .32, p< .01); organisation member proficiency (β= .31, 
p< .05); team member adaptivity (β= .23, p< .05) and organisation member adaptivity (β= 
.19, p< .05). Model 3 revealed that PA positively and significantly moderated the 
relationship between problem solving and team member proficiency (β= .21, p< .01); 
problem solving and organisation member proficiency (β= .25, p< .05); problem solving and 
organisation member adaptivity (β= .18, p< .05). Notably, the effects of problem solving on 
organisation member adaptivity are dependent upon adequate levels of PA satisfaction. 
Additionally, PA moderated the relationship between feedback and team member 
proficiency (β= .16, p< .01) and feedback and organisation member adaptivity (β= .16, p< 
.01). For these performance outcomes, the positive effects of problem solving and feedback 
were stronger when PA satisfaction was high. The significant interaction effects are shown 
in Figures 1-5.  
Discussion  
Organisations investing in apprenticeships as strategy to develop their talent need to better 
understand how to sustain professional development considering the substantial learning
<<<PAGE=325>>>
309 
 
potential of the work environment. Moreover, increasingly dynamic and interdependent 
work contexts necessitate the development of competencies beyond formalised job specific 
skills. This study expands research on work environment factors supporting the development 
of competencies required to operate as effective team and organisational members and to 
adapt in face of changes affecting the organisational social context. The findings suggest that 
problem solving and regular feedback from colleagues and supervisors play a crucial role in 
supporting the development of competencies contributing to the effectiveness of the team 
and the organisation. More so, the relationships between these factors and the considered 
work role behaviours are strengthened when PA satisfaction is high. Whilst PA is not always 
directly associated with team and organisational work role behaviours, it plays a critical role 
in enhancing the effects of problem solving and feedback on resultant performance. 
By determining a positive relationship between problem solving and the considered work 
role behaviours, this study identifies a job characteristic conducive to professional 
development that is more specific than the previously research constructs of challenging 
work (i.e. Messman & Mulder, 2015). Our findings are consistent with meta-analysis results 
presented by Podsakoff and colleagues (2000) which identified task variables as strongly 
related to organisation citizenship behaviours, and expand knowledge on the behaviours 
potentially stimulated by problem solving. When considering the relationships between 
problem solving and team and organisation member proficiency, these can be interpreted 
through an indirect effect on employees’ psychological state of perceived responsibility. As 
discussed by Pearce and Gregersen (1991), when individuals feel responsibility towards the 
organisation and their colleagues, they are more likely to engage in extra role behaviours as 
helping others. Whilst research has linked task autonomy and task interdependence with felt 
responsibility (Hackman & Oldham, 1975; Pearce and Gregersen, 1991), problem solving 
in requiring unique ideas and solutions to complex situations may also lead to felt 
responsibility for work outcomes.  
The positive relationship between problem solving and team member and organisation 
member adaptivity is consistent with studies that explore the influence of challenging job 
demands on employees’ creativity. Specifically , Zhou, Hirst and Shipton (2012) found 
problem-solving demand in positive association with employees’ creative performance 
revealing that the cognitive requirements of the job stimulate skills development and new 
solution to problems. By experiencing novel and unexpected events, apprentices experience 
challenging situations that foster learning in the workplace (Doornbos et al., 2004). As

discussed by van Rijn, Yang and Sanders (2013), workplace learning leads to the 
development of knowledge, skills and abilities required to deal with the constant changes 
affecting the work contexts. Our findings thus underscore the importance of engaging 
emergent professionals in challenging work to stimulate the ability to adapt to changes 
affecting their role as team and organisational members.  
The positive association of feedback with the spectrum of work role behaviours is consistent 
with studies that found feedback to positively affect performance (Kluger and DeNisi, 1996). 
The findings support the proposition that feedback from managers and colleagues stimulates 
workplace learning (Doornbos et al., 2004) and underline the value of short-term regular 
feedback for early career professionals (Eraut, 2007). The association between feedback and 
work role performance can be explained in light of the evidence that feedback consistently 
leads to reflection (Bednall et al., 2014; Mulder, 2013), a component of critical reflective 
work behaviour aimed at optimising individual and collective practices (Van Woerkom & 
Croon, 2008). Accordingly, regular feedback from colleagues and supervisors enhances 
individual or collegial reflection that helps emergent professionals to understand how to 
better support the effectiveness of the team and the organisation. 
The moderating effects of PA on the association between problem solving and feedback with 
both formalised and emergent work role behaviours illustrates that employees experiencing 
PA satisfaction engage more with problem solving and feedback, reporting higher 
performance results. Additionally, the results indicate that the association between problem 
solving and organisation member adaptivity is contingent upon adequate PA satisfaction, 
illustrating why apprentices may differently respond to challenging tasks. The findings 
support former research on early career professionals which identified the significance of 
long-term and strategic feedback on general progress (Eraut, 2007) explaining why this 
matter in relation to engagement with informal learning. Observing the combined effects of 
PA satisfaction and problem solving and feedback on work role performance, our study 
demonstrates that those experiencing PA satisfaction approach problem solving and 
feedback as learning opportunities. This can be explained as employees’ experiencing 
developmental PA feel part of a relational employment relationship characterised by open-
ended exchanges and long-term mutual investments (Lepak & Snell, 1999) in turn fostering 
their reciprocation by making greater use of  informal learning opportunities. The findings 
pose important implications for practice in demonstrating that reactions to PA influence how 
individuals respond to the learning potential of the work environment, underscoring the
<<<PAGE=327>>>

importance of positive appraisal reactions (Kuvaas, 2006). Additionally, the study provides 
preliminary evidence of the relevance of PA in supporting contextual performance, 
presenting it as potential factor in converting individual learning into better functioning of 
the team and the organisation. Organisations should thus focus on providing developmental 
PA that clearly communicates the organisation’s vision and strategy, enabling emergent 
professionals to understand how their role contributes to the effectiveness of the team and 
the organisation.
