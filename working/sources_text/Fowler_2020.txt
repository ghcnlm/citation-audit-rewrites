Using the Multiple Streams Framework to Connect 
Policy Adoption to Implementation
Luke Fowler
The author furthers research on the multiple streams framework (MSF) by testing hypotheses related 
to the conditional nature of politics, policy, and problems streams in affecting policy outputs from 
both policymaking and policy implementation. The author articulates a theoretical model of the 
policy process where policymaking and policy implementation are separate, but interdependent 
processes, and generates three hypotheses related to policymaking, policy implementation, and the 
interdependence of those processes. Then, the author tests hypotheses with state-level implementation 
of federal environmental policy over a 20 year period. Using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), 
the author makes joint estimations of policymaking and policy implementation as separate, correlated 
processes. Findings indicate how politics affects policymaking and policy implementation is conditional 
on existing policies and problems, and that these two processes are not independent from each other. 
Conclusions connect this MSF to the broader literature and how it may address current criticisms.

With the multiple streams framework (MSF), John Kingdon (1995) created a sophis-
ticated yet simple theoretical framework to explain how policy actors sort through 
ambiguous circumstances during policy processes. In the decades following its pub-
lication, scholars further developed many key theoretical concepts, including the 
nature of policy windows; activities of policy entrepreneurs; and the construction 
of policy, politics, and problem streams (Herweg, Zahariadis, & Zohlnhöfe, 2018). 
While the crux of this research focuses on agenda-setting and policy adoption, more 
recent development also applies concepts to understanding policy implementation 
(e.g., Fowler, 2019). Despite this, critics still question MSF’s usefulness for two rea-
sons. First, literature connecting policy adoption and implementation is disjointed, 
much of the development related to implementation is recent, and there are few 
examples of policy adoption and implementation being examined in a single model. 
As such, many still see MSF as only suited to explaining agenda-setting or policy 
adoption, and not for understanding how collective choices and collective actions 
occur in conjunction as part of a policy system (Herweg et al., 2018). Second, testable 
hypotheses are sparse, which creates limitations to providing empirical evidence 
supporting key theoretical tenets, and much of the research is based on case studies 
(Engler & Herweg, 2019; Herweg et al., 2018). To this end, a significant step in this 
line of research is articulating a policy process model that includes both policy adop-
tion and implementation, and empirically testing hypotheses based on that model.
This model will provide a vital step in understanding policy during the gover -
nance era by: (i) integrating existing MSF scholarship into a single theoretical policy 
process model; and, (ii) providing quantitative evidence that supports its validity. As 
such, we proceed with a discussion of policy adoption and policy implementation as 
two components of a single policy process through the MSF lens. Then, we develop 
three hypotheses related to the conditional nature of politics, policy, and problems 
streams in affecting both policy adoption and implementation, and the interdepen-
dent relationship between the two. Finally, we use seemingly unrelated regression 
(SUR) to test our hypotheses by modeling U.S. state environmental policy as a single 
process. Findings support hypotheses and indicate that there is an interaction among 
politics, policies, and problems in predicting major departures from the status quo in 
both policy adoption and implementation, and policy adoption and implementation 
are not independent from each other. Conclusions suggest implications for how MSF 
can further understandings of policy governance.

Fowler: Connecting Policymaking and Policy Implementation 617
The Multiple Streams Framework
A Model for Agenda-Setting and Policy Adoption
MSF scholarship largely assumes that policy processes are characterized by 
ambiguity, where different ways of thinking about similar circumstances compete 
for relevance among decision makers. Key sources of ambiguity are: fluid partici-
pants (e.g., shifting policy communities), problematic preferences (e.g., ill-defined 
policy goals), and unclear technology (i.e., uncertainty about what is possible). As 
a result, there is a constant state of chaos surrounding which problems need to be 
solved or how to solve them, and where policymakers must make sense of incom-
plete information to comprehend the world. The ultimate goal of MSF is to add 
order to this chaos (Herweg et al., 2018). To this end, Kingdon (1995) identifies five 
structural components in policy processes, where politics, problems, and policies in-
dependently stream until policy entrepreneurs couple them together during policy 
windows. Although this does not guarantee success, policy adoption is much more 
likely when this occurs (Avery, 2004; Birkland, 2004; Zahariadis, 2005).
First, politics streams encompass the political atmosphere and corresponding 
competition between value-based decisions that includes, but are not limited to, 
who should benefit, what issues should be prioritized, and how policy images will 
be interpreted. Of course, policy communities (or networks) and politicians play 
key roles in shaping debates surrounding whether problems are worthy of attention 
or policies are acceptable. Second, problem streams are made up a collection socio-
economic and environmental conditions that exist in society. Conditions become 
problems when they are identified as “non-ideal” and draw attention from poli-
cymakers via focusing events, feedback, or indicators. Third, policy streams con-
sist of a cornucopia of ideas for what should be done about problems that (may or 
may not) exist. Ideas tend to be generated by policy specialists and spread through 
policy communities based on technical or political feasibility (Herweg et al., 2018; 
Kingdon, 1995). A central tenet of MSF is that the streams have a life of their own; 
however, some critics have questioned this assumption (Herweg et al., 2018). For 
example, Robinson and Eller (2010) find evidence of stream unity in local policy 
adoption contexts.
Fourth, policy entrepreneurs are actors who attempt to manipulate policy 
streams in order to advocate for certain perspectives. Their goal is to couple streams 
together by framing and re-framing perceptions of problems, politics, and policies 
in order to satisfy policymakers’ problematic preferences. In other words, policy 
entrepreneurs want to convince decision makers that a certain choice is politically 
acceptable to solve a salient problem (Zahariadis, 2005). Finally, policy windows are 
those fleeting opportunities where there is a problem with sufficient attention from 
policymakers, a policy solution that is feasible (both technically and politically), and 
politics that are amenable to change. When policy entrepreneurs take advantage of 
these opportunities, new policies are adopted, but when they are missed, the sta-
tus quo  is maintained (Herweg et al., 2018; Kingdon, 1995). Consequently, there 
is a conditional nature to how politics, policy, and problem streams affect policy

adoption, which depends on an interaction among the three (Fowler, 2019; Travis & 
Zahariadis, 2002).
Adding in Implementation
Despite widespread application of the canonical model, a key MSF criticism is 
the primary focus on agenda-setting and policy adoption, and relatively little con-
sideration of what happens after policy is adopted (Fowler, 2019; Howlett, 2019). In 
response, recent scholars have begun applying MSF to policy implementation (e.g., 
Aberbach & Christensen, 2014; Boswell & Rodrigues, 2016; Fowler, 2019; Howlett, 
McConnell, & Perl, 2015; Sager & Thomann, 2017; Zahariadis & Exadaktylos, 2016). 
Although this body of scholarship is far less developed than scholarship focusing 
on policy adoption, there are several key concepts that are consistent. First, ambi-
guity still reigns, but decision making in policy implementation is different than in 
agenda-setting or policy adoption. While policymakers tend to be a discrete group, 
policy implementers include a swath of people with some capacity to impact pol-
icy outputs through public service delivery. Similar to policymakers, implementers 
have problematic preferences caused by uncertainty surrounding policy meanings 
and competing demands for their attention or resources (Fowler, 2019; Pandey & 
Wright, 2006). As such, policy entrepreneurs continue to employ strategies to ma-
nipulate how policy implementers interpret policies. Their interpretations, in turn, 
constitute the norms of policies in practice where ideas translate into action, and 
lead to changes in social conditions (Aberbach & Christensen, 2014; Boswell & 
Rodrigues, 2016; Fowler, 2019; Zahariadis & Exadaktylos, 2016).
Second, politics, problems, and policy streams manifest differently during 
policy implementation. Most importantly, policy streams here are not a collection 
of competing ideas for how to solve problems, but a collection of competing pol-
icy interpretations (Fowler, 2019). The inherent ambiguity that exists during pol-
icy adoption requires implementers to make sense out of policies when applying 
them to real-world conditions, which opens the door for administrative discretion 
in determining appropriate implementation behavior (Lipsky, 2010; Sowa & Selden, 
2003). Notably, policymakers have different tools at their disposal to constrain dis-
cretion (e.g., incentives, institutional rules, resource allocations), so implementers 
behave in a way that is consistent with their preferred policy interpretation (Stazyk 
& Goerdel, 2011; Wood & Waterman, 1991).
In addition, problems streams in implementation are fed by problems iden-
tified during agenda-setting processes, as policymakers already sorted through 
a litany of issues and made choices about where to focus their attention (Fowler, 
2019). Since administrators tend to focus on  what is being monitored, they natu-
rally prioritize problems that already have attention of policymakers. However, 
when policies do not outline specific performance indicators, implementers may 
make their own determinations of which measures are the most pertinent (Brehm & 
Gates, 1999; Chun & Rainey, 2005). Last, politics streams still consist of competing 
values and beliefs about how interests should be balanced (Fowler, 2019). Similar

to policymakers, implementers have to sustain political coalitions by being respon-
sive to their environment in order to maintain legitimacy for their administrative 
decisions. Importantly, if implementers are not responsive to their political environ-
ment, they risk challenges to their uses of discretion and renewed interest from pol-
icymakers, who may then adjust policies to further constrain their behavior (Davis 
& Stazyk, 2015; Reed, 2014). Consequently, the politics streams in agenda-setting 
and program implementation are, to some extent, fused. Notably, this still largely 
assumes the stream independence, but does suggest a degree of conditionality to 
which streams affect implementer behavior. In other words, the politics stream in 
policy adoption and the politics stream in implementation are tied together, but the 
politics stream remains independent from the problems or policy streams.
Third, by adopting new policies, policymakers open policy windows that cre-
ate opportunities to change the status quo in implementation behavior. In general, 
implementer behavior is driven by efforts to maintain the status quo in social con-
ditions, so problems do not catch policymaker attention and force new policies on 
implementers (Boswell & Rodrigues, 2016; Fowler, 2019; Stazyk & Goerdel, 2011; 
Zahariadis & Exadaktylos, 2016). This assumes norms of practice should be consis-
tent and stable over time, which should result in stable social conditions (i.e., policy 
adoption problems stream). Consequently, by maintaining the status quo and not 
altering policy interpretations, implementers are able to create stasis in policy sub-
systems and maintain control (Fowler, 2019; Zahariadis & Exadaktylos, 2016).
However, “[w]hile implementers may be able to withstand challenges to the sta-
tus quo from any single stream (i.e., shift in public opinion, focusing events), when 
coupled, implementers have no choice but to respond. Otherwise, they risk a break-
down of political coalitions, challenges to their legitimacy, implementation failures, 
or issues returning to the policy agendas as policy entrepreneurs shift pressure back 
to policymakers” (Fowler, 2019, pp. 7–8). In essence, if policy implementers fail to 
respond, policy communities who supported adoption are likely to question the 
efficacy and/or legitimacy of implementers, placing them under intense scrutiny 
(Fowler, 2019; Reed, 2014). Moreover, without an open policy window, the spotlight 
is unlikely to be retained on implementation, causing focus to shift back to policy 
agendas and adoption, relieving any pressure that implementers face. As such, there 
is an inherently conditional nature to the politics, problems, and policy streams in 
affecting policy implementation, where effects of one stream depend largely on 
other streams.
Linking Policy Adoption and Implementation
Although policy adoption and implementation make up two distinct compo-
nents of policy processes, previous MSF scholarship largely focuses on one or the 
other, leaving few direct insights into how they may be linked. More recent scholar-
ship on implementation from the MSF literature provides some of the most clearly 
developed theoretical connections between the two (Fowler, 2019; Howlett, et al., 
2015; Zahariadis & Exadaktylos, 2016). This scholarship largely argues that “policy

systems and processes are nested, with policymaking and policy implementation 
existing in organized interdependent layers” (Fowler, 2019, p. 4). In other words, 
these two components are essentially subprocesses (i.e., collective choice versus col-
lective action) of a larger process. While interrelated, there are separate outputs for 
policy adoption and implementation that are linked together and aggregate to pol-
icy process outputs. Figure 1 illustrates a MSF policy process model that includes 
both policy adoption and implementation subprocesses. First, policy adoption out-
puts are new policies that result from decisions made during policy adoption, which 
address nonideal social conditions. Second, once new policies are adopted, policy 
implementers respond. Individual-level behaviors, then, aggregate to the norms of 
policies in practice, which constitute implementation outputs. Third, implementa-
tion outputs lead to changes in behaviors related to social conditions that new pol-
icies aim to affect.
As such, we can isolate three different outputs within policy processes that 
likely result from policy windows: policies as choices (policy adoption outputs), 
policies as actions (policy implementation outputs), and policies as agents of social 
change (policy process outputs). Furthermore, there are also links between policy 
streams. As implied by the relationship between outputs, policy adoption out-
puts become policy streams during policy implementation. Moreover, politics and 
problems streams are largely assumed to exist in a very similar state in both policy 
adoption and implementation. However, other scholars argue that streams and/or 
coupling processes function differently in policy adoption compared to implemen-
tation (Fowler, 2019; Herweg et al., 2018). Importantly, policy process outputs feed 
into problem streams as both deal with nonideal social conditions. Consequently, 
policy, politics, and problem streams remain independent within each subprocess

(i.e., adoption, implementation), but are linked together as focus shifts from one 
subprocess to the other. Although consistent with other research on links between 
policy adoption and implementation, there is little empirical evidence surrounding 
these assumptions.
Modeling Policy Adoption and Implementation
Although well developed in many areas and widely applied around the world, 
several important shortcomings are noted by critics. Methodologically, a lack of test-
able hypotheses limits the sophistication of empirical evidence (Herweg et al., 2018). 
However, recent scholarship offers hypotheses related to specific parts of MSF, such 
as interactions between streams, which provide ample ground for empirical testing 
(Fowler, 2019; Travis & Zahariadis, 2002). Furthermore, much of this research relies 
on an implicit assumption that each policy process component can be studied in 
isolation, which does not account for how factors in policy adoption may influence 
the implementation processes or vice versa. In other words, it is difficult to under -
stand how systems work without examining the system as a whole, which creates 
distinct limitations to insights that can be gleaned from extant MSF scholarship. 
Consequently, many scholars question MSF’s utility in explaining policy processes 
and providing guidance on democratic governance that includes both policy deci-
sions and execution (Herweg et al., 2018). A key step in overcoming these challenges 
is developing and testing hypotheses related to the three elements at hand: adop-
tion, implementation, and links between adoption and implementation.
Specifically, we need  hypotheses concerning: how policy choices are made, 
how policy choices are executed, and how policy choices and execution affect each 
other. To this end, previous scholarship offers two related hypotheses concerning 
the conditional nature of politics, policy, and problems streams in affecting outputs 
from policy adoption and policy implementation processes. As such, the crux of 
our hypotheses rests on a conditional nature to the effects of streams on policy out-
puts. Although focused on a limited part of MSF, the theoretical interaction between 
streams is a crucial part of this framework, so it makes for an ample place to begin 
developing a more sophisticated policy process model. Consequently, our hypoth-
eses are based on two assumptions. First, it is not necessary to identify individual 
policy actors (i.e., policymakers, implementers) to investigate how streams impact 
policy processes (Fowler, 2019; Travis & Zahariadis, 2002). In most cases, it is impos-
sible to identify the influence of individual actors within a chaotic and complex 
process, but we can assume that individual actions aggregate to process-level out-
puts. By extension, it is more practical to focus on observing changes in outputs, 
rather than individual-level changes in behavior (Fowler, 2019). Second, as policy 
processes do not happen in a vacuum, there is an element of inertia within every 
policy process, where choices concerning future policies are influenced by current 
circumstances (Fowler, 2019; Travis & Zahariadis, 2002).
We draw our policy adoption hypotheses from Travis and Zahariadis (2002), 
which finds that effects of politics and problems streams on future allocation of 
U.S. aid to foreign countries is conditional on the normal amount of aid received.

Specifically, they find that need is a significant concern to policymakers when allo-
cating aid to poorer countries with less political importance in international rela-
tions but other factors become increasingly important as countries become wealthier 
and more politically relevant. In general terms, there is an interaction among poli-
tics, problems, and policies that affects choices concerning future policies made by 
policymakers, where deviations in the status quo of policies only occur during open 
windows when policymakers adjust their choices conditional to the coupling of 
streams. We should then expect to find that the influence of politics on policy adop-
tion outputs is moderated by both current problems and existing policies, where 
different policy choices occur depending on how significant problems are and what 
policies are currently in place.
Policy adoption hypothesis: Effects of politics on policy adoption outputs are 
conditional on current problems and policies.
We draw our policy implementation hypothesis from Fowler (2019). Extending 
the research design and hypothesis from Travis and Zahariadis (2002) to policy im-
plementation, Fowler (2019) finds evidence of a similar conditional nature for the 
effects of policy, problems, and politics streams. Specifically, he finds that there are 
only marginal differences in policy outputs from federal environmental programs 
when public opinion on the environment, spending, and/or pollutant levels are 
moderate, but when those factors all reach extreme levels, there are substantive im-
provements in program effectiveness. In general, Fowler (2019) hypothesizes that 
“[p]olicy implementers continue the status quo in implementation behavior by not 
altering their administrative decisions, but during open windows, implementa-
tion behavior is adjusted conditional to coupling of problems, policy, and politics 
streams” (p. 8). We should then expect to find that the influence of politics on policy 
implementation outputs is moderated by both the current problems and existing 
policies, where different implementation behavior emerges depending on how sig-
nificant problems are and what policies are in place.
Policy Implementation hypothesis: Effects of politics on policy implementation 
outputs are conditional on current problems and policies.
Previous scholarship is limited when it comes to the final element here: linking 
policy adoption and implementation. However, there is enough on which to base 
a simple hypothesis. From the MSF perspective, policy adoption and implementa-
tion are connected by both policy entrepreneurs and the streams. For instance, pol-
icy adoption outputs (i.e., decisions made by policymakers) become policy streams 
during implementation, as those decisions are a key source of ideas for how imple-
menters translate policies into actions; and, implementation outputs (i.e., norms of 
practice) feed into problem streams during policy adoption, as conditions policy-
makers are concerned about. As such, there is an implicit assumption in existing 
literature that these processes are not independent from each other and there is a 
degree of mutual influence, even though previous scholars have not explicitly tested

this (Fowler, 2019; Zahariadis & Exadaktylos, 2016). Consequently, we should then 
expect to find that effects of politics, policy, and problem streams on policy adoption 
and implementation processes are interdependent.
Interdependent Processes hypothesis: Effects of politics, policy, and prob-
lem streams on policy adoption outputs are not independent from their ef-
fects on policy implementation outputs.
Methodology
Data and Empirical Strategy
Following Fowler’s (2019) empirical strategy, we test our theoretical model by 
analyzing state implementation of U.S. federal environmental policy for two rea-
sons. First, and most importantly, it is consistent with the most recent and devel-
oped empirical testing of MSF hypotheses. As such, this allows us to reduce some 
of the “white noise” in expanding theoretical concepts, where concerns of whether 
this is a “good” case for examination are assuaged. Second, the federal-state frame-
work for managing the Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), and Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) allows for national and temporal consis-
tency, while also creating variation in policy adoption and implementation at the 
state level. These three programs represent the backbone of U.S. environmental pol-
icy, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) setting broad national stan-
dards and states adapting those standards to fit local needs. Previous scholarship 
argues this framework contributes to 50 different strategies for environmental policy 
and management, which, in turn, contribute to interstate differences in environmen-
tal policy outcomes (Konisky & Woods, 2012; Travis, Morris, & Morris, 2004; Woods, 
2006). As such, it allows for a quasi-experiment, where core policy and administra-
tive elements are consistent, but are matched to specific contexts through indepen-
dent policy adoption and implementation processes.
We use a pooled cross-sectional dataset that includes 50 states over 20 years, cre-
ating 1,000 state-year observations. With lagged variables, observations encompass 
the time period from 1994 to 2016. We obtained data from publicly available data-
bases managed by the EPA, U.S Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 
(BEA), League of Conservation Voters (LCV), as well as from previously published 
material as cited. Figure 2 illustrates our empirical model of MSF applied to U.S. 
environmental policy.
Temporal Dimensions
As our core interest here concerns changes from the status quo, we rely on a 
difference-in-difference approach in order to account for how changes in predictor 
variables correspond to changes in dependent variables. As such, we model our 
variables as change over time to account for how departures from norms in politics,

policies, or problems cause changes in policy adoption or implementation outputs. 
To this end, we define t1 as an initial time period in policy processes, t2 as a time pe-
riod that directly follows t1, t3 as a time  period that directly follows t2, and t 0 as 
a time  period that directly precedes t1. Importantly, this incorporates a temporal 
dimension with changes over time being a distinct point of interest as the  status 
quo is reinforced or replaced. Given that temporal organization of public programs 
and data reporting tend to occur on a yearly basis, we organize our data so that time 
periods correspond to years (i.e., t1 is the initial year of observation, t2 the following 
year, and so on), with our initial observation years as 1995 to 2014. Table 1 provides 
a description of time periods.
The temporal dimension here is an important theoretical and empirical issue as 
it relates to serial versus concurrent processes (Baumgartner, Jones, & Mortensen, 
2018; Nakamura, 1987). The “textbook perspective” (i.e., stages heuristic) presents 
policy processes as: policymakers decide on a new policy; then, implementers go 
about putting it into practice (serial process;  Nakamura, 1987; Smith & Larimer, 
2009). Moreover, numerous scholars advocate for a more realistic perspective where 
few policies are completely new and implementers are constantly managing prob-
lems while policymakers develop and amend policies (concurrent process). From 
an empirical perspective, assuming a serial process allows for a “cleaner” approach 
to modeling a multistep process, and reduces potential autocorrelation issues. 
However, in doing so, we create theoretical limitations by not incorporating fac-
tors in policy adoption and implementation with mutual influence. After balancing 
competing interests, we elected to model this as a serial process by separating our 
variables into two stages. In the first stage (i.e., adoption), predictors are modeled 
as change in value from t0 to t1 and the dependent variable as change in value from

in value from t 1 to t 2 and the dependent variable as change in value from t 2 to t 3. 
Figure 2 illustrates our empirical model.
Streams
Although underlying theoretical concepts represented by policy, problem, and 
politics streams are complex and multi-faceted, we employ an empirical strategy that 
favors parsimony in order to reduce complexity in testing and interpreting variables 
with conditional relationships. First, to operationalize problems and policy streams, 
we again follow Fowler’s (2019) empirical strategy, and use toxic releases and state 
environmental expenditures, respectively. Toxic releases are a key indicator of “the 
conditions that policymakers and implementers seek to alter, with [policy adoption 
and implementation] efforts aimed to that end. As such, existing toxic releases cap-
tures the existing problems” with attention from both policymakers and implement-
ers" (Fowler, 2019). Toxic releases are also a key indicator of toxins released into the 
environment that are correlated with other measures of environmental quality.
In addition, as Fowler (2019) argues, states retain control over program funding, 
which allows state policymakers to use budgeting to constrict or expand resources 
in order to affect policies in practice. While the CAA, CWA, and RCRA are federal 
programs, state legislatures serve as gatekeepers for funding allocations, and states 
must adopt implementation plans into state law; both of which provide specific 
opportunities for state policymakers to determine how programs are operational-
ized within their jurisdictions. Notably, federal funding only partially supports state 
efforts, and does not include the level of variability across states or over time nec-
essary to identify any specific effects. Moreover, state funding is the primary mech-
anisms by which legislatures influence program implementation. Furthermore, 
previous research indicates there is a flypaper effect for state spending, where states 
spend more in response to EPA grants. Consequently, using state environmental 
expenditures also allows us to account for how federal grants may feed into state 
policy processes (Clark & Whitford, 2011). In other words, while the CAA, CWA, 
and RCRA are federal policies, state funding is part of an annual agenda-setting 
and policy adoption process which represents decisions concerning how policies 
should be curtailed to local contexts and the corresponding implementation of those

decisions, from which we can connect an output from agenda-setting and policy 
adoption processes produced at regular intervals to other factors. We measure both 
expenditures and toxic releases as 1 year change in per capita rate to make a better 
comparison between states, with data from the U.S. Census Bureau and EPA, respec-
tively, and expenditures as real 2009 dollars in order to control for inflation.
Second, we operationalize the politics streams with two variables: citizen ideol-
ogy, and League of Conservation Voters (LCV) National Environmental Scorecard. 
In both cases, variables are modeled as changes from 1 year to the next. We differ 
from Fowler (2019) in this regard as he relies on a measure of public opinion that is 
temporally limited to the 2000s and is time invariant. In addition, the politics stream 
is likely the most nebulous concept to empirically model here, with few measures 
that capture how interests may be balanced with enough specificity to apply to envi-
ronmental policy. As such, we first look to a general indicator of interstate politi-
cal differences: ideology. We use Berry, Fording, Ringquist, Hanson, and Klarner’s 
(2010) measure of state government ideology that places states on a continuum from 
conservative to liberal based on interest group ratings of Congressional delegations. 
Berry et al. (2010, 2012) argue this measure can be used to infer ideological orienta-
tions of both state elected officials and electorates who elected them. Consequently, 
we assume liberal states will be more favorable to environmental interests in policy 
adoption processes and implementers will respond to ideological bents in construct-
ing their policy interpretations. However, the generality of ideology may limit its 
applicability when examining a specific policy area and, in using it, we must assume 
a correlation between liberalism and environmentalism.
To provide a second perspective, we also incorporate LCV scorecards, which 
provides a more specific rating of how often Congressional delegations cast pro-en-
vironmental votes on key legislation. We measure this as the annual percentage of 
pro-environmental votes made by state delegations. Although this measure is not 
as sophisticated as Berry et al.’s (2010) measure of government ideology, it rests 
on the same logic in inferring state-level political ideologies based on behavior of 
Congressional delegations. This provides us with a specific indicator of how elected 
officials perceive competing interests in environmental policy choices. As such, we 
assume elected officials in states whose Congressional delegations are rated as more 
pro-environmental will share a favorable attitude toward environmental interests 
and implementers will respond accordingly when interpreting policy. Table 2 pro-
vides descriptions of variables used in the analysis.
Although this provides us with measures of the streams, it does not account for 
ambiguity. Unfortunately, ambiguity is nearly impossible to quantitatively model 
here, but we should note its role in shaping how policy actors identify problems, 
interpret policies, and decode politics. For instance, there is significant research on 
social construction of problem indicators and how they spawn value-laden metrics 
(Pierce et al., 2014; Schneider & Sidney, 2009; Yearley, 2002). While we look at toxic 
releases as a measure of pollution, it may not be equally weighted across all policy 
subsystems in the same way, and some policy entrepreneurs may choose to identify 
other problem indicators as more important (e.g., symbolic thresholds). As such, our 
measure of problems here does not assume toxic releases are an objective problem

that is equally interpreted across all states, but rather, it assumes that policy actors 
rely on toxic releases as an indicator when interpreting environmental problems. 
Moreover, if policy actors are unconcerned with toxic releases, then there is unlikely 
to be any relationship with policy adoption choices or implementation behaviors. 
Similarly, we must also assume that state-level expenditures, citizen ideology, and 
environmental voting records are measures that reflect ambiguous contexts in which 
policy processes play out.
Policy Outputs
Our theoretical model identifies three separate outputs: policy adoption out-
puts, implementation outputs, and policy process outputs. However, the rather 
complex and abstract nature of implementation outputs (i.e., norms of implementa-
tion behaviors) creates a significant methodological challenge in searching for mea-
surement equivalence between different choice opportunities and uses of discretion 
(Jilke, Meuleman, & Van de Walle, 2015; Tummers & Bekkers, 2014). In order to ad-
dress this challenge, we continue to follow Fowler’s (2019) empirical strategy and 
assume that policy process outputs are a result of implementation outputs, but leave 
implementation outputs unobserved in the model. As such, we infer a causal link 
between the unobserved variable (i.e., implementation outputs) and the next theo-
retical step in the process (i.e., policy process outputs). We, therefore, assume that 
policy process outputs should be a direct result of implementation behaviors. This, 
of course, presents pros and cons. On the one hand, it allows us to build on Fowler 
(2019) both theoretically and empirically, and eliminates any “white noise” created 
by ineffective measures of implementation outputs. On the other hand, it skips over 
an important theoretical step in the policy process model (Howlett, 2011), and as-
sumes a causal link. Given competing demands, we determined that the probative 
value of building on Fowler (2019) outweighs limitations of leaving implementation 
outputs as an unobserved variable; however, we should be circumspect in thinking 
about findings in light of the limitations that this creates.
Consequently, we focus on policy adoption outputs and policy process outputs 
as dependent variables, which we measure as state environmental expenditures and 
toxic releases, respectively. In both cases, our dependent variables are in keeping 
with Travis and Zahariadis (2002) and Fowler (2019), which are two key empirical 
analyses of policy adoption and implementation using MSF, respectively. As argued 
above, control over spending is a key policy tool wielded by state policymakers 
to influence implementation of federal environmental programs, and toxic releases 
is an indicator of problems that policymakers and implementers want to affect 
through policy processes. As such, these largely capture two important dimensions 
of policy processes in terms of what policy choices are made and how those choices 
are implemented. We use lagged variables and measure change over time (see 
Table 1), so dependent variables capture a corresponding change in policy outputs 
that results from changes in streams. In addition, we measure both expenditures and 
toxic releases as per capita rates to make a better comparison between states, and 
expenditures as real 2009 dollars in order to control for inflation.

Fowler: Connecting Policymaking and Policy Implementation 629
As we measure policy and problems streams with the same variables (at dif-
ferent time intervals), our assumptions about causal pathways are important here. 
First, we assume initial spending (politics stream) influences spending the follow-
ing year (policy adoption outputs), which in turn influences implementer behav-
ior (implementation outputs). Second, we assume toxic releases (problems stream) 
influence both policymaker choices concerning spending (policy adoption outputs) 
and implementation behavior (implementation outputs), which affects future toxic 
releases (policy process outputs). As such, our policy adoption hypothesis is: effects 
of LCV scores and citizen ideology (politics) on next year’s environmental expendi-
tures (policy adoption outputs) are conditional on current expenditure levels (poli-
cies) and toxic releases (problems), where different relationships emerge depending 
on whether current expenditures and toxic releases are moderate (i.e., at the mean), 
or extremely high (i.e., three standard deviations above the mean or the 99.7th per -
centile). In addition, our implementation hypothesis is: effects of LCV scores and 
citizen ideology (politics) on next year’s toxic releases (policy process outputs) are 
conditional on current expenditure levels (policies) and toxic releases (problems), 
where different relationships emerge depending on whether current expenditures 
and toxic releases are moderate (i.e., at the mean), or extremely high (i.e., three stan-
dard deviations above the mean). Finally, our interdependent process hypothesis is: 
effects of LCV scores and citizen ideology, expenditures, and toxic releases on future 
environmental expenditures are not independent from their effects on future toxic 
releases.
Other Co-variants
To control for an initial baseline of policy adoption and policy process outputs, 
we include control variables for expenditures and toxic releases during the ini-
tial observation year (i.e., t 1), respectively. We measure expenditures as per capita 
spending in real 2009 dollars, and toxic releases as thousands of pounds per person. 
In addition, while EPA delegates authority over the CAA, CWA, and RCRA to most 
states, it retains authority in a few. As such, we control for program authority using a 
dummy variable comparing states with authority over CAA, CWA, and RCRA pro-
grams to those without authority (U.S. EPA, 2019a). Note that unlike other variables, 
co-variants are not measured as change over time, but are time variant.
Analysis
Given that we are interested in examining two processes that are separate but 
not independent, we test our data using SUR. SUR builds on ordinary least squares 
(OLS) regression by creating a joint estimate of two or more equations through a 
single iterative procedure. Previous scholarship argues that SUR is more efficient 
than single equation estimators by utilizing relevant information from cross-re-
gression correlations when determining parameters for each equation (Andrews 
& Van de Walle, 2013; Jackson, 2002; Martin & Smith, 2005; Mintz & Huang, 1990; 
 15410072, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psj.12381 by WORLD BANK, Wiley Online Library on [18/03/2025].

630 Policy Studies Journal, 50:3
Zellner, 1962). Specifically, “SUR estimation transforms the errors so that they all 
have the same variance and are uncorrelated. This transformation is then applied 
to the other variables in each equation, and OLS is applied to these transformed 
variables. This procedure  … offers more precise parameter estimates than single 
equation least squares because it incorporates the additional information provided 
by the correlation between the individual equation errors” (Martin & Smith, 2005, p. 
604). However, SUR estimations are only more efficient than OLS when correlations 
are significantly different from zero, and most software packages (e.g., Stata) will 
default to OLS if predictor variables are identical across equations (Mintz & Huang, 
1990; StataCorp, 2017).
Since our hypotheses focus on a conditional nature of stream effects on policy 
outputs, we use interaction terms to test relationships between our predictors and 
dependent variables. As interaction terms can cause inflated standard errors, we 
cluster standard errors at the state  level, which assumes standard errors are cor -
related within states over time but not across states. In addition, although SUR pro-
vides some correction for potential serial correlation issues that may exist in pooled 
cross-sectional datasets, this provides an extra safeguard against biased estimation of 
standard errors (Beck & Katz, 1995, 1996; Fowler, 2019; Primo, Jacobsmeier, & Milyo, 
2007; Travis & Zahariadis, 2002). Finally, coefficients for interaction terms can be dif-
ficult to interpret, so we use standardized coefficients and graph interaction effects 
(Fowler, 2019; Travis & Zahariadis, 2002). As we use two dependent variables, stan-
dardized coefficients allow for some comparison of effects within and between mod-
els, which would otherwise be inappropriate (King, 1986). Graphs compare effects 
when predictor variables are at mean values to values three standard deviations 
above the mean in order to illustrate differences that emerge between moderate and 
extreme values. We present two models: model 1 uses LCV scores to measure the 
politics stream, and model 2, citizen ideology.
Results
Table 3 displays results for both models, while Figure 3 graphs results for both 
dependent variables in model 1 and Figure 4, results for model 2. First, findings in 
both models indicate effects of politics on policy adoption outputs are conditional 
on existing policies and problems, which supports our policy adoption hypothe-
sis. Statistically significant interactions between stream variables denote effects of 
both LCV scores and citizen ideology on future environmental expenditures are con-
ditional on current expenditures and toxic releases. As coefficients for interaction 
terms are difficult to interpret directly, Figures 3 and 4 illustrate these relationships. 
Consistently in both figures, we see only marginal differences emerge in the rela-
tionship between both politics stream variables and future expenditures when either 
current expenditures or toxic releases are at the mean. However, when both current 
expenditures and toxic releases values are at three standard deviations above the 
mean, a definite positive relationship between both politics variables and future ex-
penditures becomes evident, where increased political value on environmentalism 
is correlated with increased spending. In addition, there also appears to be little

difference in future expenditures when both expenditures and toxic releases are at 
three standard deviations above the mean if either LCV scores or citizen ideology 
are at the mean.
Second, findings for both models suggest effects of politics on policy process out-
puts are conditional on existing policies and problems, which supports our imple-
mentation hypothesis. Statistically significant interactions between stream variables 
indicate effects of both LCV scores and citizen ideology on future toxic releases 
are conditional on current expenditures and toxic releases. Although interactions 
between LCV scores and other stream variables individually are statistically signifi-
cant, the interaction between all three stream variables is not statistically significant

is used to measure politics in model 2. Similar to findings for policy adoption out-
puts in Figures 3 and 4, we see only marginal differences emerge in the relationship

Third, results of the Breusch–Pagan test are statistically significant for both mod-
els, which supports our interdependent process hypothesis. Findings indicate that 
residuals from both equations are correlated, which suggests that although separate, 
policy adoption and implementation processes are not independent from each other. 
Unfortunately, this test is limited in offering additional inferences about the relation-
ship between policy adoption and implementation, but other model statistics offer 
further insights. Notably, there is a negative correlation of residuals in both models, 
which suggests that as one equation becomes more efficient, the other becomes less 
efficient. In addition, R2 statistics indicate that our models are much better predic-
tors of policy process outputs than policy adoption outputs. Taken together, this 
suggests that while there is overlap in how predictors affect both policy adoption 
and policy process outputs, there is also a significant degree of divergence. In other 
words, even though the same factors likely exist in both, policy adoption streams 
likely materialize differently than implementation streams. Despite this, it appears 
that interactions between expenditures and toxic releases are particularly import-
ant indicators of both policy adoption and policy process outputs across the board. 
Finally, findings for program authorities indicate that increased state responsibil-
ity for federal environmental programs leads to both more expenditures and lower 
toxic releases; however, effects are not statistically significant for policy adoption, so 
they should be interpreted with caution.
Discussion
Findings provide support for our policy adoption, implementation, and interde-
pendent process hypotheses. In sum, effects of politics on policy adoption outputs 
and policy implementation are conditional on current policies and problems, and 
those effects are correlated with each other. Specifically, when environmental ex-
penditures (policies), toxic releases (problems), or LCV scores or citizen ideology 
(politics) are at moderate levels, there are only marginal differences across policy 
outputs. Moreover, when all three increase to extreme levels, significant departures 
from status quo emerge. While our empirical models provide statistical evidence, it 
is also important to think about how this process plays out in practical terms. To start, 
if political winds shift in a pro-environment direction, legislatures may not respond 
by increasing spending, particularly if indicators do not suggest an environmen-
tal problem or they operate in an atmosphere of budget austerity. However, if this 
is coupled with both increasing pollution and nonincremental spending increases 
from previous years, then state legislatures are faced with a unique situation: there is 
a problem that is getting worse that has political support and that legislatures have 
already invested substantial resources into. Consequently, legislatures are likely to 
respond by further investing resources in hopes that it spurs improvements in the 
problem, or at least, dissipates political interest.
By extension, without new resources flooding into environmental agencies, imple-
menters are unlikely to shift their behavior or norms of practice, so the status quo

remains intact. Moreover, when new resources are coupled with a growing political 
interest in environmental quality and rising pollution levels, implementers are forced 
to respond by changing the norms of how they monitor and enforce environmental 
regulations in order to improve environmental conditions. Nevertheless, if pollution 
levels off, then implementers will likely maintain their current approach by rational-
izing that changing may aggravate the problem or that what they are doing works. In 
addition, if new resources from policymakers dissipate political interest in the envi-
ronment, then there is no pressure on implementers to change in the first place. In 
sum, it takes a unique set of conditions to trigger both collective choices to change 
social conditions and the necessary collective actions to put those choices into practice.
Of course, ambiguity plays a key role here, and we assume that our measures 
reflect facets of policy adoption and implementation contexts that create an objective 
comparison across states. Ambiguity is difficult to account for though, and mecha-
nisms by which policy actors interpret their surroundings is unclear. For instance, 
toxic releases may not be an important problem indicator for some. While our anal-
ysis provides empirical evidence to support our narrative above, it only begins to 
unravel the black box of policy processes that includes both decision making and exe-
cution. For instance, this does not directly account for the often changing and some-
times contradictory regulatory demands placed on state agencies by federal agencies. 
Our dataset covers three presidencies with different approaches to environmental 
policy, which reverberated through the federal system (e.g., Konisky & Woods, 2016; 
Rabe, 2007). As we examine program management in a federal system, it behooves us 
not to overlook intergovernmental dimensions that play an important role in shaping 
policy outcomes when attempting to build theory around policy implementation.
Most importantly, while our findings do provide evidence that policy adoption and 
implementation are correlated with each other, our observations do not provide much 
depth to the exact nature of that relationship. Our research design is based on a two-stage 
process with implementation following policy adoption, where we assume “a spend-
ing bill passed today is driven by environmental conditions of yesterday, but affects 
implementation and policy outputs of tomorrow” (Fowler, 2019, p. 15). However, some 
scholars argue that in reality implementation tends to coincide with policy adoption, 
where administrators work to manage problems at the same time policymakers are 
deciding what to do. We also assume that politics and problem streams exist in much 
the same way for policy adoption and implementation. However, some scholars argue 
that politics and problem streams are constructed differently during implementation 
than during policy adoption, particularly as policymakers have different relationships 
with citizens than policy implementers (e.g., Boswell & Rodrigues, 2016).
In addition, we leave policy implementation outputs (i.e., norms of policies 
in practice) unobserved in the model, and assume a direct correlation with policy 
process outputs (i.e., toxic releases). While our assumptions create a parsimonious 
research design to test our hypotheses and can be justified, they also create import-
ant limitations for our findings and the inferences that can be made about policy 
processes. Unfortunately, this is a common shortcoming, and “management and 
managerial behaviors are crucial but underexplored and underexamined variables 
in the policy literature” (Howlett & Walker, 2012, p. 212). While some scholars offer

suggestions for resolving the problem with the “missing” public manager variable, 
there are few good methodological solutions to empirically modeling how policy 
implementers apply administrative discretion in an ambiguous and chaotic environ-
ment (Howlett, 2011; Meier, 2009; Robichau & Lynn, 2009). Certainly, this element 
requires extensive additional research, but its absence from our empirical models 
does not negate the novelty of our findings. At minimum, using SUR here allows us 
to show that the conditional relationship among policy, politics, and problems is not 
isolated to policy adoption and has an interdependent relationship with policy pro-
cess outputs. Even if we disregard the implementation element (which we caution 
readers not to), this finding alone is noteworthy, as MSF scholars work to develop 
and quantitatively test hypotheses and to expand MSF beyond policy adoption so 
that it becomes a more robust theory.
Finally, if we assume that ambiguity shapes interpretations of environmental 
conditions, then we also have to question whether using a measure such as change in 
toxic releases is an effective problem indicator. For instance, limiting climate change 
to two degrees Celsius has long been a climate policy goal, but in many ways, this is a 
symbolic threshold as there is a significant degree of uncertainty surrounding actual 
climate thresholds (Keller, Bolker, & Bradford, 2004). Toxic releases are not framed 
by the same type of symbolic thresholds, so we are unable to examine it here; other 
more specific forms of pollution are though. For example, air quality is measured by 
pollutant concentrations, but some scholars argue that managers are focused on how 
often pollutant concentrations exceed recommended levels, rather than marginal 
changes in pollutant concentration (Fowler, 2016). Given this, additional research 
is necessary to examine whether conditional relationships between streams and the 
interdependence of policy processes is altered by symbolic thresholds.
Conclusions
A key contribution of this research is providing empirical evidence that sup-
ports a MSF theoretical model of a whole policy process, which is an important ex-
pansion that addresses key criticisms of existing scholarship. Most importantly, this 
builds a deeper understanding of how collective choices lead to collective actions, 
and in turn, solve social problems. Although previous scholarship is well developed 
in many areas related to this, there are few examples of models that incorporate 
both policy choices and execution. As such, our examination provides new insights 
into how ambiguous circumstances surrounding two distinct subprocesses can be 
integrated in order to understand a single complex process. As governance schemes 
evolve and become reliant on nongovernmental organizations and networks, under-
standing how to connect choices and actions will become an important determinant 
of success. Although our analysis focuses on state governments here, MSF is not 
exclusive to public agencies or traditional policy-making bodies, which allows it to 
incorporate institutional arrangements that include myriad organizations working 
to manage public problems. This will likely be important as we further consider how 
political power is used to manipulate policy choices and public service delivery in 
nonhierarchical arrangements with pluralistic interests.

This examination begins to build a bridge between MSF scholarship and demo-
cratic governance from which advice and guidance can be derived. From our findings, 
we can glean that windows open for both policy choices and execution when politics, 
problems, and policies come together, and this is a key step in successful policy gover-
nance. We can also infer that while policy windows can be utilized to increase program 
resources, those new resources may not affect policy outputs unless the right political 
and problem circumstances exist. As such, policy entrepreneurs should follow policy 
ideas through adoption and into implementation in order to ensure social problems 
actually improve. Otherwise, they may be successful in having policies adopted only 
to see those policies fail in practice. While our findings are limited in providing spe-
cific guidance beyond this point, scholars have vigorously explored other MSF con-
cepts (Herweg et al., 2018). As such, our theoretical model also makes it possible to 
integrate bodies of literature to create a cohesive explanation of policy processes.
Nevertheless, additional research is necessary. First, core MSF concepts that have 
previously been seen as self-contained within agenda-setting and policy adoption or 
policy implementation need to be considered within a broader policy process. For 
example, existing research considers how policy entrepreneurs operate during both 
policy process stages, but those concepts can be more effectively integrated. While 
scholarship is well developed in terms of policy entrepreneurship during agen-
da-setting or policy adoption, there is far less insight into how transitions between 
two interdependent processes impact strategies or tactics (Frisch-Aviram, Beeri, & 
Cohen, 2019; Roberts & King, 1991; Zahariadis, 2005; Zahariadis & Exadakatylos, 
2016). As such, scholars should examine how policy entrepreneurs switch focus 
from policymakers to policy implementers, and whether some policy entrepreneurs 
limit themselves to one part of the process or another.
Second, scholarship should integrate findings and synthesize advice and guid-
ance for democratic governance, so practitioners can more effectively navigate 
ambiguous policy environments. Ideally, by better understanding how the whole 
policy process comes together, policy actors can have a more acute understanding 
of their role in it and how to achieve outcomes that improve our society. To do so 
requires scholars to bridge the gap between theory and practice, so scholarship is 
palatable for non-academics. Finally, as this is only an initial examination of this 
model, further research is necessary to experiment with alternative research designs 
(e.g., conditional path analysis or conditional mixed-process modeling) that pro-
vide for more sophisticated modeling of relationships, such as concurrent processes. 
Although MSF is already widely used by students of public policy, expanding the-
oretical models to incorporate both policy adoption and implementation addresses 
key criticisms and increases its utility in understanding policy processes.
