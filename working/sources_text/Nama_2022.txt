Abstract
There is a growing concern about the lack of skilled municipal employees who can 
deliver essential services to under-resourced local communities in South Africa. 
However, coaching and mentoring appear underutilized to train municipal employ -
ees to improve service delivery to local communities. The study aims to investigate 
whether coaching and mentoring could capacitate municipal employees whose perfor-
mance appraisal reveals a lack of skills to provide essential services. A cross-sectiona l 
research design was adopted to conduct a survey. The target population comprised 265 
municipal employees, and a stratified random sample of 115 employees completed a 
questionnaire. The employees held positions of general managers, general assistants, 
and administrators, with varied years of experience. Cronbach’s Alpha indicated an 
overall high 0.8 questionnaire reliability score. 
Using a quantitative method, responses from municipal employees were collected to 
examine their perceptions of the influence of training and development on employ -
ee performance and service delivery. Hypotheses were tested using the bivaria nt in-
ferential statistical tests of correlation (r) and Chi-square (χ 2). The results indicated 
that training and development were more likely to improve employee performance. 
Furthermore, the results showed that trained employees were more likely to improve 
service delivery. In particular, coaching and mentoring could be used to improve per -
formance. Therefore, the study found that the municipality was not providing employ-
ees with relevant training and development to enable them to address poor service 
delivery. Finally, the study recommends that the municipality invests in training and 
development to enrich employees with new skills and knowledge to improve the qual-
ity of service delivery.

INTRODUCTION
The public sector has been widely criticized for poor performance 
and service delivery (Govender, 2017; Fernandes & Fresly, 2017). 
Mamokhere (2020) affirmed that poor, insufficient, or a complete lack 
of service delivery remains a significant challenge for local municipal -
ities in an emerging economy like South Africa. Local municipalities 
that neglect the training and development of employees have the po -
tential to deliver inadequate essential services to communities. In  ad-
dition, the lack of proper training and development may lead to poor 
employee performance, as well as the inadequate provision of essential 
services such as clean water, sanitation, sufficient health services, relia-
ble electricity, and accessible road networks (Hee et al., 2019). Previous 
research highlighted the contribution of general human resource

management to improved employee performance in the public sector (Zakar ia et al., 2017; Mehlape, 
2017; Hee et al., 2019; Kareem & Hussein, 2019). However, the role of trainin g and development as a 
mechanism for employee performance and service delivery in local munici palities is under-researched. 
South African local municipalities have been characterized b y maladministration, plunder of public 
resources, nepotism, shortages of skilled employees, corruption , and lack of financial accountability 
(Govender, 2017; Mamokhere, 2020). Moreover, the lack of investment in t raining and development 
coupled with ineffective mentoring and coaching programs aimed at nurtu ring graduates, as well as 
creating a pool of experienced technical managers, indicates that broader human resource development 
is overlooked (Govender, 2016; Ngobese, 2017). Investing in training and development has the potential 
to enhance employee performance and service delivery at local municipal ities. 
Lack of timely, effective, and efficient training and development initiatives coupled with corruption and 
lack of financial accountability and transparency negatively affect employee performance and the provi-
sion of essential services. Therefore, there is a need to examine whether ad opting training and develop -
ment interventions such as coaching and mentoring can strengthen employee performance. In addition, 
trained and developed employees might improve the delivery of essenti al basic services, particularly 
needed in developmental states exemplified by South Africa.
1. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Despite broader human resource development not 
being recognized as a strategic business partner in 
the local government sphere, training and develop-
ment initiatives are vital in ensuring that employ -
ees contribute toward the organizational strategy 
(Chibi, 2017). As a human resource development 
mechanism, training and development initiatives 
are used to improve employee skills and knowl -
edge (Heathfield, 2020; Hassan et al., 2019). Asfaw 
et al. (2015) postulated that training and develop -
ment enhance employee capabilities, with the goal 
that organizations can expand the proficiency, ef -
ficiency, and effectiveness of human assets, thus 
performing optimally. However, Ardichvili (2012) 
highlights that training and development can fo -
cus on short-term financial goals, record-keeping, 
and compliance while ignoring employee poten -
tial’s holistic development. 
Relevant training activities and programs give 
superior employee performance and improved 
service delivery (Fuente & Bartram, 2018; Hee 
et al.,  2019). Ballies (2009), Ngobese (2017), and 
Mehlape (2017) posited that it is of paramount 
importance to conduct training thoroughly as 
well as to ensure that training initiatives are 
evaluated and tailor-made to enable employees 
to grow, be competent, and perform optimally. 
However, municipalities seem to provide irrele -
vant training due to poor needs analysis, a lack 
of management and employee commitment, and 
the necessary knowledge and skills for training 
practitioners to empower employees (Abdullah, 
2009; Beer et al., 2016).
On-the-job training is exemplified by classroom 
lectures, simulation exercises, coaching, mentor -
ing, induction, apprenticeship, workshops and 
conferences, formal training, and development 
courses. These examples have the potential to in -
crease employee performance and enable workers 
to develop specific knowledge and skills to per -
form a job task. Durham (2017) states that on-the-
job training and development involve developing 
employees with common tools and equipment for 
specific tasks and activities. Tabassi et al. (2011) 
posited that on-the-job training is probably the 
most common method of employee development 
employed at various levels, particularly in the pub-
lic sector. In addition, increasing attention should 
be drawn to internal training and the use of on-
the-job training rather than off-the-job training. 
Tabassi et al. (2011) further affirmed that conduct-
ing on-the-job training is cost-effective. Hence, 
relevant on-the-job training like coaching and 
mentoring can be offered to municipal employees. 
While employee coaching may historically de -
rive from different roots, more recently, the con -
cepts were deemed to be primarily similar (Lues,

2016; Mason, 2021). Lues (2016) further argues 
that “employee coaching refers to planned one-
to-one instruction where a coach explains tasks, 
addresses questions, and offers counsel to the 
employee.” In the same vein, Mabope (2018) 
emphasized that coaching and regular feedback 
should be used to manage employee perfor -
mance in municipalities. Therefore, employees 
ought to be developed through employee coach -
ing as a training and development initiative. 
Similarly, Grosseck (2014) espoused that em -
ployee coaching exemplifies promoting behav -
ior at work to improve skills, knowledge, and 
abilities, which may result in improved employ -
ee performance and service delivery. However, 
care needs to be taken, especially in weak inter -
nal cultures, where managers are not depend -
ent on external coaches (Garvey et al., 2017; 
Mabope, 2018) and mentors.
Mentoring relationships occur within a constel -
lation of formal mentors, informal mentors, peer 
mentors, supervisory mentors, and other develop -
mental relationships within and outside the work -
place (Ragins, 2016). Mentoring relationships are 
projected to deliver exceptional results that ad -
vance employees, enhance competence, and pro -
pel careers (Lapointe & Vandenberghe, 2017). 
Mabope (2018) perceives “mentoring as a popular 
mechanism to develop a talent pool of employees 
and transfer essential job-related skills, behav -
iors, and attitudes.” In the same vein, Salter (2014) 
highlights that the potential for the transferability 
of skills from mentoring and coaching programs 
is under-researched. 
A theory by Garvey et al. (2017) proposed that 
coaching and mentoring were training and devel -
opment strategies that could be used to enhance 
employee performance, knowledge, and nurture 
skills. Similarly, Coetzee et al. (2013) noted that 
coaching underscores the relationship between a 
manager and an individual employee. Mentoring 
refers to a relationship in which an expert in the 
field gives guidance, advice, and friendship to a 
younger, less experienced employee. The coach -
ing and mentoring strategy aims to develop and 
enhance employee performance. For instance, the 
municipality may allocate mentors and coaches to 
employees who underperform to improve perfor -
mance and overall productivity.
Training and development initiatives are vital for 
improving employee performance. According 
to Pawirosumarto et al. (2017), employee perfor -
mance entails creativity, innovation, commit -
ment, and the single result of an employee’s work. 
Hee et al.  (2019) found that formal and informal 
training that focuses on basic skills and man -
agement skills development improves employee 
performance. Training and development require 
assessment tools to identify organizational and 
individual development areas. Without proper 
assessment strategies and the ability to predict 
employee competencies through performance ap -
praisals, organizations may become unclear about 
necessary competencies (Hussein, 2019). By im -
plementing assessment strategies and processes 
correctly, organizations ought to measure critical 
competencies and take steps to address areas that 
need development. In addition, practical training 
and development should increase employee job 
performance through performance appraisal and 
management to enable employees to develop the 
required knowledge and skills. 
DeNisi and Murphy (2017) stated that perfor -
mance management involves various activities, 
policies, procedures, and interventions estab -
lished to help employees improve performance. 
Performance appraisal is the primary step during 
the performance management process, which in -
cludes feedback, goal-setting, and training, as well 
as reward systems. Performance management is at 
a turning point with scrutiny and questioning by 
scholars for being too one-sided, a waste of time, 
and damaging relationships between managers 
and subordinates (Moynihan, 2008; Van Dooren 
et al., 2010; Lawler, 2012; Mackenzie et al., 2019). 
Voom et al. (2020) highlighted the difficulty of 
measuring and monitoring performance in the 
public sector compared to the private sector since 
public goals are complex to quantify, and the pub -
lic sector operates differently from competitive 
environments. Moreover, human resource depart-
ments need assurance that “performance assess -
ment techniques are aimed at identifying employ -
ee strengths and weaknesses to execute sustaina -
ble corrective measures, when necessary” (Mone 
& London, 2018). In addition, budget and planning 
cycles need some consideration when assessing 
development programs. Kariuki and Reddy (2019)

posited that performance agreements should be 
developed timeously and investigated and correct-
ed for poor performance. 
Performance management discovers the reasons 
for underperformance as well as suggests ways to 
improve performance (DeNisi & Murphy, 2017). 
Receiving feedback about performance increases the 
motivation to perform better for future performance 
(Aguinis, 2019). In addition, proper performance 
management can assist the municipality in improv-
ing the quality of service delivery, as this process 
may be conducted annually. However, the poor im-
plementation of performance management systems 
may lead to decreased motivation, including the feel-
ing that superior performance is not translated into 
meaningful tangibles such as increases in pay, pro-
motion, and rewards for personal recognition.
Involving lower-level management in deci -
sion-making processes increases employee job 
satisfaction. In addition, it benefits the munici -
pality by retaining talented and experienced indi -
viduals who will be able to deliver coaching and 
mentoring (on-the-job training) to employees. 
Furthermore, decentralization is based on the 
principle of sub-solidarity. In this rule, the provi -
sion, production, and delivery of services are de -
volved to local structures that comply with the re -
quirements and needs of the citizens. Kamara et al. 
(2017) argue that “decentralized local governance 
contributes to development to promote participa -
tory development strategies and the establishment 
of policies for local needs.”
Pradeep (2011) highlights that the decentraliza -
tion of service delivery functions is widely prac -
ticed worldwide, especially in local government 
structures, and is most recommended for local 
municipalities. Decentralization is an organi -
zation and management philosophy that moves 
decision-making away from centralized control 
(higher-level managers) and closer to middle or 
lower-level managers (Plunket et al., 2008). This 
approach lets employees know what is expected of 
them and fosters a smooth provision of services 
to the public. Furthermore, decentralized author -
ity enables management to make appropriate de -
cisions to run the organization smoothly. Lastly, 
employees are empowered and involved in the 
company’s decision-making. 
According to Pradeep (2011), various public ser -
vice delivery models can be adopted, namely the 
direct service delivery model, privatization ser -
vice delivery model, decentralized service deliv -
ery model, and alternative service delivery model. 
The direct service delivery model refers to when 
the government assumes full responsibility and 
accountability in providing services, either di -
rectly operating from headquarters or through 
de-concentrated line agencies. On the other hand, 
in the privatization service delivery model, the 
central government delivers public services to pri -
vate companies’ ownership and control (Bauer & 
Markmann, 2016). In this case, the government 
has no responsibility or control over distributed 
services except for monitoring and enforcing the 
company’s compliance with legal codes. 
Govender (2016) argues that service delivery com -
prises multiple networks and organizations that 
provide services and products to the masses. The 
South African Constitution (1996) purports that 
the objectives of municipalities include the provi -
sion of essential services sustainably. Municipalities 
are the primary agents of service delivery to com -
munities through the prioritization of Integrated 
Development Planning (Koma, 2010). The quality 
of service depends on the skills, knowledge, abili -
ties, and experience the human resources possess. 
Quality creates a complex relationship of interac -
tions and interdependencies between service deliv-
ery and training interventions. Employee training 
and development through coaching and mentoring 
initiatives can result in improved employee perfor-
mance, ultimately resulting in high quality of ser -
vice delivery. Hence, the study aims to investigate 
whether coaching and mentoring can train employ-
ees to perform duties that deliver services to com -
munities. The proposed hypotheses are:
H1: Trained and developed employees are more 
likely to improve performance. 
H1a: Coached and mentored employees are more 
likely to increase performance.
H1b: Employees who lack coaching and mentoring 
are less likely to enhance performance.
H2: Trained and developed employees are more 
likely to enhance service delivery.

2. METHODOLOGY
The study adopted a cross-sectional quantitative 
research design. Data from sample respondents 
were collected using a closed-ended structured 
questionnaire. The quantitative approach ena -
bled the paper to test the hypothesized relation -
ships between training and development, employ -
ee performance, and service delivery. As shown 
in Table 1, the target population comprised 20 
managers, 132 administrative employees, and 113 
general workers at a selected municipality in the 
Eastern Cape province of South Africa. A sample 
of 12 managers, 77 administrative employees, and 
66 general workers was selected using a stratified 
sampling technique, resulting in 155 respondents. 
Of the envisaged 155 respondents, only 115 par -
ticipated and returned the questionnaire, which 
translated into a 74% response rate.

The results sections described the statistical proce -
dures and results of the study. Demographic data 
of respondents was represented through frequen -
cies and percentages. Correlations and chi-square 
scores were obtained to examine relationships be -
tween training and development, employee per -
formance and service delivery. Tables were used 
to illustrate the results of the study and whether 
hypothesis were accepted or rejected.

The gender profile of respondents showed more 
female respondents (56.5%) than males (43.5%). 
Most respondents had between 1 to 5 years of ser -
vice (44.3%), while some reported having more 
than ten years of service (22.6%). For the age cat -
egory, the majority of respondents were aged be -
tween 31 to 40 years (51.31%), and the lowest num-
ber was represented by a few respondents aged be-
tween 20-25 years (3.47%). Regarding job positions, 
management constituted 11.43%, administration 
constituted 45.21%, and general assistant posi -
tions constituted 43.48%. As illustrated in Table 
3, for academic qualifications, most respondents 
were degree or diploma holders (38.3%), followed 
by matric holders (31.3%), while only 0.9% of re -
spondents possessed a Master’s degree.

Table 4 showed an association between training 
and development and employee performance. 
The beta test was at 0.672 with a p-value of 0.000, 
which showed a significant positive relationship 
between training and development and employee 
performance. The result meant that the training 
and development construct explained up to 44.7% 
of the variance in employee performance. Hence, 
hypothesis one was accepted.

coaching and mentoring, as well as employee 
performance, is depicted in Table 5. The results 
for the correlation coefficient were (p < 0.01); p = 
0.000 and showed that coaching and mentoring 
positively affected employee performance. In ad -
dition, the results showed a statistically significant 
relationship between coaching and employee per -
formance (p = 0.000). Therefore, hypothesis one 
(a) and hypothesis one (b) were both accepted.

A chi-square correlation test was conducted to assess 
the association between training and development 
and service delivery. The predictive effect of train -
ing development on service delivery was presented 
in Table 6 through a path regression analysis. The 
beta value indicated the impact and direction of the 
relationship, while the p-value estimated the signifi-
cance of the predictive effect. Therefore, training and 
development had a positive (β = 0.271) and statisti-
cally significant (p = 0.002) impact on service deliv-
ery. Hence, hypothesis two was accepted.
4. DISCUSSION
The study examined whether training and de -
velopment initiatives of coaching and mentoring 
could enhance employee performance and service 
delivery. The study found that training and de -
velopment were linked to employee performance. 
This finding is consistent with Hee et al. (2019) 
and Jubek et al. (2019), who revealed a similar pos-
itive relationship. Therefore, quality training and 
development could result in improved employee 
performance. In the same vein, Tshishonga (2021) 
acknowledged that training and development and 
support programs strengthened and enhanced 
the employees’ capacity to perform. Hence, rele -
vant training and development could transform 
local government to be responsive, accountable, ef-
ficient, and effective. Most respondents received 
training and development opportunities and 
were monitored as was the case in Gusnadi and 
Hermawan (2020). They acknowledged that pro -
viding and monitoring training and development 
played a pivotal role in identifying skill and devel -
opment gaps for training.
Furthermore, the study found that coaching and 
mentoring were associated with employee perfor -
mance. This finding agrees with Grosseck (2014) 
and Mabope (2018), who noted that coaching, 
mentoring, and regular feedback ought to be used 
as a strategy for developing and managing tal -
ent toward positive work behaviors. Voom et al. 
(2020) describe the difficulty of measuring and 
monitoring performance in the public sector com-
pared to the private sector since public goals are 
complex to quantify compared to private sector 
goals. Additionally, Hussein (2019) reported that 
effective mentoring and coaching would increase 
workers’ job performance and develop specific 
knowledge and skills. Moreover, coaching and 
mentoring played a critical role in maintaining an 
effective and efficient quality of service delivery 
(Tabassi et al., 2011).
Finally, the study found a positive relationship 
between training and development and service 
delivery. Training and development programs 
enhance employee capabilities, skills, and perfor -
mance, as supported by Mehlape (2017). Similarly, 
Hee et al. (2019) agree with Fuente and Bartram 
(2018) that formal and informal employee training 
activities and programs will ultimately give rise to 
improved service delivery. The prevalence of cor -
ruption, financial mismanagement, and the inad -
equate provision of essential services by the se -
lected municipality was supported by Mpofu and

Hlatywayo (2015), necessitating a need for relevant 
employee training and development initiatives. In 
the same vein, Ngumbela et al. (2019) noted that 
corruption, lack of accountability and transparen -
cy, and maladministration were endemic in local 
municipalities in the developing world and have 
negatively affected the efficient and effective pro -
vision of essential services. 
CONCLUSION
The study examined whether training and development initiatives could improve employee performance and 
service delivery. Since limited studies have been conducted in South African municipalities, the study con-
tributed to theory and practice on training and development, employee performance, and service delivery. 
The paper found a significant relationship between training and development and employee performance. In 
addition, the study found a relationship between coaching and mentoring as well as employee performance. 
The findings further revealed a positive association between training and development and service delivery. 
Therefore, it is recommended that the human resource department continuously revise and update its em-
ployee policy to ensure that training and development investments equip employees with the required skills 
and competencies. It is also recommended that the human resource department continuously conduct an 
analysis of training needs to identify the required training for employees. In addition, it is recommended 
that the human resource department provides coaching and mentoring for employees to transfer knowledge, 
skills, and abilities. 
The human resource department should implement a well-structured performance management system to 
help in the identification of gaps for training and development and enhance employee performance and 
service delivery. Since the study was conducted at a selected municipality in the Eastern Cape Province of 
South Africa, an additional limitation is adopting a quantitative methodology that investigated causal rela-
tionships. Since this study could not provide a qualitative approach, future studies may adopt a qualitative 
or mixed-method research design to compare the influence of training and development on service delivery.
