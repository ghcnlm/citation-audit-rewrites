development with participants from three
African countries

Abstract
Background: Health systems in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted capacity challenges to fulfil their mandates of
service provision and governance of their resources. Four academic institutions in Africa implemented a World
Health Organisation-funded collaborative project encompassing training, curriculum development, and partnership
to strengthen national leadership and training capacity for health workforce development. This paper looks into the
training component of the project, a blended Masters programme in public health that sought to improve the
capacity of personnel involved in teaching or management/development of human resources for health. The paper
aims to explore factors influencing contribution of training to organisational capacity development.
Methods: We chose a case study design. Semi-structured interviews were held with 18 trainees that were enrolled
in the training programme, and who were affiliated to health ministries or public health training institutions. We
gathered additional data through document reviews, observation, and interviews with 14 key informants associated
with the programme and/or working in the collaborating institutions. The evidence gathered were analysed thematically.
Results:Thirteen of the 18 training participant s stayed in the target institutions an d contributed to improved capacity of
their institutions in the fields of management, policy, planning, research, training, or curriculum development. Five left for
private and international agencies due to dissatisfaction with payment, wo r kc o n d i t i o n s ,o rc a r e e rp r o s p e c t .
Factors that were associated with the training, trainees, and th e institutional and broader context, determine contribution
of training to organisational capacity development. These include relevance of newly acquired knowledge and skills set of
trainees to the role/position they assume in the organisation; recognition of trainees by employing organisations in terms
of promotion or assignment of challenging tasks ; and motivation and retention of trained staff.
Conclusion:Training, even if relevant and applicable, makes no more than a ‘latent’ contribution, one which is activated
and realised through alignment of clusters of interacting contex tual and relational factors related to the target institutions
and trained personnel. While not predictable, implementers need to focus more deliberately on the likely interaction and
best possible alignments between training relevance, student selection for potential to cont ribute, recognition and career
advancement potential.

Background
Health systems in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted
capacity challenges to fulfil their mandates of service
provision and governance of th eir resources. Wide-ranging
capacity development interventions exist to address these
limitations. Many countries in A frica experience acute staff
shortages and poor performance of the health workforce.
This is related to inadequate attention given to workforce
development from institutions, which either train or em-
ploy human resource managers [ 1]. The lack of leadership
and management across different levels of the health sector
is often manifested in the practice of appointing clinical
staff to human resource management (HRM) roles [ 2– 4]
without the required training to execute HRM functions
across policy, leadership, education, partnership and finance
spectrums [5, 6].
A number of human resource management interventions
in low-and middle-income countries have focused on train-
ing as a principal strategy for improving health workers ’
performance and boosting capacity, mostly among frontline
providers [7, 8]. Similar trends also pre vail in other capacity
development initiatives in the health sector. A study map-
ping a wide range of interventions to improve national and
institutional capacity in health research in Africa found that
‘many efforts are geared towards individual capacity build-
ing, with indirect benefit to institutions’[8].
Scholars have noted and criticised the disproportionate
focus on building individual level capacity as a primary
strategy to the neglect of other systems level issues [ 9– 12].
The criticisms highlight the l inks between individual and
organisational level capacity development, which are often
taken for granted [ 13]. A World Bank evaluation (2008)
that explored whether training results in organisational cap-
acity development identified the elements that need to be
in place for training to effect the desired transformations:
quality training, and an enabling work environment [ 14].
Other authors point out the importance of the attributes of
trainees and of having an a ppropriate curriculum [15, 16].
All these dimensions are captured in the WHO ’sl e a d e r s h i p
and development framework (Fig. 1) which emphasises the
dynamic interaction between nu mbers, competencies, sup-
port systems and working environments [17].
The capacity development literature, too, emphasises
the need for a systems perspective that looks into inter-
actions between the different capacity levels (individual,
organisational, or environmental), and investigates the
issues that nurture or undermine capacity development
at each level [ 9, 18– 24]. As Hongoro and Normand
point out: ‘Organizational and system arrangements de-
fine the incentive context for health workers and influ-
ence both organizational and individual performance ’
[25]. Similar calls for a systems approach have also
been made in the context of interventions and research
to develop public health and research capacity [ 7, 8,
25– 29]. According to Bennet, “Human resource man-
agement systems affect workers ’ capability and their
perception of that capability, through such mechanisms
as training, supervision, and more concrete incentives
such as remuneration, promotion, and performance re-
view processes ” [29].

With respect to engagement post training, literature fur-
ther establishes the importance of recognising and support-
ing individuals that are tasked with the responsibility of
spearheading change, and ident ifies seniority as one of the
attributes these individuals need to possess [ 30– 32], hence
imperative to put great care in the selection of these
individuals.
With a focus on the use of training on health work-
force development as a strategy to leverage organisa-
tional capacity development, both in health ministries
and public health training universities, this paper ex-
plored the factors that influence contribution of training
to organisational capacity development.
The paper is part of a broader research project that fo-
cuses on examining a collaboration among four academic
institutions in Africa (year 2009– 2015), to strengthen leader-
ship and training capacity for health workforce development
at both national and regional lev els. The collaboration arose
in response to a call by – and financial support from – the
World Health Organisation [ 33]. The collaboration has
three dimensions: building a r egional network,c u r r i c u l u m /
programme development in partner institutions, and train-
ing of critical mass of experts in the field of health workforce
development. The paper looks at one component of the col-
laboration, a blended Masters in Public Health programme
with a focus on Health Workforce Development. The
programme was offered in the University of the Western
C a p e ,S o u t hA f r i c a ,t h r o u g hablended approach, a combin-
ation of distance learning and short face-to-face contact.
The programme consists of six HRM-focused and public
health modules, and a thesis on an issue focused on human
resources for health (HRH) in their country.
Methods
We adopted a qualitative case study research design due to
its suitability for investigating ‘why’ and ‘how’ questions
[34– 36]. Training participants enrolled in the training
programme and affiliated to target institutions across the
three countries are the focus of the paper. Eighteen partici-
pants (6 each from Mozambique, Rwanda, and Ethiopia)
underwent the training after being nominated to take part
in the programme by their home institutions: health minis-
tries or universities. Sixteen trainees were located, and as-
sumed leadership or trainer roles where human resource
management was one of the central foci. This proximity to
HRM-focused roles/functions had been a criterion for their
nomination to the training programme. Additional criteria
used in the selection of trainee s include academic qualifica-
tions, and local considerations of service duration and rep-
resentation of sub-national groups [33].
Semi-structured in-depth interviews [ 37– 39] were held
with all the 18 training participants. We gathered additional
data through review of documen ts (project proposals, pro-
ject agreements, progress reports and correspondence) and
observation. Additional interviews were conducted with 14
key informants that were selected purposively on the basis
of their proximity to the training programme or participants
[38, 40, 41]. They include trainers, mentors, coordinators af-
filiated with public health training institutions-U n i v e r s i t yo f
Rwanda, Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia and Mozambi-
que’s Eduardo Mondlane Universi ty; and representatives of
project implementation partners- University of the Western
Cape, South Africa, and the World Health Organisation.
The interviews were held between June 2014 and March
2015. All the trainees had completed the programme dur-
ing the time of the interview, and all but three had gradu-
ated. The interviews were audio recorded with the
permission of participants.
Information about prior training and professional
background of participants and demographic details
were also gathered. The interviews explored perceptions
and experiences of actors over a range of matters related
to the training programme, their work settings and re-
sponsibilities, and factors that enabled or constrained
learning or application of acquired competencies in the
programme. Probing was an important strategy used to
establish adequate understanding [ 37, 39].
Good rapport with participants was established over
the course of the training programme. This was evident
in the way participants were willing to be part of the re-
search and the openness they exhibited during the inter-
views. Field notes [ 38] were prepared while on the field.
The collected data were analysed thematically [ 42, 43].
All interviews were transcribed word for word. The tran-
scription was open coded manually with a focus on de-
scribing the diversity in the data. The codes were then
grouped into more analytical categories. Themes were
generated both inductively from the data and deduct-
ively from the research question and the literature on
capacity development and the systems and complexity
approach [ 38]. Causal loop diagram was used to visualise
and communicate complex system interactions [ 44– 46]
taking into consideration feedback mechanisms, both
enablers and constraints.
Rigour and trustworthiness of the research was ensured
through triangulation by seeking convergence of data from
multiple data sources and methods [ 38, 39, 43, 47, 48].
Strategies used to improve rigour and trustworthiness in-
clude engagement with participants and context prior to
data collection; voluntary participation of respondents;
counter checking r esponses; and soliciting peer feedback
[38, 48– 50].
Reflexivity was an important tool in this research.

monitoring or documentation of the programme.
Hence, we acknowledge drawing on and incorporating
our experiences.

Results
Profile of training participants
Thirteen of the training participants were male and five
were female. The median age of participants was 37, and
their ages range between 25 and 56 years. With respect
to institutional affiliations, 13 were based in health min-
istries, and five were located in public health training in-
stitutions. Looking at the educational background of the
participants, half had clinical background and the other
half had social science background (Psychology, Educa-
tion, Sociology, and Administration). At the time of the
study, of the 18 training participants, five left their home
institutions to private or international agencies due to
dissatisfaction about remuneration, work condition and
career prospect. Detail information on career progres-
sion and capacity application experiences of training
participants are presented in Table 1.
Most graduates reported that they were able to apply
their learning in the fields of management, research,
training/teaching, policy development, and training ma-
terial development. There was, however, diversity in the
graduates’ ability, capacity and opportunity to apply
newly developed skills and expertise. Clusters of factors
across multiple levels emerged in the narratives of par-
ticipants as influencing the contribution of training to
organisational capacity development: relevance of newly
acquired knowledge and skills set to role/position, and
employer recognition in terms of being promoted to se-
nior posts or being assigned challenging tasks; and mo-
tivation and retention of trained staff.
The sections to follow highlight patterns in the data
under three interrelated themes of alignment of core
competencies and role/position, employer recognition,
and retention and turnover.
Alignment of core competencies and role/position
Fifteen trainees were located in departments at the health
ministries or university where human resource manage-
ment was one of the central foci. Three participants were
enrolled in the programme with the understanding that
they would transition to a more relevant position during
or after the training. They were contract staff working in
research projects affiliated with target departments in the
universities. Two of them were later integrated into the
departments as permanent academic staff with opportun-
ities to teach HR-related courses. However, the other par-
ticipant because of changes in leadership of the
institution, he did not have the same support to enable
the transition to a more appropriate position. For the ma-
jority of the participants, therefore, their role closely
matched their acquired competencies and because they
were located in institutions mandated to govern or train
health professionals, they could make direct links between
competencies and workplace demands.
One of the trainees, P3, took on a series of progres-
sively senior posts in a health ministry, aligned to the
competencies acquired in the programme, and this is
what he has to say about his experience of applying the
competencies.
[During training] I was working on HR [at the HR
department in the health ministry] so whatever we
learned … we would practice it. … [We] changed the
administration and with the belief that the HR
programme is important not just for the Ministry [at
national level] but also for every region [sub-national
level], we started developing a curriculum and started
… the programme [a postgraduate programme in
HRM in two local universities]. [P3]
Another trainee, P35, a lecturer at the university, has in-
tegrated his learning from the programme into his
teaching and consultancy
I use all of them [training module materials] because
[they] are related to the [subjects] I teach … . The
[health workforce development module] … has very
good examples of things that we can use simply in our
context … . [Explaining further what enabled
application of learning] I think it is especially because
I am in an environment that I not only have to teach
but I have to research, I end up using all the modules.
I am also part of the [national] human resources
observatory. Surely, I have been invited to be part of
this because I am studying human resources
development. [P35]
Employer recognition
In addition to the relevance of the roles, recognition by
the employer in the form of promotion or allocation of
challenging assignments were found to enable capacity
application.
Seniority was found to aff ord participants the op-
p o r t u n i t yt ot a k eo nm o r ec h a l l e n g i n gr e s p o n s i b i l -
ities, and space to implement their learning. A few
of the participants held senior HR-related posts prior
to being enrolled in the programme. One of these
trainees, P14, was the head of HR in the health
department at sub-national level. Informed by his
learning and enabled by his senior position and asso-
ciated network, he accomplished significant changes
by decentralising HR departments, creating posts for
HR managers at district level, ensuring qualified
managers are recruited, and existing staff undergo
training in newly initiat ed HR programmes in a local
university.

[The] experience [from the programme] has increased
my capacity a great deal. The project [restructuring]
coincided with [my participation in] the HRD MPH. I
have used my knowledge [from the programme] to
make the most of this [restructuring] project. … You
need vision to do anything. … While studying in the
programme, I was able to realise all the gaps and
weaknesses in the way we are doing things. HRH
[department] is full of people who are transferred
because of disciplinary reasons [and] who don ’t
understand the work. It was [considered as] a way of
punishment. Until recently HR was not a place for
professionals. … [The restructuring] is one of the
success stories of HRH programme in [the country].
[P14]
The narratives show that the majority of participants ad-
vanced to progressively more senior positions upon join-
ing the programme, either during the course of the
programme or after its completion. This ranged from
being officers (human resource/medical/research) to be-
coming senior leaders at sub-national or national levels
in health ministries (cases in point are P3, P8, P15, P58,
P59, P56, P37).
Training participants ’ promotions to senior posts
were reported to be recognition of their qualifications,
core competencies, or improved contribution to their
departments. One of the trainees, P58, was working
as a health officer when she joined the programme.
Her response shows that she was promoted to senior
leadership position due to her improved contribution
to the institution, which in turn opened further op-
portunities to contribute.
The division within which I was … it was somehow
new. … I was the first person to get an opportunity to
study. … [The training] programme equipped me with
knowledge on how I can train health workers, [how] I
can support them … . [Preparing] the strategic plan …
I had to plan activities related to training, supervision,
mentorship … all that. … [The modules] related to
HRH development, planning and so on contributed to
making me confident in my position [as a Director]. …
I was like a pillar in my division. Because others were
not [skilled enough] … I contributed a lot. I think that
is why I was appointed as a Director. [P58]
P56 was a medical officer in a rural district hospital
when he joined the programme. He then became dir-
ector of the district hospital, and later he was promoted
to a senior post at the health ministry. His response illu-
minates the mutually reinforcing relationship between
recognition and application of competencies.
[W] hen I took [the directorship] position at the rural
hospital … my predecessor was not very present … .I
started establishing some mechanism of meeting people
[regularly] … and involving them to propose solution
… . I saw some changes in the way they manage. … I
do have materials [from the training programme] on
my computer and some books. … It helped me a lot …
. I am doing [preparing] some procedure manual
[focusing on integrating supportive supervision for the
ministry] … I am leading development of [HR] policy
for the whole [health] sector … I have been … engaging
in leading the process of determining the staffing in
health … . [and] leading the process of the HR

sustainability … [and] the national health sector
research agenda. [P56]
While such timeous recognition and creation of oppor-
tunities generated motivation, delayed employer recogni-
tion or lack of communication to this end reportedly led
to frustration and lack of motivation in other cases. One
of the trainees, P15, was an HR officer in a health de-
partment at sub-national level, and he was left frustrated
by the absence of mobility to a more senior post or bet-
ter financial package upon graduation. He expressed his
annoyance:
… . That [lack of recognition or promotion] is
disappointing. … . You can build their [staff] capacity,
but after building capacity [if] you don ’t give them
anything ... that is ... inexplicable. [P15]
It took a while before this trainee got promoted to a
position of head of HR in the provincial health depart-
ment. Protracted administrative processes and poor
communication led to turnover in the case of another
participant, P57.
Retention and turnover
Thirteen of the participants stayed in their respective in-
stitution after graduation. However, five graduates across
the countries left their institution to join international
agencies, the private sector, or change career paths. An
examination of the motives of participants reveals that a
diverse set of intrinsic and extrinsic push and pull fac-
tors contributed to their decision to stay or leave: finan-
cial incentive, employer recognition (promotion or
assignment of challenging responsibilities), career pro-
spect, job security, family circumstances, external job
holding opportunities, and change in career path.
Four of the five participants (P8, P14, P39, and P57)
who left their home institution had a clinical back-
ground. Two of them pursued clinical practice/study;
the other two occupied management positions in inter-
national agencies.
The narratives of two of the training participants, P35
and P36, one based in university and another in a health
ministry, illustrate the diversity of experiences and deci-
sions regarding retention. The university-based trainee,
P35, who was a junior lecturer, took on HR-focused
teaching and consultancy responsibilities related to his
core competency in HRH after enrolment in the training
programme. He expressed disappointment at his inad-
equate salary, but he stated his resolve to stay in the
institution.
I have to do consultancy to have [more] money … to
take care of the family. It [consultancy] ends up [being
a] big burden because I have to work, work, work. … I
am still not thinking of leaving this public sector even
though I am not satisfied with the salary because I still
want to improve my academic career. [P35]
The trainee based in a health ministry, P36, was working
as a junior manager in a public hospital when he joined
the programme. He soon left the health ministry to join
an international agency and, later, a private company.
He cited dissatisfaction with his salary and career pros-
pects as the main reasons for leaving.
I [left] to work for [an international agency] as a
national HR manager [overseeing] administration and
HR issues of 500 employees. After a year, I left the
[international agency] to join a private company [as a
head of the HR department] because I like to grow and
get better opportunity to practice HR. I moved from
ministry of health [to international agency] because of
money. The pay [at MOH] was very, very low. My net
pay at the NGO was double what I earned at ministry
of health. When I moved [to the private company], it
was almost double what I earned at the [international
agency]. [P36]
The present analysis shows that while role relevance and
seniority were enablers of capacity application, a closer
look at the differences between the groups who left and
those who stayed reveals no clear pattern based on role/
position, or recognition (be it seniority or assignment of
interesting tasks). There were also no country-specific
patterns.
Discussion
The programme discussed in this paper set out to
strengthen leadership and training capacity for health work-
force development in a regional ( African) initiative, working
with a small group of locally chosen students who, it was
hoped and assumed, would act as capacity catalysts in their
organisations. The findings show how different factors re-
lated to training (relevance a nd appropriateness), trainees
(role, seniority, motivation) and organisation (employer rec-
ognition, incentive arrangements), and broader context
(marketability, and other pull factors) interacted in different
ways to generate very diverse outcomes of training to or-
ganisational capacity development.
The literature also emphasises the dynamic and con-
text dependent nature of capacity development and that
it operates not just at individual level but also within the
organisations in which individuals operate and the
broader environment in which the organisations are lo-
cated [ 9, 18– 24]. Baser and Morgan (2008) speak about
capacity emerging out of ‘a complex interplay of atti-
tudes, assets, resources, strategies and skills, both
Amde et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1557 Page 7 of 12
<<<PAGE=8>>>
tangible and intangible (9). Similar views about complex-
ity of capacity development interventions are echoed in
the literature in the context of human resources for
health (HRH) [ 7, 25, 27, 28].
All participants spoke about the relevance of learning
and the appropriateness of the curriculum and 17 partic-
ipants found ways to apply the knowledge and skills ac-
quired in their home institutions. While eight
participants pursued new opportunities within their
ministries, within and beyond HR directorates, three
participants based in academic institutions began to in-
corporate teaching about HRH into the curriculum. For
five participants, however, the programme became a
catalyst to pursue their careers elsewhere, two in the pri-
vate sector, two others in similar fields within inter-
national agencies. Four of the five who left their home
institutions had a prior clinical background. The findings
suggest greater turnover propensity and labour market
demand for graduates with a prior clinical background.
Financial incentives and opportunities presented in pri-
vate and international agencies played an important role
in their decision.
The diversity of capacity application experiences among
participants ranges from ones where contribution is opti-
mal to those where contribution remains latent or min-
imal. It was evident that the translation of learning into
organisational contributions was enabled by the alignment
between the core competencies of the training and the
profile of recruited candidates who either had HR-related
responsibilities (training or leadership) or were expected
to move into such positions post training. Target institu-
tions (health ministries and local universities) involvement
in student selection undoubtedly assisted the alignment of
potential to apply new competencies with existing or fu-
ture roles and functions. The body of literature on training
initiatives in general – and leadership development in par-
ticular – underscores the importance of ensuring that
trainees have the opportunity to utilise newly developed
skills and expertise in their local contexts [ 21, 51, 52], and
that this be already taken into account when selecting can-
didates for training [ 21, 53].
Beyond competency, the findings suggest that capacity
application is influenced by seniority, recognition and
support from an employing institution, or application
and motivation of participants. The relational aspect of
capacity application is further highlighted in the litera-
ture as one of the factors facilitating the success of
change agents in integrating innovations in their context
[32], which most of these graduates demonstrate as they
took on the responsibility of spearheading changes in
HRH practice in their context. The more senior they
were, the more support/resources they had at their dis-
posal and the better positioned they were to consolidate
the changes. The above findings also reinforce the
significant influence the employing organisation has in
determining application by either availing opportunities
or support to embed learning in practice.
Motivation (through either intrinsic or extrinsic incen-
tives) seems to influence the likelihood of trainees iden-
tifying and capitalising on opportunities to apply
learning in their home institutions. As depicted in the
experiences of five of the cases, participants may choose
to leave the home institution for private or international
agencies to advance their career or for better remuner-
ation. In contrast, most participants stayed in the institu-
tion, mainly because of job satisfaction or opportunities
to advance their career, despite being unhappy with their
salary. In the case of academic institutions, the holding
of multiple jobs ameliorated the tension around salaries.
Retention represents one of the issues that accounts for
the complexity of the link between individual capacity de-
velopment through training and the improved capacity of
organisations in terms of improved performance. A system-
atic review of the motivation and retention of health
workers in developing countries [ 54] emphasised the im-
portance of recognition in health worker motivation, and
identified a set of influential factors, namely, ‘financial in-
centives, career development and management issues ’[54].
The study showed that trainees exercise their agency to re-
solve dissonance or reinforce alignment between their best
interests and that of the institution. This was evident in this
study through the decisions of trainees. Individuals in com-
parable situations/positions/background, end up making
varying decisions as to whether they stay or leave, due to
the multiple intersecting factors. In three cases participants
had the opportunity to augment their income through their
engagement in external multiple job holding practices, thus
keeping them in their posts but creating other conse-
quences impacting on organisational capacity [25, 55, 56].
The narratives further show that while participation in
the training was reported to improve staff contribution
in most instances, the study suggests that training also
has the unintended consequence of increasing turnover
due to the marketability of newly acquired competencies
and leads to capacity loss, as identified in several studies
[55, 57, 58]. An exploratory study in four eastern African
countries focusing on competency gaps in health work-
force management found, for example, that the health
ministries of these countries fared poorly compared to
the private and non-profit sectors in putting retention
strategies in place [ 59]. These studies have resonance
with our findings that the target institutions, which hap-
pen to be part of the public sector, stand to lose their
trained professionals as they continue to fare unfavour-
ably with private and international agencies.
Another influential individual level factor was senior-
ity, relevant both as an incentive for retention and ad-
vantage for the application of learning. It was evident in
Amde et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1557 Page 8 of 12
<<<PAGE=9>>>
the accounts of some of the cases that participants in se-
nior positions had better opportunities to take on chal-
lenging assignments, with much wider implications, such
as the development of HR units, the structuring of HR
departments, the training and staffing of these depart-
ments, and representing their institutions in specialised
networks and partnerships. It is safe to suggest that their
seniority gave them the edge (power, decision space, or
opportunity) to apply their learning on a national or re-
gional level, or the incentive to remain in the institution
despite their relatively low salary. In contrast, three
training participants who retained relatively junior posi-
tions reported that they were frustrated with the lack of
recognition/promotion or opportunity.
Albert Hirschman ’s Exit, Voice and Loyalty Frame-
work [ 60, 61] helps shed light in understanding trained
staff’s decisions, as it recognises the heterogeneous ways
individuals respond to unfavourable circumstances in an
organisation: exit (leave the organisation), voice (express
their dissatisfaction and seek change), or remain loyal
(quietly put up with the situation). According to this
perspective, “exit and voice are the two main responses
to dissatisfaction, with voice being more effective and
desirable. … a lack of exit opportunities increases voice,
and loyalty reduces exit ” [60]. In the context of this
study, all trainees were based in public institutions,
which are generally characterised by low wages and poor
working conditions. Our analysis shows that while five
chose to leave the institutions (exit), 13 remained (voice/
loyal). Our study suggests that, in addition to wages and
working conditions, factors related to employer recogni-
tion of trained staff (promotion/opportunities) and car-
eer prospect inform the choice of trained staff to exit or
not. While the situation of those who exit the group is
relatively clear, with the limited data we have it is
difficult to differentiate between the voice and loyal re-
sponses. Hence, a full application of Hirschman ’s frame-
work with additional data may generate more nuanced
insight about responses of trained staff.
Figure 2 illustrates the influence that the above dis-
cussed contextual and relational factors across multiple
levels have on the contribution of training to organisa-
tional capacity development – a conclusion, which is
supported by the literature [ 7, 27, 28]. Capacity gaps in
HRM lead to training interventions, which equip partici-
pants with relevant skills and knowledge. Application of
acquired competencies or the resulting improvement in
quality and performance leads to gradual reduction of
the organisational capacity gap in HRM. This balancing
loop is subject to influence by other intersecting factors
that particularly influence application of competencies
by training participants. Specifically, application/contri-
bution is a function of trainees ’ motivation and oppor-
tunities to apply learning. The more motivated they are,
or the more opportunities at their disposal, the more
likely they can contribute. Figure 2 also highlights the
various factors related to the employing organisation
(recognition via promotion/assignment of relevant tasks,
institutional incentive arrangements) influencing motiv-
ation and opportunities. Contextual factors (such as
labour market or public sector policies) influence the
aforementioned organisational level determinants. Each
training participant experience unique intersections of
these factors and depending on perception of their cir-
cumstances, training participants decide to stay and con-
tribute to varying degrees, or leave the institution
altogether. In the event of turnover of trained personnel,
the HRM capacity shortages in the organisation persist.
Recall and social desirability bias are possible limita-
tions of the study. We strove to address such bias

through long-term engagement, building trust and confi-
dence to enable opportunities for open reflection and
learning [ 50]. Another limitation of the study pertains to
the fact that dealing with issues related to impact and
sustainability, which are key but long-term aspects of
capacity development, was not feasible within the limited
period of this research. Hence, the research was limited
to investigating processes, and short and medium-term
outcomes of capacity development.
The findings of the study are not generalizable to par-
ticipants of other training programmes due to the quali-
tative research design and the use of purposive sampling
and small sample size. A future comparative research
examining similar in-service trainings and their relative
contribution can help advance understanding and in-
form policy and practice.
Conclusion
The present case study highlights the complex contextual
and relational factors that affect the contribution of train-
ing to organisational development. The results show di-
versity in graduates ’ ability, capacity and opportunity to
apply newly developed skills and expertise. The paper ar-
gues that training, even if relevant and applicable, makes a
‘latent’ contribution which is activated and realised (or
not) through the interaction of multilevel and interacting
contextual and relational factors. The study clearly shows
how a divergence in individual and organisational goals
and expectations (related to financial incentives, work
conditions or career path) leads to internal or external mi-
gration of trained personnel, which drains an institution
of its capacity. Dissatisfaction with payment coupled with
lack of opportunity to advance career and marketability of
new qualification have led to turnover of trained
personnel. The study further implies that implementers
need to focus more deliberately on the likely interaction
and best possible alignments between training relevance,
student selection for potential to contribute, recognition
and career advancement potential.
