Abstract
Background: Ensuring health policies are informed by evidence still remains a challenge despite efforts devoted to
this aim. Several tools and approaches aimed at fostering evidence-informed policy-making (EIPM) have been
developed, yet there is a lack of availability of indicators specifically devoted to assess and support EIPM. The
present study aims to overcome this by building a set of measurable indicators for EIPM intended to infer if and to
what extent health-related policies are, or are expected to be, evidence-informed for the purposes of policy
planning as well as formative and summative evaluations.
Methods: The indicators for EIPM were developed and validated at international level by means of a two-round
internet-based Delphi study conducted within the European project ‘REsearch into POlicy to enhance Physical Activity ’
(REPOPA). A total of 82 researchers and policy-makers from the six European countries (Denmark, Finland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Romania, the United Kingdom) involved in the project and international organisations were asked to
evaluate the relevance and feasibility of an initial set of 23 indicators developed by REPOPA researchers on the basis of
literature and knowledge gathered from the previous phases of the project, and to propose new indicators.
Results: The first Delphi round led to the validation of 14 initial indicators and to the development of 8 additional
indicators based on panellists ’ suggestions; the second round led to the validation of a further 11 indicators, including
6 proposed by panellists, and to the rejection of 6 indicators. A total of 25 indicators were validated, covering EIPM
issues related to human resources, documentation, participation and monitoring, and stressing different levels of
knowledge exchange and involvement of researchers and other stakeholders in policy development and evaluation.
Conclusion: The study overcame the lack of availability of indicators to assess if and to what extent policies are
realised in an evidence-informed manner thanks to the active contribution of researchers and policy-makers. These
indicators are intended to become a shared resource usable by policy-makers, researchers and other stakeholders, with
a crucial impact on fostering the development of policies informed by evidence.

Background
Despite nearly two decades of efforts to improve
evidence-informed policy-making (EIPM) in public
health, many gaps remain. These gaps have been attrib-
uted to organisational and strategic factors influencing
decisional processes, competing demands for resources,
and public pressure and lobbying [ 1– 4]. Challenging dis-
connects between research and policy-making processes,
such as incompatible timeframes and competing values
and interests [ 5– 10], have also been described. While a
number of tools and approaches have been developed to
facilitate EIPM in public health [ 11– 21], we registered a
lack of availability of specific indicators for EIPM. The
present study aimed to overcome this challenge by
building a set of measurable indicators for EIPM in the
field of public health. These indicators are intended to
infer if and to what extent health-related policies are, or
are expected to be, evidence-informed for the purposes
of policy planning as well as formative and summative
evaluations.
Several previous studies prepared the ground for building
these indicators by critically reflecting on facilitators and
barriers to EIPM [ 22]; giving value to the ‘knowledge trans-
action model’approach over the ‘knowledge transfer’ model
while building sustainability indicators [23]; identifying indi-
cators to assess the performance of partnerships between
researchers and policy-makers [24]; and developing indica-
tors prioritised by the global community to provide concise
information on the health situation and trends, including
responses at national and global levels [ 25].
The innovative contribution of the current study is the
development and validation of a set of measurable indi-
cators specifically devoted to assess and support EIPM
in the field of public health, intended to be jointly used
by governmental policy-makers and researchers, but also
by other stakeholders involved in various stages of the
policy-making cycle.
The study was conducted within a 5-year European pro-
ject called REPOPA (REsearch into POlicy to enhance
Physical Activity), involving six European countries –
Denmark, Finland, Italy, Romania, the Netherlands and
the United Kingdom. The overall aim of the REPOPA pro-
ject was to improve the integration of scientific research
evidence and expert know-how in real world policy-
making processes, establishing structures and best prac-
tices for health promotion and disease prevention [ 26], es-
pecially in inter-sectoral government administrational
policies directed at physical activity promotion.
Methods
We conducted the study in two phases. First, we devel-
oped a set of candidate indicators, based on two main
inputs, namely literature findings and previous REPOPA
research results [ 26, 27]. We then used the Delphi
methodology [ 28– 32] to identify other potential indica-
tors and to validate the indicators in an international
perspective.
The Delphi approach was chosen for three main rea-
sons. First, it is participatory, engaging both scientists
and policy-makers and, because of this, allows the cap-
ture of visions and values of the community for which
the indicators are developed, as recommended in litera-
ture [ 33], instigating a joint activity and process involv-
ing both scientists and policy-makers [ 23, 34]. Second,
we sought consensus among participants as we thought
this would provide a more credible outcome for an
international and inter-sectoral audience. Consensus was
built through the rounds of the Delphi, wherein the ini-
tial group of collective responses of participants was
used as an input in the second round of the Delphi, gen-
erating results that were co-produced through the group.
Third, the Delphi is an efficient means to involve a wide
range of experts from many countries at distance, with
their ‘indirect interaction ’ being mediated by the re-
searchers conducting the study.
The main methodological process followed includes
the development of an initial set of indicators as well as
the preparation and implementation of the Delphi study
to refine and integrate the initial set. These steps are de-
scribed in detail in the following paragraphs.
Developing the initial set of REPOPA indicators for EIPM
We defined a measurable indicator as an observable trait
that is an objective measure of some other phenomenon
difficult to estimate directly. Our focus was on indicators
that could be used to assess if and to what extent a cer-
tain health policy is informed by evidence; we intended
evidence in a wide sense, including research evidence,
experiential evidence, and knowledge from stakeholders
and target groups.
The initial set of indicators for EIPM was developed
based on literature describing existing frameworks of
EIPM processes, influences on these processes and con-
structs that were pertinent to indicator selection, and on
previous REPOPA findings [ 26, 27].
As for the first input, we focused on two types of published
frameworks. The first type described knowledge production
and translation in policy-making environments. These
frameworks, which concerned science-policy relationships
and the use of science in policy-making [ 6, 35– 37], expli-
cated EIPM processes and stages, key actors and influences,
and strategies to foster research knowledge use. The second
type of framework examined EIPM processes within service
delivery organisations [38– 44], or knowledge translation pro-
cesses between academics and knowledge users. This second
set of frameworks specifically described stages of knowledge
use in policy-making [ 41, 45, 46] and organisational factors
that influenced users’ acquisition of research [ 24]. We also
Tudisca et al. Health Research Policy and Systems  (2018) 16:47 Page 2 of 13
<<<PAGE=3>>>
examined literature highlighting facilitators of EIPM [21, 22,
47– 52] to select candidate indicators of these enablers. The
European Responsible Research and Innovation framework
[53] led us to include equity and inclusiveness elements in
the indicators. Moreover, literature specifically focused on in-
dicator development and/or validation in health and other
policy sectors provided insights on the principles, criteria
and processes to be considered while developing indicators
[23– 25, 54– 58].
Our second input consisted of results from previ-
ous REPOPA research steps [ 26, 50, 58– 66]. These
findings informed the identification, selection and
framing of some indicators. In particular, results
highlighted the need for indicators that (1) were per-
tinent to a wide range of stakeholders working in
different sectors and at different levels of govern-
ment; (2) reflected how policy-makers mobilise
internal and external networks to inform decisions
about physical activity po licies; and (3) took into
account considerations about the diversity of target
groups (including vulnerable populations). The process of
building measurable indicators also involved converting
tacit knowledge 1 of the researchers of REPOPA Consor-
tium into explicit knowledge, namely an ‘externalisation’
[67] that can be considered as a further input to the initial
set of indicators for EIPM. This objective was achieved by
means of both online and face-to-face meetings. In par-
ticular, the researchers were provided with a specific tem-
plate for translating their findings into measurable
indicators. To define the template structure, we consid-
ered previously reported findings [ 57]. After the first for-
mulation, the proposed indicators were translated in
terms of measurable indicators to infer the presence and
the extent of EIPM in an objective way, applying the di-
mensions of ‘SMART’ indicators – specific, measurable,
achievable/applicable, relevant, time-bound [ 33, 55].
Following the steps described above, we developed an
initial set of 23 measurable indicators for EIPM to be
used as the starting point for the two-round internet-
based Delphi study.
Preparing the two internet-based Delphi rounds
To prepare the two internet-based Delphi rounds, the
initial set of indicators was organised in thematic do-
mains and criteria were defined both for the type and
number of panellists to be involved and the evaluation
of the indicators.
Defining thematic domains for the initial set of indicators
The 23 indicators were grouped into four thematic domains
related to specific key aspects of EIPM [14, 24, 33, 40, 68– 70].
These domains were as follows:
1. Human resources – Competences and Networking,
focused on the possible kinds/types of human
resources involved in a policy process (policy-
makers, researchers, stakeholders and generic staff)
and the skills they are required to have to
contribute to EIPM;
2. Documentation – Retrieval/Production,
concentrated on the retrieval and production of
documents including scientific evidence during a
policy process;
3. Communication and Participation, concerning both
initiatives to inform several target groups during a
policy process and engagement and consultation
methodologies to gather knowledge from them,
implying a bidirectional communication;
4. Monitoring and Evaluation, focused on the possible
actors (researchers, policy-makers and other
stakeholders) to be involved in monitoring and
evaluating the use of scientific evidence in policies
and related procedures to be adopted to achieve
this aim.
Selecting panellists
We aimed to involve an international group of panellists
from the fields of health, physical activity and across sec-
tors, with the roles of researchers, policy-makers (both
civil servants and politicians) and other relevant stake-
holders (e.g. non-governmental organisations). To en-
sure that different policy-making contexts in Europe
were represented and to reach a wide perspective in the
Delphi, we planned to have 12 panellists from each of
the six REPOPA countries (termed ‘national panels ’) and
10 additional panellists working at international level,
for a total number of 82 panellists.
While composing each national panel, we aimed to get
a balanced distribution of participants in terms of pro-
fession (researchers and policy-makers 2), sectors (mainly
public health, health policy, physical activity and sports,
also with reference to disciplines like epidemiology,
health economics, political science and social science)
levels of policy-making (local, regional and/or national
administrative levels), and gender.
We also aimed to include, in each national panel,
at least one researcher with experience in science
policy and at least one politician among the policy-
makers.
Each country team of REPOPA researchers identified
and informally contacted more than the scheduled 12
experts, starting from those satisfying the required cri-
teria. We used a snowball sampling approach, asking
these experts to suggest the names of other experts suit-
able for the research. A full list of potential participants
was then generated for each country. Subsequently, each
country team ranked the contacted experts according to
Tudisca et al. Health Research Policy and Systems  (2018) 16:47 Page 3 of 13
<<<PAGE=4>>>
their areas of competence and gradually built the
planned panel, reaching the final number of 12 per
country.
The panellists working in the international context
were chosen among researchers and policy-makers from
international organisations related to physical activity,
public health, health promotion and policy innovation, e.
g. WHO, the European Public Health Association, the
Joint Research Centre, the AGE Platform Europe, the
European Public Health Association.
The whole panel was thus assembled to include 82
panellists who agreed to take part in the Delphi study
(for details see Additional file 1).
Establishing evaluation criteria to rate indicators
We asked Delphi participants to assess the relevance and
feasibility of the indicators. Relevance was defined as to
the extent to which an indicator inferred the use of EIPM;
feasibility was defined as the extent to which an indicator
was applicable in EIPM assessment processes. Panellists
scored each indicator using a four-point Likert scale (4 –
very relevant, 3 - relevant, 2 – slightly relevant, 1 – not
relevant; 4 – definitely feasible, 3 – probably feasible, 2 –
slightly feasible, 1 – definitely not feasible).
The algorithm developed for ‘accepting’ and ‘rejecting’
indicators, described in Fig. 1, was based on the calcula-
tion of medians and first quartiles of both relevance and
feasibility.
To be included in the final set of indicators for EIPM,
an indicator had to gather consensus on both high rele-
vance and feasibility. Figure 1 shows the cut-off points
for consensus we set for an indicator to be accepted or
rejected on the left and right side, respectively. These
conditions were valid for both the Delphi rounds, so that
the indicators satisfying them already in the first round
were either directly accepted or rejected and not listed
in the second round. The central part of Fig. 1 shows
the intermediate cases. Indicators that fell under this
condition as a result of the first round were sent to the
second round to be reconsidered. Indicators that fell
under this condition as a result of the second round
were finally rejected.
The indicators that were accepted, in either round,
comprise the international set of REPOPA indicators for
EIPM.
Implementing the two internet-based Delphi rounds
The two Delphi questionnaires
The first- and second-round questionnaires were sent to
the panellists in January and May 2015, respectively.
Before the distribution, REPOPA researchers from each
country team translated them to their national language
from the agreed English master version; the panellists
could answer either in English or in their native lan-
guage. Moreover, the questionnaires were pilot-tested (in
national language) in each country by two colleagues ex-
ternal to REPOPA project, checking the comprehensibil-
ity of the text of the questionnaire and the indicators
(which form the bulk of the questionnaire), possible
problems in interpreting questions, time to complete the
questionnaire, possible problems with the online tool,
and further comments.
The REPOPA Italian team, coordinating the Delphi
study, defined a strategy of central and local management

<<<PAGE=5>>>
of the Delphi activities, and designed and arranged the
web platform on Limesurvey to implement the Delphi
process. The researchers of each country team managed
the administration of the questionnaires in their own
country supported by the Italian team and focused on
keeping the country panellists on board by means of e-
mail reminders or phone calls.
/C15Questionnaire 1 description
The first-round Delphi questionnaire presented the
initial set of 23 indicators, organised in the four thematic
domains previously described, and included an introduc-
tion on the aim of the indicators and a glossary for
terms such as ‘EIPM’, ‘stakeholders’ or ‘vulnerable groups ’,
to help panellists to clearly understand the content of
the indicators proposed. 3
Panellists were asked to rate the relevance and feasibil-
ity of the indicators proposed and were invited to justify
or elaborate their relevance and feasibility ratings with
comments. In this questionnaire, panellists were also
asked to suggest additional indicators to be included in
the thematic domains.
/C15Questionnaire 2 description
The second-round Delphi questionnaire listed indica-
tors along with histograms showing the frequencies for
relevance and feasibility ratings obtained in the first
round and summaries of comments (Additional file 2);
this allowed panellists to take into account the first-
round evaluations when they rescored the indicators.

first Delphi round. Additionally, for all indicators in the sec-
ond round, panellists were invited to justify or elaborate
their relevance and feasibility ratings with comments.
Results
Delphi panellists ’ involvement
A total of 82 panellists, as planned, initially agreed to
participate in the study, including 12 panellists per coun-
try (6 researchers and 6 policy-makers each from
Denmark, Finland, Italy, Romania, the Netherlands and
the United Kingdom) plus 10 international panellists, in-
cluding 4 researchers and 6 policy-makers.
A total of 76 (92.7%) panellists answered the first round
and 72 (87.8%) answered the second round, always keep-
ing a balanced distribution between researchers and
policy-makers.
Developing the final set of REPOPA indicators for EIPM
/C15Results of the first Delphi round
Following the first round and using the initial set of 23 in-
dicators proposed by the REPOPA team (Additional file 3),
14 indicators were accepted, 9 were sent to the second
round for re-consideration and no indicators were dis-
carded, according to the algorithm in Fig. 1 and based on
panellists’ ratings.
The suggestions provided by panellists led to the de-
velopment of 8 new indicators for EIPM to be rated by
the panellists in round two (Additional file 4 lists the
panellists’comments that led to new indicators).
/C15Results of the second Delphi round
The second round led to the acceptance of another 11
indicators (in addition to the 14 previously accepted in
the first round), including 5 indicators out of 9 from the
initial set (that were neither accepted nor rejected in
round 1), plus 6 new indicators out of the 8 proposed on
the basis of suggestions given by the panellists in the
first Delphi round. These 11 indicators were added to
the 14 indicators already accepted in the first round to
compose the final set of 25 REPOPA international indi-
cators for EIPM (Fig. 2 and Additional file 5).
Table 1 shows the final set of indicators for evidence-
informed policy-making (EIPM) organised in the four
thematic domains.
On the other hand, six indicators were deemed
neither relevant nor feasible to be included in the
final set of indicators, cons isting of 4 indicators from
the initial set and 2 new indicators proposed by
panellists in the first Delphi round (Additional file 6).
Most of these indicators (5 o ut of 6 indicators; indi-
cators b – f in Additional file 6) were rejected on the
basis of relevance, while only one (indicator a:
Internships/fellowships provided by research institu-
tions during the policy, Additional file 6)w a s
rejected on the basis of both relevance and
feasibility.
Table 1 and Additional file 6 show that all the indica-
tors from the initial set of 23 indicators for EIPM related
to acquiring 4, citing 5 and producing 6 evidence in terms
of documentation were included in the final set, and two
more indicators 7 attaining to the documentation the-
matic domain were proposed by panellists to specify the
role of evidence briefs and reports on policy results from
policy-making organisations at different territorial levels
as relevant sources of knowledge.
All the indicators from the initial set related to the in-
volvement of researchers in EIPM – from one-way and
bidirectional exchange of knowledge with policy-
makers8 to a more active role in the development of the
policy and in the policy evaluation 9 – were included in
the final set. Moreover, the need for active involvement
of policy-competent researchers was stressed by

panellists with the proposal of a new indicator (Table 1,
indicator 5: researchers with policy-making experience
involved in the policy); this is complementary to the in-
dicator related to the involvement of ‘staff with research
experience’. On the other hand, indicator a ‘Internships/
fellowships provided by research institutions during the
policy’ (Additional file 6) was not considered relevant
and feasible enough to be accepted. From panellists ’
comments, it can be argued that the reason for discard-
ing this indicator – which would be in line with WHO
Regional Office for Europe ’s recommendations [ 71] –
might be their limited time duration, which does not
meet the need of continuity in the relationship between
researchers and policy-makers to foster EIPM.
The indicators implying a bidirectional knowledge ex-
change with stakeholders 10 and their contribution to the
policy (Table 1, indicator 2. Stakeholders working on the
policy) were included in the final set and panellists fur-
ther stressed the importance of communication with
stakeholders by proposing three new indicators related
to consulting target groups to get their perspective, to
acquiring communication competences to interact with
stakeholders and to fostering knowledge sharing also
among different groups of stakeholders 11. On the other
hand, indicator e ‘Stakeholders working on the policy
evaluation’ (Additional file 6) was not accepted by panel-
lists, differently from the equivalent indicator referring
to researchers (Indicator 25. Researchers working on the
policy evaluation). In this case, what can be argued look-
ing at panellists ’ comments is that the prudence in at-
tributing to stakeholders an evaluation role in policy can
be linked to the risk of conflict of interests, together
with the problem of establishing criteria to select the
stakeholders to be involved.
The other remaining indicators discarded from the
final set 12 in Additional file 6 concern aspects that can
be considered ‘procedural’ rather than ‘substantial’; most
of them were related to budget issues. Based on panel-
lists’ comments, it seems that some indicators were
deemed not feasible due to the lack of dedicated budgets
for EIPM.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to develop a set of measurable
indicators to infer the presence and the extent of EIPM
in public health policies in order to fill a recognised gap.
The study led to the development of 25 validated indica-
tors for EIPM. Several features of these indicators are
noteworthy. The international REPOPA indicators have
been co-produced and validated by a panel working at
international level, bringing together a large number of
key experts geographically dispersed in six European
countries, including also international organisations – a
particularly relevant aspect if we consider that initiatives
related to EIPM in the European Region are usually scat-
tered and often stand-alone [ 71]. Moreover, the indica-
tors were considered feasible and relevant for those
working in an array of government sectors.
Using the indicators to foster EIPM
The validated indicators for EIPM are intended to be
used by decision-makers, researchers and other stake-
holders at various stages of a policy-making process.
Measurable indicators, by giving objective data, could
help inform the design, implementation, and monitoring
and evaluation of interventions to foster EIPM.
The indicators are particularly useful for evaluating
public health and physical activity policies, either by the

organisation responsible for the policy or by other stake-
holders such as external evaluators or research institutes.
They can support EIPM already during the agenda-
setting phase, helping to identify crucial elements to
infer the presence and the extent of EIPM to be consid-
ered. During the development of a policy, the indicators
can be used to monitor enablers of or barriers to EIPM
in the policy process, giving the measure of their occur-
rence, making it possible not only to assess whether, and
to what degree, a policy is or is not being informed by
evidence, but also to discover why and how, possibly
allowing adjustments. The indicators can also be used to
evaluate the extent of EIPM of an already implemented
policy by the organisation responsible for the policy or
other administrative or research bodies. Moreover, policy
evaluations using the indicators can also provide valu-
able insights for future policy processes, also helping to
infer if the policy has created new evidence.
Besides evaluation purposes, the indicators can form
the basis for EIPM recommendations, implying actions
that, if accomplished, would foster EIPM. The indicators
may also be the basis for an intervention and for active,
critical reflection on how and why EIPM might be ad-
dressed, as already shown in literature for other vali-
dated knowledge translation tools [ 14]. Therefore, the
use of international REPOPA indicators for EIPM may
support EIPM processes, ensuring not only that the pol-
icy is informed by evidence, but also that evidence is

used instrumentally to support the selection of activities
to be implemented [ 36, 65, 72, 73], and not selectively to
justify an already made decision [ 1, 74].
The availability and use of the indicators proposed in
this study may contribute to an organisational culture
where extended value is given to the use of evidence for
decisions. Others have shown that awareness of an indi-
cator may lead policy-makers to perceive that a problem
exists, to change the way they view the problem or to
potentially focus the options they see as suitable solu-
tions [ 75]. In this way, the indicators could also impact
on stakeholders ’ frameworks of thinking [ 56], and gener-
ate new norms for EIPM within governmentally broad
social norms [ 54].
Furthermore, international REPOPA indicators are a
valuable resource for EIPM beyond physical activity and
the health field as they attain to transversal approaches
to policy-making, enhancing their use for EIPM in other
sectors. This is firstly due to the circumstance that all
sectors use policy-making cycles with common elements.
Moreover, this potential transferability of the indicators
was enhanced by the variety of areas of competence and
roles among Delphi panellists and the cross-sector ap-
proach that was followed and examined during the
REPOPA project [ 26, 50, 63, 76].
Implications for the uptake of REPOPA indicators
A first step towards the practical application of the inter-
national REPOPA indicators for EIPM has already been
performed by testing them within national conferences
held in the six REPOPA countries (to be presented in a
later manuscript); based on these national conferences,
evidence briefs and guidance resources for the use of the
international REPOPA indicators were developed.
According to WHO Regional Office for Europe
[71], many tools to support EIPM are already avail-
able but are not widely used, and more research and
development should continue, including evaluation of
new and existing tools [ 77]. Therefore, institutional support
and incentives [78, 79] such as funding or other stimuli for
the individuals to foster EIPM could be considered [ 80].
Health systems that provide strong incentives for dialogues
between policy-makers and researchers through formalised
processes and enabling stru ctures and environments are
actively facilitating knowled ge generation. Formalised
processes should include explicit incentives to demand and
use evidence, as well as time and space for inter-linkages
between policy-makers and researchers [43].
Specifically, we think that new approaches for institu-
tionalisation of the indicators would be required, includ-
ing what employees are rewarded for. A proposal would
be to build in a requirement for an assessment of indica-
tors on EIPM into routine job performance. Our sugges-
tion related to the international REPOPA indicators,
validated by this study, is to foster their joint use by
policy-makers and researchers, as a way to encourage
joint researcher – policy-maker teams – a possibility given
by the fact that the indicators were jointly developed
with the contribution of both researchers and policy-
makers, also in line with the WHO recommendations of
involving both researchers and policy-makers while de-
veloping tools [ 71]. Indeed, strengthening the interac-
tions between researchers and policy-makers has been
described as a potential solution to foster EIPM [ 22, 24, 81],
to such an extent that, according to the WHO Regional Of-
fice for Europe, it should be required among the actions to
foster EIPM for policy development by the establishment of
a legal framework to support the use of evidence [ 71]. This
issue is also reflected in seve ral indicators retained in the
final set of international REPOPA indicators that imply a
relationship between researchers and policy-makers, also
addressing the well-characterised communication gap be-
tween them [ 5, 14, 22, 24, 48, 69, 82]. Current views, which
are reflected in the final set of indicators, suggest that
EIPM-oriented communication between research and
policy-makers should be systematic and continuous, con-
sisting of a collaborative approach towards using know-
ledge in real-world settings, adapting research questions
to policy needs and helping policy-makers to interpret
research findings [ 6, 42, 43, 61, 72, 74, 78, 83– 85].
Moreover, the future use of indicators is facilitated by
the availability of a reliable version of the indicators in
six country languages (in addition to English, Danish,
Dutch, Finnish, Italian and Romanian). Although we did
not provide back translation from the six national lan-
guages to English, the methodology adopted, involving
two researchers external to REPOPA project per country
for feedback regarding the comprehension and intelligi-
bility of the questionnaires and indicators, can be con-
sidered as an initial step toward validation of the six
versions of the set of indicators. This process of valid-
ation continued within the national conferences held in
the six REPOPA countries and with the analysis and
comparison of their results.
According to WHO Regional Office for Europe [ 71],
existing evidence and tools for EIPM should be available
in local languages and sharing lessons and learning from
country experiences is important as an action to build
EIPM capacities, in particular in assessing and compar-
ing EIPM practices across countries.
Finally, according to the literature [ 86, 87], processes
of interaction, discussion and exchange are more effect-
ive to promote learning than those based on summaris-
ing research, disseminating papers and commissioning
reports. In this sense, as the REPOPA international Del-
phi process has the added value of being a research work
and a first dissemination action at the same time, the
REPOPA indicators have already started spreading.

Strengths and limitations
Two main strengths of the study are the quality of
the panel, including experts coming from different
areas of competence and different geographical con-
texts, and the unusually high response rate obtained
in both the first and second round of the Delphi (92.
7% and 87.8%, respectively) [ 32, 88, 89]. Reaching this
goal was supported by a coordination strategy that in-
volved local management of country panellists by
leads in each of the partic ipating countries and
Delphi coordinators supporting the local managing
process. A possible limitation is that, in order to
make the indicators adaptable to various contexts, we
did not define specific units of measurement (e.g.
Boolean, numerical, percentage values) and baselines
(e.g. specific values to be reached to assess the pres-
ence of EIPM) to be assigned to each indicator –
these should be established by the users with reference to
the context of a specific health organisation or policy in a
given territory. At the same time, psychometric assess-
ment of the indicators could be performed in order to
deeply understand latent factors in the indicators in view
of improving their implementation in various health and
research organisations, as reported in the literature for
other tools [ 90].
Implications for future research
Although the process of contextualising the indicators in
different countries has already started by means of the
national conferences held in the six European countries
within the REPOPA project, further adaptations might
be needed to enlarge the environments where this set of
indicators can be applied, especially with reference to
the specific contexts of resource scarcity and high bur-
dens of disease in low- and middle-income countries,
where evidence uptake to support effective and efficient
health systems interventions is crucial to reduce health
inequities [ 43] and EIPM might face specific barriers to
be considered. In low-resource settings, among the
variety of specificities to be kept in mind while dealing
with EIPM, a further issue may concern the interface be-
tween national policies and the policies of international
agencies.
At the same time, the implementation of the indicators
within a specific health policy or organisation is still to
be tested. Future empirical studies should test the pro-
posed indicators in actual policy processes to further as-
sess their usability and help to understand how to
integrate them in the regular business of an organisation.
This testing should also involve policies not strictly re-
lated to the health field in order to verify the transfer-
ability of the indicators to other sectors.
Finally, further implementation research would be re-
quired to examine processes necessary to stimulate the
use of the indicators by researchers, policy-makers and
other stakeholders.
Conclusions
The study led to the development and validation at an
international level of a set of measurable indicators spe-
cifically devoted to assess if and to what extent policies
are realised in an evidence-informed manner. These in-
dicators can also have a crucial impact on fostering the
development of policies that are informed by evidence;
they are intended to become a shared resource usable by
policy-makers, researchers and other stakeholders deter-
mined to bringing evidence into policy development
processes.
International REPOPA indicators embed several actions
and aspects related to EIPM, including methodologies of
communication with stakeholders, documentation issues,
evaluation constraints and opportunities, and the possible
creation of new evidence by policies. As a consequence,
their use can support the establishment of routine pro-
cesses to enhance EIPM, and foster innovation in key as-
pects of inter-sectoral policy-making.

1With ‘tacit knowledge ’ we mean implicit and intuitive
knowledge that is difficult to communicate, e.g. know-
how acquired during practical experience, but we also
include explicit knowledge that was not formalised in
scientific papers or reports.
2For policy-makers, we considered the following defin-
ition: “people taking decisions about the proposal and/or
implementation of a program, project or activity aimed
to an institutional goal, and having responsibility on it ”
[58, 91– 93].
3The first questionnaire comprised a further section
concerning some multi-faceted aspects which influence
EIPM, but too wide to be translated in terms of measur-
able indicators, which were presented under the label of
‘Towards complex indicators ’ and were rated on their
relevance. They will be the subject of a separate paper.

Ethics approval and consent to participate
Before the REPOPA project started, each country team sought ethical clearance in
their respective countries in the forms required by therein [94]. Before the two
internet-based Delphi rounds, an informed consent form for the REPOPA Delphi
study was signed by participants. The 82 experts who agreed to become part of the
Delphi panel remained anonymous throughout the two internet-based Delphi
rounds; their names were circulated only among REPOPA researchers and the data
obtained were analysed anonymously. The research in general followed the ethics
guidelines specifically developed and accepted by the REPOPA Consortium. Data
was collected respecting the national ethical regulations and clearance procedures
specific to each setting.
