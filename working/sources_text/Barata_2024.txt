Abstract 
Research suggests that, unlike practitioners of other professions, psychotherapists do not improve their 
performance with experience. The application of deliberate practice (DP) into psychotherapy training 
has been suggested as one way to improve psychotherapists’ and psychology students’ performance. 
This study intends to compare the effect of deliberate practice (DP) training and expositive training as 
usual (TAU) on the empathic quality of undergraduates’ therapeutic responses to clinical simulation 
videos. Psychology undergraduates (N = 36) were randomly assigned either to DP or to TAU conditions. 
They recorded their empathic responses to two videos at three different points in time over the course of 
three weeks (once before having received any training and twice after the DP or TAU interventions). 
Blind raters evaluated the empathic quality of the responses using the Measure of Expressed Empathy 
(Watson, 1999). The results indicate that undergraduate students undergoing DP displayed 
improvements in their empathic responses from baseline to after the second DP training. In contrast, 
participants in the TAU condition did not show comparable enhancements.

Introduction  
Psychotherapy has been proven to be effective 
in treating several psychological disorders  
across all age groups (Wampold, 2013). This 
effect appears to be similar across different 
psychotherapeutic approaches (Gloster et al., 
2020; Imel et al., 2008; Luborsky et al., 1975; 
Smith & Glass, 1977). Moreover, “specific 
ingredients” seem to account little for therapy 
efficacy (Ahn & Wampold, 2001; Bell et al., 
2013), with common factors, such as the 
therapist’s ability to be empathic and create and 
maintain a good therapeutic alliance  accounting 
for most therapy outcomes (Messer &  
 
Wampold, 2002). Gender, educational 
qualifications, and the degree of theoretical 
integration of therapists are not predictors of 
clients’ outcomes (Chow et al., 2015; Goldberg 
et al., 2016). Additionally, it seems that 
therapists may not improve with experience 
(Anderson et. al., 2009; Chow et al., 2015; 
Tracey et al., 2014; Wampold & Imel, 2015), 
with some even performing worse over time 
(Goldberg et al., 2016). This effect might be due 
to the lack of systematic training and feedback 
that therapists receive (Tracey et al., 2014).  
Nonetheless, there are therapists who are 
consistently seen to be more effective than their

peers (Baldwin & Imel, 2013). While this is still 
an under-researched field of study, it seems that 
these therapists tend to be more attentive to 
feedback and to engage in deliberate practice 
(DP) trainings (Miller et al., 2007; Miller et al., 
2013, Rousmaniere et al., 2017).  
This study serves as a proof of concept, 
aiming to explore the practical application of 
DP for improving therapeutic skills. Our 
objective is to showcase the feasibility and 
potential effectiveness of implementing a DP 
training method during the early stages of 
academic development by directing our efforts 
toward undergraduate students. 
Despite the attention given to the 
development of treatment programs, there is a 
lack of research regarding the teaching of 
psychotherapy methods (Pascual-Leone, 2014; 
Boswell & Castonguay, 2007). Training 
programs are typically organized based on 
schools' historical traditions and the factors that 
professional organizations deem important; 
however, these programs may not always align 
with the trainees’ perspective of what they need 
to know to be effective psychotherapists (Rocco 
et al., 2019). With this proposal we aim to 
understand if DP can be an effective method to 
alleviate the notable, perceived gap in 
psychotherapist training where there is a clear 
bias toward theoretical and didactic instruction 
in psychotherapy training. This bias 
overshadows the inclusion of hands-on practical 
experience, experiential training methods, and 
targeted development of therapeutic skills 
(Boswell & Castonguay, 2007; Rousmaniere et 
al., 2017).  
The existing research regarding 
psychotherapeutic or counseling training mainly 
addresses graduate students and professionals, 
with fewer authors discussing the effect of 
training at an undergraduate level (Hill, 2008; 
Pascual-Leone, 2014). Despite the evident 
rationale for investigating the effects of 
psychotherapy training on graduates and 
professionals, research suggests that, when 
trained in a comparable manner, undergraduates 
commencing with lower baseline values can 
attain a level of effectiveness in specific areas 
comparable to that of  graduates. For instance, 
undergraduates can demonstrate proficiency in 
abilities such as providing helpful single 
sessions and eliciting a helpful reaction from a 
client. However, there is limited research on the 
learning potential of this specific group. 
Through our research, we aspire not only to 
advance theoretical understanding but also 
bridge the practical training gap observed in the 
education of future psychotherapists. 
Specifically, we aim to understand if DP can 
improve key therapeutic skills, such as empathy, 
in undergraduate students. 
 
Deliberate Practice 
Deliberate practice (DP) is described as 
“individualized training activities specially 
designed by a coach or teacher to improve 
specific aspects of an individual’s performance 
through repetition and successive refinement” 
(Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996, pp. 278–279). This 
type of training has been proposed as one of the 
main causes for performance improvement 
(Ericsson et al., 1993; Ericsson, 2006), and 
evidence suggests that the number of hours 
spent practicing a certain domain predicts the 
practitioner's performance more than innate 
characteristics such as “talent” (Ericsson et al., 
1993). DP has shown to be effective in areas 
such as music, sports, chess, and medicine 
(Ericsson & Pool, 2016; McGaghie et al., 2011). 
However, until recently, there were no studies 
investigating its effect on the practice of 
psychotherapy.  
Research on DP’s effect on psychotherapy 
emerged with the study of so-called 
“supershrinks”; i.e., therapists who 
consistently have better results than their peers 
(Miller et al., 2007). This research proposes 
that the difference between supershrinks and 
“normal” therapists is that the former engage 
in DP trainings, work harder, and are more 
attentive to feedback. Hence, it has been 
suggested that to become a better therapist it is 
necessary for one to (a) determine the baseline 
of effectiveness, (b) engage in DP, and (c) get 
feedback. 
Since DP is similar to repetitive practice 
and to supervision, it is important to define the 
differences between each type of training. DP

involves several components, such as the 
following: (a) the observation of current 
performance; (b) individualized and immediate 
feedback; (c) the creation of small learning 
goals within the trainee's current capacity; (d) 
behavioral training focusing on the learning 
objectives identified previously; and (e) 
performance evaluation over time (Ericsson, 
2006; Miller et al., 2007; Rousmaniere, 2017). 
This differs from mere repetitive practice since 
trainees under DP training do not repeat their 
mistakes constantly as they operate under the 
guidance of an expert. For instance, in mere 
repetition, participants may fall into the trap of 
merely reinforcing the current cognitive 
structure and the current level of performance. 
In DP repetition, however, there is constant 
feedback with each repetition allowing for a 
gradual refinement of performance through 
repetitions after feedback (Ericsson, 1998). 
Additionally, with DP, there is constant 
monitoring to ensure that the repetition stays 
on the edge of the participant's potential 
development zone, thus ensuring that they do 
not remain stagnant in their progress (Miller, 
et al., 2018).  
In DP, there is solitary practice, which refers 
to time that the trainee spends training on their 
own (for example at home) without guidance but 
to be discussed and evaluated in future DP 
sessions. Therefore, DP training cannot take place 
entirely alone, without the presence and guidance 
of an expert coach; there can be only moments of 
solitary practice within the DP training.  
Supervision focuses on three specific areas of 
training goals: (1) professional and personal 
characteristics (such as self-efficacy, 
professionalism, ethics, values and attitudes, self-
knowledge), (2) trainee conceptual skills 
(recognizing client dynamics, understanding 
client-therapist interactions and sequences), and 
(3) trainee relationship and technical skills 
(alliance development/maintenance, managing 
countertransference, theory-specific skills) 
(Bernard, 1997). Traditionally, supervision of a 
therapist involves a discussion between the 
supervisor and the therapist about case diagnosis 
and dynamics to be addressed (Rousmaniere, 
2017), but with not as much discussion about the 
therapist's posture, specific interventions, or the 
degree of therapist responsiveness. During a 
therapy session, the therapist may not be aware of 
their performance quality in these areas. 
Furthermore, without means to observe the actual 
intervention by the therapist (video recording, 
audio, one-way observation mirror), supervision 
is merely descriptive. Thus, it is in this area that 
DP aims to work, introducing a new proposal that 
incorporates practical skill-training exercises 
within each therapist's zone of proximal 
development. 
The literature has shown that DP has a positive 
effect on therapists’ performance (Anderson et al., 
2019; Chow et al., 2015; Golberg et al., 2016b; Hill 
et al., 2019; Westra et  al., 2020). Several authors 
have stressed that, as DP is a new training system, 
it is crucial to test and assess performance 
improvement based on skills that predict better 
outcomes (Miller et al., 2018; Perlman et al., 2020; 
Tracey et al., 2014), and that are common to all 
psychotherapeutic approaches, rather than skills 
specific to one approach (Perlman et al., 2020). 
Since empathy has shown to be one of the common 
factors with considerable effect in therapeutic 
outcomes (Wampold, 2015), the present study uses 
empathy as its dependent variable. 
The researchers intend to analyze two 
hypotheses:  
• (H1): Participants under the DP training 
improve the quality of their empathic responses 
when compared to a group in the Training as 
Usual (TAU) condition. It is expected that, at 
the baseline, the quality of responses is the 
same for participants in both the DP and TAU 
groups and that, after the interventions, the 
responses in the DP group are significantly 
more empathic than the responses of the TAU 
group.  
•  (H2): Participants in the DP group improve the 
quality of their responses throughout the 
second and third evaluation moments (after the 
DP training), while participants in TAU 
maintain the quality of their responses in the 
three moments.

Method 
Overview and Design 
This study is a randomized control trial (RCT) 
following a mixed design. Participants recorded 
their interventions to clinical-simulation videos 
(Video A and B) on three occasions, with a week 
interval between collection of data. The Theravue® 
platform (2020) was used to record the 
interventions. Once the data were collected, the 
interventions were coded and rated by two master’s 
students, blind to participants’ conditions, who 
were trained to use the Measure of Expressed 
Empathy (MEE) (Watson, 1999).  
The interrater agreement was assessed using 
the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The 
Intraclass correlation analysis (ICC) yields a good 
agreement for participants’ empathy scores: The 
average ICC was .824 with a 95% CI [.653, .910] 
(F(35,35) = 5.549, p<.001), for the first responses; 
the average ICC was .749 [.483, .878] (F(31,31) = 
3.902, p<.001) for the second responses; and .768 
[.486, .896] (F(25,25) = 4.279, p<.001) for the third 
responses.  
 
Participants  
Participants were students enrolled in a clinical 
psychology seminar, a course in a Psychological 
Sciences bachelor’s degree program at a 
Portuguese university. The overall sample 
comprised 36 participants (Mage = 25.67, SDage = 
10.61, age range = 19 – 56; Table 1). However, due 
to subject loss during the three weeks only 26 
participants took part in all evaluation moments 
(Figure 1). None of the participants completed 
clinical hours professionally. However, two 
participants were trained in specific psychotherapy 
approaches (Table 1). All participants signed an 
informed consent.

Materials 
The training and assessment were implemented 
using Theravue® (2020), an online system for 
therapy education, in which participants watch 
clinical-simulation videos and record their 
interventions. The demographic survey was 
implemented in Qualtrics software, XM (March 
2020). Additionally, the Measure of Expressed 
Empathy (MEE) (Watson, 1999) was used to 
rate the quality of the empathic responses given 
by the participants (see the Appendix) to the 
clinical-simulation videos (Video A and B).  
The Measure of Expressed Empathy (MEE)  is a 
10-item observer-rated measure that addresses 
the time length in which therapists maintain 
empathic verbal and nonverbal behaviors. It is 
built to evaluate segments of therapy sessions 
constituted with a 9-point scale (from 0 = 
“never” to 8 = “all the time”), which addresses 
the amount of time during the segment that the 
therapist showed a certain behavior. Hence, if 
the therapist showed a behavior (e.g., the 
therapist looked concerned) 50% of the 
segments’ time, he would receive a 4 for the 
item addressing that behavior. After the

This measure shows a high (α = .88) internal 
consistency and construct validity (r = .66, p < 
0.01) measured by Barrett-Lennard Relationship 
Inventory (BLRI; Barrett-Lennard, 1962) 
(Malin, 2016). 
Video A is 59 seconds long and depicts a 
woman with PTSD symptoms who says she 
feels misunderstood by her husband. She 
describes her symptoms and her inability to stop 
thinking about her concerns. 
Video B is 47 seconds long and shows a 
young man with a conflictual relationship with 
his sister that frustrates him and negatively 
influences the relationship with his nephew.  
 
Procedure 
Data collection occurred during two academic 
years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020). Participants 
were invited to participate in a study 
investigating the effect of different training 
methods on key clinical skills. Their 
participation was voluntary, and there was no 
reward for participating. Students and coaches 
met three times during the study. In the first 
meeting, coaches explained that the study 
included two training sessions and the self-
recording of participants’ responses to a pre-
recorded video of a therapy situation where a 
client expresses their concerns. 
 The schedule was explained to the 
participants and the importance of responding to 
all the videos after each training session and 
before the next was stressed. However, to 
maintain the internal validity of the study, no 
explanation about the differences of the groups 
was disclosed. Additionally, no discussion of 
DP was conducted. At the end of the first 
meeting, participants filled an informed consent 
explaining all the procedures and data treatment 
policy. After agreeing in participating in the 
study, all participants filled the demographic 
form and were randomly allocated to one of the 
two conditions. 
After the first meeting, participants received 
an email with their credentials to log in to 
their Theravue® account, and they were 
requested to record the first response to both 
video A and B before the second meeting with 
the coaches. Until this point, the procedure was 
the same for both the experimental (DP) and the 
control (TAU) groups. From the second meeting 
onward, the participants’ activities differed 
depending on the group to which they are 
allocated. 
The DP workshop consisted of a 90-minute 
group workshop with a certified DP coach who 
was also a university lecturer. In this group, 
participants had a brief introductory discussion 
about empathy and its importance in therapy 
outcomes. The participants were also told that 
the purpose of this workshop was to help them 
get feedback on their performance and to tailor 
training to improve it. The coach invited the 
first participant to show one of their responses 
to the videos. After watching the responses, 
objective and precise performance feedback was 
given to each participant, followed by an open 
group discussion of the performance. The 
coaches proposed objective exercises involving 
verbal and/or nonverbal tasks that were at the 
edge of the participants’ current capacity. These 
may pertain to the participants’ attitude, voice, 
responsiveness, or understanding of the client’s 
situation. The participant then re-watched the 
video and tried to give a new response taking 
into consideration the feedback and the 
proposed exercises, which were rehearsed at 
least 3 times for each response. This procedure 
occurred for all participants, and group 
discussion of individual performance was 
encouraged. At the end of the session the 
participants were invited to form small groups 
and practice the proposed exercises to improve 
therapeutic skills through role play. They were 
also asked to train alone with these exercises 
before the next session. The coach provided 
feedback to the groups during role play. All 
Rousmaniere’s (2017) assumptions of DP were 
met in this training.  
The TAU workshop also consisted of a 90-
minute group workshop with a university 
lecturer who was also an experienced 
psychotherapist. This condition aimed to 
simulate the environment of a more traditional 
lecture. The lecturer gave a presentation on

empathy and its importance in clinical outcomes. 
The lecturer presented empathy literature and 
initiated a debate on the importance of empathy in 
psychotherapy. Theoretical papers and books 
regarding this topic were shown. Topics such as 
therapist attitude, voice, responsiveness, and 
understanding of the client’s situation were debated 
and examples discussed. To avoid differences in 
content in the discussion of empathy, the DP 
and the TAU workshop  explored the same 
content when addressing empathic skills.  
These processes were repeated two times 
during the study: First, the participants recorded 
their responses to the videos taking into 
consideration the fact that they were to have an 
“empathic intervention”; they then had their first 
DP or TAU session, after which they recorded their 
response to the videos again; in the following 
week, they had their second and last sessions 
(either DP or TAU) and repeated the process a third 
time. 
  
Results 
Empathic Quality of Responses Between 
Groups 
The comparison of empathic scores between the 
experimental (DP) and control group (TAU), 
assessed through a Mann-Whitney test, partially 
support the first research hypothesis.  
The DP (Mdn = 3.58) and TAU (Mdn =

Empathic Quality of Responses Within 
Groups 
Friedman’s ANOVA was used to test if the 
participants’ performance increased within 
groups. That is, if the participants’ performance 
on the DP group and the TAU group increased, 
separately. For participants in the DP group, 
there was a significant increase in the responses’ 
empathic quality, X2 (2) = 9.143, p = .010, W = 
.327. Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc tests were 
carried out to analyse the differences between 
the three measures and these yielded a 
significant difference between the baseline (time 
1) and the last intervention (time 3) X2 (2) = -
1.143, p = .007. There were no significant 
differences in the control (TAU) group for the 
different measures X2 (2) = 2.167, p = .338, W 
= .090. These results partially support the 
second hypotheses since participants in the 
experimental group performed better after two 
DP interventions and participants in the control 
condition did not improve their responses.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Discussion 
Results revealed significant differences in 
scores for the DP condition across the three time 
points. Post hoc analysis using Dunn-Bonferroni 
correction indicated no significant differences in 
scores between Time 1 and Time 2 or between 
Time 2 and Time 3 in the DP condition. 
However, a significant difference was observed 
between Time 3 and Time 1, suggesting notable 
changes in scores during this interval. 
For the TAU condition, there were no 
statistically significant differences in scores 
across the three time points. It seems that the DP 
condition exhibited significant changes in scores 
over the three time points, while the TAU 
condition did not show significant differences 
across the assessed time points. No interaction 
between training group and time was found.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While the data do not reveal an interaction 
effect between the training group and time, we 
posit that these findings may serve as a  
promising indicator of the potential efficacy of 
DP. Nevertheless, the absence of interaction 
between time and training method implies that 
the conclusions of this study should be 
approached with caution. 
Of particular significance is the recognition 
that DP is a medium- to long-term method, and 
it is crucial that its application  remain 
consistent over time. Unfortunately, due to the 
constraints of this study, only two sessions of 
DP or TAU were allowed, potentially 
compromising the ability to thoroughly examine 
the effects of DP. 
Our findings go along with Pearlman and 
colleagues’ (2020) and Westra and colleagues’ 
(2020) results, where participants who were

under an active learning condition improved 
compared to participants in a TAU condition, 
and also with Chow and colleagues (2015) and 
Goldberg and colleagues (2016) findings, where 
participants under an DP training improved their 
clients’ outcomes. 
The fact that the effect of DP is only 
significant after the second intervention goes 
along with the DP literature that states that DP 
training has no immediate results (Ericsson et 
al., 1993; Ericsson & Pool, 2016; Tracey et al., 
2014; Miller et al., 2018). In fact, DP training is 
a highly mental and physically demanding 
activity, which requires extreme focus and effort 
for short periods of time, over a long period of 
time (Ericsson et al., 1993; Ericsson & Pool, 
2016). Consequently, trainees need to focus on 
long-term achievements and gains to sustain 
their practice (Ericsson et al., 1993; Ericsson & 
Pool, 2016). This dynamic may pose a challenge 
for DP training, particularly in solitary practice, 
as aspiring psychotherapists express that they 
feel overwhelmed when practicing alone and 
exhibit a preference for working in the presence 
of a coach rather than engaging in solitary 
assignments (Hill et al., 2019). 
As indicated by the literature (Goldberg et 
al., 2016), there are no substantial differences in 
performance associated with years of 
experience. However, it is plausible to 
hypothesize that students without previous 
clinical experience may have a lower baseline 
empathy compared to experienced therapists, 
thus making them more susceptible to 
improvement. Research indicates that 
inexperienced therapists or novice trainees 
enhance their clinical skills through various 
means such as modeling, practice, and feedback. 
 (Hill & Lent, 2006). Consequently, one 
might speculate that DP training for experienced 
therapists could take a longer time to yield 
positive results. To ensure the sustainability of 
the observed trends, ongoing monitoring of 
performance would be essential.  
Our results suggest that despite being an 
“individualised training activity” (Ericsson & 
Lehmann, 1996, pp. 278–279), DP trainings can 
be effective when applied in a group setting 
since it is possible to provide individualized 
feedback and training within group activities. 
This might be promising for the application of 
DP in continuing learning (e.g., supervision, 
postgraduate degrees, professional development 
workshops, etc.) since this is often occurs in 
groups. Moreover, as suggested by Westra and 
colleagues (2020), group sessions may be 
helpful for trainees since they can watch other 
trainees’ performance and feedback. The 
effectiveness of DP in groups reduces the effect 
of certain limitations of individualized DP  for 
both the trainee and the coach. Personal DP 
sessions might be too expensive for trainees and 
too time-consuming for coaches. Hence, the 
suggested effectiveness of group DP training 
might remove these two considerable DP 
constraints. We stress that in a group training it 
is necessary to ensure a non-judgmental and 
safe environment, as well as to avoid non-
purposeful and non-individualized repetition 
(Ericsson et al, 1993; Ericsson & Pool, 2016; 
Rousmaniere, 2017).  
The results of this study may provide 
insights into the effect of commonly used 
methods in continuing education, such as 
lectures and theoretical supervision, on the skills 
of psychotherapy trainees. One common 
criticism is that continuing learning methods 
tend to have a theoretical rather than a practical 
nature (Rousmaniere et al., 2017) and offer no 
feedback focused on individual performance 
(Ericsson & Pool, 2016). While this type of 
training is valuable for knowledge development 
in the field of psychotherapy, it may not fully 
address the imperative for enhancing the 
performance of psychotherapists (Rousmaniere, 
2017). The trend observed in the results of the 
present study suggest that incorporating DP 
training into these methods could mitigate the 
limitation of a purely expository training 
approach. 
DP applied to psychotherapists and 
psychology students’ training is a recent area of 
study and therefore still lacks empirical 
literature. The present results advocate that 
interpersonal skills such as empathy might be 
improved by DP training, at least in participants 
with no previous clinical skills. However, it is 
important to bear in mind that all the points

mentioned above indicate that this study is a 
proof of concept. Its method needs to be applied 
to other populations and include more training 
sessions so that results can be tested and 
corroborate (or not) the trend demonstrated by 
the presented data. 
 
Limitations and Future Research 
As previously mentioned, the study sample 
comprises students with no clinical experience. 
The sample size is also a limitation of the study, 
as there is a small number of participants in 
each condition which might increase the 
probability of a Type II error.  
Regarding the study procedure, participants 
were aware that their recordings would be 
evaluated. These recordings may have 
contributed to a feeling of being unsafe and a 
sense of judgment, which is not conducive to 
DP training (Ericsson et al., 1993; Rousmaniere, 
2017). Last, since training with practical 
activities is uncommon, and undergraduate 
students are used to theoretical lectures, our 
results might have suffered from a novelty 
effect. This effect may occur when an 
innovation is introduced (e.g., a new treatment) 
and increases participants’ motivation; that is, 
the newness of the training approach, rather than 
the experimental manipulation, produced an 
effect.  
For future research, it is crucial to replicate 
this study with a larger sample size to control 
for and analyze differences among experienced 
and non-experienced therapists, while also 
incorporating long-term follow-ups for data 
collection. The expanded sample size should 
include both trainees and experienced therapists 
to investigate potential interaction effects 
between conditions and therapist experience. 
Additionally, exploring whether the hours spent 
practicing alone affect participants' 
improvement would provide valuable insights. 
Longitudinal monitoring of participants' 
performance and the collection of clients' 
outcomes over time are essential aspects to 
consider. To ensure the quality of the DP 
manipulation, participants' evaluation of DP 
training quality and coaches' competence, use of 
the Deliberate Practice Coach Competency 
Scale (DPTCS) (Vaz & Rousmaniere, 2020), 
should be integrated. Furthermore, it is 
recommended to replicate this study with 
individualized DP sessions to examine potential 
differences between group and individual 
training. 
These findings suggest that DP might be a 
reliable training method to help undergraduate 
students develop clinical skills such as empathy. 
Hence, the present study contributes not only to 
the development of scientific research on the 
application of DP to students’ training but also 
to the effectiveness of current teaching 
practices.

Five-minute segments should be rated. Each segment is given a global rating on a nine- point scale on 
therapist’s behaviours that reflects aspects of expressed empathic communication. To score the measure 
add the items and calculate the mean. 
 
1. Does the therapist’s voice convey concern? 
Listen for high energy, colour (expressive of the emotions that it is trying to convey, flexible, musical), 
soft resonance that matches the verbal expression of concern; calmness, a grounded, open quality to the 
therapist’s voice. The voice should not sound rigid) 
0..................2...............4.................6.....................8 
Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
2. Is the therapist’s voice expressive? 
(Listen for high energy, colour, varied pitch; is it expressive where it needs to be?) 
0..................2...............4.................6.....................8 
Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
3. Does the therapist’s vocal tone or response match the intensity of the client’s feelings? 
(Listen for high energy, colour, emphasis, pitch variation that matches intensity of client’s feelings). 
Note: There are neutral states and in that case the therapist would match that state – doesn’t necessarily 
have to be highly emotional or field with intense feeling. (The vocal tone should convey a sense that 
therapist can meet the client at the same level of intensity; voice should show that therapist can handle 
the intensity and can hold client’s feelings e.g. show comfort when client is depressed; A score of 0 = 
nonchalant, non-caring attitude captured in vocal tone or complete mismatch between the subject matter 
that the client is conveying and the therapists response (e.g. vocal tone worried or flat if client excited). 
0..................2...............4.................6.....................8

4. Does the therapist convey warmth and an atmosphere of safety? 
(Does the therapist smile, maintain eye contact, convey softness, and appear receptive to the client’s 
concerns (receptiveness is not involvement; more low key respectful, open); (0 = “cold fish”; blank); 
(Does the therapist communicate an atmosphere of safety, of “holding” for the client?) 
0..................2...............4.................6.....................8 
Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
5. Is the therapist responsively attuned to the client’s inner world moment by moment in the 
session? 
(Does the therapist provide moment-to-moment acknowledgements, not let things go by; pick up the live 
edges of the client’s experience; fine-tune their responses to fit with their client’s? Is the therapist 
attuned to client’s facial and/or non-verbal behaviour that may be different from the content of client’s 
responses? Is the therapist attentive to nuances of meaning and feeling (doesn’t package what was said

and just reiterate it back?). Responses are not just a reflection of surface content but show an 
understanding of the client’s inner world. (Inner world is defined as client’s feelings, perceptions, 
memories, construal, bodily sensations (felt sense, and core values).

Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
6. Does the therapist look concerned? 
(Does the therapist look engaged and involved and maintain eye contact, or does the therapist look 
bored, disengaged, blank, and listless? Being attentive is an aspect of concern) 
0..................2...............4.................6.....................8 
Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
7. Is the therapist responsive to the client? 
(Does he or she adjust his/her responses to follow the client’s track? 
0..................2...............4.................6.....................8 
Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
8. Do the therapist’s responses convey an understanding of the client’s feelings, and inner 
experience? 
(Do the therapist’s responses show a sensitive appreciation and gentle caring for the client’s feelings and 
inner world? Do the therapist’s responses convey an emotional understanding of the client’s inner world, 
for example – “so you’re just like a little girl in the corner?”. Does the therapist convey the emotional 
meaning and emotional significance of events? Feelings are not just labels of anger, sadness, etc., but 
can also be metaphors. Keep in mind that if the therapist hasn’t said much 5-minute segment that may be 
appropriate.

Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
9. Do the therapist’s responses convey an understanding of the client’s cognitive framework and 
meanings? 
(It is expected that most therapists will show an understanding of what their clients are saying. To score 
0 one person would have to be saying the sky is blue and the other talking about loud music so that there 
is no overlap in content or continuity between the participants). Ask yourself “Are they on the same 
page?”. Is there a back and forth quality to the interaction? Is the therapist following what the client is 
saying? To score highly the therapist captures the client’s construal/or idiosyncratic perception.

Never       25%       Half the time         75%        All the time 
 
10. Is the therapist accepting the clients feeling and inner experience? 
(8 = sincere i.e. conveying that you mean what you say – being authentic, open, prizing, genuine; 0 = 
invalidating of the client’s experience and dismissing their perspective or being insincere, putting on an 
act; trying to appear empathic but coming across as inauthentic.).
