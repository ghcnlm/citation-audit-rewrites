Temporary jobs have become more promi-
nent in all labor market sectors ranging 
from construction to scientific research. As 
a consequence, careers are also becoming 
more dynamic, and employees need to keep 
up with a growing number of changes in 
work and working organizations. Moreover, 
employees are increasingly expected to 
take their own responsibility for managing 
their career (Segers & Inceoglu, 2012; Vuori, 
IT’S ALL ABOUT CAREERSKILLS: 
EFFECTIVENESS OF A CAREER 
 DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTION 
FOR YOUNG EMPLOYEES

The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of the CareerSKILLS 
program, a career development intervention based on career competencies 
and the JOBS methodology, which aims to stimulate career self-management 
and well-being of young employees. In a quasi-randomized control trial, the ef-
fects of the program were tested in a homogeneous sample of young employ-
ees with intermediate vocational education (N
intervention = 1 12, Nnon-intervention = 61) 
and in a heterogeneous sample of employees from a special reintegration 
program (Nintervention = 71, Nnon-intervention = 41). Our results support the effective-
ness of the intervention: participants of the CareerSKILLS program, versus 
a control group, showed increases in six career competencies (reﬂ  ection of 
motivation, reﬂ ection on qualities, networking, self-proﬁ  ling, work explo-
ration, and career control), self-efﬁ cacy, resilience against setbacks, career-
related behaviors, perceived employability, and work engagement. These 
results provide empirical support for the effectiveness of the CareerSKILLS 
program. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2014 Wiley

n the past few decades, several changes 
have taken place in the labor markets 
of Western countries. Labor has become 
more knowledge based and service ori-
ented and employee well-being and 
career development are becoming increas-
ingly important (Diener & Seligman, 2004; 
Nieuwenhuis, Coenen, Fouarge, Harms, & 
Oosterling, 2012). In addition, the labor 
market has become much more flexible.

Faced with these 
challenges, 
employees need 
to seek career 
opportunities 
proactively within 
as well as outside 
of their current 
organization. 
Therefore, gaining 
resources and 
competencies 
to successfully 
manage one’s career 
is essential.
an alarming 28 percent unemployment rate 
of young employees in Europe (European 
Commission, 2012).
All these indicators emphasize the impor-
tance of research on the role of career compe-
tencies in the career development of young 
workers. To study the role of career compe-
tencies, a number of steps need to be taken. 
The first would be to examine what compe-
tencies are important and how to assess these 
competencies. In a recent study, Akkermans, 
Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, and Blonk (2013) 
developed a model and assessment instrument 
of career competencies. The authors showed 
that career competencies can be reliably and 
validly measured. A second step in studying 
the role of career competencies would be to 
investigate whether career competencies can 
be enhanced by brief interventions.
This issue of career competencies and 
career-related interventions may be especially 
important for young employees with lower 
levels of education. European labor market 
studies show increasing differences between 
educational groups concerning health, sick-
ness absence, and unemployment (European 
Commission, 2012). In these studies, employ-
ees with lower educational levels report the 
least favorable outcomes. In addition, educa-
tional and professional levels are polarizing in 
the sense that more jobs are being created for 
highly skilled workers, and wages are increas-
ing more among highly skilled workers 
(European Commission, 2012). Research also 
indicates that a lower educational level can 
result in an extended job search for the first 
job, and in lower job security (Nieuwenhuis 
et  al., 2012). In addition, lower-skilled jobs 
are becoming ever more complex due to 
increasing certificate and diploma demands, 
an increasing emphasis on flexibility and 
social skills, and the growing role of informa-
tion and communication technology (ICT) 
(Nieuwenhuis et al., 2012). Therefore, in our 
study we focused on young employees with 
lower educational levels (i.e., fewer than 12 
years of education, noncollege).
In this study, we tested the short-term 
effectiveness of a brief intervention that 
aims to stimulate career competencies and 
work-related well-being of young employees. 
Toppinen-Tanner, & Mutanen, 2011). Faced 
with these  challenges, employees need to 
seek career opportunities proactively within 
as well as outside of their current 
organization. Therefore, gaining 
resources and competencies to 
successfully manage one’s career 
is essential. For these reasons, 
Vuori et  al. (2011) argued that 
more empirical studies are needed 
that examine the effectiveness of 
interventions supporting career 
development. In line with Vuori 
et al., Hall and Las Heras (2010) 
emphasized that these interven-
tions may also include so-called 
“smart jobs”—jobs that are de-
signed in such a way that they 
may  facilitate both employee 
well-being and career develop-
ment. In this study we empiri-
cally tested a career development 
intervention and focused on its 
effects on career competencies 
and work- related well-being of 
young workers.
Thus far, research on employee 
well-being and career develop-
ment has focused mainly on adult, 
more experienced employees 
(e.g., Buyens, Van Dijk, Dewilde, 
& De Vos, 2009). Relatively few studies have 
solely focused on young employees. This 
is a surprising result, in particular because 
young employees encounter many career-
related activities in a brief period of time 
that may have important consequences for 
their future career, health, and well-being 
(see Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, Blonk, & 
Koppes, 2009; Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, 
Van den Bossche, Blonk, & Schaufeli, 2013; 
Elfering, Semmer, Tschan, Kälin, & Bucher, 
2007). Besides finding a first occupation 
and exploring possibilities for further pro-
fessional development, these also include 
experiencing unsatisfactory employment, 
work socialization, and underemployment 
(Koivisto, Vuori, & Nykiri, 2007; Koivisto, 
Vuori, & Vinokur, 2010). Moreover, young 
employees have been hit hardest by the eco-
nomic crisis of the past few years, leading to

Finland (Vuori, Silvonen, Vinokur, & Price, 
2002) and the Netherlands (Brenninkmeijer 
& Blonk, 2011). Vinokur and Schul (1997) 
found that these interventions were especially 
effective because of the active working ingre-
dients of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997) and 
inoculation against setbacks (Meichenbaum, 
1985). In focusing on enhancing self-efficacy 
together with skill acquisition, 
participants gained a sense of 
mastery. Moreover, by preparing 
participants for potential setbacks, 
they were better able to overcome 
these setbacks. These two work-
ing ingredients of self-efficacy and 
inoculation against setbacks were 
the methodological fundament 
in developing the CareerSKILLS 
program. Further, the exercises 
of this intervention were aimed 
at enhancing the career compe-
tencies that were brought for-
ward in the model of Akkermans, 
Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et  al. 
(2013).
Career Competencies
The main building blocks of the 
CareerSKILLS intervention are 
career competencies. As mentioned 
earlier, Akkermans, Brennink-
meijer, Huibers, et  al. (2013) 
recently formulated a model of 
career competencies, which was 
used as a basis for the Career 
Competencies Questionnaire 
(CCQ). Using qualitative pilot 
studies and quantitative analyses 
with structural equation model-
ing, they showed that the CCQ 
had good content, factorial, dis-
criminant, and incremental valid-
ity. Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, 
Huibers, et  al. (2013) characterized career 
competencies as knowledge, skills, and abili-
ties central to career development that can be 
developed by the individual. Their model was 
divided into three dimensions—reflective, 
communicative, and behavioral competen-
cies—and each of these dimensions contained 
The methodology of this intervention was 
derived from the JOBS program (Caplan, 
Vinokur, Price, & Van Ryn, 1989), an empiri-
cally supported intervention that was 
 originally developed to reintegrate recently 
unemployed individuals. Our intervention, 
the CareerSKILLS intervention (Akkermans 
& Lagerveld, 2010), employs active learning 
processes (Caplan, Vinokur, & Price, 1997) in 
which the learner has a central role in identi-
fying personal and professional development, 
and creative problem solving. Empirically 
testing this career development intervention 
may provide us with additional understand-
ing of how to stimulate career competencies, 
employability, and work-related well-being of 
young workers.
The CareerSKILLS Intervention
The CareerSKILLS intervention was devel-
oped to stimulate career competency devel-
opment and work-related well-being of young 
employees. Its methodology is based on the 
JOBS intervention (Caplan et  al., 1989), 
which was developed at the Michigan 
Prevention Research Center as a preventive 
intervention for recently unemployed job 
seekers. The JOBS program is a short, inten-
sive group course that follows a strict proto-
col. In five consecutive four-hour meetings, 
the participants work with themes such as 
reflecting on future wishes, expanding pro-
fessional networks, and setting goals. Two 
facilitators lead the sessions, which consist of 
12 to 20 participants. The JOBS program sets 
itself apart from other interventions because 
of its methodology and its theoretical back-
ground, which is detailed next. The method-
ology is based both on skill acquisition and 
on strengthening self-efficacy and problem 
solving skills. 
The effectiveness of JOBS and JOBS-derived 
interventions has been studied in a number 
of empirical field studies. In the United States, 
several studies with unemployed individuals 
demonstrated both the short-term and long-
term effectiveness on problem-solving skills, 
finding a job, job satisfaction, and income 
earned (Caplan et  al., 1989; Vinokur, Price 
& Schul, 1995). Similar results were found in

536 H UMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, JULY–AUGUST 2015

with the active learning processes in the 
intervention (Vinokur & Schul, 1997): 
 self-efficacy and inoculation against setbacks. 
Self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997, 2012) refers to 
individuals’ judgment of their capability of 
meeting demands in a specific context. Self-
efficacy has been shown to increase individu-
als’ motivation for performing specific 
goal-related behavior (Van Ryn & Vinokur, 
1992; Vuori et al., 2011). Applied to the work-
ing context, it can be defined as the confi-
dence in one’s abilities to successfully perform 
work-related and career-related activities. 
Self-efficacy is an important ingredient of 
CareerSKILLS because it contributes to defin-
ing personal strengths and interests (related 
to reflective career competencies), social rela-
tions at work (related to communicative 
career competencies), and seeking possibili-
ties and shaping one’s career in the desired 
direction (related to behavioral career compe-
tencies; Vuori et  al., 2011). Akkermans, 
Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et al. (2013) also 
demonstrated that self-efficacy is related to 
career competencies and perceived employ-
ability. The CareerSKILLS intervention aims 
to enhance self-efficacy by adopting an 
approach that centers around positive rein-
forcement and specific positive feedback in 
active learning exercises. Referent power of 
the trainers and emphasizing that partici-
pants are experts themselves, combined 
with social support, further strengthens 
self-efficacy.
The concept of inoculation against setbacks 
refers to the ability to anticipate setbacks and 
the skills to cope with them (Meichenbaum, 
1985, 2007). According to Meichenbaum, 
inoculation against setbacks can be achieved 
by providing an individual with experience 
in potential stressors and setbacks. By pre-
paring against setbacks, individuals increase 
their resilience and develop a sense of mastery 
in problem-solving skills when confronted 
with real-life obstacles. Because setbacks are 
accepted as learning opportunities, individu-
als will maintain their motivation to carry 
out difficult behaviors when faced with real 
setbacks (Meichenbaum, 2007). As argued 
earlier, young workers face many new chal-
lenges and difficult choices in a brief period 
two competencies. Reflective career compe-
tencies pertain to creating awareness of the 
career and to combining personal reflections 
with the professional career. The two compe-
tencies that comprise this dimension are 
reflection on motivation, which refers to reflec-
tion on values, passions, and motivations 
with regard to the personal career; and reflec-
tion on qualities, which refers to reflection on 
strengths, shortcomings, and skills with regard 
to the personal career. Communicative career 
competencies relate to being able to effec-
tively communicate with significant others to 
improve one’s chances of career success. The 
two competencies are networking, which refers 
to the awareness of the presence and profes-
sional value of one’s network, and the ability 
to expand this network for career-related pur-
poses; and self-profiling, which refers to pre-
senting and communicating one’s personal 
knowledge, abilities, and skills to the internal 
and external labor market. Finally, behavioral 
career competencies pertain to being able to 
actually shape one’s career by taking action 
and being proactive. Work exploration, which 
refers to actively exploring and searching for 
work-related and career-related opportunities 
on the internal and external labor market, 
and career control , which refers to actively 
influencing learning processes and work pro-
cesses related to one’s career by setting goals 
and planning how to reach these goals, are 
the two behavioral competencies. 
During the intervention, participants 
first work on their reflective competencies 
by focusing on what they like and dislike in 
work, what their qualities are, and what kind 
of job or working environment they would 
like to achieve. Next, they work out strategies 
involving significant others (i.e., communi-
cative competencies) to arrive at that pre-
ferred situation. Finally, these strategies are 
further refined with an action plan and an 
active search for opportunities to implement 
their plans (i.e., behavioral competencies). 
Self-Efﬁ cacy and Resilience Against 
Setbacks
In line with the JOBS program, CareerSKILLS 
is built on two active ingredients that interact

expect participants to perform these behav-
iors more frequently after participating in the 
CareerSKILLS intervention.
Another outcome of our intervention 
study is perceived employability. In recent 
years, the concept of employability has 
received much attention both in research and 
in practice, and it has been linked to career 
competency development (e.g., Akkermans, 
Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et al., 2013; Kuijpers, 
2003). Although different definitions exist, the 
common denominator in these definitions is 
the ability to gain equal or better employment 
in the present and in the future (e.g., Fugate, 
Kinicki, & Ashforth, 2004; Van der Heijde & 
Van der Heijden, 2006). The definition that we 
used in this study is that employability is “the 
ability to keep the job one has or to get the job 
one desires” (Rothwell & Arnold, 2007, p. 25). 
Recent studies have also focused on perceived 
employability (e.g., De Cuyper, Bernhard-
Oettel, Berntson, De Witte, & Alarco, 2008), 
emphasizing the importance of a subjective 
sense of being able to obtain and retain equal 
or better employment. As discussed earlier, 
the CareerSKILLS program is built around the 
two working ingredients of self-efficacy and 
resilience against setbacks. In fostering partici-
pants’ confidence in their ability to perform 
career-related activities and their sense of resil-
ience against obstacles, it is likely that they 
will also experience more positive perceptions 
of their ability to succeed in their career, and 
thus in their chances of obtaining and retain-
ing employment. This is especially the case 
because they gain additional mastery of career 
competencies during the intervention, which 
has been linked to perceived employability 
(Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et  al., 
2013). This leads to our next hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: The CareerSKILLS intervention will 
increase the levels of career-related behaviors and 
perceived employability in the intervention group 
compared with the control group.
As previously noted, CareerSKILLS was 
also developed to increase employee well-
being. Recent findings indicated that career 
competencies are related to job resources and 
work engagement, but not to job demands 
of time. They are often confronted with 
obstacles such as finding a suitable job and 
getting used to the responsibilities and social 
relations in working life. Therefore, it is 
essential to inoculate these young employ-
ees against setbacks, in order to keep them 
motivated and more resilient. For this reason, 
every session in the program contains sev-
eral “inoculation against setbacks” exercises, 
where participants help each other to recog-
nize potential obstacles, and subsequently to 
find solutions for these obstacles.
Because the exercises in the CareerSKILLS 
program were explicitly formulated to increase 
the six career competencies discussed earlier 
(Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et al., 
2013), we expect that the intervention will 
enhance the career competencies of the par-
ticipants. As the CareerSKILLS intervention is 
built around two active ingredients, self-effi-
cacy (Bandura, 2012) and inoculation against 
setbacks (Meichenbaum, 2007), we also 
expect participants to gain increased levels of 
work-related self-efficacy and become more 
resilient against setbacks. For these reasons, 
we formulated the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: The CareerSKILLS intervention will 
increase the level of career competencies in the in-
tervention group compared with the control group.
Hypothesis 2: The CareerSKILLS intervention 
will increase the level of work-related self-efﬁ cacy 
and resilience against setbacks in the intervention 
group compared with the control group.
As the CareerSKILLS program is aimed at 
increasing career self-management behaviors 
of young employees through the mastery of 
career competencies, an integral part of the 
CareerSKILLS program focuses on activating 
and encouraging participants to add con-
crete career-related behaviors to their inten-
tions. Consequently, we expect participants 
to report more career-related behaviors after 
completing the intervention. For example, 
one exercise specifically focuses on drawing an 
individual’s network, and on actually asking a 
relevant person from that network for career 
opportunities (e.g., a job offer). Because these 
skills are trained during the intervention, we

group and a control group. Data for this study 
were collected in two organizations: a Dutch 
educational institution (Sample 1) and a 
Dutch multinational (Sample 2). Participants 
in the intervention groups followed the pro-
gram during school hours in Sample 1, and 
during work hours in Sample 2. Participants 
of the control group did not receive a specific 
course or a placebo intervention. They fol-
lowed the regular curriculum of their school 
(Sample 1) and organization (Sample 2). In 
this way we could investigate whether the 
CareerSKILLS program would have added 
value on top of the regular programs. Due to 
practical restraints of the participating orga-
nizations, we could not fully randomize the 
groups. 
We derived the first sample from a large 
Dutch educational institution. These students 
received intermediate vocational education 
(i.e., fewer than 12 years of total education; 
noncollege): they followed a study of 3 to 4 
years, in which they all had an educational 
specialization (e.g., health care, metal indus-
try, administrative work). During their voca-
tional training they did multiple internships 
which increased in length and intensity each 
time. The participants in this study were in 
their final year of training, in which they did 
an extensive internship for one to four days 
per week. This was our primary test of effec-
tiveness, because the CareerSKILLS interven-
tion was specifically developed for this group.
The majority of participants in Sample 1 
were male (69.4 percent), with a mean age of 
19 years (83.8 percent was between 16 and 
20 years). The average tenure with their cur-
rent working organization was 8.7 months 
and they worked an average of 28.8 hours per 
week. Allocation to the two groups was based 
on the school class in which the interns were 
following their lessons: a class was appointed 
to either the intervention group or the con-
trol group. The composition of the two condi-
tions was matched with regard to educational 
specialization (e.g., ICT, health care, admin-
istrative work). A total of 112 out of 135 par-
ticipants followed the entire program and 
filled out questionnaires at three points in 
time (84 percent participation rate; 100 per-
cent response rate). In the control group, 61 
and emotional exhaustion (Akkermans,  
Schaufeli, Brenninkmeijer, & Blonk, 2013), 
thus showing a resemblance to personal 
resources that can stimulate employee well-
being (Hobfoll, 1989; Xanthopoulou, Bakker, 
Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2007, 2009). For 
this reason we also included work engage-
ment and emotional exhaustion in our anal-
yses, as indicators of motivation and strain, 
respectively. Work engagement is defined as 
a positive, fulfilling, work-related 
state of mind that is character-
ized by vigor, dedication, and 
absorption (Schaufeli, Salanova, 
González-Roma, & Bakker, 2002). 
Emotional exhaustion is a core 
component of burnout, which 
refers to feelings of being over-
extended and exhausted by the 
emotional demands of one’s work 
(Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, 
& Schaufeli, 2001). As noted here, 
career competencies have been 
positively linked to work engage-
ment, which indicates that mas-
tering these competencies may be 
positively associated with moti-
vation at work. On the contrary, 
earlier findings have shown no 
relationship between career com-
petencies and emotional exhaus-
tion, suggesting that the mastery 
of these competencies may not 
act as a buffer against strain. 
Because the CareerSKILLS pro-
gram is built around increasing 
these career competencies, it is 
likely that similar effects would be 
found. Therefore, we formulated the follow-
ing hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4: The CareerSKILLS intervention will 
increase the levels of work engagement, but not of 
emotional exhaustion, in the intervention group 
compared with the control group.

Our design was a quasi-randomized control 
trial with two conditions: an intervention

used to assess the robustness of our findings 
and to be able to generalize our results to a 
larger group of employees, as we expected the 
CareerSKILLS intervention to be useful for 
other groups of employees as well. A slight 
majority of the participants in Sample 2 were 
female (51.3 percent). Their mean age was 33 
years but roughly half of them were younger 
than 30 years and had received intermediate 
vocational education. On average, they were 
working in this reemployment program for 
6.7 months and they worked 35.9 hours per 
week. Full demographic details of the partici-
pants are displayed in Table I. In this sample, 
allocation to intervention or control group 
was determined based on department loca-
tion, as the organization consisted of four 
participating departments spread out over the 
Netherlands. In every department the partici-
pants were appointed to either the interven-
tion or the control group. A total of 72 of 84 
out of 89 students filled out questionnaires 
(69 percent response rate) at two points in 
time, corresponding with the first and third 
measurement in the intervention group. We 
checked for selective attrition both in the 
intervention group and the control group, 
but we did not find any significant differ-
ences with regard to gender (F(1, 133) = 1.18, 
p = .28, and F(1, 87) = 2.86, p = .10, respec-
tively) or educational specialization (F(1, 133) 
= 1.47, p = .23, and F(1, 87) = 1.55, p = .22, 
respectively).
The second sample consisted of partici-
pants in a reemployment program provided 
by a large Dutch multinational. These par-
ticipants had been unemployed but were 
given a temporary job in a special program 
that aimed to return them to work. The reem-
ployment program was part of the corporate 
social responsibility agenda of this multi-
national company. This second sample was

Participants 
brainstormed about 
possible jobs that 
fit their values, 
passions, and skills. 
They were asked to 
step into a figurative 
time machine to 
discover their dream 
jobs.
The CareerSKILLS Intervention
The first part of the CareerSKILLS interven-
tion consisted of four sessions during the 
course of two weeks: two sessions in the first 
week and two sessions in the second week. 
The participants followed a return day (the 
fifth session) six weeks after starting the inter-
vention. All sessions lasted 4 hours, adding 
up to 20 hours of total intervention time. 
Participants also received homework assign-
ments to increase transfer to their daily life 
situation. The intervention used methods 
such as an active learning process, brain-
storming (both in plenary sessions and in 
subgroup sessions), social modeling, a socially 
supportive environment, and role-playing. 
Inoculation against setbacks exercises were 
built around all the core themes of the inter-
vention by brainstorming about potential 
obstacles and solutions for these obstacles.
The composition of the exercises in the 
sessions was based on the six career compe-
tencies described earlier. Session 1, “Who Am 
I and What Am I Good At?,” contained exer-
cises with reflection on motivation and reflec-
tion on qualities. Participants reflected on the 
values that were important to them in their 
career and brainstormed about their personal 
qualities. At the end of the first session, par-
ticipants drew a personal emblem in which 
they elaborated on their achievements, their 
hidden talents, and their values. 
Session 2, entitled “My Passions and My 
Future,” again focused on both reflective career 
competencies. Participants brainstormed about 
possible jobs that fit their values, passions, and 
skills. They were asked to step into a figurative 
time machine to discover their dream jobs. 
The second session also focused on career 
control: participants started an action plan in 
which they formulated career-related goals on 
the short term (up to six months), the mid-
dle-long term (one to two years), and the long 
term (three to five years). 
Session 3, entitled “My Network and My 
Action Plan,” was built around career con-
trol as well. Participants reflected on their 
action plans and they further refined them. 
Networking was also a central component 
of the third session: participants drew an 
participants completed the entire program 
(86 percent response rate; 100 percent par-
ticipation rate). In the control group, 41 of 75 
participants filled out both questionnaires (55 
percent response rate). The composition of 
the two conditions was matched with regard 
to how long the participants had been part of 
the reintegration program, the working loca-
tion, age, and educational level. We checked 
for selective attrition both in the intervention 
group and the control group, but we did not 
find any significant differences with regard to 
gender (F(1, 82) = 1.13, p = .29, and F(1, 73) 
= 2.55, p = .12, respectively) or age ( F(1, 82) 
= 1.14, p = .29, and F(1, 73) = 2.72, p = .10, 
respectively).
Participants in the intervention 
groups received three question-
naires in both samples: immediately 
before the start of the intervention 
(Time 1), immediately after the 
four-day program two weeks later 
(Time 2), and after the final fifth 
day (i.e., the return day) of the 
program, six weeks after the start 
(Time 3). Questionnaires were 
handed out to the participants, so 
they could immediately be filled 
out on the spot. A research assis-
tant was present when partici-
pants filled out the questionnaire. 
This assistant briefly explained 
the procedure and was available 
for answering questions. The assis-
tant also stated that there were 
no right or wrong answers and that the data 
would be processed anonymously, thereby 
reducing the risk of evaluation apprehension 
(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 
2003). Participants in the control group 
received two questionnaires: a first question-
naire at a set time and location (Time 1) and a 
second questionnaire after six weeks (Time 3 
of the intervention group). The second ques-
tionnaire (Time 2) was left out for the control 
group due to practical concerns of the partici-
pating organizations. In sample 2, the control 
group filled out online questionnaires instead 
of paper-and-pencil surveys. They received an 
invitation via e-mail, and a reminder a week 
later.

(Vuori et  al., 2005). Second, active teaching 
and learning methods  were used. This means 
that instead of lecturing, the trainers make 
use of the participants’ own knowledge and 
their context; for instance, in discussions and 
role-plays. An advantage of active learning is 
that it takes place in the career context of the 
participants, which makes the content very 
specific and applicable to their real-life situa-
tion (El-Tannir, 2002). Third, certified trainers 
who lead the sessions are well trained to build 
trust and facilitate group processes. Fourth, 
trainers attempt to create a supportive training 
environment, in which participants learn from 
and support each other. This occurs through 
modeling and rewarding supportive behav-
iors (Vuori et  al., 2011). A supportive envi-
ronment is crucial for learning and facing 
challenges (Vuori et al., 2005). Finally, prepa-
ration against setbacks  is used to brainstorm 
about potential career-related obstacles and 
how to overcome these obstacles. This com-
ponent is important in providing a buffer to 
potential risks because of fail experiences.
Measurement Instruments
Career competencies  were measured with the 
21-item Career Competencies Questionnaire 
(CCQ; Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, 
et al., 2013). The items were measured on a 
5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (com-
pletely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). The 
total scale of career competencies showed 
excellent internal consistency with alpha val-
ues between 0.94 and 0.95. This scale con-
sisted of six subscales:
1. Reflection on motivation  was measured 
with three items, a sample item being “I 
know what I like in my work” (alpha val-
ues ranging from 0.81 to 0.87).
2. Reflection on qualities  was measured with 
four items. An example of an item is “I 
know my strengths in my work” (alpha 
values ranging from 0.85 to 0.92).
3. Networking was measured with four items, 
a sample item being “I know how to ask 
for advice from members of my network” 
(alpha values ranging from 0.78 to 0.88).
4. Self-profiling was measured with three 
items. A sample item was “I am able to 
elaborate map of their network, and they 
brainstormed about the importance of net-
working and the possibilities for increasing 
their personal and professional network. 
Session 4, entitled “How Do I Search for 
Possibilities and How Do I Present Myself?,” 
focused on self-profiling and work explora-
tion. Participants were asked about their values 
and skills, and the ways in which they exhib-
ited these competencies to significant others. 
In role-playing exercises, they attempted to 
present themselves as convincingly as pos-
sible to each other. Participants also did an 
exercise in which they were asked to think of 
ways to search for career-related opportunities 
both inside their current organization, inside 
their current industry, and outside of their 
current industry. The fourth session ended 
with a ceremony during which the trainers 
complimented all participants personally on 
their active role during the intervention. 
Session 5, the return day, was held 
approximately six weeks after the first session. 
Participants reflected on their experiences in 
daily life outside of the intervention and they 
brainstormed about ways to retain their learn-
ing experiences in the future. In this way, they 
practiced with repeating and retaining infor-
mation about all six career competencies. 
After completing the fifth session, participants 
received an official CareerSKILLS certificate.
The development of the intervention 
followed the five components for effective 
group interventions as used in the JOBS 
program (Price, Friedland, Choi, & Caplan, 
1998). These guidelines constitute didactic 
techniques and delivery methods to maxi-
mize active learning processes, and to stim-
ulate self-efficacy and inoculation against 
setbacks (Vinokur & Schul, 1997). Moreover, 
their applicability to and relevance for job-
related and career-related interventions has 
been demonstrated (Vuori, Price, Mutanen, 
Malmberg-Heimonen, 2005; Vuori et  al., 
2011). First, career self-management skills were 
developed through the incorporation of career 
competencies; for example, by defining one’s 
strengths and interests, and by finding means 
to achieve career goals. This component is 
important because most individuals have 
insufficient knowledge and skills in this area

has been shown to be positively correlated 
with career competencies (Akkermans, 
Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et  al., 2013), job 
satisfaction, and employee well-being, and 
negatively correlated with job insecurity (De 
Cuyper et al., 2008; De Cuyper & De Witte, 
2008). A sample item from this scale is “I 
could find a different, better job if I wanted 
to” (alpha values ranging from 0.81 to 0.93). 
Work engagement  was measured with 
the nine-item version of the Utrecht Work 
Engagement Scale (UWES; Schaufeli, Bakker, & 
Salanova, 2006). The items were measured on 
a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) 
to 6 (always). The UWES items reflect three 
underlying dimensions, which are measured 
with three items each: vigor (e.g., “At work I 
feel bursting with energy”; α = 0.77), dedica-
tion (e.g., “My work inspires me”; α = 0.88), 
and absorption (e.g., “I get carried away when 
I am working”; α = 0.81). Emotional exhaustion 
was measured with the five-item subscale from 
the Utrecht Burnout Scale (UBOS; Schaufeli & 
Van Dierendonck, 2000). The items were mea-
sured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 
0 (never) to 6 (always). One item was deleted 
from the scale because it clearly reduced the 
internal consistency of the scale. An exam-
ple item from this scale is “I feel mentally 
exhausted because of my work” (α = 0.88).
Satisfaction with the intervention  was 
assessed by asking participants to rate each 
day of the CareerSKILLS intervention on a 
5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very bad) 
to 5 (very good). These self-constructed items 
were formulated as follows: “How would 
you rate [session number]: [session title] ?” 
Cronbach’s alpha for the scale score was 0.80.
Strategy of Analysis
Repeated measures multivariate analyses of 
variance (MANOVAs) were used to test whether 
there were significant changes in each of the 
outcome variables across the two conditions 
between Time 1 (pretest) and Time 3 (six weeks 
later). We tested for main effects of time and 
condition, as well as for interaction effects of 
Time × Condition. The outcome variables that 
were used comprised the six career competen-
cies (reflection on motivation, reflection on 
show others what I want to achieve in my 
career” (alpha values ranging from 0.75 
to 0.87).
5. Work exploration was measured with three 
items. An example of an item is “I can ac-
tively search for the developments in my 
area of work” (alpha values ranging from 
0.72 to 0.88).
6. Career control  was measured with four 
items, a sample item being “I can make 
clear career plans” (alpha values ranging 
from 0.82 to 0.93).
Work-related self-efficacy  was measured 
with five items based on the criteria as for-
mulated by Bandura (2012). The items were 
reformulated for use in an occupational set-
ting. The items of this scale, as well of those of 
all scales below, were measured on a 5-point 
Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely dis-
agree) to 5 (completely agree). Similar scales 
based on these criteria have been shown to 
be positively related to well-being, stress 
appraisals, and social relations (Luszczynska, 
Gutiérrez-Doña, & Schwarzer, 2005). A sam-
ple item from this scale is “If difficult prob-
lems arise at work I know how to solve them” 
(alpha values ranging from 0.82 to 0.90). 
Resilience against setbacks  was mea-
sured with a four-item scale based on 
Brenninkmeijer, Cremer, and Blonk (2005). 
These items have been used in several 
studies related to the JOBS methodology 
(Brenninkmeijer et  al., 2005). The scale was 
adapted to be used in a career setting. An 
example item from this scale is “I would find 
a good solution if things would go wrong in 
my career” (alpha values ranging from 0.81 
to 0.90).
Career-related behaviors were measured with 
a self-constructed five-item scale. Example 
items from this scale include “I actively shape 
my career” and “I search for possibilities to 
positively influence my career” (alpha values 
ranging from 0.85 to 0.95). This scale was pos-
itively related to the other study variables, but 
no extremely high values were found, thereby 
supporting the validity of this scale.
Perceived employability was measured with 
a Dutch version of the eight-item scale of 
De Cuyper and De Witte (2008). This scale

112 participants, 49.1 percent scored the 
intervention “very good,” 47.3 percent scored 
it “good,” 3.6 percent scored it “neutral,” and 
none of the participants scored it “bad” or 
“very bad.” In Sample 2, the results were com-
parable (M = 4.11, SD = 0.55). Of the 71 par-
ticipants, 50.0 percent rated the intervention 
“very good,” 47.2 percent scored it “good,” 
and 2.8 percent scored it “neutral.” Again, 
none of the participants scored the program 
“bad” or “very bad.” These results indicate 
that the CareerSKILLS intervention was 
highly appreciated by the participants.

against setbacks. The interaction effects were 
significant and in favor of the intervention 
group, thereby supporting Hypothesis 2. 
Main effects of time and group were found 
for perceived employability and career-
related behaviors. Moreover, the interaction 
effects were significant, supporting 
Hypotheses 3. Finally, there was a significant 
effect of time and a significant Time × 
Condition interaction effect in favor of the 
intervention group for work engagement, 
but no significant effects were found for 
emotional exhaustion. These results support 
Hypothesis 4.
Because Sample 2 consisted of  employees 
from different age categories, we ran addi-
tional analyses to examine whether there 
were differences in the effectiveness of 
CareerSKILLS between the group younger 
than 30 years (identical to Sample 1) and 
older than 30 years. None of the outcome 
variables developed differently for the two 
groups. The only one that came very close 
to being significant was the group × out-
come variable interaction effect of perceived 
employability ( F(1, 111) = 3.88, p = .051). 
Hence, CareerSKILLS was generally as effec-
tive for participants older than 30 years as it 
was for those younger than 30 years.
Discussion
Our study aimed to investigate the effective-
ness of the CareerSKILLS program, an inter-
vention aiming to stimulate career self-
management behaviors and work-related 
well-being of young employees. This inter-
vention was developed based on the princi-
ples of the JOBS program (Caplan et al., 1989). 
Its exercises are based on the concept of career 
competencies (Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, 
Huibers, et al., 2013), and its working ingredi-
ents are self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997), and 
inoculation against setbacks (Meichenbaum, 
1985).
CareerSKILLS distinguishes itself from 
other career development interventions in 
several ways. First, the CareerSKILLS program 
focuses primarily on young employees who 
are starting their career, a group that has 
received relatively little research attention so 
information about the correlations between 
the study variables can be obtained from the 
corresponding author.
CareerSKILLS Effectiveness 
in Sample 1
We found a significant main effect of time 
and group on all six career competencies (see 
Table III). More importantly, all six Time × 
Condition interaction effects were significant 
and were in the expected direction: the mean 
scores significantly increased in the interven-
tion group, but not in the control group, sup-
porting Hypothesis 1. There were significant 
main effects of time and group for work-
related self-efficacy and for resilience against 
setbacks. Moreover, the Time × Condition 
interaction effects were significant for both 
outcome variables, showing a significant 
increase in mean values for the intervention 
group, but not for the control group. These 
findings confirm Hypothesis 2. Significant 
main effects were also found of time and 
group for career-related behaviors and for per-
ceived employability. Both Time × Condition 
interaction effects were significant and in the 
expected direction, thereby supporting 
Hypothesis 3. Finally, for work engagement 
there was a significant effect of time and of 
group. There was also a significant Time × 
Group interaction effect in favor of the inter-
vention group. However, no significant effects 
were found for emotional exhaustion. These 
results support Hypothesis 4.
CareerSKILLS Effectiveness 
in Sample 2
The results in Sample 2 were similar to those 
in Sample 1 (see Table III). We found main 
effects of time for all six career competencies, 
demonstrating the positive increase of mean 
scores between T1 and T3. Significant main 
effects of group were also found, although 
the effects for self-profiling and work explo-
ration were only marginally significant. All 
six interaction effects were significant and in 
favor of the intervention group, thereby sup-
porting Hypothesis 1. We also found signifi-
cant main effects of time and group for 
work-related self-efficacy and resilience

In a quasi-
randomized control 
trial, we examined 
to what extent 
the intervention 
influenced career 
competencies, self-
efficacy, resilience 
against setbacks, 
career-related 
behaviors, perceived 
employability, 
work engagement, 
and emotional 
exhaustion.
career competencies (Hypothesis 1), in work-
related self-efficacy and resilience against set-
backs (Hypothesis 2), and in career-related 
behaviors and perceived employability 
(Hypothesis  3), compared with the control 
group. Moreover, there was a significant 
increase in the intervention group of work 
engagement, but no effect of emotional 
exhaustion, compared with the control group 
(Hypothesis 4). These results indicate that 
the CareerSKILLS intervention is beneficial 
both in enhancing career self-management 
and work-related well-being of young work-
ers. Overall, these results demonstrate the 
short-term effectiveness of the CareerSKILLS 
intervention for young employees with lower 
educational levels, and they build on previous 
work regarding well-being of young workers 
during the start of their careers (Akkermans 
et al., 2009; Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, Van 
den Bossche et al., 2013).
We cross-validated our results in a second, 
heterogeneous, independent sample consist-
ing of temporary employees in a reemploy-
ment program. The results in this second 
sample were also in line with our hypoth-
eses. We found a significant increase among 
participants of the program in their mastery 
of career competencies (Hypothesis 1), in 
self-efficacy and resilience against setbacks 
(Hypothesis 2), and in career-related behav-
iors and perceived employability (Hypothesis 
3), compared with the control group. We also 
found a significant increase in work engage-
ment, but no effect of emotional exhaustion 
(Hypothesis 4). In addition, we tested for pos-
sible age differences in the second sample. 
The results show that the intervention was 
equally effective for employees younger than 
30 years and those older than 30 years. These 
results provide additional support for the 
short-term effectiveness of the CareerSKILLS 
intervention, further solidifying the robust-
ness of the findings.
Theoretical Implications
Our findings have several theoretical implica-
tions. First, we provided additional support 
for the notion that career competencies are 
malleable and may therefore be an important 
far despite the many challenges they face in a 
brief period of time. Second, CareerSKILLS is 
an intervention program that focuses both on 
prevention of negative outcomes (e.g., under-
employment) and the promotion of posi-
tive outcomes (e.g., employability and work 
engagement). In this sense, it also bears simi-
larities to amplitive interventions (Ouweneel, 
Schaufeli, & Le Blanc, 2009), which specifi-
cally focus on stimulating positive outcomes 
for all employees, and to a strength-based 
approach (Hodges & Clifton, 2004), which 
centers around positive reinforce-
ment of the strengths that indi-
viduals possess, rather than their 
weaknesses. This may be espe-
cially important for our target 
group of young employees, as a 
recent study showed that career 
competencies may act similar to 
a personal resource in stimulat-
ing motivation and well-being 
(Akkermans, Schaufeli, et  al., 
2013). Third, CareerSKILLS aims 
to stimulate career development 
of all young employees, not only 
of specific “problem groups” (e.g., 
the unemployed or dropouts). 
Last but not least, we expanded 
the methodology of the JOBS pro-
gram, which has been shown to be 
effective in various empirical stud-
ies (e.g., Vinokur et al., 1995), with 
the concept of career competen-
cies (Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, 
Huibers, et al., 2013).
In a quasi-randomized control 
trial, we examined to what extent 
the intervention influenced 
career competencies, self-efficacy, 
resilience against setbacks, career-related 
behaviors, perceived employability, work 
engagement, and emotional exhaustion. We 
tested the intervention in two independent 
samples: one consisting of students who did 
extensive internships, and another consist-
ing of participants in a special reintegration 
program. The first sample was a homoge-
neous group of young employees with inter-
mediate vocational education. A significant 
increase was present in the mastery of all

learning, growth, and employability. This fur-
ther underlines the importance of combining 
research on job design and career develop-
ment (Hall & Las Heras, 2010).
Limitations and Suggestions 
for Future Research
A number of limitations and suggestions for 
future research need to be addressed. First, 
although our current results indicate that the 
effects of the CareerSKILLS intervention 
remain stable after six weeks, we only have a 
short-term measure of effectiveness. Burke 
and Hutchins (2007) emphasized that indi-
viduals need time and opportunity to absorb 
the content of interventions and to imple-
ment their new skills and knowledge in prac-
tice. According to these researchers, it would 
be important to use longer retention inter-
vals, preferably even more than one year, to 
ascertain the transfer effect of intervention 
designs. Because we developed the 
CareerSKILLS intervention to stimulate long-
term career development and well-being of 
young employees, it is important that the 
effectiveness of the intervention is also tested 
with a longer-term measure, for example, 
with a 12-month follow-up (e.g., Koivisto 
et al., 2007). 
A second important limitation is that 
our study included only self-report mea-
sures. Although the value of subjective mea-
sures with respect to work-related themes 
of research is increasingly emphasized (e.g., 
De Cuyper,  Van der Heijden, & De Witte, 
2011), it only provides limited insight into 
the actual effectiveness of the CareerSKILLS 
intervention. This is also a limitation of the 
CCQ that we used to assess career compe-
tencies as it measures perceived competency 
mastery. An important addition to our cur-
rent study would be to investigate objec-
tive career outcomes of the participants, for 
example, objective employability measures, 
such as the actual number of job shifts and/or 
internal promotions. Moreover, it would be 
interesting to have supervisors and coworkers 
fill out the CCQ to gain a better understand-
ing of the actual career competency mas-
tery of employees. We therefore believe it is 
building block of career development inter-
ventions. Moreover, and in line with 
Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et al. 
(2013), we showed that career competencies 
and perceived employability are closely and 
positively related, which indicates that career 
competencies may be important in fostering 
employability of the young workforce. These 
results also further support the validity of 
the framework of career competencies that 
was brought forward by Akkermans, 
Brenninkmeijer, Huibers, et al. (2013).
Second, we heed the call of Vuori et  al. 
(2011) in developing and empirically test-
ing a career development intervention. Our 
results demonstrate that an intervention 
using the psychological concept of career 
competencies (Akkermans, Brenninkmeijer, 
Huibers, et  al., 2013) in combination with 
the active working ingredients of self-efficacy 
(Bandura, 1997) and inoculation against set-
backs (Meichenbaum, 1985), and the five 
components for effective group interventions 
used in the JOBS program (Price et al., 1998), 
may be an effective means of activating young 
workers to proactively manage their career. 
This may be especially effective when com-
bined with the active learning processes that 
are part of the intervention (Caplan et  al., 
1997). As such, this study also further sup-
ports the effectiveness of the JOBS methodol-
ogy. Moreover, our results imply that gaining 
career competencies, being self-efficacious, 
and being resilient against potential obsta-
cles may be important concepts in the career 
development of young workers who are start-
ing their career.
A third implication concerns the effect of 
the CareerSKILLS program on work engage-
ment, but not on emotional exhaustion. In 
line with Akkermans, Schaufeli, et al. (2013), 
this indicates that career competencies are 
uniquely related to motivation as opposed to 
strain. Moreover, these findings support the 
assumption that career competencies are not 
exclusively related to career development, 
but also to employee well-being (Akkermans, 
Schaufeli, et  al., 2013). Career competency 
development may therefore contribute to the 
development of so-called “smart jobs” (Hall 
& Las Heras, 2010), as they can stimulate

The CareerSKILLS 
intervention offers 
an opportunity for 
employees to gain 
additional career 
competencies and 
increased self-
confidence and 
resilience against

addition to HR and career guidance programs 
in organizations. An added advantage is that 
it is organized in groups, which means that 
teams or groups of colleagues could poten-
tially be trained simultaneously. In addition, 
CareerSKILLS may be used as an organiza-
tional socialization tactic for newcomers (Saks 
& Gruman, 2011). This is a practical and 
effective way of intervening that also fosters 
the transfer and implementation in daily life 
because participants can support each other 
like they do during the program. HR depart-
ments could also implement the CareerSKILLS 
program when faced with downsizing or out-
placement programs. For these reasons, the 
CareerSKILLS intervention could be inte-
grated with career-related HR practices in 
organizations.
The CareerSKILLS intervention can 
also be a valuable addition to career guid-
ance programs in intermediate vocational 
schools. Training students in career com-
petencies and stimulating their self-con-
fidence and resilience in self-managing 
their career may provide them with a solid 
basis to complete the school-to-work tran-
sition in a healthy and effective way. The 
CareerSKILLS program may be incorporated 
in curricula of schools, thereby stimulating 
students’ preparedness for managing their 
career and supporting them in gaining rel-
evant competencies.
Conclusion
This study provides an empirical intervention 
study that attempts to bridge a gap between 
career development and organizational 
behavior. Specifically, we focus on increasing 
the career self-management and well-being of 
young employees through the mastery of 
career competencies, and through increasing 
their self-efficacy and resilience against 
potential setbacks. This career development 
intervention can contribute both to prevent-
ing negative outcomes such as underemploy-
ment, and to promoting positive outcomes 
such as engagement and employability. 
Therefore, the CareerSKILLS program can be 
valuable for all young employees, making it 
broadly applicable in educational settings 
important to include these kinds of objective 
outcome measures in future studies on the 
CareerSKILLS program in order to investigate 
the actual effects it has for career develop-
ment of young employees.
Although CareerSKILLS was primarily 
developed for young employees, in order 
to further validate the effective-
ness of the program it would be 
interesting to test it among other 
groups of employees. As our find-
ings in Sample 2 indicated that 
the program was equally effec-
tive for employees younger than 
30 years and older than 30 years, 
future studies may implement 
CareerSKILLS among older work-
ers to examine whether they would 
also experience enhanced career 
development and well-being after 
participating in the intervention. 
Moreover, as especially our second 
sample was rather small, it would 
be important to further validate 
our findings among larger groups 
of young workers as well.
Finally, to be most effec-
tive, interventions should focus 
simultaneously on the individ-
ual and the organization level 
(e.g., Sockoll, Kramer, & Bödeker, 
2008). It is therefore interesting 
to include employees’ organiza-
tions (schools and working orga-
nizations) in future intervention 
programs; for example, by train-
ing supervisors and managers to 
consolidate the changes in com-
petencies and behaviors (i.e., the transfer) of 
the participants.
Practical Implications
The CareerSKILLS intervention offers an 
opportunity for employees to gain additional 
career competencies and increased self-confi-
dence and resilience agains setbacks. It can 
also stimulate motivation at work, thereby 
providing the tools for long-term career self-
management and employee well-being. This
