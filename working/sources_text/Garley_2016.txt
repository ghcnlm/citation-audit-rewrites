Abstract 
Background: Malaria control interventions in most endemic countries have intensified in recent years and so there 
is a need for a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to measure progress and achievements. Providing 
programme and M&E officers with the appropriate skills is a way to strengthen malaria’s M&E systems and enhance 
information use for programmes’ implementation. This paper describes a recent effort in capacity strengthening for 
malaria M&E in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Methods: From 2010 to 2014, capacity-strengthening efforts consisted of organizing regional in-person workshops 
for M&E of malaria programmes for Anglophone and Francophone countries in SSA in collaboration with partners 
from Ghana and Burkina Faso. Open-sourced online courses were also available in English. A post-workshop assess-
ment was conducted after 5 years to assess the effects of these regional workshops and identify gaps in capacity.
Results: The regional workshops trained 181 participants from 28 countries from 2010 to 2014. Trained participants 
were from ministries of health, national malaria control and elimination programmes, non-governmental organiza-
tions, and development partners. The average score (%) for participants’ knowledge tests increased from pretest to 
posttest for Anglophone workshops (2011: 59 vs. 76, 2012: 41 vs. 63, 2013: 51 vs. 73; 2014: 50 vs. 74). Similarly, Franco-
phone workshop posttest scores increased, but were lower than Anglophone due to higher scores at pretest. (2011: 
70 vs. 76, 2012: 74 vs. 79, 2013: 61 vs. 68; 2014: 64 vs. 75). Results of the post-workshop assessment revealed that 
participants retained practical M&E knowledge and skills for malaria programs, but there is a need for a module on 
malaria surveillance adapted to the pre-elimination context.
Conclusion: The workshops were successful because of the curriculum content, facilitation quality, and the engage-
ment of partner institutions with training expertise. Results from the post-workshop assessment will guide the 
curriculum’s development and restructuring for the next phase of workshops. Country-specific malaria M&E capacity 
needs assessments may also inform this process as countries reduce malaria burden.

Background
In recent years, heightened commitments from govern -
ments and several partners to eliminate malaria have 
resulted in increased funding globally for malaria [1, 2]. 
Governments and funding partners are both requesting 
robust evidence for the health returns on their invest
-
ments. To generate such evidence, countries need to 
have a solid information system in place for monitoring 
malaria interventions and measuring achievements [3, 
4]. However, there are important challenges in the per
-
formance of existing information systems at the country 
level, particularly in their ability to provide timely and 
quality data to inform malaria programme implementa
-
tion [1, 2, 5, 6].
At the global level, donors often use survey-based data 
to evaluate the impact of their programmes, in terms of 
coverage, morbidity, and mortality [7, 8]. These data are 
generally robust and reliable over time. However, these 
data are not timely and do not provide the granular level 
of detail that programme managers need to monitor 
programme implementation. This situation can create 
disconnect between various stakeholders regarding the 
status of programme implementation. Building capacity 
to collect, analyse, and use data from multiple informa
-
tion sources is a critical need within disease control pro -
grammes. There are different means to build this M&E 
capacity, including degree programmes, on-the-job train
-
ing, and short-term certificate courses [9–11]. This paper 
examines the importance of short-term training in build
-
ing capacity for M&E within National Malaria Control 
Programmes.
Degree training builds skills using a long-term 
approach, whereby individuals take multiple courses 
to complete a degree programme. However, the degree 
training approach is not always feasible for adult learn
-
ing due to high costs and the amount of time away from 
work needed to complete the degree [12, 13]. On-the-
job training through regular supportive supervision is a 
mentoring approach that involves direct contact between 
a supervisor and an individual, and this training builds 
skills on the job [14, 15]. However, this approach can also 
vary greatly depending on the level of support and the 
relationship between the supervisor and the individual.
Short courses (in person or online) are designed to 
build skills quickly through intensive short-term train
-
ing that usually lasts only a few weeks. This method 
trains many people in a short time by focusing on a nar
-
rowed topic. It is ideal for working professionals who 
need to build skills quickly but cannot leave their work 
for a longer-degree programme. Short courses often 
focus less on theory and include practical and applicable 
content and exercises that can be applied immediately 
to the job. Short courses are often packaged to be more 
affordable than lengthy degree training programmes and 
open-ended routine supervision [13, 16].
In 2009, a suggestion by the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) 
Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) 
initiated the idea of conducting a series of regional work
-
shops for M&E of malaria programmes to strengthen 
countries’ capacity in developing and implementing 
malaria M&E plans. Using the short-course approach, 
under the auspices of MERG with regional partners, 
regional malaria M&E workshops for Anglophone and 
Francophone countries in SSA were designed and imple
-
mented from 2010 to 2014. The aim was to improve the 
quality of data and information and to help guide pro
-
gramme implementation and thereby reduce the malaria 
burden and improve health (Fig. 1). After the workshops, 
participants were expected to return to their malaria pro
-
grammes and apply their new M&E knowledge and skills 
to improve their programmes’ active M&E plans and 
streamline the implementation of national plans.
This paper describes the process of implementing these 
workshops, highlights achievements, and discusses les
-
sons learned and new challenges.
Workshop implementation process
Implementing partners and target audience
Implementing partners were selected through a com -
petitive bidding process that included evaluating organ -
ization experience, personnel, logistic capacity, and 
budget. The University of Ghana, School of Public Health 
(UGSPH) in Accra, Ghana, was chosen to implement the 
Anglophone workshop in 2010. The Centre de Recherche 
en Santé de Nouna (CRSN) and the Centre de Recherche 
International en Santé (CRIS) were selected to imple
-
ment the Francophone workshop in Ouagadougou, Bur -
kina Faso, in 2011. Workshop objectives aimed to build 
upon existing regional resources and increase regional 
capacity for M&E of malaria by teaching participants the 
M&E fundamentals specified for malaria programmes 
while providing hands-on experience in designing malaria 
M&E plans.
The workshops targeted national- and subnational-level 
malaria personnel, especially those responsible for gath
-
ering, analysing, and using programme-related data. Also 
included were personnel from non-governmental organi
-
zations (NGOs), universities, and development partners, 
such as USAID and Global Fund, who are responsible for 
the oversight of malaria programmes, especially in the 
areas of reporting, monitoring, and evaluation.
Curriculum design
The curriculum was designed to meet the needs of pro -
gramme managers and fill the gaps in basic monitoring 
and evaluation skills at the programme level. Modules

were selected to provide practical tools and techniques 
that participants could apply to their current work. The 
curriculum focused on creating a good M&E plan and 
implementing it as a guide for malaria programmes. The 
curriculum was created in English and then translated to 
French after the 1st year for the Francophone countries. 
Over time, the content has been updated in line with 
the emerging needs for malaria control and addressing 
feedback from participants. These updates added new 
malaria interventions to stay abreast of new methods and 
tools used in the field. Facilitators from partner institu
-
tions contributed to the curriculum updates based on 
their expertise and experience. Table 1 describes the cur
-
riculum’s objectives and the benefits to participants by 
module.
Running the workshops
The workshops were 10-day courses at an academic insti-
tution. USAID/PMI provided core funding for curricu -
lum development, start-up costs, trainers’ training, and 
a few competitive annual fellowships. Participants paid 
their course fees and travel expenses. The Anglophone 
course took place at the UGSPH, while the Francophone 
course was held at the University of Ouagadougou, 
School of Medicine. Teaching approaches included ple
-
nary sessions, discussions, and a group project. Facili -
tators led individual and group exercises, such as case 
studies, hands-on data analysis, data presentation exer
-
cises, and fieldwork.
Group work was a significant component of the 
courses. Participants were divided into groups at the 
beginning of each workshop and assigned to use a step-
by-step approach in developing an M&E plan focused 
on a specific malaria control intervention. The groups 
developed problem statements, goals, and objectives; 
designed a conceptual framework; conducted strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis; 
chose relevant indicators for their specific malaria inter
-
vention; selected an evaluation method; and budgeted 
their M&E plan. Groups presented two progress reports 
and received feedback from peers and facilitators. On the 
last day of the workshop, each group presented an M&E 
plan.
Training materials were developed, taught, and 
updated annually by project staff and the local imple
-
menting universities: UGSPH, and CRSN/CRIS. In an 
effort to build capacity within the hosting institutions, 
each module was co-facilitated by one instructor from 
the implementing partner and another from the project 
staff. The number of modules taught by implementing 
partners gradually increased as staff became more com
-
fortable in conducting the sessions. In the 2010 Anglo -
phone course, five sessions were taught exclusively by 
project staff; however, by 2014, this was reduced to one 
session. In contrast, the number of sessions taught by 
UGSPH and in-country partners increased from 9 of 15 
sessions in 2010 to 8 of 11 in 2014. Similarly, the num

partners at the Francophone course increased from 11 of 
16 sessions in 2011–12 of 16 in 2014.
Workshop evaluation
Several evaluation tools were used to assess the work -
shops’ implementation and measure the knowledge 
gained by the participants. These tools included a module 
assessment form, a group work assessment form, and a 
workshop evaluation form [17, 18].
At the end of each module, the participants rated the 
quality of the content and the quality of the instruction 
on a scale of 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) using the module 
assessment form. Facilitators reviewed the evaluations 
daily and made necessary improvements based on sug
-
gestions for subsequent modules.
At the end of the workshop, the participants completed 
the workshop assessment form, which provided feed -
back on content, quality of facilitation, materials, train -
ing environment, relationships between participants, 
and group work. Findings from this assessment provided 
detailed information for a variety of future workshop 
improvements.
In 2014, a form was introduced for peer assessment of 
the group work. Peers assessed group work on presenta
-
tion quality, form, content, presenter explanations, and 
each group’s response to questions. Teamwork and gen
-
eral group organization were also evaluated. Scores were 
weighted gradually with the lowest weight assigned to the 
first presentation and the highest weight to the final pres
-
entation. Average scores were calculated and the winning 
group was recognized on the final day.
To assess knowledge gained, the participants took pre- 
and post-module knowledge tests on the first and last day 
of each workshop. These tests consisted of a series of 20 
multiple-choice questions on malaria M&E content in 
the workshop modules.
Overall post‑training assessment
In early 2015, the training team commissioned an inde -
pendent post-workshop assessment to assess the regional 
M&E capacity of malaria workshops from 2010 to 2014, 
identify gaps in capacity, and evaluate the effects of the 
regional training course. Specific objectives included 
assessing skill and knowledge retention; documenting the 
use of the skills and knowledge gained in the participants’ 
current work, and understanding how the workshop can 
be improved for future participants. The methodology 
included a document review of workshop materials, a lit
-
erature review, and the design of a survey protocol with 
specific surveys in French and English for participants 
who completed the workshop, their supervisors, and 
stakeholders interested in malaria M&E. One hundred 
and eighty-one workshop participants (120 Anglophones 
and 61 Francophones) and 40 supervisors (21 Anglo
-
phones and 19 Francophones) were identified and con -
tacted for an online survey, while 33 stakeholders were 
also contacted for an in-depth interview.
Workshop outputs
Participants trained
One hundred and eighty-one people were trained from 
2010 to 2014. Participants came from 28 countries, with 
the majority from Nigeria (36), Ghana (18), and Burkina 
Faso (16). Tanzania (13), Democratic Republic of Congo 
(10) and Uganda (10) also had high participation (see 
Fig.  2). All participants came from SSA, except for one 
participant from the United States. At the time of the 
workshops, 41  % of the participants trained were from 
non-governmental organizations, 27 % worked for a min
-
istry of health, and 22 % worked specifically for national 
malaria control and elimination programmes. Develop
-
ment partners, such as USAID and Global Fund, repre -
sented 8 % of participants trained.
Knowledge gained
Upon completion of the workshop, participants under -
stood fundamental concepts and practical approaches 
to the M&E of malaria programmes. They learned pro
-
grammatic applications of tools and data systems used 
to monitor and evaluate malaria programmes. The work
-
shops provided an opportunity for hands-on experience 
in developing M&E plans. The results of the pre- and 
post-tests conducted on the first and last days of the 
Fig. 2 Participants trained in malaria M&E through regional work-
shops by country, 2011–2014

workshop indicated the knowledge gained, and the aver -
age score was higher on the post-test compared to the 
pre-test for both Anglophone and Francophone work -
shops in all years (Table 2).
Quality of the workshops
The average score per year of quality of content was 
above 8.50, with the highest score of 9.21 in 2014 in the 
Francophone course. The Anglophone course showed 
improvement in the quality of content from an average 
score of 8.11 in 2010 to 8.74 in 2014. Similarly, the rat
-
ing of the quality of facilitation improved, regardless of 
the implementation of co-facilitation and partner-led 
facilitation.
Post‑workshop effects
The use of knowledge gained during the workshop was 
documented in six-month and one-year follow-up quali
-
tative surveys. The findings suggested that the M&E 
workshop contributed to, or helped, alumni in their 
work or research. Specific areas that participants noted 
included designing an M&E plan; defining and reporting 
indicators; using data for decision-making; and data col
-
lection, analysis, and feedback of data results. Workshop 
alumni also mentioned contributing to malaria indicator 
surveys (MIS) and impact evaluations.
Newly trained participants were admitted to a network 
of previously trained M&E professionals and invited to 
join the Roll Back Malaria M&E listserv [19]. These tools, 
moderated by MEASURE Evaluation, provide oppor
-
tunities for trained participants to share ideas after the 
workshop, participate in M&E-specific webinars, and col
-
laborate with others internationally in the field of M&E.
The success of these regional M&E malaria work -
shops has generated interest in country-specific work -
shops. These have taken place in Kenya (2011) and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (2013 and 2015). Other 
countries, including Burkina Faso, Liberia, Senegal, 
and Tanzania, have also expressed interest. In addition, 
regional workshops generated an interest in reaching 
more people through the development of an online M&E 
for the malaria course, which was launched in 2012. 
An open-sourced curriculum is also available online in 
English [20]. An online course will be launched in French 
in 2016 [21].
Results from the overall post-workshop assessment 
revealed that participants retained practical M&E knowl
-
edge and skills. One participant remarked, “Immediately 
after the workshop, I was part of a team that was assigned 
to review our project’s M&E plan…and most of my con
-
tributions to the process were based on what I learned 
from the workshop. To be specific, when it came to 
developing an indicator reference sheet/matrix, we actu
-
ally used the template developed by my workshop’s group 
members as an example. ”
There was positive feedback about the workshops from 
participants, supervisors, and stakeholders related to the 
relevance of the course content, application of knowledge 
and skills gained, improvement of overall M&E capacity, 
and change in perception/support of M&E activities.
“We used to have some discrepancies in data and 
reporting, but using an online data management software 
along with training of the staff in M&E, after having the 
training, the quality of data has been improved remark
-
ably in data collection and reporting to mention few. ”
There was a willingness to continue supporting the 
regional M&E capacity of malaria workshops “…espe -
cially for some of us who live in countries that do not 
have institutions that provide such courses, for those who 
cannot afford to pay school fees, and for the convenience 
of being able to do it at my own time. This combination 
makes this platform an excellent initiative. ”
Further findings identified a need for new modules to 
be created, particularly malaria surveillance and evalua
-
tion methods, to add more value to the course and iden -
tify the changing needs in malaria programmes. There 
was also an urgent need to establish a more robust post-
training follow-up programme and analyse the partici
-
pants’ costs associated with the course.
Discussion
This paper documents efforts to build capacity within 
NMCPs for malaria M&E through workshops for 
malaria-endemic countries in SSA from 2010 to 2014. 
The workshops contributed to training a significant 
number of health professionals involved in malaria

control and elimination efforts who are now contribut -
ing to improve malaria M&E in their respective coun -
tries. The design, content, and implementation process 
of these workshops facilitated the buy-in and interest 
from countries and key partners involved in the malaria 
control efforts at the national, regional, and global 
levels.
Establishing strong country partnerships is essen
-
tial to the success of capacity building interventions. 
UGSPH and CRSN assembled a cohesive group of 
experienced facilitators to teach the workshops and 
created links between institutions inside and outside 
host countries. Facilitators at the Anglophone course 
were from UGSPH, the Ghana National Malaria Con
-
trol Programme, the Ghana Health Service, the World 
Health Organization’s country office, and the Nogu
-
chi Medical Centre. Similarly, the Francophone course 
included facilitators from Centre de Recherche en Santé 
de Nouna (CRSN), Centre de Recherche Internationale 
pour la Santé (CRIS)/University of Ouagadougou, Cen
-
tre Muraz, the Burkina Faso National Malaria Control 
Programme, and the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health. 
Each facilitator brought extensive years of M&E experi
-
ence to enrich the curriculum.
The importance of regular communication with pre -
vious workshop cohorts to guide future participation 
is vital to the success of forthcoming capacity-building 
workshops. This communication has generated new 
country-specific M&E trainings to improve M&E malaria 
capacity at the national level. Course alumni have been 
actively involved as facilitators and key promoters of 
these courses. Alumni have also contributed to impact 
evaluations and other M&E malaria control and pre-
elimination activities at the country level upon comple
-
tion of the workshops.
Though the success of this capacity-building interven -
tion can be measured individually through pre- and post- 
workshop tests, evaluations, and follow-up surveys, it is 
challenging to measure the contribution to the improve
-
ment of country-level malaria M&E system. Workshop 
alumni changed positions; completed additional training 
courses; and worked in multiple programmes like HIV/
AIDS, tuberculosis, and others. This further complicates 
measurements of the contributions of this one malaria 
capacity-building intervention to the improvement of 
countries’ malaria information systems and health infor
-
mation systems overall. However from the alumni feed -
back, the skills gained from the training are being applied 
to improve data quality and reporting.
While this workshop model trained 181  M&E profes
-
sionals from 28 countries on the fundamentals needed to 
improve their respective country-level malaria information 
systems, capacity gaps were still identified. Francophone 
participants had a more difficult time securing funding 
than Anglophone participants. Workshop costs were too 
high for the majority of participants to self-fund. In 2014, 
the courses cost $3000 plus travel for the Anglophone 
course and $3870 for the Francophone course. These 
costs included tuition, course materials, housing, and 
breakfast and lunch for the duration of the workshop, 
and they were designed to provide a small margin of 
profit to support partner institutions. Although, a few fel
-
lowships are available every year, most participants had 
to rely on a sponsor. The length of the workshop is also in 
question, as there is not consensus on what is the optimal 
training length to learn and retain the training materials. 
Workshop management costs were linked to only one 
funding source, which has fiscal and project year limita
-
tions. Regional university venues provided an established 
professional learning environment, but infrastructure 
issues were abundant.
Conclusion
The results of the post-workshop assessment provide 
a good way forward for the future of these workshops 
[22]. Recommendations from participants, supervisors, 
and stakeholders will guide the next phase of work
-
shops in the curriculum development and restructuring 
of the workshops. Details are currently under discus
-
sion, including revamping the current M&E fundamen -
tals curriculum to include optional tracks on targeted 
M&E topics. Such topics may include data presentation, 
interpretation, and use; data analysis; surveillance; and 
impact evaluation. Additional ideas include contributing 
to a malaria module for the anticipated one-year Master’s 
programme in M&E at the University of Ghana. How
-
ever, country malaria M&E capacity needs assessments 
may be necessary to inform this process, especially as 
countries shift from malaria control to pre-elimination to 
elimination. Finally, the sustainability of these workshops 
and any capacity-building activities in malaria M&E will 
depend on the availability of funding and countries being 
able to tap into existing funding mechanisms.
