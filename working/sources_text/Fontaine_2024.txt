Abstract 
Background Implementation strategies targeting individual healthcare professionals and teams, such as audit 
and feedback, educational meetings, opinion leaders, and reminders, have demonstrated potential in promoting 
evidence-based nursing practice. This systematic review examined the effects of the 19 Cochrane Effective Prac-
tice and Organization Care (EPOC) healthcare professional-level implementation strategies on nursing practice 
and patient outcomes.
Methods A systematic review was conducted following the Cochrane Handbook, with six databases searched 
up to February 2023 for randomized studies and non-randomized controlled studies evaluating the effects of EPOC 
implementation strategies on nursing practice. Study selection and data extraction were performed in Covidence. 
Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted in RevMan, while studies not eligible for meta-analysis were synthe-
sized narratively based on the direction of effects. The quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE.
Results Out of 21,571 unique records, 204 studies (152 randomized, 52 controlled, non-randomized) enrolling 36,544 
nurses and 340,320 patients were included. Common strategies (> 10% of studies) were educational meetings, educa-
tional materials, guidelines, reminders, audit and feedback, tailored interventions, educational outreach, and opinion 
leaders. Implementation strategies as a whole improved clinical practice outcomes compared to no active inter-
vention, despite high heterogeneity. Group and individual education, patient-mediated interventions, reminders, 
tailored interventions and opinion leaders had statistically significant effects on clinical practice outcomes. Individual 
education improved nurses’ attitude, knowledge, perceived control, and skills, while group education also influenced 
perceived social norms. Although meta-analyses indicate a small, non-statistically significant effect of multifaceted 
versus single strategies on clinical practice, the narrative synthesis of non-meta-analyzed studies shows favorable

outcomes in all studies comparing multifaceted versus single strategies. Group and individual education, as well 
as tailored interventions, had statistically significant effects on patient outcomes.
Conclusions Multiple types of implementation strategies may enhance evidence-based nursing practice, 
though effects vary due to strategy complexity, contextual factors, and variability in outcome measurement. 
Some evidence suggests that multifaceted strategies are more effective than single component strategies. Effects 
on patient outcomes are modest. Healthcare organizations and implementation practitioners may consider employ-
ing multifaceted, tailored strategies to address local barriers, expand the use of underutilized strategies, and assess 
the long-term impact of strategies on nursing practice and patient outcomes.

Contributions to the literature
• This is the first systematic review consolidating evi -
dence on the effects of the 19 Cochrane Effective Prac -
tice and Organization of Care (EPOC) healthcare pro -
fessional-level implementation strategies on nursing 
practice and patient outcomes.
• It identifies effective strategies such as educational 
meetings and materials, opinion leaders, strategies tai -
lored to context-specific barriers and facilitators, and 
reminders.
• It illustrates the effects of strategies on determinants of 
nurses’ behaviors, including attitude, perceived behav -
ioral control, and social norms.
• It identifies the need for more high-quality studies eval-
uating underutilized strategies such as local consensus 
processes, patient-reported outcome measures, and 
continuous quality improvement, especially in low- and 
middle-income countries.
Background
Nurses, comprising 59% of the global healthcare work -
force, play a pivotal role in delivering both autonomous 
and collaborative care across the spectrum of health -
care services [1, 2]. Their contributions are essential for 
achieving the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Devel -
opment Goals (SDGs), particularly in ensuring healthy 
lives and promoting well-being for people of all ages [3, 
4]. Nurses are indispensable in providing comprehensive 
primary healthcare [5], ensuring quality care, and main -
taining patient safety through clinical decision-making 
[6]. Given their central role in healthcare delivery, pro -
moting the adoption of evidence-based practices among 
nurses is a global imperative to enhance patient outcomes 
and advance health equity [7, 8]. The range of nursing 
practices is vast and can include administering medica -
tion, assessing illnesses, conducting tests and screenings, 
documenting care, practicing hand hygiene and other 
infection prevention measures, offering vaccinations, and 
providing counseling and advice on health behaviors [9].
The successful adoption and sustained use of evidence-
based practices by nurses is influenced by a multitude of 
factors spanning individual, sociocultural, and environ -
mental levels [9–13], as documented in implementation 
science determinant frameworks such as the Theoreti -
cal Domains Framework (TDF) [14]. These factors can 
either hinder or facilitate implementation and encompass 
challenges such as lack of knowledge, unfavorable social 
norms, workflow or process issues, ineffective teamwork 
or leadership, and inadequate institutional support [9–
13, 15]. Implementation science has generated a wealth of 
evidence on strategies that can overcome these multilevel 
barriers, fostering behavior change and promoting the 
adoption of best practices across various clinical contexts 
[16–18]. Implementation strategies—the specific meth -
ods/actions to promote the adoption of evidence-based 
practices—aim to produce change in nurses’ behaviors or 
the clinical environments in which they operate, or both 
[19–21].
Implementation strategy taxonomies have been devel -
oped to characterize intervention components aimed 
at promoting evidence uptake, including the Cochrane 
Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Tax -
onomy [22]. The EPOC Taxonomy includes 19 profes -
sional implementation strategies, targeting individual 
healthcare professionals and team behaviors, including 
audit and feedback, clinical practice guidelines, commu -
nities of practice, educational materials, local opinion 
leaders, printed educational materials, and reminders 
[22]. Multifaceted strategies, or implementation inter -
ventions, combine several of these strategies to address 
multiple barriers to implementation simultaneously [23, 
24]. Investigating the effectiveness of multifaceted ver -
sus single component strategies is crucial for identifying 
the most efficient methods to promote evidence-based

practices, optimizing resource use, and enhancing patient 
outcomes [23].
Studies examining the effects of implementation 
strategies show small to moderate  impacts on chang -
ing health professionals’ behaviors, with few providing 
evidence of a significant change in patient outcomes 
[25]. Systematic reviews have investigated the effects 
of audit and feedback [17], local opinion leaders [26], 
printed educational materials [27], strategies leveraging 
information and communication technologies [28– 32], 
and reminders [33] on professional practice and patient 
outcomes. Specifically in nursing, two recent system -
atic reviews explored the effects of implementation 
strategies on the uptake of clinical practice guidelines 
by nurses and demonstrated positive effects on nurs -
ing practice and patient outcomes [34, 35]. However, 
to our knowledge, no systematic review and meta-
analysis has been conducted to consolidate evidence 
on the effects of the full range of EPOC healthcare 
professional-level implementation strategies on nurses’ 
practice and patient outcomes. Furthermore, no pre -
vious review has examined quantitatively the effects 
of implementation strategies on key determinants of 
nurses’ behaviors, such as attitudes (including beliefs 
about consequences), knowledge, intentions, perceived 
behavioral control (including beliefs about capabili -
ties), skills, and perceived social norms, as outlined in 
the TDF [14]. These determinants are particularly sig -
nificant as they represent core elements of many estab -
lished behavioral theories and frameworks [36], making 
them crucial for understanding and driving clinical 
practice change among nurses.
Objective and research questions
The objective of this systematic review and meta-
analysis was to assess the effects of healthcare profes -
sional-level implementation strategies, as defined in the 
EPOC Taxonomy [22], on nurses’ clinical practice and 
patient outcomes. We aimed to address the following 
questions:
1. What are the effects of implementation strategies on 
compliance with desired clinical practice in nurses 
(primary outcome) and patient outcomes (secondary 
outcome)?
2. What are the effects of implementation strategies on 
six key determinants of nurses’ behavior in clinical 
practice, including attitudes, intentions, knowledge, 
perceived behavioral control, perceived social norms, 
and skills (secondary outcomes)?
3. What are the effects of multifaceted implementation 
strategies compared to single implementation strate -
gies on compliance with desired clinical practice in 
nurses and patient outcomes?
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted 
based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews 
of Interventions [37] and is reported in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (see Additional 
file 1) [38].
Protocol and registration
The protocol was registered at the International Prospec -
tive Register of Systematic Reviews on 5/01/19 (PROS -
PERO CRD42019130446) and can be found online [39]. 
No changes have been made to the review methods since 
the protocol’s registration.
Search strategy and eligibility criteria
A search strategy was developed in collaboration with 
a Research Librarian using controlled vocabulary (e.g., 
MeSH terms) and keywords relating to implementa -
tion strategies, nurses, and study designs. Searches were 
undertaken in CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, 
PubMed and Web of Science for literature published 
between database inception until February 26, 2023 (see 
Additional file  2). Other sources searched to identify 
additional relevant citations included the reference lists 
of included studies and relevant systematic reviews found 
through the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
and Google Scholar.
We included studies conducted with all types of nurses 
(e.g., registered nurses, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse 
specialists, licensed practical nurses) across any clini -
cal setting. Studies were excluded if more than 10% of 
the sample consisted of other healthcare professionals 
or if results specific to nurses were not reported. Studies 
focusing on nursing students were excluded. Implemen -
tation strategies were defined as methods or techniques 
to promote the initial adoption and sustained use of 
evidence-based interventions, practices and programs 
[22]. Eligible studies were required to include at least 
one of the 19 healthcare professional-level implemen -
tation strategies outlined in the EPOC Taxonomy (see 
Table 1) [22]. Studies of financial interventions, patient-
oriented organizational interventions, structural organi -
zational interventions, and regulatory interventions were 
considered out of scope. The review allowed for studies 
with all types of comparators or usual care. Studies had 
to report either an objective measure of nurses’ practice, 
such as clinical interventions reported in patients’ medi -
cal files or the number of tests ordered, or a subjective

measure, such as self-reported performance of clinical 
interventions. Studies which focused solely on determi -
nants of nurses’ practice were excluded. In terms of study 
designs, the review included all types of randomized 
studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 
cluster randomized trials (CRTs) and stepped wedge 
CRTs. We also included non-randomized controlled 
studies (NRCS). Cross-sectional studies, observational 
studies, and case reports were excluded. Only published 
peer-reviewed articles were included to allow for detailed 
review of intervention components; conference abstracts, 
dissertations and theses were excluded.
Selection of studies
Identified records were imported into EndNote X8 [40] 
and duplicates were removed. The remaining records 
were imported into the Covidence software [41] for 
screening where additional duplicates were removed 
automatically. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were 
screened in duplicate in Covidence for eligibility by two 
reviewers with conflicts resolved through discussion or 
moderation of a third reviewer.
Data extraction
All data were extracted in duplicate in Covidence by two 
reviewers with conflicts resolved through discussion or 
moderation of a third reviewer. Data were extracted for 
study, participant, and intervention characteristics (e.g., 
strategies in each study arm according to the EPOC Tax -
onomy), as well as our primary and secondary outcomes, 
into a pre-piloted and standardized data extraction form 
(Microsoft Excel for Office 365). All corresponding study 
authors were contacted by email to clarify study details 
and to obtain additional study characteristics and results 
data. Two reminder emails were sent to authors who did 
not respond to the initial request.
Assessment of risk of bias
For RCTs, risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane 
Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials [42]. For 
CRTs, risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane RoB 2 
tool for CRTs [42]. For NRCS, risk of bias was assessed 
with the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of 
Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool [43]. If a single study 
reported multiple outcomes relevant to the review, risk of 
bias was assessed for each outcome. RCTs were ranked as 
having low risk, some concerns, or high risk of bias across 
five domains, and the overall risk of bias was derived. 
CRTs were ranked as having low risk, some concerns, or 
high risk of bias across six domains, and the overall risk 
of bias was derived. NRCS were ranked as having a low, 
moderate, serious, or critical risk of bias across seven 
domains, and the overall risk of bias was derived. Two 
reviewers assessed risk of bias independently, with con -
flicts resolved through discussion.
Measures of intervention effect
All continuous and dichotomous outcomes related to 
clinical practice were expressed in terms of compliance 
with the desired practice or process of care completed by 
a nurse. In cases where studies reported both dichoto -
mous and continuous measures for the same targeted 
behavior, we extracted and conducted separate analyses 
for each type of measure. We prioritized the extraction 
of individual clinical practice measures over summary or 
composite measures whenever the former were available.
In situations where the intervention aimed to reduce a 
targeted behavior to align more closely with established 
guidelines, we inverted the outcome data for both con -
tinuous and dichotomous measures to ensure a consist -
ent direction of effect and interpretation across studies. 
When a study measured multiple clinical practice out -
comes, we selected the outcome identified as the primary 
outcome by the study authors. If the primary outcome 
was not specified, we extracted the first outcome listed in 
the results section.
Additional continuous and dichotomous outcomes 
extracted, where available, included nurses’ attitudes 
(encompassing beliefs about consequences), defined 
broadly as emotional and evaluative responses to a clini -
cal behavior; intention, defined as readiness to perform 
a clinical behavior; knowledge, defined as the aware -
ness and understanding of specific facts, techniques, 
or processes that affect the clinical behavior; perceived 
behavioral control (encompassing beliefs about capabili -
ties, self-efficacy), defined broadly as nurses’ perception 
of their ability to perform a clinical behavior; perceived 
social norms (encompassing social influences), defined 
broadly as nurses’ perception about the normative expec-
tations of others regarding a clinical behavior; and skills, 
defined as the practical abilities to perform a clinical 
behavior. We also extracted continuous and dichotomous 
outcomes related to patient health, defined as patient 
health status, reduction in symptoms, and other health 
improvements reasonably attributable to the nursing care 
provided.
For outcomes assessed at multiple time points, we 
selected data from the longest follow-up period. In the 
case of cross-over studies, we used data from the first 
period only due to the risk of carryover effects.
Data analysis
Where data were available, we performed DerSimonian 
and Laird random-effects meta-analyses of the primary
<<<PAGE=7>>>

Fontaine et al. Implementation Science           (2024) 19:68 
 
(clinical practice) or secondary outcomes (patient out -
comes; nurses’ attitudes, intentions, knowledge, per -
ceived control, perceived social norms, and skills) across 
various intervention categorizations outlined in Table  1. 
We synthesized the pooled estimate of studies in which 
the implementation strategy was present vs. not present 
(e.g., audit and feedback in the intervention arm [IA] vs. 
no active intervention or another implementation strat -
egy in the control arm [CA]). We also synthesized the 
pooled estimate of studies comparing directly a multifac -
eted strategy to a single strategy.
For dichotomous outcomes, a pooled odds ratio (OR) 
with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in 
Review Manager Web (RevMan Web) Version 7.7.0 [44] 
using the proportion of people with each outcome of 
interest. A fixed continuity correction of 0.5 was applied 
where there was a 0 cell in calculating ORs. For continu -
ous outcomes, we calculated the standardized mean 
difference (SMD) by using the difference between the 
post-test means, divided by the pooled standard devia -
tion (SD) in RevMan Web since studies used a wide 
range of outcome measures for diverse constructs and 
targeted behaviors. Missing SDs were obtained, when 
possible, by using CIs or standard errors in calculations 
detailed in the Cochrane Handbook [37]. For the CRTs 
included, we conducted analyses adjusting for clustering 
with the design effect when possible. The design effect 
was calculated using the intracluster correlation coeffi -
cient (ICC), the number of clusters and the average sam -
ple size of each cluster [37]. Stepped-wedge CRTs were 
only included for descriptive purposes and were not 
used in the analysis due to the inability to adjust for time 
effects. For studies with multiple intervention groups, 
we included each pairwise comparison relevant to this 
review separately, but with shared control groups divided 
out approximately evenly among the comparisons [37]. 
Missing data regarding study and intervention character -
istics, as well as results, were not imputed. Missing data 
regarding ICCs were imputed based on the median ICC 
observed in the extracted data. Two-sided p values of less 
than 0.05 were deemed to be statistically significant.
In addition to the quantitative analyses, we conducted a 
narrative synthesis to summarize and interpret the find -
ings from studies that could not be included in the meta-
analysis due to missing data, the nature of the outcome, 
or the nature of the comparison. As recommended in 
the Cochrane Handbook [37], we used the direct of the 
effects to synthesize findings narratively.
Tables were created to present the characteristics of 
included studies, the effects of implementation strate -
gies on both primary and secondary outcomes, and the 
effects of implementation strategies on clinical practice 
outcomes across strata for the primary comparison.
Risk of bias judgments for each extracted outcome 
were summarized by domain using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I, 
and presented through risk of bias graphs and summaries 
with the risk of bias visualization tool (robvis) [45].
Subgroup analysis, investigation of heterogeneity 
and non-reporting bias
We assessed heterogeneity across studies using the 
I2 statistic (I 2  of less than 25% = low heterogeneity; I2 
25–75% = moderate heterogeneity; I2 of more than 
75% = high heterogeneity) and by visually examining 
forest plots to explore the range of effect sizes for com -
parisons of interest.  We investigated heterogeneity by 
stratifying the meta-analysis for our first comparison 
(i.e., any implementation strategy versus no active inter -
vention) based on the study design, the study setting, the 
targeted clinical behavior in nurses, and the intervention 
(i.e., implementation strategy group).  We assessed non-
reporting bias with funnel plots for our primary outcome.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies 
with unclear to high risk of bias to assess their potential 
impact on study outcomes.
Assessment of the certainty of the evidence and summary 
of findings
Two reviewers assessed the quality of evidence inde -
pendently for each outcome using the five domains of 
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel -
opment, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach [46] in the 
GRADEpro GDT software [47]: risk of bias, inconsist -
ency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. A 
third reviewer helped resolve any discrepancies in the 
assessments. Risk of bias was assessed by the percentage 
of studies evaluated as low risk of bias in a given com -
parison (not serious > 50% studies, serious 21–50%, very 
serious ≤ 20%). The certainty of evidence was rated for 
each outcome as “very low, ” “low, ” “moderate, ” or “high. ” 
A table was created to present an overview of effects and 
the certainty of evidence for clinical practice and patient 
outcomes, and summary of findings tables were created 
for all comparisons and outcomes.
Results
Results of the search and included studies
We identified 30,134 records from bibliographical data -
bases and 39 from other sources, resulting in 21,602 
unique records (see Fig.  1). Out of 837 records assessed 
for eligibility, 204 studies were included: 152 randomized 
studies and 52 controlled, non-randomized studies,
<<<PAGE=8>>>
Page 8 of 31Fontaine et al. Implementation Science           (2024) 19:68 
enrolling 36,544 nurses (reported in 161 studies) and 
340,320 patients (reported in 88 studies). All correspond-
ing authors were contacted, and a total of 78 authors 
(38%) responded to requests for additional data. Out of 
the 204 studies included in the review, 160 contributed 
data to the meta-analyses for our primary outcome (com-
pliance with desired clinical practice) and 44 were syn -
thesized narratively.
Characteristics of included studies
A summary of the characteristics of included studies is 
presented in Table  2. The majority were randomized 
studies (152 studies, 75%), including 96 CRTs (47%), 51 
RCTs (25%), and 5 stepped-wedge CRTs (2%), involv -
ing a total of 30,473 nurses and 323,986 patients. Non-
randomized studies accounted for 52 studies (25%), 
including 38 non-randomized controlled trials (19%), 
13 non-randomized cluster-controlled trials (6%), and 
1 controlled time series study (< 1%), involving 6,071 
nurses and 16,334 patients. Most studies were conducted 
in hospital settings, particularly inpatient or emergency 
departments (139 studies; 68%). Primary care or general 
practice settings comprised 25 studies (12%), and nurs -
ing homes accounted for 21 studies (10%). Other settings 
included community health centers, homecare, hospital 
outpatient settings, public health units and skilled nurs -
ing facilities. In terms of country income status, most 
studies were conducted in high-income countries (160 
studies, 78%), followed by upper-middle-income coun -
tries (37 studies, 18%), and a small number in lower-mid -
dle-income (7 studies, 3%) and low-income countries (1 
study, < 1%). The studies targeted various clinical behav -
iors, with the most common focus on multiple behaviors 
(48 studies, 24%). Common behaviors included: pro -
viding counseling and advice (29 studies, 14%), infec -
tion prevention and control practices (26 studies, 13%), 
assessing and diagnosing illness (26 studies, 13%), admin-
istering medication (14 studies, 7%), documenting care 
(10 studies, 5%), and coordinating care (10 studies, 5%). 
Behaviors targeted in less than 5% of studies included 
testing and screening, managing physical restraints, man-
aging symptoms, managing care equipment, prescribing, 
vaccinating, and reporting clinical incidents. Additional 
file 3 presents the characteristics of all included studies. 
Additional file 4 presents the excluded articles at full text 
assessment stage and reasons for exclusion.
Risk of bias across included studies
We summarized the decisions regarding individual 
domains within the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-I 
in the risk of bias summary (see Fig. 2). Overall, for CRTs, 
the risk of bias for all outcome assessments (N = 227 from 
96 CRTs and 5 stepped-wedge CRTs) was distributed as 
follows: 50% were assessed as low risk, 29% had some 
concerns, and 21% were considered high risk. For RCTs 
(N = 127 outcome assessments across 51 RCTs), 50% of 
the assessments were categorized as having some con -
cerns, 28% as high risk, and 22% as low risk. For NRCS 
(N = 85 outcome assessments across 52 NRCS), 55% were 
considered to have a critical risk, 25% a serious risk, 18% 
a moderate risk and 2% a low risk. The full risk of bias 
assessment for each outcome, for RCTs, CRTs and NCRS 
is presented in Additional file 5.
Use of implementation strategies across included studies
As illustrated in the panel a of Fig.  3, among the imple -
mentation strategies employed in at least 10% of the 
studies, educational meetings were the most common 
(intervention arms [IAs] N = 155; control arms [CAs] 
N = 29), followed by educational materials (IAs N = 145; 
CAs N = 22), clinical practice guidelines (IAs N = 64; 
CAs N = 13), reminders (IAs N = 43; CAs N = 3), audit 
and feedback (IAs N = 38; CAs N = 1), educational out -
reach (IAs N = 32; CAs N = 1), tailored interventions (IAs 
N = 26; CAs N = 2), and local opinion leaders (IAs N = 24; 
CAs N = 3). Strategies employed in less than 10% of stud -
ies included patient-mediated interventions, local con -
sensus processes, monitoring the performance of delivery 
of healthcare, clinical incident reporting, interprofes -
sional education, communities of practice, managerial 
supervision, routine patient-reported outcome measures, 
educational games, and continuous quality improvement. 
No intervention used public release of performance data.
As illustrated in the panel b of Fig.  3, implementation 
strategies almost always included some form of individ -
ual clinician education (including educational materials, 
educational outreach, and clinical practice guidelines) 
and/or group clinician education (including communities 
of practice, educational meetings, and interprofessional 
education) combined with reminders, audit and feed -
back, local opinion leaders, and tailored interventions. 
Additional file  3 presents the implementation strategies 
used across study arms.
Effects of implementation strategies
Effects of implementation strategies as a whole compared 
to no active intervention
In comparison with no active intervention, implementa -
tion strategies as a whole had significant positive effects 
on continuous clinical practice outcomes (76 assess -
ments; SMD 0.94, 95% CI 0.72–1.15; I 2 = 95%; see Fig.  4), 
and dichotomous clinical practice outcomes (60 assess -
ments; OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.70–2.62; I 2 = 95%; see Fig.  5). 
Statistically significant positive effects were also observed 
on nurses’ attitudes (30 assessments; SMD 0.59, 95% CI 
0.23–0.95; I2 = 92%), knowledge (37 assessments; SMD

1.16, 95% CI 0.82–1.49; I 2 = 91%), perceived behavioral 
control (19 assessments; SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.35–1.13; 
I2 = 91%), and skills (10 assessments; SMD 0.97, 95% CI 
0.42–1.52; I2 = 87%). No significant effects were observed 
on continuous patient outcomes (10 assessments; SMD 
0.23, 95% CI -0.01–0.47; I 2 = 87%) and dichotomous 
patient outcomes (12 assessments; OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.96–
2.22; I2 = 84%). Statistical heterogeneity was high in all 
analyses. All forest plots are presented in Additional file 6. 
The clinical practice outcomes included in meta-analyses 
across all comparisons are presented in Additional file 7.
Table  3 presents subgroup analyses of the estimated 
SMDs for continuous outcomes and the estimated ORs 
for dichotomous outcomes to illuminate the variance in 
effects attributed to study design, study setting, and clini-
cal behavior targeted for change. Minimal differences in 
effects were noted across these strata. Though, primary 
care/general practice for continuous clinical practice out-
comes decreased and was no longer significant.
Effects of specific implementation strategies on primary 
and secondary outcomes

egy subgroups by the primary outcome. Dichotomous 
clinical practice outcomes are positively affected (i.e.,

interventions, and opinion leaders. Continuous clini -
cal practice outcomes are positively affected by group 
clinician education, individual clinician education, and 
tailored interventions. Across all implementation strat -
egy subgroups, group clinician education, individual 
clinician education and tailored interventions had sta -
tistically significant effects on patient outcomes. These 
results may be influenced by heterogeneity and the lack

multifaceted strategies had small, non statistically signifi -
cant effects on continuous clinical practice outcomes (12 
assessments; SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.01–0.46; I 2 = 77%; see 
panel a of Fig. 6), dichotomous clinical practice outcomes 
(20 assessments; OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.76–2.40; I 2 = 91%; 
panel b of Fig.  6), and dichotomous patient outcomes (5 
assessments; OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89–1.90; I 2 = 0%) (see 
Additional file 6).
Effects of implementation strategies in included studies 
not ineligible for meta‑analysis
After contacting all study authors, 44 studies were not 
included in meta-analyses for our primary outcome due 
to missing data (n= 27) [48–74], comparisons that were 
not relevant to our analyses (e.g., comparing two groups 
receiving the same type of implementation strategy with 
design variations) (n= 14) [75–88], or expressing their 
outcomes as rates rather than in a compatible format 
(n= 3) [89–91].
Of these studies, 25 focused solely on educational strat-
egies, with 22 showing more favorable outcomes in the 
experimental groups. Kaner et  al. [78] demonstrated 
that educational outreach increased brief alcohol inter -
ventions compared to clinical practice guidelines. Edu -
cational meetings (EMeet), often supplemented with 
educational materials (EMat) and/or clinical practice 
guidelines (CPG), led to improvements across various 
areas:  blood glucose monitoring (O’Neill et  al.: EMeet), 
[63] communication (Antonini et al.: EMeet), [48] diabe -
tes management (Lim et al.: EMeet + EMat), [59] endotra-
cheal suctioning practices (Day et  al.: CPG + EMeet), 
[52] nursing documentation and care planning (Müller-
Staub et al.: EMeet; Brady et al.: EMeet), [49, 81] use of 
physical restraints (Chang et al.: EMeet), [51] counseling 
(Tsai et al.: EMeet; Woodcock et al.: EMeet), [72, 86] and 
symptom management (Hessig et  al.: EMat + EMeet; 
Michaels et  al.: CPG + EMat + EMeet). [55, 61] Magnan 
et  al. [80] used educational materials alone to improve 
physical examination. Nine studies evaluated tech -
nology-enhanced educational strategies. Carrico et  al. 
[87] reported that biosimulated visual demonstration 
of particulate transmission resulted in increased per -
sonal protective equipment use. Jansson et  al. [84, 92], 
through two studies, demonstrated adding feedback and 
debriefing to simulation-focused educational meetings, 
improved nurses’ adherence to evidence-based guide -
lines for mechanical ventilation. Rutherford-Hemming 
et  al. [82] found higher levels of evidence-based perfor -
mance of neurological examinations in simulation-based 
education compared to a self-study module. Wang et al. 
[83] found improved application of counseling following 
the additional of simulation to educational meetings and 
materials. Wang et al. reported the effects of game-based 
learning on hand hygiene practices. [85] Kinsman et  al. 
[88], Lau et  al. [79], and Van de Steeg et  al. [70] found 
e-learning programs improved physical examination, 
medication administration, and delirium care. Hammers-
ley et al. [53], Seeley et al. [68], and Segal et al. [69] found 
no benefits from educational strategies.
Four out of five studies using audit and feedback alone 
were inconclusive. Charrier et al. [76] found that audit and 
feedback and the presence of facilitators, compared with 
self-monitoring, improved compliance to protocols for 
pressure lesions and the management of catheters. Bittner 
et al. [75], Hutchinson et al. [91], Noordman et al. [62], and 
Rothschild et al. [66] found no effects of audit and feedback 
on hand hygiene, history-taking, the reporting of medica-
tion errors, and medication errors.
Studies using multifaceted implementation strategies 
including other strategies than education compared to 
no active intervention were often successful, with 9 out 
of 10 showing positive results. Brennan et  al. [50] evalu -
ated a tailored intervention using the CAM-ICU guideline, 
which increased delirium screenings and led to a decrease 
in delirium rates. Chambers et al. [89] and Fabre et al. [90] 
found that a multifaceted implementation strategy reduced 
nurse-led urine culturing. Hödl et al. [56] improved urinary 
incontinence equipment management using educational 
outreach, materials, guidelines, and reminders. Documen-
tation improved by 43% in the multi-faceted group, while 
the control group saw a 15% decrease after 2  weeks. Lin 
et  al. [60] found that a multifaceted strategy (audit and 
feedback, tailored intervention, educational meetings, and 
materials) improved the use of relaxation techniques in 
surgical nurses in Taipei. Morita et al. [73] found improved 
palliative care practices following a multifaceted strat -
egy involving tailoring and education. Reynolds et  al. [65] 
assessed a multifaceted strategy (educational outreach, 
educational materials, audit and feedback) to improve 
compliance with chlorhexidine gluconate bathing docu -
mentation and reduce central line-associated bloodstream 
infections. While CHG bathing compliance increased sig-
nificantly by 6.97%, the 27.4% decrease in CLABSI rates 
was not significant. Schondelmeyer et al. [67] reported that 
education (meetings, clinical practice guidelines, outreach) 
with audit and feedback reduced guideline-discordant 
continuous pulse oximetry use by 30% in pediatric nurses 
in the USA. Wald et al. [74] also found effects of audit and 
feedback on the uptake of catheter-associated urinary tract 
infection prevention measures. One study of a multifaceted 
implementation strategy had inconclusive results. Happ 
et al. [93] evaluated a web-based training with local opinion 
leaders to reduce ICU adverse events, finding no significant 
changes in physical restraint use.
Four studies specifically compared the effects of mul -
tifaceted versus single-component strategies, with all
<<<PAGE=14>>>
Page 14 of 31Fontaine et al. Implementation Science           (2024) 19:68 
favoring multifaceted strategies. Hong et  al. [57] found 
higher urinary catheter care practice implementation 
using local opinion leaders with educational meetings, 
than either component alone. Johnston et  al. [58] used 
audit and feedback, local opinion leaders, and educational 
materials compared to only monitoring healthcare deliv -
ery on the documentation of pain assessment in Cana -
dian patients. Pagaiya et al. [64] compared a multifaceted

strategy to guidelines alone for reducing antibiotic pre -
scriptions in Thailand. Walsh et  al. [71] found that web-
based education with process feedback significantly 
reduced oversedation in ICU patients in the UK, more 
than other education methods.
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses to exclude stud -
ies assessed as being at overall unclear or high risk of 
bias, as presented in Additional file  8. Effect measures 
tended to decrease with the removal of high risk of bias

studies, though most remained statistically significant. 
In rare instances, the effect sizes increased, such as with 
continuous clinical practice outcomes for multifaceted 
interventions compared to single strategy interventions. 
Heterogeneity remained high in most analyses.
Non-reporting bias
Funnel plots indicated some evidence for non-reporting 
bias in dichotomous clinical practice outcomes (any vs 
no implementation strategies comparison), continuous 
clinical practice outcomes (individual clinician education 
comparison), and continuous clinical practice outcomes 
(group clinician education comparison) (Additional 
file  9). These studies tend to be heavily concentrated to 
the upper left of the triangle suggesting that the effect 
measure could be underestimated for the intervention. 
We did not find clear evidence for non-reporting bias for 
other outcomes.
Certainty of the evidence
Table 6 provides an overview of the impact of various 
implementation strategies compared with different or 
no active interventions for improving compliance with 
desired clinical practice and patient outcomes. The table 
presents both quantitative findings from meta-analyses 
and narrative findings from studies not included in the 
meta-analyses. It also includes the certainty of evidence 
(GRADE) for each type of intervention and outcome, 
offering a comprehensive view of how different strate -
gies influence clinical practice and patient care. Detailed 
summary of findings tables are presented in Additional 
file 10.
Discussion
This systematic review examined the effects of healthcare 
professional-level implementation strategies on nursing 
practice and patient outcomes across 204 studies. Over -
whelmingly, the implementation strategies described 
were multi-component, primarily involving individual 
and group education (e.g., educational meetings, educa -
tional materials, clinical practice guidelines, communities 
of practice, interprofessional education) combined with 
reminders, audit and feedback, local opinion leaders, 
and tailored interventions. In a quarter of the included

studies, implementation strategies targeted multiple 
clinical behaviors for change, such as providing coun -
seling and advice, practicing hand hygiene, assessing and 
diagnosing illness, administrating medication and docu -
menting care. Meta-analyses of 160 studies and narra -
tive synthesis of 44 studies not eligible for meta-analysis 
revealed that both single and multifaceted implementa -
tion strategies have positive effects on clinical practice 
outcomes, with important variability across strategies. 
Statistically significant and practically meaningful posi -
tive effects were also observed for secondary outcomes 
including nurses’ attitudes, knowledge, perceived behav -
ioral control and skills for strategies consisting of indi -
vidual or group education, reminders, and tailored 
interventions. Effects on patient outcomes were observed

for group and individual education, as well as tailored 
interventions.
Our findings are consistent with previous reviews of 
implementation strategies, demonstrating the positive 
effects of group and individual education, reminders, 
patient-mediated interventions, and the involvement 
of opinion leaders on clinical practice outcomes. A 
systematic review by Spoon et  al. [35] similarly iden -
tified a broad spectrum of implementation strategies 
that positively influenced guideline adherence among 
nurses and improved patient-reported nursing out -
comes. Likewise, Cassidy et al. [34] found that combin -
ing educational meetings with other strategies, such 
as educational materials and opinion leaders, effec -
tively supported guideline-concordant nursing care. 
Forsetlund et  al. [16] associated educational meetings 
with likely improvements in professional practice and 
patient outcomes, while Giguère et al [27] observed that 
printed educational materials, when used alone and 
compared to no intervention, might improve slightly 
healthcare professionals’ practices and patient health 
outcomes. Additionally, Flodgren et  al. [26] reported 
that opinion leaders, whether alone or in combina -
tion with other interventions, can promote evidence-
based practice, though their effectiveness varies across 
studies. However, despite its widespread use, audit 
and feedback have shown mixed results. A systematic 
review by Ivers et al. [94] indicated small improvements 
in professional practice among physicians but provided 
limited evidence of effectiveness among nurses. In our 
meta-analyses, strategies including audit and feedback 
did not achieve statistically significant impacts on clini -
cal practice outcomes (a sensitivity analysis excluding 
high-risk-of-bias studies showed a statistically signifi -
cant effect, but only in two studies). This may be due to 
limited statistical power, heterogeneity, or limitations 
of this strategy in inducing practice change among 
nurses. Notably, while 9 out of 14 studies of strategies 
including audit and feedback synthesized narratively 
favored the experimental group in terms of clinical 
practice outcomes, 8 of these studies involved multifac -
eted strategies.
Additionally, our review highlights the underuse of 
many implementation strategies. Ten out of 19 EPOC 
strategies examined were used in less than 5% of included 
studies. This suggests a need for further exploration and 
integration of the full range of EPOC strategies to poten -
tially enhance nursing practice and patient outcomes. 
Furthermore, there is a need to consider additional tax -
onomies of implementation strategies, such as the Expert 
Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) 
Taxonomy, which outlines 73 unique strategies across 
9 clusters [20]. Designing and evaluating multifaceted 
strategies using a broader range of implementation strat -
egies could help address the gaps in current implemen -
tation research and practice. While our exploration of 
the effects of implementation strategies on determinants 
of nurses’ behavior is novel and provides insights on the 
effectiveness of educational strategies on attitudes, inten-
tions, knowledge, perceived behavioral control, perceived 
social norms, and skills, further research could benefit 
from examining outcomes through the lens of the TDF 
[14] and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and 
Behavior (COM-B) Model [95], as these frameworks 
allow for a deeper understanding of the determinants of 
behavior change.
Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion 
about the effectiveness of multifaceted versus single 
component implementation strategies. An overview of 
reviews by Squires et  al. [96] found no strong evidence 
that multifaceted strategies significantly improve out -
comes compared to single interventions. A more recent 
overview of reviews by Boaz et  al. [25], without quan -
titative analyses, concluded that the effectiveness of 
multifaceted strategies compared to single strategies is 
nuanced and context-dependent. The authors discussed 
that  while multifaceted strategies appear to be more 
likely to generate positive results than single strategies, 
the evidence varies, and the impact on patient outcomes 
is often limited. In our review, while quantitative find -
ings suggest a small, non-statistically  significant effect 
of multifaceted versus single strategies on clinical prac -
tice, the narrative synthesis of studies with outcomes 
ineligible for meta-analysis shows favorable outcomes in 
all four studies using multifaceted strategies compared 
to single strategies. These multifaceted strategies typi -
cally combined elements such as educational outreach, 
audit and feedback, tailored interventions, and the use of 
local opinion leaders. This might indicate that multifac -
eted strategies can enhance the uptake of evidence-based 
practice among nurses more effectively than single strate-
gies. However, the translation of these improvements to 
better patient outcomes is uncertain. Tailoring strategies 
and ensuring organizational capacity to support research 
utilization, as emphasized by Boaz et  al. [25], are cru -
cial. Our analyses showed that tailored strategies based 
on contextual assessments of implementation barriers 
and enablers had significant effects on professional out -
comes and patient outcomes. This suggests that strategies 
customized to address specific barriers and facilitators 
within a particular context, echoing a previous system -
atic review by Baker et al., [97] may be more effective in 
driving improvements in patient care.
The analysis reveals that while implementation strat -
egies can improve clinical practice outcomes among 
nurses, their impact on patient outcomes is modest. This

observation aligns with broader research, which sug -
gests that while nurses play a crucial role in healthcare 
delivery, the direct translation of their practice improve -
ments into measurable patient benefits is influenced by a 
multitude of factors. The pathway from practice changes 
to patient outcomes is complex, shaped by organiza -
tional culture, patient engagement, and broader systemic 
issues within healthcare settings [16, 17, 25]. Consider -
ing the role of these factors and the influence of other 
healthcare professionals, nurses can have a nuanced and 
often indirect influence on patient outcomes within the 
larger healthcare system [6]. However, several outcomes 
directly affected by nursing practice were not extracted 
in the context of this review, such as length of stay, read -
missions and patient satisfaction [98]. Additionally, we 
extracted the longest follow-up measurements for all 
outcomes, which may have diminished the observed 
effects. Consequently, it is important to interpret these 
overall averages and findings with caution, given the 
effects of strategies may vary significantly depending on 
the context, target behaviors, actors, outcomes and spe -
cific populations involved.
The predominance of studies (190 studies) from high-
income countries highlights a critical gap in the literature 
regarding the effectiveness of implementation strategies 
on nursing practice in low- and middle-income countries 
(LMIC). A recent review using the ERIC Taxonomy sug -
gests that many implementation strategies can be applied 
to LMIC contexts [99]. However, out of 60 studies in this 
review, a minority of studies employed randomized trials 
or high-quality quasi-experimental designs with controls, 
and just one study evaluated implementation strat -
egy effectiveness [99]. Future research should focus on 
exploring the adaptation and evaluation of professional 
implementation strategies in diverse contexts to ensure 
global relevance and equity in healthcare improvements.
A key strength of this systematic review is its focus on 
nursing practice, improving comparability across studies. 
The inclusion of studies conducted with multiple types 
of healthcare providers in previous systematic reviews 
of implementation strategies constitutes an important 
source of heterogeneity. Additional strengths include 
the extraction of continuous and dichotomous clinical 
practice and patient outcomes, as well as a comprehen -
sive range of determinants preceding clinical practice in 
nurses (e.g., social norms, attitudes, intentions), provid -
ing additional insights on the effects of implementation 
strategies. Other methodological strengths of the review 
include contacting all study authors systematically to 
obtain additional data, the use of the EPOC Taxonomy 
to guide data extraction and analysis of findings and the 
use of GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence and 
enhance the reliability of the review’s conclusions.
This review also has limitations. The presence of mul -
tiple co-interventions and varying study designs could 
confound the results, making it challenging to isolate the 
effect of specific implementation strategies. Some stud -
ies were judged to have a high risk of bias, potentially 
affecting the reliability of the findings, though sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to exclude these studies. Addi -
tionally, we could not abstract some important factors, 
such as organizational and contextual characteristics, 
and the effects of implementation strategies depend on 
engagement with the intervention, which was not meas -
ured or reported in many studies. We synthesized and 
described a very large, heterogeneous dataset, which we 
believed could not be meaningfully summarized effec -
tively through a narrative approach alone. The meta-
analyses demonstrated substantial heterogeneity for most 
analyses (I2 often above 75%), indicating significant vari -
ability in the effect sizes across studies. This high hetero -
geneity can reduce the reliability of the pooled estimates 
and suggests that the effects of implementation strategies 
may differ substantially depending on the context and 
specific characteristics of each study. There was consider-
able variation in the measurement and reporting of clini -
cal practice and patient outcomes across studies. This 
variation complicates the comparison and synthesis of 
results and may contribute to the observed heterogene -
ity. For these reasons, the findings from our quantitative 
analyses should be interpreted with caution given that 
they rely on heterogenous and moderate quality data, and 
as a quantitative aid to the narrative synthesis.
This comprehensive review offers several action -
able recommendations and implications for health -
care systems. Implementation practitioners and 
healthcare organizations may consider adopting and 
investing in multifaceted, tailored, context-specific strat -
egies that address local barriers and leverage facilitators 
for the successful implementation of evidence-based 
interventions in nursing practice. Furthermore, practi -
tioners and organizations should also consider expanding 
the repertoire of strategies they employ, incorporating 
underutilized strategies listed in the EPOC Taxonomy 
such as local consensus processes, patient-mediated 
interventions, and continuous quality improvement, 
while exploring additional strategies outlined in the ERIC 
Taxonomy. Finally, there is need for ongoing monitor -
ing and evaluation mechanisms to assess the long-term 
impact of implementation strategies on both clinical 
practice and patient outcomes.
Conclusions
Implementation strategies play a crucial role in enhanc -
ing evidence-based nursing practice and potentially 
improving patient outcomes. Future research should

focus on exploring how different healthcare settings 
and contexts influence the effectiveness of implementa -
tion strategies; investigating the sustainability and long-
term impact of strategies on both clinical practice and 
patient outcomes; evaluating the effectiveness of novel 
and underutilized implementation strategies; evaluating

Authors’ contributions
GF conceptualized the study, developed the research questions, and defined 
the scope of the review. GF, in collaboration with a Research Librarian, 
designed and ran the search strategies. Title and abstract screening were per-
formed by GF, BV, MAMC, ALav, MFD, ALap, GC, GR and CP . The full text review 
was carried out by GF, BV, MAMC, ALav, MFD, ALap, GC, GR, CEC and CP . Data 
extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by GF, BV, CW, MAMC, 
ALav, MFD, ALap, SAC, GC, GR, NA, MM, CEC, CP , TM and PL. GF, BV, CW, and NA 
managed the data cleaning and performed the meta-analyses, which were 
reviewed by KK. GF, BV and CW prepared the tables and figures, while GF and 
CW led the narrative synthesis and drafted the manuscript. KK, SC, MPG, SS, NS 
and SM provided critical input into the organization, analysis, and interpreta-
tion of the results. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
