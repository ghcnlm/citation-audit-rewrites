Abstract
Background: The use of participatory monitoring and evaluation (M&E) approaches is important for guiding local
decision-making, promoting the implementation of effective interventions and addressing emerging issues in the
course of implementation. In this article, we explore how participatory M&E approaches helped to identify key design
and implementation issues and how they influenced stakeholders ’decision-making in eastern Uganda.
Method: The data for this paper is drawn from a retrospective reflection of various M&E approaches used in a maternal
and newborn health project that was implemented in three districts in eastern Uganda. The methods included qualitative
and quantitative M&E techniques such as key informant interviews, formal surveys and supportive
supervision, as well as participatory approaches, n otably participatory impact pathway analysis.
Results: At the design stage, the M&E approaches were usefu l for identifying key local problems and feasible
local solutions and informing the activities that were subsequently implemented. During the implementation
phase, the M&E approaches provided evidence that info rmed decision-making and helped identify emerging
issues, such as weak implementation by some village health te ams, health facility constraints such as poor use of standard
guidelines, lack of placenta disposal pits, inadequate fuel for the ambulance at some facilities, and poor care for low birth
weight infants. Sharing this information with key stakehold ers prompted them to take appropriate actions. For example,
the sub-county leadership constructed placenta disposal pits, the district health officer provided fuel for ambulances, and
health workers received refresher training and mentorship on how to care for newborns.
Conclusion:Diverse sources of information and pe rspectives can help researchers and decision-makers understand and
adapt evidence to contexts for more effective interventions. Sup porting districts to have crosscutting, routine information
generating and sharing platforms that bringtogether stakeholders from different sectors is therefore crucial for the successful
implementation of complex development interventions.

Background
The ever increasing demand for scarce resources has drawn
more attention to the need to not only evaluate health pro-
grammes, but to also ensure that the results of these evalu-
ations influence the implementation of programmes. The
availability of accurate, timely and consistent data at the
national and sub-national levels is assumed to be crucial for
development programmes to effectively manage health sys-
tems, allocate resources according to need, and ensure
accountability for delivering on health commitments [1 – 3].
Ac o m p r e h e n s i v em o n i t o r i n gand evaluation (M&E) system
should enable programme implementers, decision-makers
and budget planners to learn which strategies work and
what needs to be improved so that resources can be better
targeted towards saving lives [4]. Timely evidence from
research during the course of implementation can inform
and influence policy develop ment, the identification of
good practices and the development of sustainable health
systems [4– 6].
In contexts where maternal and newborn mortality is
high, both demand and supply-side challenges exist side-
by-side [2]. Comprehensive M&E systems are important for
identifying the challenges that can eventually be mitigated.
For instance, providing appro priate maternity care is a
complex process that involves a wide range of preventive,
curative and emergency services as well as several different
levels of care – from the community to the facility and
beyond [2, 7]. At the household level, there is a need to rec-
ognise maternal and newborn danger signs by family mem-
bers so that appropriate services can be sought [8, 9]. At
community level, accessibility to information on maternal
and newborn service, proximity to the health facility and
access to transport contribute to the increased utilisation of
services from skilled personnel. At the facility level, equip-
ment, supplies and medicines must be available to enable
the health provider to make the correct diagnosis, provide
appropriate treatment and make timely decisions so as to
save the life of the mother and her newborn [7, 8]. Address-
ing these barriers to access should be informed by periodic
collection of data that tracks implementation changes and
challenges, which can be share d regularly/systematically
with community stakeholders (such as community health
workers, known as village health teams (VHTs) in Uganda,
and community local leaders), health service providers and
decision-makers at district and national level. Supporting
community actions that can lead to the desired changes re-
quires M&E approaches that a llow information gathering
and sharing in participatory ways so as to influence
decision-making and action by key community-level stake-
holders [9]. Such participatory evaluation approaches have
been defined as “applied social research that involves a
partnership between trained evaluation personnel and
practice-based decision makers, organizational members
with program responsibility or people with a vital interest in
the program” [10]. Weaver and Cousins [11] categorise par-
ticipatory evaluation into practical participatory evaluation,
which is more utilisation oriented and mainly focused on
local problem solving, and tra nsformative participatory
evaluation, which is more em ancipatory in nature with a
strong empowerment component aimed at addressing
existing inequities. What diffe rentiates participatory M&E
from other M&E approaches is that it is responsive to local
needs [10, 11], since this provides an opportunity to local
citizens to be able to generate local applicable ideas and re-
sources that are sustainable within their local context [2, 8,
12, 13]. Application of participatory M&E facilitates transla-
tion of implementation findings for stakeholders, thus
allowing them to gain a better understanding of the inter-
vention and its possible effects [13, 14]. It also enhances
their use of the evaluation findi ngs through their participa-
tion in the implementation learning and assessment process
[15]. In addition, the involvement of different stakeholders
helps to uncover diverse views, which guides debate and
better understanding of the issues that affect the communi-
ties [11, 15]. Furthermore, the application of participatory
M&E approaches strengthens the skills of the people
involved, thus enabling them to contribute more to the suc-
cessful completion of the research project [10, 11]. This
approach has been identified as one of the best ways of
transferring knowledge and research skills to the imple-
menters, allowing them to continuously take charge of new
programmes/projects without relying too much on external
skills [10, 11].
In addition, the approach also encourages fairness, since
it provides an opportunity for different groups, such as
the voiceless within the society/community with a stake in
the implementation or research, to be represented [11].
As a result, this can inform the redesigning and improve-
ment of programmes that do not reach their intended
beneficiaries [16, 17].
Several authors have propos ed theories that explain the
mechanisms that underpin the activities and consequences
of practical participatory evaluations. Smits and Champagne
[18] emphasise the importance of four key concepts, namely
interactive data generation, co -construction of knowledge,
local context of action and instrumental use. On the other
hand, Cousins and Chouinard [19], emphasise the evalu-
ation context and decision/pol i c ys e t t i n ga sf a c t o r st h a ti n -
fluence the participatory inter active processes positively or
negatively. This interactive process eventually influences
evaluation knowledge production and evaluation utilisation.
The MANIFEST project
We used a range of participatory M&E approaches during
the implementation of the Maternal and Neonatal Imple-
mentation for Equitable Systems (MANIFEST) project.
MANIFEST had several key interventions, which were im-
plemented using a participatory action research approach.
Kananura et al . Health Research Policy and Systems 2017, 15(Suppl 2):107 Page 56 of 73
<<<PAGE=3>>>
They included (1) community mobilisation and empower-
ment through the community health worker home visits,
community dialogue meetings, radio talk shows and mes-
sages; (2) improvement of financial and geographical ac-
cess to care by promoting savings for delivery care and
organising local transport; and (3) health systems
strengthening through training of health workers, mentor-
ship, supportive supervision and capacity-building of
leaders in management. These interventions were pro-
vided only in the intervention area except for the radio
talk shows and messages, which were aired on radios with
listenership in the control areas as well and support super-
vision, which was routinely provided by the district health
team in both the control and intervention area. More de-
tails about the intervention are available in the MANI-
FEST study design paper [20].
The MANIFEST project had a multisectoral group of
stakeholders who played different roles. The research
team comprised of members from the district level (dis-
trict health officers, and district reproductive health focal
persons) and researchers from the Makerere University
School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins University
School of Public Health. The district health officers (AB,
GM and DNB), Makerere University team (RMK, EEK
and SNK) and Johns Hopkins University School of Pub-
lic Health (LP, AG and DHP) were all responsible for
designing the intervention. The Makerere University
team was also responsible for building the capacity of
the local implementers by providing technical support to
the district and sub-county teams, who were the lead
implementers. The Johns Hopkins University School of
Public Health team provided general oversight for imple-
mentation of the project together with the Makerere
University team. The sub-coun ty and district level stake-
holders comprised of the health workers, various commu-
nity leaders and decision-makers (religious leaders, political
leaders and technocrats). The health workers, facility and
district managers were responsible for ensuring that quality
services were provided, while the political and technical
leaders at sub-county and distri ct level were responsible for
providing oversight and ensuring that required decisions on
maternal and newborn health (MNH) were made during
sub-county and district council meetings or other such
fora.
The community level stakeholders included men and
women of reproductive age, VHT members, savings group
leaders and local transport ers. The men and women of the
community were important sta keholders, since they made
decisions about seeking app ropriate care for mothers and
newborns and preparing for birth by ensuring that they had
the financial resources requ ired in addition to planning
transport and purchasing other requirements needed for
the mother and newborn. The VHT members were respon-
sible for doing home visits and conducting community
dialogues, which were community meetings established to
discuss MNH issues. Saving group leaders and transporters
provided relevant services that contributed to increasing
access to cash and transport for MNH. The local trans-
porters were chosen by the savings group and they were
responsible for providing safe transport services to health
facilities during antenatal care (ANC) and at the time of
delivery. Prior to the implementation of the project, re-
fresher trainings and orientation meetings were provided
for all the local implementers in the project. This was done
to enhance their capacity to play their expected roles, as
explained above. Continuou s technical support was also
provided throughout the imple mentation of the project by
the Makerere University team and respective local supervi-
sors. Further details about t he trainings performed are
available in Ekirapa-Kiracho et al. [20].
During study implementation, the research findings
were analysed, synthesised and shared on a quarterly basis
with the different stakeholders in the intervention area.
The quarterly assessments and feedbacks involved
the health workers, district health management team, sub-
county and district political and technical personnel, other
implementing partners, and researchers. Whereas numer-
ous papers have been written about outcomes of evalu-
ation studies, much less attention has been paid to the
evaluation processes themselves [21]. The purpose of this
paper is to examine how the participatory M&E ap-
proaches were used to monitor implementation progress,
identify challenges and influence decision-making by com-
munity and district level stakeholders.
Methods
Implementation study area and design
The MANIFEST intervention was implemented in three
districts of eastern Uganda from 2013 to 2015. The esti-
mated population of the three districts was 1,106,100
(Kamuli 500,200, Kibuku 209,000 and Pallisa 396,900)
[22]. The three districts have 104 health facilities, 33 in
Pallisa, 17 in Kibuku and 54 in Kamuli [22]. In these areas,
only approximately 1 of 2 pregnant women attend four or
more ANC visits or deliver in health facilities, which is less
than the 60% and 75% ANC and facility delivery national
wide average estimates, respectively [23, 24]. The MANI-
FEST baseline study estimated the neonatal mortality rate
to be 34 per 1000 live births [25], compared to the 27 per
1000 live births national estimates [23, 24].
Data collection and sources
The data for this paper is drawn from retrospective reflec-
tion of the various data collection sources that included
document reviews, project implementation review meet-
ings, focus group discussions, key informant interviews,
health facility support supervisions and household surveys.

Details of how the implementation study data was collected
are available in a study design paper [20].
M&E approaches
Our motivation for using the participatory approaches
was mainly pragmatic and political [11]. The pragmatic
approach was aimed at promoting problem solving. We
therefore encouraged the involvement and participation of
local stakeholders in assessing progress with implementa-
tion, identifying key lessons and challenges, and subse-
quently suggesting suitable solutions to the challenges
identified. In relation to the political aspects, our aim was
to make sure that we gather the support of the community
leaders (politicians), the implementing team (health
workers, community development officers, implementing
partners and community health workers) and the commu-
nity, including marginalised populations such as adoles-
cents and disabled persons. The project provided avenues
for these stakeholders to be able to critically understand the
health challenges at both hea lth facility, community and in-
dividual level through providing evidence and allowing
interaction, which in turn motivated them to take an active
role in providing solutions to the problems identified.
We collected data during the design stage at the begin-
ning, during implementation and at the end of the inter-
vention, and consistently involved stakeholders at national,
district, sub-county and community (village) level during
data collection and dissemination. Figure 1 provides a sum-
mary of the M&E data collection approaches and tools that
were employed as well as the stakeholder engagements that
were undertaken.
Stakeholder involvement
At the planning and design stage, a planning meeting that
involved the research team members, health providers,
district leaders, sub-county leaders and community mem-
bers was conducted in order to identify community condi-
tions/problems that lead to underutilisation of maternal
health services and contribute to maternal and newborn
deaths. These planning meetings were facilitated by the
Makerere University School of Public Health research
team. During the planning meeting, the stakeholders were
asked to discuss how to address the problems identified
Fig. 1 M&E tools, approaches, and activities used at different stages of programme design and implementation. a All stakeholders at national,
district, sub-county and community (village) level as well as researchers were involved at planning and during the implementation phase. b National
policy-makers were involved in biannual stakeholders ’meetings conducted at national level and quarterly presentation at Ministry of Health reproductive
health steering committee.c Theory of Change (ToC) was performed during design stage and was revised during the implementation through data
collection and meeting with stakeholders at different levels. d Mapping was conducted during the design phase and included all stakeholders at
national, district, sub-county and community (village) level. e The most significant change (MSC) approach was performed quarterly throughout the
implementation period, with ( f) participatory impact pathway analysis (PIPA) performed twice and involving only district stakeholders, sub-county
stakeholders, implementing partners and researchers. This approach collected data through formal meetings. g Surveys, key informant interviews (KIs)
and focus group discussions (FGDs) were performed at the beginning of implementation (baseline), quarterly/midterm and at the end of the implementation
(end line).h Health facility assessments were performed at the beginning of implementation (baseline), quarterly/supportive supervision and at the end of the
implementation (end line).i During formal meetings, for instance, quarterly review meetings, we collected data on significant changes and conducted
PIPA workshops

using available resources and a given time frame. The
involvement of the stakeholders at the planning stage pro-
vided a better understanding of the maternal and newborn
problems and guided the selection of interventions that
were implemented.
During the implementation phase, the stakeholders at the
community and sub-county levels in the intervention areas
were engaged in addition to the district level stakeholders.
They were engaged through quarterly group meetings,
which took place at sub-county and district level, quarterly
support supervision visits to th e health facilities, and quar-
terly group meetings with the VHTs and the communities
(community dialogues). At district level, the meetings were
chaired by the district health officer, who was responsible
for mobilising all district stakeholders, including the imple-
menting partners and donors such as UNICEF and USAID.
At sub-county level, the meetings were chaired by the sub-
county chief, who was also responsible for mobilising the
sub-county implementation committee for the meeting.
These stakeholder meetings have been described in Table 1.
During the stakeholders ’ meetings, the component lead,
who was a member of the district health management team,
presented results from study household surveys, health facil-
ity support supervision repor ts, key informant interviews
and focus group discussions with the stakeholders/benefi-
ciaries. Based on the presenta tions and discussions, appro-
priate actions were then taken by district planning leaders,
health workers, health managers and the research team. The
district biostatistician and the district health team were
responsible for the analysis of routine data collected through
the district health management information system, while
the Makerere University research team was responsible for
the analysis of data collected through additional surveys.
Mapping and Theory of Change
This stage guided the team to map out the possible study
outcomes, influential stakeholders to be targeted, partner-
ships to be identified, strategies for addressing community
and health providers’ behaviours, and inputs needed for the
implementation of different strategies. This information

was used to develop a Theory of Change. The Theory of
Change enabled the research team members to clarify not
only the ultimate outcomes and impacts they hoped to
achieve, but also the avenues through which they expected
to achieve them. This helped the research team and the
local stakeholders build cons ensus on the implementation
pathways. More details about the Theory of Change and
how it was used are available in Paina et al. [26].
Quantitative data collection
Quantitative information was collected through household
surveys, health facility support supervision visits, health
information utilisation data and reports from the commu-
nity health workers. We conducted household surveys at
baseline, midterm and endline so as to determine changes
in the study outcomes, while we used Lot Quality Assurance
Sampling (LQAS) techniques to conduct quarterly house-
hold surveys during the first 9 months of the study to moni-
tor the uptake of key intervention elements. The main
outcomes for LQAS household surveys were changes in
facility deliveries, ANC attendance, birth preparedness prac-
tices, and knowledge of birth p reparedness, pregnancy,
labour and newborn danger si gns. Every quarter, we ran-
domly selected five villages as s upervision areas in each dis-
trict (supervision units), from which we randomly sampled
19 eligible households for assessment. A team of five
district-based persons (go vernment employees), who
included the biostatistician and health management infor-
mation system focal person, collected the data. Table 2 pro-
vides details of these data collection methods.
Qualitative data collection
A team of trained research assistants with support from a
qualitative research specialist from Makerere University
collected qualitative data through focus group discussions,
key informant interviews and quarterly review meetings at
district and sub-county level. We conducted focus group
discussions with men and women in rich and poor com-
munities and in locations that were considered hard to
reach and easily accessible. These areas were selected by
members from the district health office [20]. The key
informant interviews were conducted with community
leaders, district health management team members and
health providers [20]. More details about the data collec-
tion are described in Table 2.
Most significant change
We used a modified version of the most significant change
approach to help us track the most significant changes
experienced by the health providers and the community
during the implementation phase [27] (Fig. 1). We did this
by collecting stories of change during focus group discus-
sions with the community, key informant interviews with
health providers and local leaders, and meetings (quarterly
meetings, health workers symposia and research team
meetings). The stories spanned across several domains
that included quality of care provided at the health facil-
ities, health workers ’attitudes, changes in healthcare man-
agement/leadership skills and behavioural changes among
mothers in terms of birth preparedness and newborn care.
However, we did not rank these stories so as to identify
the most significant change; rather, we considered all of
them as stories of change since our aim was to capture
perceptions of change from the stakeholders ’perspective.
Participatory impact pathway analysis (PIPA)
We used PIPA to identify key stakeholders involved in
MNH. The PIPA workshop was conducted in the first

and second year of implementation. Details about how it
was conducted are available in Ekirapa-Kiracho et al. [28].
We used PIPA to analyse the type, role and strength of
each stakeholder, as well as how they were connected with
one another in the context of maternal and newborn ser-
vices. This helped the project team to understand the
actors in MNH, the resources that they possessed, as well
as the power and influence that they had in promoting
achievement of the project objectives.
Results
In the subsequent sections, we present findings that
illustrate how M&E information shared with each group
of key stakeholders was used to identify challenges and
linked to the decisions or actions taken.
Community level
During the design phase of the programme we held
focus group discussions and stakeholder meetings with
local members of the communities. The purpose of these
discussions were to identify local problems and feasible
solutions as well as the existing local resources, includ-
ing existing infrastructure and governance structures,
human and financial resources. Through the discussions
we were able to identify the problems that affect MNH
services in three main areas, including birth prepared-
ness, transport and quality of MNH care services in the
health facilities. The problems related to birth prepared-
ness included lack of awareness of its importance, nega-
tive cultural practices, men neglecting their roles, lack of
knowledge about family planning, poor saving culture
and poverty. The transport problems included absence
of ambulances, long distances to health units, lack of
appropriate transport vehicles and high transport fares.
The quality of care was being compromised by frequent es-
sential drug shortages, inadequate number of delivery beds,
understaffing, poor health workers’attitudes, irregular sup-
port supervision, staff absenteeism, informal charges, and
poor technical and managerial s kills. This information was
used to identify the intervent ions that were implemented.
For instance, to address the challenge of low awareness
about the importance of birth preparedness, home visits by
community health workers were suggested and later
included as one of the key interventions. To address poor
managerial and technical skills, refresher training for health
workers was proposed and provided as one of the interven-
tions for health system strengthening.
The local resources identified included existing infra-
structure and governance structures such as the sub-county
committee, community development office, local transport
associations, VHTs and savings groups. The sub-county
committee was given the respons ibility of supervising the
quarterly community dialogues that were held at every
village. The community development office was able to
provide technical support to the saving groups when we
realised that most of them had managerial problems and
lacked the basic documentation that was required for their
efficient functionality.
During the implementation phase, we shared informa-
tion about uptake of the intervention elements and pro-
gress with implementation of the intervention with the
community level stakeholders. Table 3 provides a sum-
mary of key issues that were identified at the community
level and shared with community stakeholders, as well as
the actions that were recommended by these stakeholders.
Data from the household surveys provided information
about the uptake of various aspects of the intervention.
For example, in some of the hard-to-reach areas, newborn
deaths were high and most of the women were delivering
at home with assistance from traditional birth attendants.
Data collected from community health workers also helped
the research team and district health office capture the
number of newborn deaths an d maternal deaths more
completely and accurately. Previously, the district only had
data from the facility, which reflected a much smaller num-
ber of maternal and newborn deaths. The focus groups
were used to explore the reasons behind these home deliv-
eries and newborn/maternal deaths in more depth and to
identify possible solutions that could be undertaken by
community, facility or district level stakeholders. Table 4 pro-
vides a summary of the main factors contributing to mater-
nal and newborn deaths and solutions that were proposed.
The main factors included delays in deciding to seek
care and inadequate care at the health facilities, with de-
lays in deciding to refer mothers at the health facilities.
Some of the problems that had been identified during the
problem identification phase were still present even at the
design phase of the study. Their persistence during the
intervention showed that more attention needed to be
given to addressing them. These issues were then brought
to the attention of local leaders, health providers, includ-
ing VHTs, and district planners in the community. For
example, through the community dialogues, we empha-
sised the importance of delivering in health facilities and
preparing for birth by saving money so that transport
could be availed in case a mother was referred to a more
specialised facility. As a result, women started saving with
the saving groups and some groups bought their own
boda bodas, which they started using to transport the
members of the groups at subsidised costs and sometimes
for free. Initially, the community used to save mainly to
meet their needs during festive seasons such as Christmas
or for burial. However, this has now changed as a result of
these community engagements, which have made the
community realise the importance of birth preparedness
and saving to meet their MNH needs (Additional file 1).
As alluded to earlier, we performed surveys with the
VHTs to identify their knowledge about danger signs and
Kananura et al . Health Research Policy and Systems 2017, 15(Suppl 2):107 Page 61 of 73
<<<PAGE=8>>>
areas of weakness in conducting health education and
referral during home visits. Results from the second moni-
toring data collection exercise (6 months after the inter-
vention started), during which interviews were done with
VHTs, revealed that only 46% knew at least three newborn
danger signs. Furthermore, only 29% of the VHTs were
knowledgeable about the transport and savings compo-
nent of the intervention (Table 3). These results were
shared with the VHTs during the quarterly group meet-
ings and refresher training was provided in these weak
areas. The VHTs also performed role-plays that reminded
them of the information that they were to share with the
rest of the community. We also used the quarterly group
meeting as a method of obtaining feedback from the
VHTs about how the health workers were responding to
the clients. For example, early in the study, the VHTs
reported that the health workers rejected some of the
referrals made by them. This information was shared with
the health workers, who explained their response by say-
ing that sometimes the VHTs did not assess the patients
well before referring them. For instance, some of them
referred all women with big legs to the facility thinking
they had oedema. This feedback was in turn given to the
VHTs through quarterly meetings, who were then asked
to ensure that they adequately assessed patients before
referring them.
The PIPA workshops were used to identify stake-
holders involved in MNH and their roles in improving
access to MNH care. They enabled us to identify other
implementing actors who could contribute to achieving
the project objectives. For instance, default from pay-
ment was a challenge in the saving groups. During the
workshop, it was recommended that the police could
equip the community development officers with infor-
mation about how to seek legal redress so that they are
able to ensure that the saving groups can recover their
money or protect it from being borrowed illegally. The
PIPA workshop was also able to demonstrate to the
community members that a multisectoral approach was
required to increase access to care for mothers and new-
borns, since they were able to appreciate the role that
women’s husbands, VHTs, transporters, family members
and health workers played in influencing where women
delivered from. This increased their willingness to par-
ticipate in activities that were geared at saving the lives
of mothers and newborns.
Health facility level
At facility level, the M&E data helped us to track
MNH service availability and gaps. Table 5 provides a
summary of issues that were identified and actions
that were recommended.
The quarterly support supervision visits that involved
both the research team and the district leaders helped
the team to identify service delivery gaps, which were
reported to the respective health facility teams and dis-
trict health office for their action. For instance, in some
facilities, health workers were not using partographs to
monitor the labour progress and, in fact, some of the
health workers did not know how to use the partograph.

However, during support supervision by the district sup-
port supervision team, health workers were reminded
about the importance of using partographs and provided
with refresher training on the use of partographs [29]
(Table 5).
In addition, some health facilities were found to have
no essential birth items and equipment. In some cases,
the facilities had this equipment in their stores, but they
were not aware of their availability. For example, at least
five lower level health facilities in Kibuku and the health
district store in Pallisa had manual vacuum aspiration
sets that they were able to put to use. The support
supervision reports were discussed in the district quar-
terly review meetings, which tasked the health facility
and district teams to find alternative means of address-
ing these problems.
The periodic household surveys helped us identify
newborn care gaps. For example, the midterm survey re-
sults indicated that few mothers with low birth weight
infants received information on how to care for small in-
fants (36.8%), and only 5.3% received kangaroo mother
care (midterm 2014 report). These findings were shared
with the health workers during support supervision and
mentorship visits and the district health office during
quarterly meetings. As a result, the district health offices
and the Makerere research team decided to support the
health facilities to put in place strategies that
may strengthen the newborn care services focusing on
care for low birth weight infants as suggested by the
health workers. Hospitals and health centres in each of
the districts set up newborn care corners. In addition, the
study team put more emphasis on building skills related
to the management of newborn infants by adding a
paediatrician to the mentorship team and provided more
skills-building sessions on low birth weight infant screening
and management of pre-term infants with a focus on new-
born resuscitation skills and kangaroo mother care.

(immediately the labour started, 8:00 am). When the facility staff failed, they
referred her to the hospital at 11:00 pm (at night). The hospital opted for a
caesarean. After the operation, she bled too much, and this resulted in her
death. Fortunately, the baby survived ” Deceased’s sister

access to services because I had not gone with my husband. I again went
there when it was 6 months and the same happened. …. I tried to explain

delivery reached, I decided to deliver from home because I feared to go
back to the facility. Two days after delivery, my child died ” Mother 35 y,

aspects of the intervention (home visits by VHTs, maternal
and newborn care practices, a ttendance of community dia-
logues, formation of saving groups and linkages with trans-
porters), gaps in health service delivery and challenges faced
(Tables 3 and 5). The sharing of these findings enabled the
community leaders and decision-makers to learn about local
conditions and problems affe cting the communities and
they were able to take actions to respond to those problems.
For example, during supportive s upervision visits, we were
able to find out that some facilities did not have placenta
pits for placenta disposal, essential drugs and supplies, elec-
tricity or fuel for the ambulance. The sharing of this
information in the review meet ings at sub-county and dis-
trict level prompted the leaders and decision-makers to take
the required action. The district and sub-county offices
availed the funds required for construction of the placenta
pits, repairing of health facilities and ambulances as well as
fuel provision (Table 5). Information sharing also helped dis-
trict officials to identify addi tional resources and partner-
ships that could be made available. For example, the
Member of Parliament in Pallisa district bought motorised
ambulances to ease the transport problem and the sub-
county leaders considered p rocurement of tricycles and
facilitation of community health workers in their budget
planning (Table 5).
The involvement of the health district leaders, health
facility managers and sub-county leadership team in plan-
ning and M&E also strengthened their capacity in the use
of data for advocacy, planning and decision-making. As a
result, some district health offices have learnt the
importance of participatory planning, M&E as a tool for
information sharing, advocacy and resource allocation.
For instance, Kibuku district now uses the health informa-
tion data to determine the facilities that need to be ex-
panded or that require more staffing (Additional file 2).
Some of the health facility managers also reported that
they now hold more effective meetings with clearly spelt
out objectives and action plans. In addition, they are able
to garner more support from stakeholders who influence
decision-making about allocation of resources. As a result,
one of the health facilities was able to receive funds for
the renovation of its theatre (Additional file 3).
Discussion
This paper describes the participatory M&E methodologies
and tools used to identify key implementation issues and
solve problems and how they influenced decision-making.
Some of the key components noted in theories about prac-
tical participatory M&E, such as interactive data generation,
local contextual action and lo cal contextual factors, were
also noted to have played key roles in data generation and
influencing decision-making in this paper [11, 19]. Use of a
combination of M&E approaches and tools had several
benefits. Firstly, they allowed triangulation of data from
various sources leading to m ore complete reporting and a
better understanding of some of the issues noted. They also
enhanced interactive data generation, which enabled the
study implementation team to get perspectives from differ-
ent stakeholders and provided a comprehensive picture of
how different factors and actor s were interacting to influ-
ence MNH outcomes. For example, several newborn deaths
were reported in the intervention area. Hence, it was im-
portant for the district heal th management team, health
workers and other key stakeholders to understand the cir-
cumstances that led to the deaths, so that measures could
be put in place to stop similar occurrences. The qualitative
interviews that were done with women who had lost their
infants therefore aided in the identification of the factors
that contributed to these deaths. The district and sub-
county level stakeholders were then able to take actions to
solve some of the problems identified. Other researchers
have also indicated the importance of combining quantita-
tive assessments of pre-specified mediating variables
with qualitative investigation of participant responses
in testing and redefining the causal intervention as-
sumptions [8, 16, 30, 31].
Secondly, combining qualitative and quantitative data
collection methods from several sources and discussing
these results with a diverse group of stakeholders during
the quarterly review meetings also allowed co-construction
of knowledge and the identificat ion of unanticipated path-
ways, as well as in-depth exploration of pathways which are
too complex to be captured using one method [30]. For
instance, to encourage male involvement, facilities prioritise
women who come with their partners and sometimes
d e c l i n et ow o r ko nw o m e nw h od on o td u r i n gA N C .H o w -
ever, we noted that this becomes a barrier to seeking formal
delivery care services for women who have no partners.
These women feel discriminated against and decide to shun
all the facility services, as described by a woman who gave
birth at home and later lost her newborn. During the meet-
ing, these findings on the community stories were shared
and the district health offices and leaders agreed that the
policy of not attending women who have not come with
their husbands should be abolished.
Thirdly, the frequent interactive monitoring of the imple-
mentation allowed us to identify gaps in implementation and
to identify practical solutions that could be implemented by
those who were responsible for improving service delivery.
During supportive supervisi on, we realised that, whereas
some of the implementation was constrained by factors that
were beyond the control of the facilities or health workers,
such as inadequate essentia l equipment and supplies and
skilled motivated health workers [32 – 34], in several cases
there was something that the health workers could do. For
example, some newborns were dying without being resusci-
tated and partographs were not being filled in some facilities
simply because the health workers lacked the skills to do so.
Kananura et al . Health Research Policy and Systems 2017, 15(Suppl 2):107 Page 65 of 73
<<<PAGE=12>>>
Availing information on thes e health facility gaps, and
emphasising the fact that the health workers could change
this situation if supported, encouraged the facility and district
management to take action whenever there was a problem
that they could solve. Other researchers have indicated
the importance of engaging clinical and management staff
in the discussion of implementation barriers and facilita-
tors [33 – 35]. However, for this monitoring to lead to
improvement in service delivery, the gaps must be clearly
specified, actions that are to be taken to mitigate them
must be identified and persons responsible indicated, and
follow-up must be carried out to ensure that the required
action was taken, otherwise the problems simply continue
to persist.
Finally, the participatory M& E methods facilitated inter-
active processes that promoted interaction and dialogue
between the stakeholders. We realised that the dialogue
enhanced the ability of stakeholders to hold each other
accountable, which was an unanticipated positive outcome.
Other studies have also emphasised the need for informa-
tion sharing with stakeholders at each stage of implementa-
tion [5, 8], which strengthens appropriate decision-making,
advocacy and resource sharing [12, 36, 37]. However, we
noted that, in the absence of the research team, things
tended to slide back to the status quo, implying that
strengthening of such accountability processes requires time
and local champions before it can become entrenched into
local systems.
In spite of the above benefits, we note that there were
several challenges that may hinder instrumental use of
findings from participatory M&E approaches and may also
limit the decision-making, especially in low- and middle-
income countries. One of the major challenges was related
to local contextual factors. Often, the available resources
were not adequate for taking the required actions. One of
the key weaknesses noted was in the referral system,
which needed a comprehensive set of communication and
transport facilities at the community and facility levels.
Although some progress was made through the purchase
of a motorcycle ambulance and trailers as well as the pur-
chase of motorised ambulances by politicians, these were
not enough. Persistent inability to address problems iden-
tified as a result of inadequate financial resources often
frustrates health workers and managers, who are willing
to bring about change; these are among the challenges
that have been noted in decentralised settings in develop-
ing countries. Although local leaders have the power to
make decisions that can improve service delivery, this
decision-making space is limited by the resources that are
available to them [38, 39]. The resources available to man-
agers must therefore be expanded if they are to make
significant changes towards improving service delivery.
Another factor that limited the ability of managers to
make positive decisions was the power dynamics in the
district. It has been noted that power dynamics can influ-
ence collaborative M&E practices [11]. Local political and
technical leaders wield a lot of power in decentralised set-
tings. Managers and leaders in other key positions are
therefore often unwilling to make decisions that may spoil
their relationships with such lo cal leaders. A district health
officer may therefore find himself unable to discipline a
health worker who is closely related to a high-ranking dis-
trict officer.
Other local contextual challenges included inadequacies
in data collection and analysis, as well as report writing
and information use at district offices and health facilities
[40]. Some of the inadequacies were related to inadequate
skills for checking the data collected and reported by the
facilities to the districts, or to the inability to appropriately
analyse the data collected. When we noted this, we
planned to conduct a data quality assessment and to pro-
vide refresher training for the district biostatistician and
records officers. Unfortunately, we were not able to address
all these gaps because of financial and human
resource constraints. Another related challenge was
linked to the way key decisions were often made by
managers and district leaders. Decisions about pro-
gramming of public health programmes are often in-
fluenced not only by the data but also by the tacit
knowledge of the programme implementers [41]. This
therefore meant that there was low demand for data
for decision-making both at facility and district level.
Projects that aim to influence decision-making at dis-
trict, community and facility level therefore need to
budget funds for strengthening data collection, ana-
lysis and evidence generation. If district leaders have
such training and an intrinsic desire to promote ac-
countability, then they could spearhead similar activ-
ities that are geared at changing the status quo and
improving service delivery.
The major strength of this paper is that it draws its data
from several sources and therefore had adequate triangula-
tion of data sources. Furthermore, the prospective nature of
the M&E of activities also allowed the information obtained
to be used in real time to improve the implementation of the
study. The study also contributes to the needed literature on
participatory M&E approaches,t h e r e b yd e m o n s t r a t i n gt h e
value of stakeholder involvement in decision-making, and
how and at what level to involve them. However, one limita-
tion of the paper is that it does not indicate the actual
amount spent on M&E activities despite them being very re-
source intensive. To promote sustainability of the approaches
used herein, we suggest that similar programmes embed
their data collection needs within existing routine sys-
tems of data collection so as to limit the additional
cost of data collection. Similarly, feedback to stake-
holders can be embedded within other existing stake-
holder and programme meetings.

Conclusions
Our implementation experience has revealed that a com-
bination of participatory M&E approaches and feedback
to stakeholders is very useful in tracking progress and
identifying emerging implementation challenges, which
help in facilitating planning and decision-making during
implementation. Borrowing from our implementation ex-
perience, supporting districts to have crosscutting routine
information and generating and sharing platforms that
involve stakeholders from different sectors is crucial for
the successful implementation of complex development
interventions. However, there is a need to strengthen the
skills of those responsible for the collection and analysis of
data that is used to generate local evidence. Similarly, the
resources required for addressing identified problems also
need to be expanded so as to enlarge the decision-making
space for key implementers and decision-makers.
Future research on participatory M&E could include docu-
mentation of resource needs, exploration of approaches to
evaluate the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement and de-
velopment of measures to assess the contribution of partici-
patory M&E.
