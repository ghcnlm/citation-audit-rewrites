Executive Summary 
Teacher professional learning is of increasing interest as one way to support the increasingly 
complex skills students need to learn in preparation for further education and work in the 21st 
century. Sophisticated forms of teaching are needed to develop student competencies such 
as deep mastery of challenging content, critical thinking, complex problem-solving, effective 
communication and collaboration, and self-direction. In turn, effective professional development 
(PD) is needed to help teachers learn and refine the pedagogies required to teach these skills. 
However, research has shown that many PD initiatives appear ineffective in supporting changes in 
teacher practices and student learning. Accordingly, we set out to discover the features of effective 
PD. This paper reviews 35 methodologically rigorous studies that have demonstrated a positive link 
between teacher professional development, teaching practices, and student outcomes. We identify 
the features of these approaches and offer rich descriptions of these models to inform those seeking 
to understand the nature of the initiatives. 
Defning and Studying Efective Professional Development 
We define effective professional development as structured professional learning that results in 
changes in teacher practices and improvements in student learning outcomes. To define features 
of effective PD, we reviewed studies meeting our methodological criteria (see Appendix A) that 
emerged from our extensive search of the literature over the last three decades. We coded each of 
the studies to identify the elements of effective PD models. 
Using this methodology, we found seven widely shared features of effective professional 
development. Such professional development: 
Is content focused: PD that focuses on teaching strategies associated with specific curriculum 
content supports teacher learning within teachers’ classroom contexts. This element includes an 
intentional focus on discipline-specific curriculum development and pedagogies in areas such as 
mathematics, science, or literacy. 
Incorporates active learning: Active learning engages teachers directly in designing and trying 
out teaching strategies, providing them an opportunity to engage in the same style of learning they 
are designing for their students. Such PD uses authentic artifacts, interactive activities, and other 
strategies to provide deeply embedded, highly contextualized professional learning. This approach 
moves away from traditional learning models and environments that are lecture based and have no 
direct connection to teachers’ classrooms and students. 
Supports collaboration: High-quality PD creates space for teachers to share ideas and collaborate 
in their learning, often in job-embedded contexts. By working collaboratively, teachers can 
create communities that positively change the culture and instruction of their entire grade level, 
department, school and/or district. 
Uses models of effective practice: Curricular models and modeling of instruction provide 
teachers with a clear vision of what best practices look like. Teachers may view models that 
include lesson plans, unit plans, sample student work, observations of peer teachers, and video or 
written cases of teaching. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT v
<<<PAGE=8>>>
Provides coaching and expert support: Coaching and expert support involve the sharing of 
expertise about content and evidence-based practices, focused directly on teachers’ individual needs. 
Offers feedback and reflection: High-quality professional learning frequently provides built-in 
time for teachers to think about, receive input on, and make changes to their practice by facilitating 
reflection and soliciting feedback. Feedback and reflection both help teachers to thoughtfully move 
toward the expert visions of practice. 
Is of sustained duration: Effective PD provides teachers with adequate time to learn, practice, 
implement, and reflect upon new strategies that facilitate changes in their practice. 
Our research shows that effective professional learning incorporates most or all of these elements. 
We also examine professional learning communities (PLCs) as an example of a PD model that 
incorporates several of these effective elements and supports student learning gains. This 
collaborative and job-embedded PD can be a source of efficacy and confidence for teachers, and can 
result in widespread improvement within and beyond the school level. 
Creating Conditions for Efective Professional Development: Opportunities 
and Challenges 
Research has established that the educational system within which PD occurs has implications for 
its effectiveness. Specifically, conditions for teaching and learning both within schools and at the 
broader, system level can inhibit the effectiveness of PD. For example, inadequate resourcing for 
PD—including needed curriculum materials—frequently exacerbates inequities and hinders school 
improvement efforts. Failure to align policies toward a coherent set of practices is also a major 
impediment, as is a dysfunctional school culture. Implementing effective PD well also requires 
responsiveness to the needs of educators and learners and to the contexts in which teaching and 
learning will take place. 
Implications for Policy and Practice 
Examples of PD that have been successful in raising student achievement can help policymakers 
and practitioners better understand what quality teacher professional learning looks like. Policy can 
help support and incentivize the kind of evidence-based PD described here. For instance: 
1. Policymakers could adopt standards for professional development to guide the design, 
evaluation, and funding of professional learning provided to educators. These standards 
might reflect the features of effective professional learning outlined in this report as well as 
standards for implementation. 
2. Policymakers and administrators could evaluate and redesign the use of time and school 
schedules to increase opportunities for professional learning and collaboration, including 
participation in professional learning communities, peer coaching and observations across 
classrooms, and collaborative planning. 
3. States, districts, and schools could regularly conduct needs assessments using data 
from staff surveys to identify areas of professional learning most needed and desired 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT vi
<<<PAGE=9>>>
by educators. Data from these sources can help ensure that professional learning is not 
disconnected from practice and supports the areas of knowledge and skills educators want 
to develop. 
4. State and district administrators could identify and develop expert teachers as mentors 
and coaches to support learning in their particular area(s) of expertise for other educators. 
5. States and districts can integrate professional learning into the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA) school improvement initiatives, such as efforts to implement 
new learning standards, use student data to inform instruction, improve student literacy, 
increase student access to advanced coursework, and create a positive and inclusive 
learning environment. 
6. States and districts can provide technology-facilitated opportunities for professional 
learning and coaching, using funding available under Titles II and IV of ESSA to address 
the needs of rural communities and provide opportunities for intradistrict and intraschool 
collaboration. 
7. Policymakers can provide flexible funding and continuing education units for learning 
opportunities that include sustained engagement in collaboration, mentoring, and 
coaching, as well as institutes, workshops, and seminars. 
In the end, well-designed and implemented PD should be considered a essential component of a 
comprehensive system of teaching and learning that supports students to develop the knowledge, 
skills, and competencies they need to thrive in the 21st century. To ensure a coherent system that 
supports teachers across the entire professional continuum, professional learning should link to 
their experiences in preparation and induction, as well as to teaching standards and evaluation. It 
should also bridge to leadership opportunities to ensure a comprehensive system focused on the 
growth and development of teachers.

Introduction 
As demands for deeper and more complex student learning have intensified, practitioners, 
researchers, and policymakers have begun to think more systematically about how to improve 
teachers’ learning from recruitment, preparation, and support, to mentoring and other leadership 
opportunities. Sophisticated forms of teaching are needed to develop 21st century student 
competencies, such as deep mastery of challenging content, critical thinking, complex problem-
solving, effective communication and collaboration, and self-direction. In turn, opportunities are 
needed for teachers to learn and refine the pedagogies required to teach these skills. 
However, major questions remain about how 
Sophisticated forms of teaching teachers can learn these skills and how PD can 
play a role in improving teacher practice. Recent are needed to develop 21st 
research on PD has underscored the importance 
century student competencies. of these questions, given the mixed findings 
often generated.
1 For example, one recent study 
of four districts serving a largely low-income 
student population found that even with large financial investments in teacher PD, both teacher 
practice (according to teacher evaluations) and student learning (according to state assessments) 
saw little change. The study found that teacher evaluations stayed the same, or declined in the span 
of 2-3 years, while more than $18,000 of PD money per teacher was spent in these districts. In spite 
of their findings, the authors of the four-district study did not recommend dropping investment in 
teacher PD. Instead, recommendations included redefining what it means to help teachers improve, 
reevaluating current professional learning and support programs,and reinventing how we support 
effective teaching at scale.
2 
It is certainly true that PD does not always lead to professional learning, despite its intent.3 Fullan 
(2007) argues that external approaches to instructional improvement are rarely “powerful enough, 
specific enough, or sustained enough to alter the culture of the classroom and school.”
4 Indeed, 
research on PD in the United States found that most teachers receive PD of short duration (less than 
eight hours on a topic, usually in afterschool workshops) and that, during the No Child Left Behind 
Era, there was an increase in this short-term approach and a decline in access to more sustained 
professional learning approaches.
5 In addition, some school contexts pose equity challenges related 
to the potential impact of PD on student learning (e.g., poor leadership, inadequate resources, or 
countervailing school or district mandates).
6 
At the same time, a growing number of rigorous studies establish that well-designed PD can, when 
effectively implemented, lead to desirable changes in teacher practice and student outcomes. These 
studies build on an expansive body of research that has previously described positive outcomes 
from professional learning using teacher and student self-reports or observational designs.
7 As 
states and districts work to create new structures and strategies for PD, it is useful to evaluate 
what this research has to say about the kinds of professional learning that improve instruction and 
student achievement.

Defning Efective Professional Development 
In this review, we define effective professional development as structured professional learning 
that results in changes to teacher knowledge and practices, and improvements in student learning 
outcomes. We conceptualize professional learning as a product of both externally provided and 
job-embedded activities that increase teachers’ knowledge and help them change their instructional 
practice in ways that support student learning. Thus, formal PD represents a subset of the range of 
experiences that may result in professional learning. 
This Study 
In this paper, we examine the research on

extensive search of the literature over the last 
three decades which met our methodological 
criteria: They featured a careful experimental or 
comparison group design, or they analyzed student outcomes with statistical controls for context 
variables and student characteristics. (Appendix A details our methodology and Appendix B details 
each reviewed study.) We coded each of the studies to generate the elements of effective PD models. 
Appendix C indicates the elements exhibited by each of the PD model(s) featured in each study. 
We recognize that this methodology has limitations. Because studies of professional development 
typically examine comprehensive models that incorporate many elements, this paper does not seek 
to draw conclusions about the efficacy of individual program components. Rather, it offers rich 
descriptions of the combined characteristics of PD that research has found to positively relate to 
student outcomes. 
We are also unable to comment on the studies of PD that do not appear to yield positive results on 
student achievement. Although many studies lack the rigorous controls needed to draw inferences 
about outcomes, there are a number of well-designed studies of PD that share some of the features 
we highlight here but did not find positive effects. We located six studies with strong methodologies 
that failed to find impacts on student learning. Several found positive influences on teacher 
knowledge and/or practices but not on the measure of student outcomes used.
8 These measures of 
student outcomes were sometimes designed to evaluate the specific goals of the PD and sometimes 
were a more generic commercial instrument or state test. 
Authors noted a number of potential reasons for their findings, including lack of implementation 
fidelity in the conduct of the PD,
9 lack of opportunity for teachers to implement what they learned 
in the PD in their classrooms,10 and teacher turnover that reduced many teachers’ access to the 
PD.11 In one study, Garet and colleagues (2016) make a critically important point when they note 
that the content of PD could be misdirected—that, is not focused on the actual teaching knowledge 
and skills that are needed to support student learning.
12 It is obviously most important that what 
teachers are taught reflects the practices that can actually make a positive difference for student 
learning. That is, the content of professional development matters, along with its form. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 2
<<<PAGE=13>>>
Another crucial element is the knowledge 
that teachers bring to the PD experience—and 
whether it is sufficient to support their learning 
of particular pedagogical strategies. In one 
interesting case, where mathematics PD was 
conducted in a district that had very large 
numbers of uncredentialed teachers, researchers 
found positive effects on student learning only 
for those teachers who began with a higher 
level of content knowledge, signaling that the

improvement, and deeper student 
learning. 
effectiveness of PD may depend in part on 
how solid a content foundation teachers have with which to absorb its lessons.13 These and other 
considerations may influence the effectiveness of PD, even when it may share some of the features 
we identify here. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to unpack why specific initiatives 
have proved less than fully successful, we identify barriers to the implementation of effective PD as 
identified by researchers later in this paper. 
Goals and Outline of This Report 
Our primary goal is to illuminate the features of PD that have been found to be effective, in hopes 
that this analysis can help inform policymakers and practitioners responsible for designing, 
planning, and implementing potentially productive opportunities for teacher learning. 
We aim to provide practitioners, researchers, and policymakers with a research-based understanding 
of the kinds of PD that can lead to powerful professional learning, instructional improvement, and 
deeper student learning. By examining information about the nature of effective PD, policymakers and 
practitioners can begin to evaluate the needs of the systems in which teachers learn and do their work 
and consider how teachers’ learning opportunities can be more effectively supported. 
In the sections that follow, we first review the elements of effective PD initiatives identified through 
our review of recent literature, offering examples from specific studies and PD models. We then 
explore how the currently popular phenomenon of professional learning communities—often 
superficially implemented—can be effectively organized. Next, we provide an overview of the 
broader conditions that support or inhibit effective teacher PD in the United States, drawing on the 
broader PD literature. We conclude with considerations for policy and practice.

Design Elements of Efective Professional Development 
In recent decades, a “new paradigm” for PD has emerged from research that distinguishes 
powerful opportunities for teacher learning from the traditional, one-day, “drive by” workshop 
model.
14 The research on effective PD has begun to create a consensus about key principles in the 
design of learning experiences that can impact teachers’ knowledge and practices. 15 The ongoing 
expansion of this literature provides an opportunity to build upon this consensus with new 
insights, particularly given the increased prevalence of rigorous research designs in PD studies 
that boost confidence in the validity of findings. 
Although research on the effectiveness of PD has been mixed, positive findings have stimulated a 
general consensus about typical components of high-quality professional learning for teachers.
16 
This consensus, articulated by Desimone (2009) and others, holds that effective PD possesses a 
robust content focus, features active learning, is collaborative and aligned with relevant curricula 
and policies, and provides sufficient learning time for participants. Our review confirms and 
expands upon this five-part framework, providing additional specificity about the types of active 
and collaborative practices that underlie powerful teacher PD. 
Using the methodology detailed in Appendix A, we identify seven characteristics of effective 
PD. Specifically, we find that it: 
1. Is content focused 
2. Incorporates active learning utilizing adult learning theory 
3. Supports collaboration, typically in job-embedded contexts 
4. Uses models and modeling of effective practice 
5. Provides coaching and expert support 
6. Offers opportunities for feedback and reflection 
7. Is of sustained duration 
Successful PD models generally feature a number of these components simultaneously. The Reading 
Recovery program, described in detail in the box that follows, is an example of one program that 
possesses all seven elements and has been found to generate positive student gains. Other effective 
programs may possess most but not all of the seven features. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 4

Efective Professional Development in Practice: Reading Recovery 
Reading Recovery is an example of a professional development model that has demonstrated effectiveness in 
supporting student learning gains in dozens of studies over several decades on multiple continents.17 Reading 
Recovery was originally designed to provide individualized interventions for struggling readers in New Zealand, 
and has since been widely implemented in the U.K., Canada, and Australia. It was frst implemented in the U.S. 
in 1984, and grew to serve a peak number of 152,000 students nationwide in the 2000–01 school year.
18 In 
2010, the Ohio State University—the U.S. seat of Reading Recovery—received a $45 million federal i3 grant 
to fund the expansion of Reading Recovery. The university partnered with 19 universities across the U.S. to 
recruit and train teachers and schools to participate in the Reading Recovery program. The i3 grant supported 
teacher PD for 3,747 teachers, who served 387,450 students in one-to-one lessons, classroom teaching, or 
small-group instruction.
19 
The Reading Recovery theory of change asserts the critical role of the teacher in identifying students’ strengths 
and needs, and facilitating their learning by providing appropriate opportunities to acquire and use new reading 
skills.
20 The teacher’s practice is highly diagnostic and grounded in a substantial knowledge base about the 
learning-to-read process for diverse learners, as well as a sophisticated set of teaching skills applied in an 
individualized fashion for each learner. The basis of the Reading Recovery PD model is similarly informed by a 
very deliberate approach to acquiring and applying knowledge that is individualized to the needs of the teacher. 
To prepare teachers to play this critical role, Reading Recovery provides intensive PD that incorporates all 
seven of the elements of effective PD. In groups of 8 to 12, teachers complete a yearlong graduate-level 
training course taught by a literacy coach. This sustained training involves model lesson observation, teacher 
demonstration of effective teaching techniques, and frequent collaborative discussion between participants. 
After the training course, faculty from the partnering university support teachers in their classrooms and 
facilitate program implementation within their area.
21 Additional, ongoing PD for these teachers includes 
a minimum of six sessions with a Reading Recovery teacher leader and colleagues; opportunities for 
interaction and collaboration with school leaders and colleagues; and ongoing access to conferences and 
training institutes.
22
 A 2016 evaluation of the i3 funded initiative found that students who participated in the U.S. expansion of 
Reading Recovery signifcantly outperformed students in the control groups on measures of overall reading, 
reading comprehension, and decoding.
23 Moreover, these gains were nearly three times as large as average 
gains for similar broad instructional interventions. This effect translates to Reading Recovery students in the 
study gaining an additional 1.55 months of learning compared to the national growth average for 1st graders. 
Of particular interest during the i3 scale-up study was the performance of English language learners (ELLs) and 
rural students. Results indicated that there was a similarly large positive impact on their performance.
24 These 
fndings suggest that the Reading Recovery PD program is capable of positively impacting student achievement 
on a large scale and can help drive equitable learning outcomes for ELL and rural students. 
The section continues with a description of each characteristic with supporting literature and examples. 
Additional information about each study described in this section is available in Appendix B. 
Content Focus 
Professional learning that has shown an impact on student achievement is focused on the content 
that teachers teach. Content-focused PD generally treats discipline-specific curricula such as 
mathematics, science, or literacy. It is most often job embedded, meaning the PD is situated in 
teachers’ classrooms with their students, as opposed to generic PD delivered externally or divorced 
from teachers’ school or district contexts. This type of PD can provide teachers the opportunity to 
study their students’ work,
25 test out new curriculum with their students,26 or study a particular 
element of pedagogy or student learning in the content area.27 Ideally, the PD is aligned with school 
and district priorities, providing a coherence for teachers, as opposed to having PD compete with 
differing school and district priorities.
28 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 5
<<<PAGE=16>>>
Thirty-one of the 35 studies we reviewed 
featured a specific content focus as part of the 
PD model. Among the PD models without a 
specific content focus, two focused on specific 
pedagogies that were not discipline specific,
29 
and one study focused on supporting teachers in 
promoting inquiry-based learning and leveraging 
technology in support of standards-based 
instruction.
30 A final study provided insufficient

not the PD was content specific.31 
One study of PD for upper elementary teachers, which focused on helping teachers analyze science 
teaching and improve pedagogy, illustrates job-embedded and content-focused PD. Roth et al. 
(2011) studied teachers participating in The Science Teachers Learning from Lesson Analysis 
(STeLLA) program.
32 The project focused on both science content and pedagogy using a video-based 
analysis-of-teaching PD model. The PD began with a three-week summer institute focused on 
science content taught by faculty at a local university. Teachers in the STeLLA program also engaged 
in video analysis of teaching during the summer institute. In follow-up sessions throughout the 
school year, teachers utilized Student Thinking and Science Content Storyline Lenses, creating 
PD that was both content specific and classroom based. The Student Thinking portion of the PD 
focused on understanding students’ ideas for use in planning, teaching, and analysis of teaching— 
particularly in anticipating student thinking to assist teachers in responding to students’ ideas and 
misunderstandings in productive ways. The Science Content Storyline portion of the PD focused 
on the sequencing of science ideas and how they are linked to help students construct a coherent 
“story” that makes sense to them. STeLLA teachers met in small groups facilitated by a program 
leader and discussed video cases of teaching that could include video(s) of one classroom, student 
and teacher interviews, teacher materials, and student work samples.
33 
STeLLA teachers also taught a set of four to six model lessons themselves and analyzed their teaching 
using a structured protocol. Half of a study group would teach the lessons to their students, and the 
entire group would collaboratively analyze the teaching and student work, and revise the lessons for 
the other half to use. The roles would then switch and the second half of the group would teach the 
lessons in their classrooms, followed by collaborative analysis and subsequent revision. The analysis 
was highly scaffolded by the PD facilitators. STeLLA groups met for 58 hours of analysis throughout 
the school year, in addition to 44 hours during the three-week summer session for a total of 102 
hours. Roth et al. (2011) studied this group of teachers in comparison to a group of teachers who only 
attended the science content portion of the PD program.
34 The content-only teachers received just the 
44 hours of PD, and it was not explicitly connected to their classroom contexts. 
Results of the study showed that teachers who participated in the STeLLA program had students who 
achieved greater learning gains than comparison students whose teachers received content training 
only, as determined by pre- and post-test science content exams. Statistical analyses linked these 
gains in student learning with teachers’ science content knowledge, teachers’ pedagogical content 
knowledge about student thinking, and teachers’ ability to create a cohesive science content storyline. 
STeLLA teachers outperformed the content-only teachers and, moreover, were able to retain their 
content learning whereas content-only teachers were not.
35 A second randomized study of the STeLLA 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 6
<<<PAGE=17>>>
program similarly found positive effects for students of participating teachers.36 This study, similar to 
other studies in this review, suggests that PD that treats only content learning is not as effective as PD 
that links content learning to pedagogies supporting teachers’ students and practice.37 
Teacher professional learning that is context specific, job embedded, and content based is 
particularly important for addressing the diverse needs of students (and thus teachers) in differing 
settings. For example, in one study of PD for elementary science teachers in an urban school 
district, teachers of Latinx students learned science content as well as conversational Spanish 
and strategies for using culturally relevant pedagogies.
38 In another program targeting teachers of 
Latinx dual-language learners, monolingual teachers were provided with a range of instructional 
strategies to support children’s primary language 
development in Spanish.

experiences that should be in these content- and context-specific PD

to specific student populations with targeted 
strategies to support their achievement. 
Active Learning 
The design of PD experiences must address how teachers learn, as well as what teachers learn. 
Trotter (2006) outlines several theories of learning and adult development and identifies themes 
that are relevant for designing teacher PD. 
• Adults come to learning with experiences that should be utilized as resources for new 
learning. 
• Adults should choose their learning opportunities based on interest and their own 
classroom experiences/needs. 
• Reflection and inquiry should be central to learning and development.
40 
These themes provide a general framing that helps to explain why teacher PD that incorporates 
active learning experiences is effective in supporting student learning and growth. “ Active learning” 
suggests moving away from traditional learning models that are generic and lecture based toward 
models that engage teachers directly in the practices they are learning and, preferably, are 
connected to teachers’ classrooms and students. Active learning, in sharp contrast to sit-and-listen 
lectures, engages educators using authentic artifacts, interactive activities, and other strategies to 
provide deeply embedded, highly contextualized professional learning. Active learning is also an 
“umbrella” element that often incorporates the elements of collaboration, coaching, feedback, and 
reflection and the use of models and modeling. 
Opportunities for “sense-making” activities are important.
41 Such activities often involve modeling 
the sought-after practices and constructing opportunities for teachers to analyze, try out, and 
reflect on the new strategies.42 Active learning opportunities allow teachers to transform their 
teaching and not simply layer new strategies on top of the old, a hallmark of adult learning theory.43 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 7
<<<PAGE=18>>>
Greenleaf et al. (2011) describe an active teacher professional learning model that improved 
student science learning.44 California high school biology teachers participated in PD integrating 
academic literacy and biology instruction through a program called Reading Apprenticeship. The 
PD was inquiry based, subject focused, collaborative, and designed to address teachers’ conceptual 
understandings as well as pedagogical content knowledge. Each session was designed to immerse 
the teachers in the types of learning activities and environments they would then create for their 
students. Teachers engaged in activities to simulate their own discipline expertise in relation 
to literacy, and they also engaged in analysis of texts to identify potential literacy challenges to 
learners.
45 
In addition, teachers analyzed student work, videotaped classroom lessons, and studied cases of 
student literacy learning designed to foster high expectations of student learning. Metacognitive 
routines such as think-alouds and reading logs for science investigations were used in PD sessions. 
Teachers also practiced classroom routines to build student engagement and student collaboration 
(e.g., “think-pair-share,” jigsaws, text-based student discussion, and problem solving). An important 
part of the PD was a metacognitive reflection after each session that focused on the session’s impact 
on teachers’ learning and potential impact on their students’ development.
46 
The program employed 10 sessions over the course of a year. An initial five-day institute took place 
the first summer of the study, followed by two follow-up days of PD during year 1 and a final three-
day PD follow-up the summer after the academic year. During the study year, participants engaged 
in collaboration on a listserv that fostered the exchange of resources and ideas and was moderated 
by PD coaches. This multimodal, active learning PD model resulted in student achievement 
equivalent to a year’s reading growth compared with students of teachers assigned to a control 
group. Students of treatment teachers also performed better than their counterparts in control 
classrooms on state assessments in English language arts and biology.

instance, Buczynski and Hansen (2010) describe 
how 4th through 6th grade teachers had the 
opportunity to participate in “constructivist, 
hands-on experiences” through the use of science kits.
48 These were the same science kits that 
teachers would then go on to use in their classrooms with their students. Similarly, teachers in a study 
by Heller et al. (2012) completed the same scientific investigations they analyzed in written teaching 
cases.
49 In other studies, pedagogical and content experts would “teach” model lessons with teachers 
engaging as learners.50 Additionally, two studies incorporated role-playing as a part of teachers 
“practicing” lessons with their peers to better understand students and their learning.51 
Overall, 34 of the 35 studies incorporated some element of active learning in the design of the PD, 
while one study did not provide enough description of the PD model to ascertain whether active 
learning was present.

Collaboration 
As schools have increasingly As schools have increasingly structured teaching 
as a collaborative community endeavor, it makes structured teaching as a 
sense that teacher collaboration is an important collaborative community endeavor,

it makes sense that teacher can span a host of configurations—from

schoolwide collaboration to exchanges with feature of well-designed PD. other professionals beyond the school. 
In a program studied by Allen et al. (2011), 
teachers collaborated with a one-on-one coach.53 In this study, Virginia high school teachers 
enrolled in My Teaching Partner-Secondary, a web-mediated coaching program designed to improve 
teacher-student interactions. Teachers participated in an initial training workshop followed by 
twice-monthly coaching from a remote mentor. For each coaching session, teachers were asked to 
submit short videos of their practice, reflect on their teaching, and respond to questions from their 
coach regarding the relationship between teacher practice and student engagement. Each reflection 
was followed by a 20- to 30-minute phone conference with the coach. Teachers also attended 
monthly booster workshops and were given access to an annotated video library for the duration of 
the program.
54 
Overall, the program offered 20 hours of in-service training over 13 months, in addition to the 
focused work teachers were doing in their classrooms to design and reflect on their practice. 
Students whose teachers had participated in the program the previous school year demonstrated 
gains in student achievement relative to the control group, with student learning gains equivalent 
to an average increase from the 50th to 59th percentile.
55 A replication study featuring an extended, 
two-year version of the My Teaching Partner-Secondary model found similar promising results.56 
This model of PD is especially promising for teachers who may be in remote or rural schools and 
may not have access to professional learning opportunities more readily available in suburban or 
urban areas. 
Other studies have looked at collaboration at the school level.
57 One New Zealand study focused 
on schoolwide PD efforts in 195 schools spread across four cohorts of teachers.58 Teachers in 
these schools participated in a flexible whole-school professional development model designed to 
improve student literacy, particularly for low-performing students. Each of the participating schools 
selected a focus on reading or writing for the duration of the two-year project and was assigned an 
expert literacy facilitator to provide PD for teachers and school leaders. 
Facilitators visited each school biweekly to conduct classroom observations, model literacy 
instruction, provide coaching and feedback, and engage in discussion and other activities with 
school staff. Facilitators also trained a literacy leader at each school who provided additional 
support for colleagues. The project provided resources such as classroom observation and 
facilitation tools, as well as training and feedback for the expert facilitators throughout the 
two years. Students attending schools participating in the project outperformed achievement 
expectations relative to a nationally normed sample, especially in writing. Students in schools with 
a focus on improving writing improved at 2.9 to 3.5 times the expected rate. Students in schools 
with a focus on improving reading improved at 1.4 to 1.6 times the expected rate.

instruction and serve as support groups for each 
other’s work on their practice. Collective work 
in trusting environments provides a basis for 
inquiry and reflection into teachers’ own practices, allowing teachers to take risks, solve problems, 
and attend to dilemmas in their practice.
61 
Other studies focused on districtwide collaborative PD in efforts to bring larger-scale improvements 
to teaching and learning.
62 For example, in one Texas district, teachers engaged in on-site, 
small-group PD to promote inquiry-based, literacy-integrated instruction to improve English 
learners’ science and reading achievement.
63 Through the program, teachers and paraprofessionals 
participated in workshops where they reviewed upcoming lessons, discussed science concepts with 
peers, engaged in reflections on student learning, participated in inquiry activities as learners, 
and received instruction in strategies for teaching English learners. Researchers also provided 
teachers with lesson plans that incorporated strategies for effective instruction of English learners. 
Teachers met biweekly for collaborative, three-hour sessions, receiving six hours of PD per month; 
paraprofessionals met monthly for three hours. The program also included a focus on new and 
enhanced instructional activities for English learners. 
Students who received enhanced instructional activities and whose teachers received PD 
demonstrated significantly higher science and reading achievement than students who were 
engaged in business-as-usual instruction. Treatment students also earned passing and commended 
scores on district science benchmarks at higher rates than control group students.
64 By focusing 
on improving the practice of teachers of English language learners, this kind of collaborative, 
districtwide PD can have important implications for improving the equity of whole systems. 
Technology-facilitated PD such as the web-mediated coaching program studied by Allen et 
al. (2011) can also foster cyber collaboration,
65 which can be effective in improving student 
achievement.66 Landry et al. (2009), for example, describe a well-designed online PD program that 
improved early literacy outcomes for young children.67 In that study, described in additional detail 
later in the Feedback and Reflection section, early childhood educators participated in a facilitated 
online course on language and literacy instruction. The interactive course included videos models, 
message boards, and opportunities to practice skills in small groups. In this case, technology 
facilitated the incorporation of collaboration and other effective PD elements, such as active 
learning and modeling, in the professional learning design. 
Overall, 32 of 35 studies we reviewed incorporated some element of collaboration to support 
teacher professional learning, while three studies did not provide sufficient description to 
determine whether or not collaboration was a part of the model design. When PD utilizes effective 
collaborative structures for teachers to problem-solve and learn together, it can positively 
contribute to student achievement. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 10
<<<PAGE=21>>>
Use of Models and Modeling 
PD that utilizes models of effective practice has proven successful at promoting teacher learning 
and supporting student achievement. Curricular and instructional models and modeling of 
instruction help teachers to have a vision of practice on which to anchor their own learning and 
growth. The various kinds of modeling can include 
• video or written cases of teaching, 
• demonstration lessons, 
• unit or lesson plans, 
• observations of peers, and 
• curriculum materials including sample assessments and student work samples. 
All 35 studies reviewed here included curricular models and/or modeling of effective instruction 
in the delivery of content and pedagogical learning for teachers. For example, Heller et al. (2012) 
conducted a randomized experimental design of three intervention groups and one control 
group to study the effects of PD on elementary students’ learning in science.
68 The PD focused 
on pedagogical science content knowledge for elementary teachers, utilizing three different 
interventions, all of which proved successful in improving student achievement. 
One group of teachers analyzed written 
teaching cases, drawn from actual classrooms 
Curricular and instructional models

analyzed their own students’ work in relation 
to their teaching. Teachers in this intervention 
experienced carefully structured, collaborative 
analysis of their own students’ work, which required that they teach a unit. Discussion protocols 
for the analysis of student work were employed that focused teachers’ analysis on student 
understanding of content. These teachers took turns bringing in student work samples and 
formative assessment tasks that they analyzed collaboratively. Teachers also had access to a 
“task bank” of formative assessment model items they could use with their students. A third 
group utilized metacognitive analysis of their own learning experience in the form of reflective 
discussions about their own learning processes as they engaged in science content activities. 
The course was designed to help teachers identify concepts they found challenging to learn, 
examine the logic behind their own common misunderstandings of the content, and analyze the 
roles of hands-on investigations, discourse, and inquiry in science learning. Expert staff developers 
delivered a series of three courses (the PD was delivered in 8 three-hour sessions, for a total of 24 
contact hours with a facilitator).
69 
Findings of this study showed that students of teachers who participated in any of the PD 
opportunities had significantly greater learning gains on science tests than students whose teachers 
did not participate (with average gains of 19-22 percentage points compared to 13 points for control 
students). These effects were maintained a year later. Student justification of correct answers in 
year 1 of the study showed significant improvement from pre- to post-test for those students whose 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 11
<<<PAGE=22>>>
teachers analyzed student work samples (which incorporated the use of model assessments, as 
noted above). In the follow-up year, teachers who utilized cases of teaching also had significantly 
higher answer justification scores. Those teachers who focused on metacognitive analysis of their 
own learning experience showed no student gains in written justification of correct answers. The 
findings of this study are notable because the strongest effects on written justifications of answers, 
a task more complex than identifying correct answers on a content exam, are connected to the PD 
that focused on models of effective practice, including curricula and instruction, in combination 
with student work analysis and classroom pedagogical practice.
70

learning in conjunction with model curriculum

support. For example, Kleickmann et al. (2016) 
found that teachers who utilized educational 
curriculum materials alone had lower student 
achievement than those teachers who had access to those materials and expert support combined 
with collaborative active learning opportunities that focused heavily on sequencing and presenting 
science concepts to facilitate student learning.
71 
Doppelt et al. (2009) reported similar findings.72 Teachers in this study participated in content-
based collaborative inquiry sessions as support for a new 8th-grade science curriculum focused on 
electronics. Teachers participated in active learning based on the new curriculum—they engaged 
in the model lessons just as their students would. In addition, they spent much time in the 
workshops reflecting on instructional activities in their classrooms. They shared student work and 
instructional materials, actively discussing and reflecting on instruction. Students whose teachers 
used the new curriculum and participated in PD had statistically greater achievement than those 
students whose teachers used the new curriculum with no PD. Even more significant, achievement 
for students of those teachers who continued to use the older standard curriculum was greater than 
that of those students whose teachers used the new curriculum with no PD.
73 That suggests that 
students were better off if their teachers did not attempt to utilize new curricular materials without 
effective PD supporting them. 
Coaching and Expert Support 
The previous sections foreshadowed the role experts can have in helping to guide and facilitate 
teachers’ learning in the context of their practice. In their work with educators, experts—typically 
educators themselves—often play this critical role by employing the types of professional learning 
strategies outlined above, such as modeling strong instructional practices or supporting group 
discussion and collaborative analysis of student work. Such coaches may also share expertise about 
content and evidence-based practices, as well. 
The practice of providing coaching or other expert support for educators was identified in 30 of the 
35 studies reviewed. Four of the studies did not specify who delivered the PD or whether expert 
support was offered. In one case, coaching and expert support were not offered as part of the PD: 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 12
<<<PAGE=23>>>
Shaha and Ellsworth (2013) describe a web-based PD platform with opportunities for teachers 
to engage with PD content through objective-setting, videos, forums, and communities, without 
specified expert support.
74 
One common structure for providing expert support is one-on-one coaching in the context of a 
teacher’s own classroom.
75 Experts also shared their knowledge as facilitators of group workshops76 
or as remote mentors utilizing technology to communicate with educators.77 Individuals with 
a variety of backgrounds can fill the role of expert; in the reviewed studies, coaches and other 
experts ranged from specially trained master teachers
78 and instructional leaders79 to researchers 
and university faculty.81 For example, Roth et al. (2011) relied on both program leaders to facilitate 
small-group learning and university-based scientists to teach science content to educators.81 
The coaching model studied by Powell and colleagues (2010) offers an example of expert support 
that contributed to student learning gains.
82 The PD was designed to provide early childhood 
educators with individualized feedback to improve early literacy instruction. Educators attended 
an initial two-day orientation that introduced program content and fostered relationship building 
between coaches and educators. Educators then participated in biweekly coaching sessions with a 
university-based literacy coach, in person or remotely. 
Across both formats, coaches and teachers worked together to choose a specific instructional 
practice on which to focus each session. Coaches then observed the teachers’ practice and provided 
both supportive and constructive feedback. On-site coaches observed educators for approximately 
90 minutes, then the two met for 30 minutes to debrief the observation and provide oral and written 
feedback, including recommendations to improve practice. For remote coaching, educators shared 
15-minute video clips and coaches provided detailed written feedback, supported by links to video 
exemplars and other materials available through the program. The semester-long program included 
16 hours of workshops and seven coaching sessions.
83

literacy coaching program showed significantly 
larger gains and better performance on a number

those whose teachers had not participated.
84 
Recent literature also suggests that coaching or other expert scaffolding can support the effective 
implementation of new curricula, tools, and approaches by educators.
85 This is consistent with 
earlier research providing evidence that teachers who receive coaching are more likely to enact 
desired teaching practices and apply them more appropriately than those receiving more traditional 
PD.
86 Taken together, the literature demonstrates that expert supporters can play a critical role in 
creating effective PD. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 13
<<<PAGE=24>>>
Feedback and Refection 
Feedback and reflection are two other powerful tools found in effective PD; they are often employed 
during mentoring and coaching but are not limited to these spaces. As noted earlier, feedback 
and reflection are critical components of adult learning theory. Professional development models 
associated with gains in student learning frequently provide built-in time for teachers to think 
about, receive input on, and make changes to their practice by providing intentional time for 
feedback and/or reflection. While feedback and reflection are two distinct practices, they work 
together to help teachers move thoughtfully toward the expert visions of practice that they may 
have learned about or seen modeled during PD. 
Thirty-four of the 35 reviewed studies specified 
that PD included efforts to support educators 
in reflecting on their practice; one study 
offered no data about reflections on practice. 
Greenleaf and colleagues (2011) documented 
one approach to incorporating reflection into 
PD models.
87 After high school biology teachers 
participated in literacy activities as learners, 
they participated in a debrief, describing the 
elements of the activity that extended their

literacy learning and considering implications 
and adaptations of the pedagogy for their classrooms. This reflection process was designed to 
bolster teachers’ own learning and to support their teaching literacy in science. 
In addition, 24 studies outlined processes for providing educators with feedback on their practice. 
(The remaining 11 did not specify whether feedback was provided to participants). Landry 
and colleagues (2009) describe multiple opportunities for educators to receive feedback in a 
program targeting early childhood educators’ ability to promote children’s language and literacy 
development.
88 In the program, which was implemented across four states, educators enrolled 
in a facilitated online course focused on language and literacy instruction, eCIRCLE. The course 
included videos of model lessons, online coursework and knowledge assessments, and opportunities 
to plan lessons and practice skills in small groups and in teachers’ own classrooms. The course also 
offered interactive message boards that were moderated by expert facilitators. Teachers participated 
in four hours of this coursework per month throughout the school year. Participating educators also 
received a supplemental curriculum on preschool language and literacy skills and were encouraged 
to monitor children’s language and literacy progress using a standardized tool. In addition, some 
educators participated in biweekly onsite mentoring sessions with the expert facilitators. For those 
educators receiving mentoring, mentors first observed teacher practice, then facilitated reflective 
follow-up and provided both positive and constructive feedback to educators using a structured 
format. Whether through online forums or in-person coaching, teachers participating in the 
program were offered opportunities to receive feedback from specially trained experts.
89 
The researchers’ randomized controlled study of the program found that students of teachers 
who received PD through the program demonstrated greater gains in phonological awareness, an 
important emergent literacy skill, than students of those who did not.
90 Researchers also found 
that students of teachers who received both expert mentoring and feedback on children’s progress 
experienced the greatest gains on a variety of language and literacy outcomes. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 14
<<<PAGE=25>>>
In effective PD programs, the practices of generating feedback and supporting reflection often 
include opportunities to share both positive and constructive reactions to authentic instances of 
teacher practice, such as lesson plans, demonstration lessons, or videos of instruction.
91 These 
activities are frequently undertaken in the context of a coaching session92 or a group workshop 
facilitated by an expert.93 In a few cases, feedback was shared among teachers.94 In each of these 
settings, effective PD programs leveraged feedback and opportunities for reflection to create richer 
environments for teacher learning.

in short, one-off workshops.
95 The traditional 
episodic and fragmented approach to PD does 
not afford the time necessary for learning that is “rigorous” and “cumulative.”
96 Professional 
development that is sustained, offering multiple opportunities for teachers to engage in learning 
around a single set of concepts or practices, has a greater chance of transforming teaching practices 
and student learning. 
None of the PD initiatives described in this review occurred in the context of a single, isolated 
encounter.
97 The programs instead typically spanned weeks, months, or even academic years, with 
ongoing engagement in learning by teachers. These findings are consistent with previous literature 
on the duration of effective PD, which suggests that professional learning must be sustained to 
have an impact.
98 Beyond the findings of many studies of individual PD programs, Wenglinsky 
(2000) found in an analysis of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data that 
spanned many different teacher experiences across the country that stronger instructional practices 
in mathematics and science were associated with professional development that was extended 
and sustained.
99 In a review of literature, Yoon et al. (2007) identified nine studies of PD using 
experimental or quasi-experimental designs and found that the effective PD models examined in 
these studies offered an average of 49 hours of development per year, with an associated average 
boost in student achievement of 21 percentile points.
100 
Thirty-one of the 35 studies we reviewed explicitly described PD that was sustained over time 
through recurring workshops, coaching sessions, or engagement with online platforms; the 
remaining four studies did not specify a particular format or duration. The most common model for 
PD among these studies was participation in an initial, intensive workshop, followed by applications 
in the classroom and additional development days or coaching sessions to extend and reinforce 
educator learning.
101 For example, teachers participating in the middle school science PD program 
described by Penuel et al. (2011) attended a two-week summer workshop, followed by ongoing work 
in their classrooms supported by four development days throughout the school year.
102 Several other 
studies engaged teachers in formal coursework that followed a traditional academic schedule.103 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 15
<<<PAGE=26>>>
Another common strategy is to engage teachers in multiple sessions of a similar structure, often 
over a semester or school year, to promote meaningful professional learning.104 The program 
described by Heller et al. (2012) included 8 three-hour sessions in which certain ideas about science 
instruction were taught and discussed, while teachers also engaged in related activities in their 
classrooms between the sessions. The model studied by Doppelt et al. (2009) was delivered in 
five workshops, each lasting four hours.
105 Between workshop classes, the teachers implemented 
related activities, which were grist for their reflections and discussion in the workshops. Although 
these models varied in the overall duration of the PD and the distribution of hours across the 
program, all provided opportunities for learning across multiple engagements, along with the 
ongoing connected learning that occurred for teachers within their classrooms as they applied the 
curriculum ideas and teaching strategies they were working on in the course or workshop series. 
One benefit of sustained PD may be the opportunity for teachers to continue their learning 
outside the formal meetings of the program, whether in their own classroom, in collaboration with 
colleagues, or by less formal means. As Darling-Hammond et al. (2009) argue: “The duration of 
professional development appears to be associated with stronger impact on teachers and student 
learning—in part, perhaps, because such sustained efforts typically include applications to practice, 
often supported by study groups and/or coaching.”
106 By returning to PD settings over time, teachers 
have an opportunity to refine and apply their understanding of material in their classrooms. 
For example, the two-year PD model studied by 
By promoting learning over time, Johnson and Fargo (2014) engaged teachers in 
intensive summer workshops as well as ongoing both within and between sessions, 
learning during the school year to enhance 
PD that is sustained may lead to science instruction for Spanish-speaking 
elementary school students.
107 The program many more hours of learning than

included graduate-level coursework on teaching 
elementary science, as well as an orientation 
to a new, inquiry-based science curriculum and 
strategies for culturally relevant pedagogy. Teachers’ learning from this intensive workshop was 
reinforced through occasional release days and monthly grade-level workshops with professional 
learning communities. These additional sessions supported teachers in deepening their learning 
and provided space for ongoing support in implementing the new curriculum. This cycle was 
repeated in the second year, with an additional summer workshop and continued release days.
108 
This model not only offered teachers the opportunity to return repeatedly to the PD material over 
the course of a semester, but also to apply their learning within the context of their classroom 
between workshops. By promoting learning over time, both within and between sessions, PD that is 
sustained may lead to many more hours of learning than is indicated by seat time alone.

Realizing the Promise of Professional Learning Communities 
This review has so far offered rich descriptions of professional development models that have 
incorporated various elements of effective PD. One currently popular model is the use of 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs). While many professional learning community efforts 
have been poorly implemented and superficial in their design and impact, there is evidence that 
PLCs can, when implemented with a high degree of quality, support improvements in practice, along 
with student learning gains. Well-implemented PLCs provide ongoing, job-embedded learning that 
is active, collaborative, and reflective. 
This section moves beyond our review of effective PD models to explore the growing body of 
research about the conditions under which PLCs can be an effective strategy for supporting ongoing 
teacher learning within and across schools. 
The Benefts of Analyzing Student Work and Student Data 
The examination of student work is often a focus of productive professional learning communities. 
Analyzing student work collaboratively gives teachers opportunities to develop a common 
understanding of what good work is, what common misunderstandings students have, and 
what instructional strategies may or may not be working and for whom.
109 For example, a study 
investigating three high-achieving schools that have continuously beaten the odds on standardized 
tests found that teachers’ use of multiple student data sources to collectively reflect upon and improve 
instructional practices in team meetings contributed to increases in student achievement.

(1997) analyzed three sets of data (School 
Restructuring Study, National Educational 
Longitudinal Study, and Study of Chicago School Reform) to understand how various reforms 
influence improved educational experiences for students.
112 In their findings, the authors linked 
successful professional learning communities to reduced dropout rates among students; lower 
absenteeism rates; and academic achievement gains in mathematics, science, history, and reading. 
Another finding had important implications for school equity: The particular characteristics 
of strong professional communities—shared intellectual purpose and a sense of collective 
responsibility for student learning—reduced the “traditionally strong relationship between 
socioeconomic status and achievement gains in mathematics and science.”

Learning From Professional Communities Beyond the School 
Positive effects of professional communities that operate beyond the school level have also been 
documented by a number of researchers.114 These are often organized via networks that connect 
teachers around subject matter or other shared educational concerns. Lieberman and Wood (2002) 
reported on the work of the National Writing Project (NWP), one of the most successful teacher 
networks, to understand how teacher learning in a community can be a source of efficacy and 
confidence in the process of adopting new practices.
115 The NWP , initially called the Bay Area 
Writing Project, began in 1973 as a partnership in California between the University of California, 
Berkeley, and local school districts. It has grown to more than 185 sites in all 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
116 The heart of the model is the local school-
university partnerships, which operate as autonomous sites to support context-specific strengths 
and meet context-specific challenges. “These sites are designed to be robust professional and social 
communities that occupy an intermediary or ‘third space,’ neither wholly of the university nor 
wholly of the school districts.”
117 
Despite the autonomy of the local sites, there 
are common design features and core principles

that guide each site and are aligned with all the can be a source of effcacy and 
elements outlined above. The national network 
confdence in the process of focuses on supporting the success of each local 
adopting new practices. site. NWP local sites first focus on creating 
community among a small group of teachers 
during a five-week summer institute in which 
teachers engage in writing, share their work, 
and critique their peers. In the process of making their work public and critiquing others, teachers 
learn how to make implicit rules and expectations explicit, and how to give and receive constructive 
feedback for students. These summer institutes are held at each site and run by “teacher 
consultants” who are trained and supported by the national network.
118 
The summer institutes, which were designed to promote risk-taking and collaboration, provide 
a foundation for ongoing learning for teachers once they have left. These ongoing professional 
learning programs are collaboratively designed by schools and universities and led by teacher 
consultants, NWP veteran teachers. In addition, NWP provides many ways to promote active, 
collaborative learning within and across sites; newsletters, annual conferences, and opportunities to 
lead workshops are catalysts for the continuous engagement of teachers, creating the intersection 
of professional learning communities within the school and across the profession.
119 
An important aspect of the NWP’s success is the inclusion of program research starting from the

Efective Professional Development in Practice: 
National Writing Project’s College-Ready Writers Program 
The College-Ready Writers Program (CRWP) is a National Writing Project program that focuses 
specifcally on the argument writing of students in grades 7 through 10 by introducing teachers 
to new instructional practices based on higher standards for college- and career-ready writing. A 
two-year random assignment study of the program’s implementation in 12 local Writing Project 
sites has demonstrated its promise for supporting student learning.
120 
SRI conducted the study of CRWP in 22 high-poverty rural districts across 10 states—Alabama, 
Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and 
Tennessee. Despite such geographical and contextual diversity, the CRWP was implemented with a 
high degree of fdelity. The study design randomly assigned 44 high-poverty rural districts to either 
the CRWP program or a control group. The CRWP components included: PD of at least 90 hours 
over two years with supports that included demonstration lessons, coaching, co-designing learning 
tasks, co-planning, curricular resources including lesson units for argument writing, and formative 
assessment tools to help teachers focus on student learning. In contrast, the control group 
engaged in “business as usual” PD.
121 
The program succeeded in supporting both teacher and student learning despite the challenges 
that high-poverty rural districts often face for implementing effective PD. CRWP was found to 
have a positive, statistically signifcant impact on three of four attributes of student writing: 
content, structure, and stance. The remaining attribute, writing conventions, was marginally 
signifcant. Authors of the study note, “… this study of teacher professional development is one 
of the largest and most rigorous to fnd evidence of an impact on student academic outcomes,” 
indicating the power of high-quality PD to affect student achievement improvements at scale.
122 
There are several characteristics of the CRWP that distinguish it from many other programs and 
which align with research on quality PD. Three key elements are: 
1. A sustained focus on learning over time with explicit modeling, engagement in, and feedback 
about pedagogical writing strategies. 
2. A teacher-driven system that is enacted with collaboration at the center of the professional 
learning work. 
3. Active learning focused on classroom practices with student work at the center. 
Additionally, this PD is focused on a particularly complex task—using nonfction text as the evidence 
for writing a well-reasoned argument.

Creating the Conditions for Efective Professional 
Development: Opportunities and Challenges 
This review of research on professional 
development models that have positively 
impacted student learning has aimed to identify 
and illustrate professional learning elements 
in order to help shine light on powerful 
teacher learning experiences. Examples of 
PD that have raised student achievement can 
help policymakers and practitioners better 
understand what goes into quality teacher 
professional learning. This review does not

explain, however, why some well-designed PD 
does not improve student achievement.123 In this section, we consider studies both within and 
beyond the scope of our review to explore factors that support or complicate the implementation 
of effective PD. We find that conditions for teaching and learning both within schools and at the 
broader systems level can inhibit the effectiveness of teacher PD. 
School Level 
Several researchers have sought to understand why some PD has proven insufficient to affect 
teaching practice and raise student achievement in schools.
124 In their study of 4th to 6th grade 
teachers, Bucznyski and Hansen (2010) discussed several barriers to the implementation of PD.125 
They challenge the notion that PD is only as effective as a teacher’s will to employ the knowledge 
and skills gained. They note, “… teachers that are willing to implement professional development 
practices in the classroom often face hurdles that are beyond their control.”
126 Teachers may also 
face hurdles that are within their control, but which are difficult, if not impossible, to attend to, 
given the challenging nature of their specific school environments. 
Among these barriers are a lack of time allotted to teaching curriculum that uses the newly acquired 
knowledge and skills; the need to teach mandated curriculum on a pacing guide; challenges 
of teaching English learners without specific PD to address students’ learning needs; a lack of 
resources (such as curriculum materials, technology, or science equipment); and classroom 
management issues. Of these barriers, the study’s authors noted that lack of resources was the 
largest barrier to PD implementation, commenting that teachers often have to pay for their own 
materials for their classrooms. As a result, 
[w]hen funds are out of pocket for teachers, a financial divide is in place for students 
of more affluent teachers and students of teachers whose own financial resources are 
limited. Other resources provided by schools, such as technology, are also limited.
127 
One teacher in the study noted on a survey, “Having to locate, borrow, or purchase items for an 
experiment is time consuming and not always possible.”128 
These barriers affect students and teachers in a wide range of contexts; they are of particular 
concern for schools and districts located in high-poverty neighborhoods where financial constraints 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 20
<<<PAGE=31>>>
are often particularly acute. The researchers recommend that teachers be given strategies during PD 
to proactively address possible obstacles as they arise.129 
Johnson and Fargo (2010) echoed these equity challenges, discussing the specific obstacles to 
applying the lessons of PD in urban schools.
130 They note, “Teachers in urban schools often get 
caught up in the many distractions occurring on a daily basis and struggle to engage learners who 
are often distracted by complicated lives outside of school.”
131 Crises such as school closings and the 
uncertainty of employment were cited as examples of the type of “turbulence” that urban science 
teachers faced in the course of acquiring and implementing new learning from PD opportunities.
132 
These examples also demonstrate how the obstacles faced by teachers in schools may actually be 
manifestations of broader issues that stem from systemic problems. In the case of limited funding, 
for example, the learning experiences of teachers as well as students are influenced by broader 
policy about resource allocation. 
System Level 
Challenges to implementing effective PD extend beyond the school and classroom. A New 
America report from Tooley and Connally (2016) identified system-level obstacles to effective PD 
and concluded that there are four overarching areas where improvement is needed to facilitate 
increased effectiveness of PD. 
1. Identifying PD needs: Teacher PD is often determined without understanding what 
teachers need. This shortfall is frequently exacerbated by a lack of shared vision around 
what excellent teaching entails. In addition, preparation and training for principals and 
instructional leaders often fail to address how leaders can identify and organize needs-
based PD. Without systems in place to ensure teachers’ needs are being identified and met, 
PD will not be as effective as it should be. 
2. Choosing approaches most likely to be effective: As noted in this review, there is a 
reasonably strong consensus about the kind of professional learning opportunities likely 
to yield student achievement. Still, a great deal of PD is implemented that does not meet 
these standards. “One-off” workshops are easy to schedule and require less time and 
human capital to implement than evidence-based approaches. Teacher contracts and state 
recertification requirements also tend to encourage these models by emphasizing seat time 
as the metric for gauging engagement with PD. 
3. Implementing approaches with quality and fidelity: Even when educators have 
knowledge of effective PD models, implementation presents its own obstacles. For example, 
a school or district may create a program that includes coaching for teachers. However, it 
is not sufficient to simply designate coaches and have them available for teachers; many 
other variables affect coaches’ effectiveness. The authors note, “The coach’s expertise in 
the teachers’ grade span, subject, and/or school context; the depth of observation, feedback, 
and suggestions for things to try differently; the authority of a coach to recommend next 
steps; time and accountability for teachers to follow through with recommended next steps” 
have implications for the success of the program.
133 Other implementation barriers include 
the lack of an integrated, coherent approach to instruction and insufficient capacity. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 21
<<<PAGE=32>>>
4. Assessing PD outcomes: Few schools, districts, or state education agencies have created 
good systems of tracking PD, let alone systems for analyzing the quality and impact of PD. 
Without a sense of what is working and why, it is hard to adopt and implement professional 
learning for teachers that is evidence based and designed to address potential obstacles.
134 
Even in the case of well-designed PD, these obstacles can impede the effectiveness of professional 
learning and hinder its impact on student learning and achievement. The challenges with 
implementing and scaling evidence-based practices underscore that translating promising PD 
research into practice remains one area ripe for improvement.

Conclusions and Policy Implications 
Professional development is an important strategy for ensuring that educators are equipped to 
support deep and complex student learning in their classrooms. However, research shows great 
variation in the extent to which PD programs accomplish this goal. This paper has examined recent 
studies of successful PD models that report student learning gains. We identify seven common 
design elements of these effective PD approaches. 
1. They are content focused. 
2. They incorporate active learning strategies. 
3. They engage teachers in collaboration. 
4. They use models and/or modeling. 
5. They provide coaching and expert support. 
6. They include time for feedback and reflection. 
7. They are of sustained duration. 
Across the reviewed studies, these elements have been combined in a variety of ways to support 
teachers’ professional learning. Indeed, none of the successful programs featured attributes in 
isolation: As Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) note, the combination of these elements creates a 
collaborative culture that results in a form of collective professional capital that leverages much 
more productive, widespread improvement in an organization than would be possible if teachers 
worked alone in egg-crate classrooms.
135 Regardless of the specific model employed, PD should 
be well designed, incorporating elements of effective PD, as we have described. It should also be 
linked to identified teacher needs, should ensure that teachers have a say in the type of learning 
they require to best support their students, and should be regularly evaluated so that quality can be 
continually improved. 
Implications for Policy 
Supporting and incentivizing the kind of evidence-based PD we have reviewed here could be 
facilitated by changes in policy. For example: 
• Policymakers could adopt standards for professional development to guide the design, 
evaluation, and funding of professional learning provided to educators. These standards 
might reflect the features of effective professional learning outlined in this report as well as 
standards for implementation.
136 
• Policymakers and administrators could evaluate and redesign the use of time and school 
schedules to increase opportunities for professional learning and collaboration, including 
participation in professional learning communities, peer coaching and observations across 
classrooms, and collaborative planning. 
• States, districts, and schools could regularly conduct needs assessments using data 
from staff surveys to identify areas of professional learning most needed and desired 
by educators. Data from these sources can help ensure that professional learning is not 
disconnected from practice and supports the areas of knowledge and skills educators want 
to develop. 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 23
<<<PAGE=34>>>
• State and district administrators could identify and develop expert teachers as mentors 
and coaches to support learning in their particular area(s) of expertise for other educators. 
• States and districts can integrate professional learning into ESSA school improvement 
initiatives, such as efforts to implement new learning standards, use student data to inform 
instruction, improve student literacy, increase student access to advanced coursework, and 
create a positive and inclusive learning environment. 
• States and districts can provide technology-facilitated opportunities for professional 
learning and coaching, using funding available under Titles II and IV of ESSA to address 
the needs of rural communities and provide opportunities for intradistrict and intraschool 
collaboration. 
• Policymakers can provide flexible funding and continuing education units for learning 
opportunities that include sustained engagement in collaboration, mentoring, and 
coaching, as well as institutes, workshops, and seminars. 
Implications for Implementation and Practice 
At the same time, well-designed programs must also be implemented well to be effective. Even the 
best designed PD may fail to produce desired outcomes if it is poorly implemented due to barriers 
such as 
• inadequate resources, including needed curriculum materials; 
• lack of shared vision about what high-quality instruction entails; 
• lack of time for planning and implementing new instructional approaches; 
• conflicting requirements, such as scripted curriculum or pacing guides; and 
• lack of adequate foundational knowledge on the part of teachers. 
Common obstacles to PD should be anticipated and planned for during both the design and 
implementation phases of PD. Implementing PD well also requires responsiveness to the needs of 
educators and learners and to the contexts in which teaching and learning will take place. 
In the end, well-designed and implemented PD should be considered an essential component of a 
comprehensive system of teaching and learning that supports students to develop the knowledge, 
skills, and competencies they need to thrive in the 21st century. To ensure a coherent system that 
supports teachers across the entire professional continuum, professional learning should link to 
their experiences in preparation and induction, as well as to teaching standards and evaluation. It 
should also bridge to leadership opportunities to ensure a comprehensive system focused on the 
growth and development of teachers.

Appendix A: Methodology 
This paper builds upon an earlier review of effective teacher professional development by Darling-
Hammond et al. (2009). To identify elements that are prevalent in effective PD, we reviewed the 
empirical literature on models that have demonstrated benefits for student learning. Our review 
includes studies from recent decades that use rigorous methodologies to demonstrate a positive 
link between teacher PD and student outcomes. 
Specifically, each study included in the review either employs an experimental or quasi-
experimental comparison group, or uses appropriate statistical modeling and hypothesis testing 
to estimate the effect of teacher PD on students’ academic outcomes, with controls for context 
variables and student characteristics. The review includes studies that find positive, statistically 
significant effects of PD on student achievement. All studies included in the review appear in peer-
reviewed journals, or represent rigorous, large-scale research studies submitted to federal agencies 
and subject to review. 
We drew on Darling-Hammond et al.’s (2009) survey to identify articles published before 2010 
with methodologies and findings to qualify for inclusion in the current review. We paired this 
approach with a thorough scan of more recent literature, using database searches to identify studies 
published from 2010 on that meet the criteria for inclusion. Researchers used keyword searches to 
cull relevant literature from Google Scholar, ERIC, EBSCO, JSTOR, and SAGE in early fall of 2016 and 
again in spring 2017. Key terms used in these searches include: “teacher professional development,” 
“professional learning,” “student outcomes,” and “student achievement.” Although we endeavored 
to undertake an exhaustive search of recent literature, it is possible that relevant studies have been 
excluded because they were not catalogued under any of the key search terms used. Appendix B 
details each of the 35 studies that surfaced using this method that met our methodological criteria, 
eight from Darling-Hammond et al. (2009) and 27 from the broader scan of recent literature. 
We then reviewed these studies and qualitatively coded them for program features and 
characteristics. To begin this process, a researcher generated a list of deductive codes based on 
previous literature, including Darling-Hammond et al. (2009) and Desimone (2009). Deductive 
codes included, for example, collaboration and 50+ hour duration. After an initial reading of the 
papers in the review, researchers refined and expanded coding to include features that emerged 
from the studies, including sustained duration, opportunities for feedback, and reflection on practice. 
Researchers created decision rules for each of the refined codes and engaged in ongoing discussion 
throughout the coding process to ensure inter-coder reliability. 
At times, the defined elements of effective PD can overlap. For example, collaboration can be both 
an active learning strategy and an element unto itself. However, it is possible to engage in active 
learning without structured collaboration and it is possible to engage in forms of collaboration, 
such as discussing a theory or idea, that do not involve active applications. 
Appendix C provides an overview of the elements that were exhibited by the PD model(s) featured 
in each study. Two studies that otherwise met the criteria for inclusion in the review were excluded 
from Appendix C because they contain insufficient detail regarding the PD model to enable 
qualitative coding of the program elements. These studies—Wenglinsky (2000) and Desimone et al. 
(2013)—analyze large-scale data sets spanning a variety of contexts and, as a result, provide limited 
descriptions of the PD provided to teachers. However, these studies provide important evidence 
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE | EFFECTIVE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 25

regarding the effectiveness of PD, so are retained in Appendix B and referred to where relevant in 
the body of the paper. They have been omitted from Appendix C and the counts of the prevalence of 
each element in the text due to limited details regarding the PD to which teachers were exposed. 
We recognize that this methodology is not without limitations. Because studies of PD typically 
examine comprehensive models that incorporate many elements, this paper does not seek to draw 
conclusions about the efficacy of individual program components. We are also unable to comment 
on the elements of PD models that did not yield positive results on student achievement. It is 
conceivable that these ineffective models share one or more elements with those highlighted in this 
study and yet fail to produce positive effects on student achievement, perhaps due to weaknesses 
in content, design, or implementation. However, it is beyond the scope of this paper to detail why 
specific programs are unsuccessful. Rather, the study seeks to describe the characteristics of PD that 
research has been found to have positive relationships with student outcomes. Although the paper 
dedicates a section to obstacles and challenges to implementation, this remains an area worth 
further investigation.

Description:
 Researchers analyzed three years of results from the Teachers’
Opportunity to Learn (TOTL) survey of middle school mathematics teachers
in Missouri. Analysis focuses on what types of professional development, as
defned by the survey (standard professional development, teacher collaboration,
university courses, professional conferences, informal communication, and
individual learning) are associated with student achievement growth. 
Methodology: Three-year descriptive survey analysis
• n=467 middle school mathematics teachers in 91 Missouri schools
• Student achievement measured using the Missouri Assessment Program in 
mathematics 
Findings: Student achievement growth rates were positively associated with 
school average amounts of participation in teacher collaboration, professional 
conferences, and informal communication with colleagues. Controlling for student 
characteristics and teacher qualifcations, a one-hour increase in the school 
average amount of teacher collaboration was associated with a .01 increase in 
the annual growth rate in student math scores over the three years. A one-hour 
increase in the school average amount of teacher participation in professional 
conferences and informal communication were associated with increases in the 
annual growth rate of .15 and .23 respectively.

student achievement. Science, 333(6045), 1034–1037.
Description: Teachers enrolled in My Teaching Partner–Secondary, a web-mediated 
coaching program designed to improve teacher-student interactions. Teachers 
participated in an initial training workshop followed by twice-monthly coaching 
from a remote mentor. For each coaching session, teachers were asked to submit 
short videos of their practice, refect on their teaching, and respond to questions 
from their coach regarding the relationship between teacher practice and student 
engagement. Each refection was followed by a 20- to 30-minute phone conference 
with the coach. Teachers also attended monthly “booster” workshops and were 
given access to an annotated video library for the duration of the program. Overall, 
the program offered 20 hours of in-service training over 13 months in addition to 
the time teachers spent working on the program’s concepts in their classrooms. 
Methodology: Two-year randomized controlled trial
• n=78 secondary school teachers and 2,237 secondary students in 12 Virginia 
schools
• Student achievement measured by Virginia state standardized tests in relevant 
subject
Findings: Students whose teachers participated in the program the previous 
school year demonstrated gains in student achievement of .22 standard deviations 
(equivalent to an average increase from the 50th to 59th percentile) relative to 
students whose teachers had not participated.

Description:
 Teachers participated in My Teaching Partner–Secondary, a web-
mediated coaching program to improve teacher-student interactions in the classroom.
Teachers participated in an initial half-day training with master teachers from
the research team who would go on to provide remote coaching for the duration
of the program. This initial workshop focused on the dimensions of high-quality
student-teacher interactions, such as teacher sensitivity and regard for student
perspectives, and included videos of exemplary practice. Over the next two academic
years, teachers engaged in 12 remote coaching cycles focused on student-teacher
relationships, classroom organization, and instructional support. In each coaching
cycle, teachers shared a video of a typical lesson with their coach, who chose short
segments of the lesson to highlight for analysis and discussion. Coaches shared
these segments with teachers, who were asked to examine their own practice,
student responses to their practice, and the relationship between teacher practice
and student reactions. This refection was followed by a 20- to 30-minute phone
conference focused on instructional strategies to strengthen interactions with
students. This coaching cycle occurred every 6 weeks. The 2-year program concluded
with a fnal booster workshop. 
Methodology: Stratifed randomized controlled trial
• n= 86 secondary school teachers and 1,194 secondary students in a diverse 
urban school district.
• Student achievement measured by Virginia state standardized tests in the 
subject areas taught by the participating teachers.
Findings: At the end of the two-year program, students whose teachers 
participated demonstrated gains in achievement equivalent to an average 
increase from the 50
th to 59th percentile relative to students whose teachers 
had not participated (ES = 0.48).

Description:
 Teachers participated in PD using either the Dynamic Integrated
Approach (DIA) or the Holistic Approach (HA). Using the DIA, teachers’ skills were
evaluated and assigned to one of fve developmental stages, with each stage focusing
on increasingly complex teaching skills. The Holistic Approach examines attitudes,
beliefs, and practices not limited to stages and skills. Teachers attended nine
monthly sessions throughout the school year. The DIA group sessions consisted of
assigning teachers’ developmental stages and collaborating and creating individual
action plans. Between each PD session, teachers implemented their plans in their
classrooms, received feedback, and revised their plans. Teachers in the HA group
refected and discussed a problem based on attitude, beliefs, and practice. The
remaining sessions were used to create, discuss implementation, and adjust an
action plan with colleagues. Each monthly session lasted 3-4 hours in duration
totaling 27-36 hours. Both groups completed a total of 88.5 hours of PD. 
Methodology: Randomized controlled trial
• n=123 3rd- to 6th-grade teachers in Cyprus schools and 131 students
• Criterion-reference math tests
Findings: Overall, the achievement of students whose teachers employed DIA 
was 0.34 standard deviations higher than those in the HA group.
Students of teachers at stages 1 and 2 scored lower (-0.52 and -0.24 standard 
deviations respectively) than those of teachers at stage 3. Students of teachers 
at stage 4 had the highest achievement gains. Students of teachers in stage 
4 of the DIA group scored 0.32 standard deviations higher than students of 
teachers at stage 3.

teacher practice; uncovering connections. Teacher and Teacher Education, 26,
599–607.
Description:
 Teacher PD focused on integrated, inquiry-based instruction in
elementary classrooms. An Inquiry Learning Partnership (ILP) was formed between
two urban school districts, a science museum, and a university to develop
the professional development program for 4th- to 6th-grade trade teachers.
The co-designed PD consisted of standards-based content and inquiry-based
strategies. PD consisted of lectures on subject matter by university professors
paired with constructivist, hands-on experiences for teachers with science kits
and demonstration of inquiry practices. Science content was taught by university
faculty, while pedagogy sessions were led by the ILP director and district resource
teachers. Pedagogy session topics were identifed as formative assessment, use
of student science notebooks, unpacking standards, teaching English learners,
adapting curriculum, best practices, and addressing the achievement gap. PD was
administered during a 35-hour, weeklong summer institute. In addition, teachers
attended at least seven of 29 available seven-hour Saturday content sessions over
the course of an academic year. 
Methodology: Quasi-experimental study within an exploratory case study
• n=118 veteran 4th- to 6th-grade teachers across two urban districts’ 
low-performing schools and 1,964 5th-grade students
• Student achievement measured by scores on 2005 and 2006 California 
Standards Tests (CSTs) from grade 5 and from local assessments
Findings: In one district, among participating teachers’ students, 9% more 
scored profcient or advanced on the CST in 2006 than in 2005, compared to 
a 2% gain from teachers who did not participate in PD. In the second district, 
the scores of participating teachers’ students were stable while those of 
nonparticipating teachers declined, showing a 4% drop in the percent scoring 
profcient or advanced. The greatest gains in student achievement occurred at 
sites where multiple teachers were involved in the PD.

language learners. Early Childhood Research Quarterly 25: 194–206. 
Description: Nuestros Niños Early Language and Literacy Program is a research-based 
PD program focused on effective instructional practices to promote language and 
literacy skills for pre-k children in general, and Latinx dual language learners (DLLs) 
in particular. The PD was designed for monolingual teachers who used English as 
the language of instruction and was structured as a three-day institute conducted 
over several weeks, with follow-up sessions throughout the course of the year. The 
institute contained six modules focused on topics of literacy and DLLs. Teachers were 
also provided with a range of instructional strategies and suggestions for specifc 
accommodations to facilitate the development of children’s primary language in 
Spanish. Follow-up sessions with bilingual Latinx consultants supporting learning 
communities of teachers took place over the school year. During the learning 
communities, teachers worked collaboratively to create lesson plans and view 
recordings of themselves and others teaching to refne and improve their own 
instructional strategies for Latinx DLL children. Consultants also met with teachers 
one-on-one. 
Methodology: Randomized controlled trial 
• n=55 teachers and 193 pre-k Latinx dual language learners in North 
Carolina’s More at Four Pre-Kindergarten Program
• Student achievement measured in English and Spanish on the Woodcock 
Language Profciency Battery-Revised: English and Spanish Forms; the 
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and corresponding Test de Vocabulario en 
Emagenes Peabody; the Phonological Awareness Tasks; Naming Letters; and 
Where’s My Teddy Story and Print Concepts
Findings: Teachers’ general language and literacy practices and those specifc 
to Latino ELLs measurably improved. For outcomes assessed in Spanish, there 
were signifcantly greater gains for children in the intervention group than in the 
control group on the Phonological Awareness (ES=.69) and Rhyme matching 
(ES=.68) tasks.

Description:
 The study outlines the professional development mathematics coaches
received to deliver onsite, whole-school teacher professional development in
elementary schools. Coaches received specialized training in fve courses focusing
on mathematics content, mathematics pedagogy, and educational leadership that
were designed for the program and provided through local universities. Courses
were co-taught by mathematicians, and mathematics educators and coaches were
provided access to course materials, video exemplars, and case studies. Coaches’
coursework was completed over two years. Data from the study indicate that coaches’
primary activities in their placement schools included coaching teachers and
supporting assessment. 
Methodology: Three-year randomized controlled trial 
• n=36 elementary schools in urban and urban-edge school districts 
• Student achievement measured by Virginia’s statewide standardized 
achievement test in mathematics
Findings: Assigning elementary mathematics coaches improved student 
achievement in grades 3-5 by .14 to .19 standard deviations in each grade 
level. Stronger effects on achievement were observed in grades 4 and 5 than 
in grade 3. The presence of a mathematics coach did not have a signifcant 
impact on student achievement during the frst year of placement.

Description:
 Early elementary school teachers participated in a month long summer
workshop designed to enhance their understanding of children’s mathematical
thinking. University faculty led the workshop, which was focused on research about
children’s approaches to addition and subtraction and principles for its application
in the classroom. Participation in the workshop earned teachers three university
credits and entailed attendance at lectures and involvement in a variety of active-
learning opportunities such as group discussions and workshops, unit planning, and
shared analysis of curricular materials. Teachers also received free time to work on
projects of their choosing, individually or with colleagues and workshop leaders as
participants preferred. Following the workshop, teachers met with workshop leaders
one time; teachers also had continued access to a resource person affliated with the
program throughout the year. Overall, the workshop provided 80 hours of professional
development.

students 
• At pre-test, student achievement was measured using the Iowa Test of Basic 
Skills (ITBS). At post-test, researchers used ITBS and other standardized and 
researcher-designed mathematics items.
Findings: Students of teachers who participated in the workshop outperformed 
students of teachers who did not on three of six measures of mathematics 
achievement, including one measure of computation and two measures of 
problem solving. These students were also more inclined to be more cognitively 
guided in their beliefs about mathematical learning and to report greater 
understanding of mathematics.

Study and Professional Development Description Study Methodology and Findings Related to Student Outcomes
Desimone, L., Smith, T., & Phillips, K. (2013). Linking student achievement 
growth to professional development participation and changes in instruction: A 
longitudinal study of elementary students and teachers in Title I schools. Teachers 
College Record, 115(5), 1–46.
This article focused on two types of professional development: content-focused 
and participation-focused (time spent on math instruction). Using data from the 
Longitudinal Evaluation of School Change and Performance (LESCP), authors aimed to 
answer: 1) to what extent do teachers’ self-reported topic coverage and emphasis on 
memorization and solving novel problems, and time spent on mathematics instruction 
predict student growth? Does a teacher’s time spent on mathematics instruction and 
emphasis on memorization and solving novel problems predict student growth? and 2) 
to what extent does teacher participation in content-focused professional development 
predict the aspects of instruction in the frst question to be related to increases in 
students’ achievement gains in mathematics? To what extent does participation in 
content-focused PD predict if a teacher will spend more time on memorization or novel 
problem-solving and relate to student achievement in mathematics. Researchers 
analyzed teachers’ instructional practice and participation in professional development 
over three years and student academic growth over those three years. 
Methodology: Three-year quasi-experimental study using hierarchical linear 
modeling
• n=457 3rd- to 5th-grade teachers and 4,803 students in 71 high-poverty 
schools
• Student outcomes measured by SAT-9 tests
Findings: Student growth was 15% of a standard deviation slower than 
average for students whose teachers focused on basic topics and 15% of a 
standard deviation faster than average for students whose teachers focused 
on advanced topics. Growth was 7.5% of a standard deviation slower than 
average for students whose teachers emphasized memorizing facts. Teachers 
who participated in professional development that focused on math content or 
instructional strategies in mathematics (in Year 1) were more likely to teach in 
ways associated with student achievement growth; for example, they were 11% 
of a standard deviation more likely to teach advanced topics.

(2009). Evaluating the impact of facilitated learning community approach to 
professional development on teacher practice and student achievement. Research 
in Science and Technological Education, 27(3), 339–354. 
Description: Teachers participated in content-based collaborative inquiry (CBCI) 
sessions in order to receive support for a new 8th-grade science curriculum focused on 
electronics. Two sessions occurred prior to implementation; two during; and the fnal 
workshop occurred after the implementation as a fnal refection on the unit. Teachers 
were engaged in activity learning situated in the curriculum—they actually engaged 
in the lessons just as their students would. In addition, they spent much time in the 
workshops refecting on instructional activities in their classrooms. They shared student 
work and instructional materials, actively discussing and refecting on instruction. 
In year 1 of the study, curriculum designers led the PD. Year 2, teacher leaders from 
the frst cohort led the PD. Key elements of the PD were the opportunity for teachers 
to discuss students’ understandings, collect and analyze data, share results with 
colleagues, and problem-solve instructional solutions collaboratively. In total, teachers 
participated in fve four-hour workshop sessions. 
Methodology: Two-year quasi-experimental study 
• n=23 8th-grade science teachers in a mid-sized urban school district 
• Student achievement was measured by a six-question knowledge test in year 
1 and a 20-question knowledge test in year 2 of the study
Findings: Students whose teachers participated in the PD had an advantage 
in achievement over those whose teachers did not. Students whose teachers 
used the new curriculum and participated in PD had signifcantly greater 
achievement than those students whose teachers used the new curriculum 
with no PD (ES=1.17). This remained true for students whose teachers 
continued to use the new curriculum.

Efects of problem based economics on high school economics instruction. Final 
report. National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, NCEE 
2010–4002.
Description:
 PD focused on the Problem Based Economics curriculum developed by
the Buck Institute for Education on 12th-graders’ content knowledge measured by
the Test of Economic Literacy and a performance task as opposed to a traditional
lecture and textbook format. The problem-based approach allows students to
reason through and solve a real-world problem through inquiry-based pedagogy.
Control group and intervention teachers taught two consecutive semesters (fall and
spring) of economics. Intervention teachers taught the Problem Based Economics
curriculum, while the control group taught the typical course. Only student data for
the spring were included in the analysis. Intervention teachers taught fve of the nine
modules in the problem-based curriculum. Intervention teachers participated in a
fve-day professional development workshop to become familiar with the module and
pedagogical strategies. They were trained by current and former economics teachers.
On four occasions throughout the semester, once at the beginning and throughout
the module completion, teachers participated in a group conference call with
developers and the study team to discuss progress and challenges and get feedback.
Teachers also had the ability to call and email Buck Institute staff throughout the
implementation. The PD took place for one academic school year—a fve-day training
and periodic check-ins throughout the school year. 
Methodology: Within-school randomized controlled trial
• n=64 11th- and 12th-grade economics teachers and 4,350 students in 
Arizona and California 
• Student outcomes measured by Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) and a 
performance task assessment
Findings: Teachers who participated in the PD and had support in Problem 
Based Economics had students who scored 0.27 standard deviations higher 
on the TEL (on average got 2.6 test items correct) than teachers who had not 
participated in the PD.

Writing Project’s College-Ready Writers Program in high-need rural districts. Journal 
of Research on Educational Efectiveness, 1-26.
Description:
 The National Writing Project’s (NWP) College-Ready Writers Program
(CRWP) provided professional development to improve teaching about argument
writing at the secondary level. The program used a three-part approach that included
collaborative professional development, support for the implementation of new
curricular resources, and formative assessment. Teachers engaged in communities
of practice that included analysis of student work; participated in mini units that
positioned the teachers as learners; and co-planned and co-taught NWP’s argument
writing curriculum, observed demonstration lessons, and engaged in refection on
their practice with teacher consultants. Formative assessments provided rapid
feedback and suggested next steps to improve teacher practice. The program
provided approximately 90 hours of professional development over two years. NWP
provided training and support for district leaders, including one-on-one phone calls
and site visits, throughout the program. 
Methodology: Two-year district-randomized controlled trial analyzed using 
multilevel models
• n=329 teachers in 44 rural, high-need districts across 10 states
• Student achievement measured using an on-demand argument writing 
assessment
Findings: Teacher participation in the program was associated with positive 
effects on the quality of student writing. Researchers documented positive, 
statistically signifcant effects on three out of four student writing attributes 
measured: content (ES=.20), structure (ES=.20), and stance (ES=.15). The 
remaining attribute, writing conventions, was marginally signifcant (ES=.12).

study group: Impact of the professional development model on reading instruction 
and student outcomes in frst grade classrooms. American Educational Research 
Journal 47(no. 3): 694–739. 
Description: The focus of this study was a Teacher Study Group (TSG) PD model with 
a focus on 1st-grade teachers’ reading comprehension and vocabulary instruction. 
Teachers in the TSGs met to discuss readings on research-based for teaching “at-risk” 
students and how to implement the strategies into their own teaching. Teachers 
collaboratively planned lessons using strategies they read and discussed. Teachers 
actively engaged in facilitator-guided problem-solving discussions and applied learning 
activities using a recursive process: (1) debrief previous application of the research, 
 walk through the research, (3) walk through the lesson, and (4) use collaborative (2)
planning. This PD took place over 16 sessions (twice a month) October to June. The 
sessions lasted approximately 75 minutes each. In between sessions, teachers 
practiced and refected upon the strategies in their classrooms. 
Methodology: Randomized controlled trial 
• n=81 1st-grade teachers and 468 students from three large urban school 
districts across three states 
Student achievement in comprehension and vocabulary achievement were • 
measured by three Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) 
tests, two subtests of the Woodcock Diagnostic Reading Battery (WDRB), 
and for a subset of participants, the California Achievement Test. 
Findings: Positive effects of the treatment were found on teachers’ knowledge 
and practices in the TSG sample. Controlling for initial performance on letter 
fuency measures, teacher knowledge and practice factors were signifcantly 
and positively related to all of the student outcome measures. Despite small 
sample sizes, signifcant differences between the treatment and control groups 
on reading outcomes emerged on the California Achievement Test (ES=.20), 
and marginally signifcant effects were found on students’ oral vocabulary 
(ES=.44). Effects were noticeable (.21, .21, and .23), though non-signifcant, 
for the Letter-Word Identifcation, Reading Vocabulary, and Oral Reading 
Fluency subtests, respectively.

impacts of reading apprenticeship professional development. American Educational 
Research Journal, 48(3), 647–717. 
Description: High school biology teachers participated in professional development 
integrating academic literacy and biology instruction through Reading Apprenticeship. 
The program was inquiry-based, subject-focused, collaborative, and designed to 
address teachers’ conceptual understandings as well as pedagogical content 
knowledge. The sessions were designed to immerse teachers in the types of learning 
activities and environments they would then create for their students. They engaged 
in activities to simulate their own discipline expertise in relation to literacy, and they 
also engaged in analysis of texts to identify potential literacy challenges to learners. 
In addition, teachers analyzed student work, videotaped classroom lessons, and 
studied cases of student literacy learning designed to foster high expectations of 
student learning. Metacognitive routines such as think-alouds and reading logs for 
science investigations were also used in professional development sessions. In the 
sessions, teachers practiced classroom routines to build student engagement), student 
collaboration (e.g., think-pair-share, jigsaws, and text-based student discussion and 
problem- solving (e.g., text annotation). Metacognitive refection after each session 
focused on the impact of these sessions on teachers’ learning and potential impact on 
their students’ development. 
The 10 professional development sessions took place over the course of a year. An 
initial fve-day institute took place the frst summer of the study. This was followed by 
two follow-up days of professional development during year 1, and a fnal three-day 
follow-up occurred the summer following the academic year. During the study year, 
participants engaged in collaboration on a listserv moderated by professional 
development coaches, including the exchange of resources. 
Methodology: Group-randomized experimental study utilizing hierarchical linear 
modeling 
• n=105 California high school biology teachers in underserved public high 
schools 
Student learning measured using California states tests of English language • 
arts, reading comprehension, and biology 
Findings: Students in treatment classrooms performed better than controls 
on state standardized assessments in English language arts (ES=0.23), 
reading comprehension (ES=0.24), and biology (ES=0.28). Treatment classes 
performed about a year ahead of the control classes at the end of the study. 
Effect sizes for white students in treatment classrooms ranged from 0.33 to 
 and for English learners from 0.18 to 0.23. Positive impacts were also 0.40
found on ELA and biology test scores of Latinx students, although these were 
not statistically signifcant. No signifcant test score differences were found 
for African American students across classroom types. Test scores for reading 
comprehension and biology were higher in intervention schools than in control 
schools for both males and female students.

Diferential efects of three professional development models on teacher knowledge 
and student achievement in elementary science. Journal of Research in Science 
Teaching, Vol. 49, No. 3, pp. 333–362.
Description: 
This PD focused on pedagogical science content knowledge for
elementary teachers, utilizing three different interventions. One group of teachers
analyzed prestructured written teaching cases. These cases were drawn from actual
classrooms and written by teachers. Thus, it was an analysis of practice approach,
which incorporated student work analysis, student teacher dialogue analysis, and
teacher thinking and behaviors. Teachers also engaged in the same scientifc
investigations written about in the cases during their PD sessions. Embedded in this
PD was identifying the logic behind common scientifc misunderstandings, analyzing
teachers’ instructional choices, and considering teaching implications for their own
students.
A second group analyzed their own student work in relation to their teaching. Teachers 
in this intervention experienced carefully structured, collaborative analysis of their 
own students’ work, which was derived from a common unit they taught. Discussion 
protocols for the analysis of student work were employed, which focused teachers’ 
analysis on student understanding of content. In addition, these sessions also focused 
on the analysis of tasks to identify characteristics that support formative assessments 
to elicit information about student thinking and make instructional decisions based on 
student thinking. 
A third group utilized metacognitive analysis of their own learning experience. This took 
the form of refective discussions about their own learning processes as they engaged 
in science content activities. The course was designed to help teachers identify 
concepts they found challenging to learn, examine the logic behind their own common 
misunderstandings of the content, and analyze the roles of hands-on investigations, 
discourse, and inquiry in science learning. Expert staff developers delivered a series 
of three courses (one PD was delivered in eight three-hour sessions, for a total of 24 
contact hours with a facilitator). 
Methodology: Randomized controlled trial
• n=256 4th-grade teachers and 7,000 students across six states
• Student outcomes measured by achievement tests developed in prior 
analyses of the PD; includes selected-response items and written 
justifcations for answers
Findings: Students of teachers who participated in PD had signifcantly greater 
learning gains on standardized tests than those who had teachers who did not 
participate, with average gains of 19-22 percentage points on the assessments 
compared to 13 points for control students. Effect sizes ranged from .4 to .8 
over the two-year study. 
Teachers who participated in the PD focused on student work analysis had 
students who improved their scores signifcantly compared to controls. In the 
follow-up year, students of both those teachers and teachers who focused on 
cases had signifcantly higher test score gains. Those teachers who focused 
on metacognitive analysis did not improve students’ written justifcations as 
compared to the controls in either year. 
English language learner student scores were raised by approximately 18 
percentage points in all three interventions—all three signifcantly higher than 
the average 7.1 percentage points gained in the control group.

professional development on Hispanic student performance on state mandated 
assessments of science in elementary school. Journal of Elementary Science 
Teacher Education 25: 845–859. 
Description: Elementary school science teachers participated in a professional 
development program to improve science instruction and facilitate culturally relevant 
pedagogy. The two-year program began with a two-week summer workshop that 
included graduate-level coursework on teaching elementary science, as well as 
orientation to a new science curriculum and culturally relevant pedagogy. During 
the second summer, the workshop focused on teaching elementary science and 
learning conversational Spanish. Professional development was reinforced through 
occasional release days and monthly grade-level workshops with professional 
learning communities. Over 2 years, the program provided 224 hours of professional 
development. 
Methodology: Three-year case study drawn from a cluster randomized, 
controlled trial
• n=21 teachers in two elementary schools in a large urban school district in a 
southwestern state
• Student science achievement was measured by performance on a state-
mandated science assessment.
Findings: Students attending the school whose teachers participated in 
the PD program demonstrated signifcantly larger improvements in science 
achievement over time relative to students who attended the school with 
business-as-usual PD for their teachers.

Description: Middle school science teachers working in an urban school district 
participated in a professional development program to strengthen standards-based 
instruction and foster culturally responsive teaching. The hands-on, whole-school 
program began with a two-week summer institute designed to foster relationship-
building among teachers and introduce a new science curriculum and culturally 
responsive teacher strategies. Throughout the frst year of the program, teachers 
attended monthly workshop days to refne the curriculum to better meet the needs of 
their students and undertook peer observations, providing positive and constructive 
feedback to colleagues. In the second year of the program, teachers attended a 
three-day summer session and additional monthly release days, and conducted home 
visits to deepen relationships with students and families. In total, the program offered 
nearly 200 hours of professional development, with 120 hours in the frst year and 77 
hours in the second. 
Methodology: Two-year quasi-experimental study 
• n=16 middle school science teachers from four schools in one urban district
• Student science achievement was measured using specially designed 
assessments. 
Findings: Students of teachers participating in the PD demonstrated 
signifcantly larger growth in science achievement than students at control 
schools in the second year of the program, with gains twice as large as those of 
students in the control schools.

text-based analytical writing for mainstreamed Latino English language learners in 
grades 6 to 12. Journal of Research on Educational Efectiveness 4(3): 231–263. 
Description: Secondary English teachers participated in the Pathway Project to improve 
their ability to employ cognitive strategies to support English language learners’ 
interpretive reading and analytical writing skills. Through the program, teachers learn to 
structure analytical writing activities by engaging in revisions to an on-demand writing 
assessment completed by students. The program began by introducing teachers to a 
cognitive strategies tool kit for supporting students’ reading and writing in association 
with literacy texts. Subsequent sessions focused on analyzing student performance, 
strengths, and needs through writing assessments; collaboratively designing lessons 
incorporating cognitive strategies for literature instruction; and setting goals for future 
years. These sessions were complemented by monthly meetings at each school led by 
literacy coaches and designed to support teachers in implementing Pathway strategies. 
The program also provided curricular materials aligned with cognitive approaches to 
literature instruction, accompanied by guidance for implementing them in teachers’ 
classrooms. Overall, teachers participated in six full-day professional development 
sessions and fve after-school sessions, for a total of 46 hours of professional 
development throughout the school year. 
Methodology: Cluster randomized controlled trial analyzed using hierarchical 
linear modeling 
• n=103 secondary English teachers and more than 2,000 students in a large, 
urban school district 
Student achievement measured using an on-demand writing assessment • 
and the California Standards Tests for English language arts 
Findings: Students of teachers who participated in the Pathway Project 
performed signifcantly better (ES=.35) on an on-demand text-based analytical 
writing assessment and on the overall state standardized test of English 
language arts (ES=.07), after controlling for initial performance. On the 
on-demand writing assessment, 22% of students of participating teachers 
received at least two scores of 4 or above (out of 6), as compared to 14% 
of students in the control group. On the state standardized test, students of 
participating teachers scored on average 3 percentage points higher.

of expert scafolding in elementary science professional development on teachers’ 
beliefs and motivations, instructional practices, and student achievement. Journal 
of Educational Psychology, 108(1) 21–42. 
Description: PD focused on implementing a social constructivist approach to 
elementary science teaching through educational curriculum materials (ECM). Three 
groups of teachers participated in PD, each group with a different level of scaffolding 
(support for their learning through ECM). One group used the ECM materials with 
no expert scaffolding. Two other groups received 16 all-day workshops of PD to 
supplement the use of ECM. The frst six (38 hours) focused specifcally on foating and 
sinking. The 10 additional workshops (62 hours) focused on the other 10 topics. The 
focus of the workshops was to develop content and pedagogy. The “high scaffolding” 
group of teachers engaged in active learning activities such as scientifc investigations, 
providing counter examples, developing analogies, and engaging in discussions. In 
general, the PD the teachers received mimicked the process by which they were to 
guide their elementary students. Teachers were also prompted to refect on their own 
learning processes and to consider their own naïve science conceptions to help them 
understand the need to construct learning to ft students’ existing schema. In addition, 
expert helped teachers to understand sequencing of science concepts to facilitate 
student learning. 
In contrast, the “low scaffolding” group of teachers received little of this support. 
Instead, the expert PD coach demonstrated a series of lessons on foating and sinking 
in a 3rd-grade classroom without scaffolding teachers’ content and pedagogical 
knowledge. Teachers observed these lessons and conducted pre- and post-interviews 
with students. They were encouraged to discuss their observations in relation to the 
student interviews. 
The PD spanned approximately fve months, with scaffolded groups receiving an 
additional 100 hours of PD during this time. 
Methodology: Two-year quasi-experimental study 
• n=73 elementary science teachers and 1,039 3rd and 4th-grade students 
Student achievement was measured through an assessment of students’ • 
conceptual understanding of foating and sinking 
Findings: Students taught by teachers who received “high scaffolding” 
exhibited signifcantly higher achievement than did students taught 
by “low scaffolding” teachers (ES=.45). Student achievement for both 
“high scaffolding” and “low scaffolding” teachers signifcantly surpassed 
achievement in classes taught by teachers with no scaffolding (ES=.55).

development model to scale. Journal of Learning Disabilities 39(4): 306–324. 
Description: Head Start educators took part in a professional development program 
to enhance instruction in support of improved language and early literacy skills for 
young children. The program began with a four-day, small-group workshop focused on 
strategies for supporting language enrichment and early literacy growth. The workshop 
relied on interactive strategies such as guided discussion, group problem-solving, and 
role-playing. Following the workshop, specially trained mentors conducted ongoing 
training sessions throughout the school year. Educators also received one hour of 
coaching per week from the mentors in their frst year of training. Teachers who 
continued in the program for a second year participated in a two-day refresher course 
and received one hour of coaching biweekly, as well as ongoing training. 
Methodology: Two-year quasi-experimental study 
• n=750 Head Start educators and 5,728 children in 20 urban and rural 
centers across Texas 
Child outcomes were measured using fve instruments—four standard • 
assessments of early literacy and a specially designed social-emotional 
development scale 
Findings: Researchers identifed greater gains in language and literacy 
skills for children whose teachers participated in professional development, 
although results varied by program site. In year 1 of the study, researchers 
observed moderate to large positive associations between teacher professional 
development and children’s early literacy and language skills at 20% to 40% 
of sites, depending on the measure. In year 2 of the study, moderate to large 
effect sizes were observed in between 20% and 68% of sites.

Efectiveness of comprehensive professional development for teachers of at-risk 
preschoolers. Journal of Educational Psychology 101(2), 448–465. 
Description:
 Early childhood educators participated in professional development to
enhance teachers’ ability to promote children’s language and literacy development.
Through the program, educators participated in a facilitated online course focused
on language and literacy instruction, eCIRCLE. The facilitated course included videos
of model lessons, interactive message boards, and opportunities to plan lessons and
practice skills in small groups. Participating educators also received a supplemental
curriculum on preschool language and literacy skills and were encouraged to use
ongoing monitoring of student progress. Teachers participated in four hours of
coursework per month throughout the school year. In addition, some teachers
received detailed feedback on children’s language and literacy progress that was
linked to curricular activities and/or two-hour, on-site mentoring sessions twice per
month. 
Methodology: Randomized controlled trial
• n=262 early childhood educators and up to eight children per classroom in 
158 schools in Florida, Maryland, Ohio, and Texas
• Student outcomes measured through a standardized vocabulary assessment 
Findings: Collectively, students of educators in all four professional 
development groups demonstrated greater gains in phonological awareness 
than students of educators in the control group (ES=0.14). 
Students of teachers who received both mentoring and detailed, instructionally 
linked feedback on children’s language and literacy progress experienced the 
greatest gains in a variety of language and literacy outcomes. This included 
greater gains than students whose teachers received business-as-usual 
professional development on expressive vocabulary (ES=0.19) and print and 
letter knowledge (ES=0.26).

Description: Teachers engaged in on-site, small-group professional development 
to promote inquiry-based, literacy-integrated instruction to improve English 
learners’ science and reading achievement. Through the program, teachers and 
paraprofessionals participated in workshops where they reviewed upcoming lessons, 
discussed science concepts with peers, engaged in refections on student learning, 
participated in inquiry activities as learners, and received instruction in strategies for 
teaching English learners. Researchers also provided teachers with lessons plans 
that incorporated strategies for effective instruction of English learners. Teachers met 
biweekly for three-hour sessions, receiving six hours of professional development per 
month; paraprofessionals met monthly for three hours. The program also included a 
focus on new and enhanced instructional activities for English learners. 
Methodology: Quasi-experimental study
• n=246 5th-grade teachers and 166 students in four lower middle schools in 
an urban district in southeast Texas
• Student achievement was measured by performance on science and reading 
district and state tests and Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy 
Skills (DIBELS)
Findings: Treatment group students scored signifcantly higher scores on the 
DIBELS than control group students. In addition, students of teachers who 
participated in PD earned passing and commended scores on district science 
and reading benchmarks at higher rates than students of those who did not 
participate (ES=0.127 - .238). A similar pattern was observed for reading 
achievement on the state test, with an average passing rate of 69% in the 
treatment group and 60% in the control group.

Marek, E. & Methven, S. B. (1991). Efects of the learning cycle upon student and 
classroom teacher performance. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 28(1), 
41–53. 
Description: Elementary science teachers participated in a monthlong in-service 
workshop designed to support the adoption of a new approach to science instruction. 
The workshop aimed for participants to understand that science is a process, or 
“search for knowledge,” rather than a body of knowledge, and that students who learn 
science as a search for knowledge construct their own understandings about the 
world. It was also designed to help teachers learn how to develop “learning cycles, ” 
an approach to curriculum that is compatible with approaching science as a process 
or method. During the workshop, teachers experienced several learning cycles as 
learners; this involved gathering data, identifying key concepts from the data, and 
expanding their understanding by applying the concept to other topics. Teachers then 
taught each other using learning cycles from a provided curriculum before preparing 
their own learning cycles for use in the classroom. All teachers agreed to use learning 
cycles in their classrooms following the workshop. The workshop offered 100 hours of 
in-service training over four weeks. 
Methodology: Quasi-experimental matched pairs design 
• n=27 elementary science teachers and 226 k- to 5th-grade students 
• Student outcomes were measured using three Piagetian conservation tasks, 
a measure of cognitive development, and an analysis of descriptive language 
used by students during interviews. 
Findings: Students of treatment group teachers demonstrated signifcantly 
greater growth in their conservation reasoning abilities than control group 
teachers. Treatment group students also demonstrated enhanced quality and 
quantity of descriptive language relative to control group students.

Evaluation of the Four-Year i3 Scale-Up. Philadelphia, PA: Consortium for Policy 
Research in Education.
Description: Educators participated in an intensive yearlong graduate-level training 
course in order to teach Reading Recovery, an intervention targeted at struggling 
1st-grade readers. In support of teachers receiving the PD are literacy coaches who 
conduct the training course and university faculty who support implementation. 
Training is designed to enhance a teacher’s ability to identify students’ strengths 
and needs, and to facilitate his or her learning by helping students develop a set of 
self-regulated literacy strategies that govern the use of meaning, structure, letter-sound 
relationships, and visual cues in reading and writing. Once trained, teachers provided 
students with individual, daily 30-minute lessons over the course of a 12- to 20-week 
period. 
Methodology: Parallel randomized controlled trial and quasi-experimental 
study
• n=1,122 schools across the country in a wide variety of locales (e.g., urban, 
rural, suburban) and 6,888 students
• Student achievement was measured using Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) 
Reading Total assessment and the state 3rd-grade reading exam.
Findings: For each set of reading scores, the treatment group’s performance 
was one-third to one-half standard deviation larger than that of the control 
group.

classroom organization, read-aloud techniques, story-related lesson plans, and play-
based literacy activities. Participating teachers also received a large supply of books for 
classroom libraries and students’ home libraries. Overall, teachers participated in 30 
hours of training, including three daylong workshops and seven shorter meetings. 
Methodology: Stratifed randomized controlled trial
• n=18 kindergarten teachers and 377 children from six schools in a single 
large eastern urban school district 
• Student outcomes measured using two widely used early literacy instruments
Findings: Students of teachers receiving training and books demonstrated 
higher scores and larger gains on all early literacy measures than did students 
of teachers who did not receive training. In all but one case, these differences 
were statistically signifcant.

Description:
 New Zealand schools participated in a fexible whole-school professional
development model designed to improve student literacy, particularly for low-
performing students. Participating schools each selected a focus on either reading or
writing for the duration of the two-year project and were assigned an expert literacy
facilitator to provide professional development for teachers and school leaders.
Facilitators visited each school biweekly to conduct classroom observations, model
literacy instruction, provide coaching and feedback, and engage in discussion and
other activities with school staff. Facilitators also trained a literacy leader at each
school who provided additional support for their colleagues. The project provided
resources such as classroom observation and facilitation tools, as well as training
and feedback for the expert facilitators throughout the two-year period. 
Methodology: Quasi-experimental design utilizing hierarchical linear modeling
• n=22,506 middle school students in 195 New Zealand schools
• Student achievement was measured by a New Zealand standardized 
assessment 
Findings: Students attending schools participating in the project outperformed 
a nationally normed sample, especially in writing. Students in schools with a 
focus on improving writing improved at 2.9 to 3.5 times the expected rate (1.15 
to 1.4 standard deviations). Students in schools with a focus on improving 
reading improved at 1.4 to 1.6 times the expected rate (0.72 to 0.85 standard 
deviations). 
Learners from all groups (defned by gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic 
status) outperformed expectations based on national norms.

Description:
 Teachers participated in the Enhancing Missouri’s Instructional
Networked Teaching Strategies (eMINTS) professional development program. The
goal of eMINTS is to help teachers develop student-centered, purposeful instruction
fostered by technology utilization. While the comprehensive program involves
whole-school PD elements, the bulk of the program is focused on the development of
teachers. Specifcally, teachers engaged in approximately 240 hours of PD over the
course of two academic years through formal training sessions, a model school site
visit, within-building communities of practice, and individualized coaching sessions.
Some study schools also received an additional year of Intel Teach courses and
online tools to support eMINTS learning. 
Methodology: Three-year cluster randomized controlled trial 
• n=60 high-poverty, rural Missouri middle schools
• Student achievement was measured using Missouri Assessment Program 
(MAP) in communication arts and mathematics and the 21st-Century Skills 
Assessment.
Findings: Student test scores on MAP mathematics tests increased 
signifcantly more (0.128 to 0.178 standard deviations) than the control group. 
Results on MAP communication arts and 21st Century Skills scale scores were 
not statistically signifcant.

Technology Initiative (AMSTI). Washington, DC: Institute for Education Sciences.
Description: 4th- to 8th-grade teachers engaged in the Alabama Math, Science, and 
Technology Initiative (AMSTI), a two-year schoolwide intervention intended to improve 
student achievement by better aligning classroom practices with national and statewide 
teaching standards by providing professional development, access to materials and 
technology, and in-school support for teachers. The PD includes a 10-day summer 
institute, follow-up training during the school year, access to program and curriculum 
materials, and mentoring and coaching by lead teachers and site specialists. 
Methodology: Two-year cluster randomized controlled trial
• n=82 Alabama middle schools
• Student achievement was measured using SAT-10 tests and the Alabama 
Reading and Mathematics Test.
Findings: On the SAT-10 mathematics test, students in AMSTI schools scored 
0.05 standard deviations higher than their counterparts in non-PD schools, 
equivalent to about 28 additional days of student progress. In a separate 
two-year exploratory analysis, AMSTI students increased their math scores by 
0.10 SD and their science scores by 0.13 SD more than control groups.

design sequences of instruction in earth systems science: A comparison of three 
professional development programs. American Educational Research Journal, 
48(4), 996–1025.
Description: Middle school science teachers in a large urban school district 
participated in one of three professional development programs designed to improve 
student science learning. The programs all used an approach to curriculum design 
known as Understanding by Design that helps teachers plan by identifying learning 
goals, designing or using assessments to gauge student performance relative to 
those goals, and offering activities to further develop student understanding. Each of 
the professional development models intentionally incorporated features that have 
been suggested by research to be part of high-quality professional learning programs, 
including the use of hands-on, collaborative learning strategies and opportunities to 
deepen content knowledge and understandings of student science thinking. Each 
program was also aligned with district standards and goals for science education. 
The groups varied in the degree to which teachers received guidance in selecting 
curricular materials and explicit instruction in the pedagogical models underlying 
curriculum. Some teachers received explicit training in instruction and assessment 
techniques that are associated with the use of an Understanding by Design
approach. Others were provided and asked to use an NSF-funded middle school 
science curriculum. The fnal group received training in techniques associated with 
Understanding by Design and were provided the new curricular materials, which they 
were asked to use at least 50% of the time. 
Teachers in each of the three programs attended a two-week summer workshop, plus 4 
additional development days during the school year. 
Methodology: Cluster randomized controlled trial
• n=53 middle school science teachers and 1,550 students in a single urban 
district in the American southeast
• Student science learning was measured through specially designed unit tests
Findings: Students of teachers who received explicit instruction regarding 
teaching models performed better than students whose teachers did not 
receive such instruction (d=0.29-0.34). Students of teachers who only 
received guidance in selecting curricular materials did not perform signifcantly 
differently than students whose teachers received business-as-usual 
professional development.

The case of a learner-centered mathematics program for elementary school 
teachers. International Journal of Education Research 72, 26–37. 
Description: Elementary math teachers engaged in a PD program to bolster standards-
based elementary math instruction. The program was designed to be learner-centered, 
offering active learning opportunities that are collaborative, owned by teachers, 
supportive of changes in classroom practice, and that foster pedagogical and content 
knowledge. Teachers participated in a number of activities, including a summer 
workshop, follow-up workshops during the academic year, and classroom-embedded 
professional development activities. All activities were coordinated by a project team 
that included a mathematics professor, mathematics education professors, and school 
leaders. The program provided approximately 80 hours of professional development 
over 10 months. 
Methodology: Three-year nonexperimental study 
• n=291 elementary mathematics teachers from two school districts: one 
large urban district and a nearby suburban district 
Student outcomes were measured using curriculum-based assessments. •
Findings: Results from three years of program data indicate students 
of teachers who participated in the program consistently experienced 
signifcant gains in mathematics from pre- to post-test, mediated by teachers’ 
mathematical knowledge for teaching. The mean gain from pre to post test 
in Year 1 was 29.74 (SD=35.05). The mean gain from pre to post test in 
Year 2 was 37.40 (SD=35.35) and from pre to post test in year 3 was 41.35 
(SD=35.70).

an early literacy professional development intervention on Head Start teachers and 
children. Journal of Educational Psychology, 102(2), 299–312. 
Description:  Early childhood educators received PD in early literacy teaching from 
expert coaches. Educators attended a two-day workshop that was designed to foster 
relationship-building between coaches and educators and featured demonstrations 
and guided discussions of program content. Coaches then observed educators 
biweekly and provided teachers feedback related to early literacy instruction. 
Coaching was done either onsite or remotely. Onsite coaches observed educators 
for approximately 90 minutes, then met for 30 minutes to debrief the observation 
and provide oral and written feedback. For remote coaching, educators submitted 
15-minute video clips and coaches provided detailed written feedback supported 
by links to video exemplars and other materials available through the program. The 
semester-long program included 16 hours of workshop and seven coaching sessions. 
Methodology: Two-year randomized controlled trial 
• n=88 educators in 24 Head Start centers serving urban and nonurban 
counties in a midwestern state, with approximately eight students per 
classroom 
Student achievement was measured using seven instruments, including the • 
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III and the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of 
Achievement 
Findings: Teachers who participated in the coaching program demonstrated 
target practices at signifcantly higher levels. Students of teachers who 
participated in the coaching program showed signifcantly larger gains and 
better performance on four out of seven outcomes measured by the study: 
letter knowledge (ES=0.29), print concept (ES=.22), writing (ES=.17), and 
blending skills (ES=0.18).

(2011). Videobased lesson analysis: Efective science PD for teacher and student 
learning. Journal on Research in Science Teaching, 48(2),117–148. 
The Science Teachers Learning through Lesson Analysis (STeLLA) PD was a videobased 
analysis of a practice program for upper elementary teachers designed to help them 
analyze science teaching and learning to improve pedagogy. Two groups participated in 
the study. Both groups received the same science content instruction from university 
scientists during a three-week summer institute. STeLLA participants also engaged in 
video analysis of teaching during the summer institute and in follow-up sessions across 
the school year utilizing the Student Thinking and Science Content Storyline Lenses. 
The Student Thinking portion of PD focused on understanding students’ ideas for use 
in planning, teaching, and analysis of teaching, particularly in anticipating student 
thinking to assist teachers in responding to students’ ideas and misunderstandings 
in productive ways. The Science Content Storyline portion of the PD focused on the 
sequencing of science ideas to help students construct a coherent “story” that makes 
sense to them. STeLLA teachers met in small groups facilitated by STeLLA program 
leaders and discussed video cases of teaching that could include video(s) of one 
classroom, student and teacher interviews, teacher materials, and student work 
samples. STeLLA teachers also taught a set of four to six model lessons themselves 
and analyzed their teaching using a structured protocol. Purposes of these lessons 
were identifed as: 1) modeling and scaffolding of the two lenses; 2) clarify science 
content understandings; and 3) provide common curriculum for lesson analysis 
work. Half of a study group would teach the lessons and the entire group would 
collaboratively analyze the teaching and student work, and then revise the lessons for 
the other half to use. The roles would then switch and the second half of the group 
would teach the lessons that would be used for analysis. The analysis was highly 
scaffolded by the PD facilitators. STeLLA groups met for 58 hours of analysis across the 
school year, in addition to 44 hours during the three-week summer session for a total 
of 102 hours. Content-only teachers received just the 44 hours of PD. 
Methodology: Quasi-experimental comparison group study design 
• n=48 urban California upper elementary teachers of 1,490 students 
Student achievement was measured by pre- and post-tests of student • 
content knowledge. 
Findings: STeLLA teachers’ students showed greater gains than non-STeLLA 
teachers’ students. For a typical student taught by a STeLLA teacher, higher 
average achievement was associated with: 
Teachers’ science content knowledge • 
(ES =.20) 
Teachers’ ability to analyze science teaching about student thinking • 
(ES =.18) 
Teachers’ classroom use of Science Content Storyline strategy; selecting and • 
using content representations matched to the main learning goal (ES=.32)

of mathematics: A study of three contrasting approaches to professional support. 
Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education 4: 55–79. 
Description: Upper elementary school teachers participated in a reform-oriented 
professional development program designed to enhance student understanding of 
fractions. The program began with a fve-day summer institute, followed by biweekly 
meetings for the remainder of the school year. Program meetings targeted teachers’ 
own mathematical content knowledge, their understanding of students’ mathematical 
thinking and motivation, and their competence in the use of integrated assessments. 
The meetings utilized individual and collaborative work, and active-learning strategies 
such as role-playing. Teachers participating in the program were also provided with two 
lessons from a reform mathematics curriculum to implement in their classrooms. 
Methodology: Quasi-experimental design utilizing ANCOVA analyses
• n=23 upper elementary school teachers
• Student knowledge of fractions was measured using a specially designed 
test with both conceptual and computational items.
Findings: Teacher participation in the professional development program was 
associated with higher student achievement on the conceptual portion of the 
fractions test. There was no difference on the computational portion of the 
fractions test.

Psychology 40(1): 19–26. 
Description: Educators participated in online, on-demand professional development 
through a web-based commercial product featuring teacher resources such as videos 
and online forums. In each participating school, teachers averaged at least 90 minutes 
of video viewing on the PD platform, though teachers in higher engagement schools 
averaged six hours of viewing and teachers in lower engagement schools averaged 
three hours. Through the platform, teachers had the opportunity to answer follow-up 
and refection questions about content, create focus objectives, and join interactive 
user forums and communities. 
Methodology: Two-year quasi-experimental design 
• n=734 schools in 39 states
• Student achievement was measured by students achieving profcient or 
advanced ratings on standardized math and reading tests.
Findings: Students at schools with higher average engagement with the PD 
program improved reading achievement at four times the rate of students at 
schools with lower average engagement and improved math achievement at 30 
times the rate of students at low-engagement schools.

analysis-of-practice, videocase-based, teacher professional development program 
on elementary students’ science achievement. Journal of Research on Educational 
Efectiveness, 10(2), 241–271.
Description:
 4th- to 6th-grade science teachers used STeLLA—an analysis-of -
practice, videocase-based, professional development program to improve student
science learning. The treatment group consisted of teachers who participated in a
PD program that integrates science content deepening with analysis of practice. The
comparison group participated in a PD program of equal duration and intensity, but
only included content deepening. During a summer institute, teachers were given six
lessons and then asked to teach the lessons in the fall. At the institute, the treatment
group worked collaboratively to discuss video analysis of experienced science
teachers with university faculty guided their thinking on targeted science ideas.
During the fall, teachers taught the lessons from the institute. During their monthly
sessions, they analyzed each other’s teachings of those lessons and student work.
During the spring, the group sessions shifted to developing their own lesson plans
using STeLLA strategies and lenses. Teachers planned a sequence of connected
lessons. At the culminating session, teachers shared their analysis of teaching their
own lessons. During the summer institute, the comparison group participated in
hands-on investigations, creation and analysis of content representations, science
notebook writing, large and small group discussions, short lectures and readings, and
feld trips. During the school year, teachers taught targeted content from the summer
institute. Both groups completed a total of 88.5 hours of PD. 
Methodology: Cluster randomized controlled trial
• n=144 4th– to 6th-grade teachers in 77 Colorado Front Range elementary 
schools and 2,823 students
• Students’ content knowledge, as measured by a project-specifc test.
Findings: Students of teachers participating in STeLLA outperformed students 
whose teachers did not participate (ES=0.52 standard deviations).

Description: Researchers analyzed 1996 NAEP mathematics and science data 
for 8th-graders to investigate, among other questions, what aspects of teacher 
professional development result in increased student achievement. 
Methodology: One-year descriptive survey analysis
• n=7,146 8th graders for mathematics and 7,776 8th graders for science.
• Student achievement measured using the 1996 National Assessment of 
Educational Progress (NAEP) 
Findings: In mathematics, students of teachers who participated in PD for 
teaching diverse students were 107% of a grade level ahead of their peers in 
math. Students whose teachers participated in PD in higher-order thinking skills 
were 40% of a grade level ahead of their peers.
In Science, PD in laboratory skills was associated with students being 44% of 
a grade level ahead, compared to students with teachers who did not have 
this PD. However, PD in classroom management was associated with 37% of a 
grade level behind their peers for science, raising questions about the nature of 
the PD offered.
