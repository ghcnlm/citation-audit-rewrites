This study is theﬁrst to apply the theoretical principles of Malcolm Knowles’ theory of
andragogy to evaluate data collected from learners who participated in team science
training workshops in a biomedical research setting. Brieﬂy, andragogy includes six
principles: the learner ’s self-concept, the role of experience, readiness to learn,
orientation to learning, the learner’s need to know, and intrinsic motivation. Using an
embedded study design, the primary focus was on qualitative data, with quantitative data
complementing the qualitative ﬁndings. The deductive analysis demonstrated that
approximately 85% of the qualitative data could be connected to at least one
andragogical principle. Participant responses to positive evaluation questions were
largely related to two principles: readiness to learn and problem-based learning
orientation. Participant responses to negative questions were largely connected to two
different principles: the role of experience and self-direction. Inductive analysis found an
additional theme: meeting biological needs. Quantitative survey results supported the
qualitative ﬁndings. The study ﬁndings demonstrate that andragogy can serve as a
valuable construct to integrate into the development of effective team science training
for biomedical researchers.

INTRODUCTION
Malcolm Knowles developed the theory of andragogy to provide a framework for understanding the
distinct learning patterns of adult learners [1, 2]. Knowles’ theory suggests that instructors should
understand and attend to the unique aspects of adult learning motivation. Adult learners often balance
numerous commitments, and their educational goals are based on well-deﬁned needs [3, 4]. Compared to
their younger counterparts, adult learners are frequently more motivated to perform well in their studies
and are more oriented towards task completion [5]. In many cases, adult learners choose to advance their
education to retain a competitive edge in the workplace, especially in times of economic recession [3].
Table 1provides a brief summary of each of the six principles of Knowles’ Theory of Andragogy.
Andragogy has been applied to severalﬁelds ranging from chemistry [6] to the coaching of
“master athlete” swimmers [7]. Moreover, it is useful in several distinct educationalﬁelds including

physical education [8], early childhood education teacher training
[9], outdoor science education [10], police training [11], military
education [12], and social work [13]. One study explored the
value of an andragogical framework in a study of blended learning
among part-time adult learners pursuing vocational degrees
through distance learning [ 14]. Another study performed a
randomised controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of the
experiential learning principle of andragogy in teaching nutrition
concepts to culinary arts students and found that experiential
learning was more effective [15].
Although andragogy is a useful theoretical lens in a wide
variety ofﬁelds, it has rarely been applied to medical and health
sciences disciplines. One study incorporated andragogical
principles through the use of podcasts in undergraduate
kinesiology courses [ 16]. Another promoted the use of
andragogy in online nursing education [ 17]. A 2012 study
suggested incorporating Knowles’ principles of andragogy into
the teaching of medical residents [18]. Another study showed that
incorporating learner self-direction in the form of a ﬂipped
classroom model yielded higher test scores for Emergency
Medicine residents over time compared to traditional teaching
methods [19]. Knowles promoted the importance of andragogy in
the continuing education of health professionals, given the rapid
changes in the ﬁeld and the mandatory nature of professional
education [ 20]. Another paper, however, argues that the
andragogical principle of intrinsic motivation is “simplistic,
misleading, and counterproductive” when applied to medical
students [ 21]. We found no existing literature applying
andragogy in a biomedical research setting. Furthermore, few
studies have explored the utility of andragogy from the
perspective of the learners themselves.
Since 2016, the Center for Improvement Science (CIS) at
the University of Cincinnati (UC) has offered more than
50 presentations and workshops aimed at teaching
biomedical research professionals how to better collaborate
on research teams. The CIS operates within a“Science of Team
Science ” environment that is largely driven by our local
National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Center for
Advancing Translational Science (NCATS)-funded Clinical
& Translational Science Award (CTSA). The Science of
Team Science has been de ﬁned as “...an e w
interdisciplinary ﬁeld ... which aims to better understand
the circumstances that facilitate or hinder effective team-
based research and practice to identify the unique outcomes
of these approaches in the areas of productivity, innovation,
and translation ”[SIC] [22]. In order to produce workshops
that improve “productivity, innovation and translation” in the
work of biomedical research professionals, the CIS has applied
the principles of andragogy to team science education since its
inception [22]. We use experiential learning methods to assess
readiness to collaborate, promote participants’ self-re ﬂ
ection,
balance didactics with interactive activities, ensure“hands-on ”
components, explicitly connect learning to practice, and draw
on the wealth of team experience in each group of workshop
attendees. Andragogy is a valuable learning theory that has
been widely studied in other disciplines; however, it has not
been applied to theﬁeld of team science education. Because we
have found it to be one of the most valuable tools in our
teaching approach, we examined the usefulness of integrating
andragogical principles into team science training workshops,
as evidenced by themes from the participants’ evaluation data.
Given our emphasis on andragogical principles in educational
practice, this work used an embedded study design with
qualitative evaluation data as the primary focus, but with
quantitative evaluation data also analysed to augment the
qualitative data [ 23]. We undertook a phenomenological
approach to investigate adult learners ’ experiences of team
science training through the lens of andragogy.
TABLE 1 |The six principles of Knowles’andragogy theory.
Principle Description
Self-Concept As a person matures, their self-concept moves from that of a dependent personality to that of a self-directed human being.
Children maintain a self-concept of total dependency, but adulthood is characterised by a self-concept of self-direction.
Once this psychological maturation occurs, the adult naturally feels most comfortable in situations that allow him or her to
self-direct, in an independent way.
Role of Experience As people mature, they accumulate a growing reservoir of experience that becomes an increasing resource for learning.
Unlike children, who deﬁne themselves in terms of other people (teachers, parents, siblings, etc.), adults deﬁne themselves
by their experiences. Experience, in itself, can be a form of expertise that teachers should draw upon and use as a resource
for learning.
Readiness to Learn As a person matures, their readiness to learn becomes increasingly oriented towards the developmental tasks of their social
roles and life situations. Adult learners want to learn because of the roles they play in their current stage of life, whether at
work or home as parents or spouses.
Orientation to Learning Traditional pedagogy assumes that young students have a subject-based approach to learning, partly because they do not
have much life experience. Andragogy assumes that adults approach learning with a problem-based approach.
Need to Know/Why Adults often pursue education because they need to know something. Adult learners carefully consider why they are learning
something. In pedagogy, it is assumed that students will simply learn what they are told to learn. Adults want to understand
what they will do with the information in life and how it will beneﬁt them or be of consequence to them if they do not learn it.
Intrinsic Motivation Adult learners are responsive to some external motivators (better jobs, promotions, higher salaries), but the most potent
motivators are internal pressures (the desire for increased job satisfaction, self-esteem, or quality of life).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Study Setting
Team Science workshops from 2016 to 2021 were offered and
promoted through a variety of email listservs, internal electronic
newsletters, and websites aimed at UC research faculty and staff.
Registration was voluntary for the majority of participants. A small
minority were required to attend due to internal grant funding or
training programme requirements. Workshops were primarily
offered in an in-person setting and lasted 1 – 3h . T o
accommodate COVID-19 restrictions, workshops were
reformatted to be virtual and synchronous beginning in March
2020. The education team met weekly during this period to plan
and deliver the workshops. Team meetings were multifaceted and
included discussions on workshop logistics, content planning, slide
and activity development, and a review of feedback from recent
workshop evaluations. Importantly for this study, the education
team also used these meetings to discuss andragogical principles, to
ensure that several principles were incorporated into workshop
planning, and to debrief on perceived successes and potential
improvements of recent workshops, using both facilitator
perspectives and learner evaluation feedback. This study was
reviewed by our Institutional Review Board (IRB) and
determined not to be human subject research (IRB #2024-0184).
Data Collection
A paper evaluation survey was distributed to each participant at each
in-person workshop, and participants were allotted time at the end of
each workshop to complete it. Online workshop participants received
an electronic evaluation survey link in the chat box at the conclusion
of the workshop and via email shortly after the workshop ended. A
minor update was made to the onlines u r v e yi n s t r u m e n tt oi n c l u d ea n
additional question regarding the use of technology to achieve the
goals of the virtual workshop. All evaluation surveys were anonymous
a n di n c l u d e dL i k e r t - s c a l e dq u e s t io n sa s k i n gp a r t i c i p a n t st or a t et h e
instructors, workshop content such as activities and examples, and
the overall learning experience, as well asﬁve open-ended questions.
Although the evaluation instrument was not designed with
andragogical principles in mind, these were incorporated into the
workshop development process. The evaluation survey was initially
developed for the purpose of improving educational programmes.
However, the research team questioned whether the incorporation of
andragogical theories into the educational programme was valuable
for participants’ learning. The full evaluation survey instrument is
provided inSupplementary Appendix SA.
This study used the qualitative data collected from responses
to the open-ended questions of the instrument. We also selected a
subset of the Likert-scaled questions that represented key
andragogical principles. These included the value of the
workshop in meeting one’s needs (Intrinsic Motivation), the
Usefulness of handouts or other“takeaways” (Need to Know/
Why), the Active involvement of participants in the learning
experience (Self-Concept), the Use of practical examples
(Readiness to Learn), and the Use of activities (Role of
Experience, as workshop activities most often occur in small
group discussions that focus on participant sharing and peer
learning). Data from 6 years of workshop evaluations were
combined into one dataset for analysis, with each evaluation
marked as having occurred in-person or online.
Data Analysis
At e a mo fﬁve qualitative coders used a deductive approach to analyse
the evaluation survey data [24]. The research team applied andragogy
as a theoretical framework both to analyse the data and to organise the
study ﬁndings. Using a modiﬁed selective coding process, we sought
data that supported the sixprinciples of andragogy [25]. Although the
evaluation instrument was not speciﬁcally designed with andragogy as
a guiding framework, the analysis team sought to code learner
responses to open-ended questions according to the principles of
andragogy where appropriate andmeaningful. Each coder analysed
the data independently, and then the team met bimonthly to reﬁne
interpretations and resolve any differences between coders.
The research team recognised the difﬁc u l t yo fc o d i n gs o m e
participants’ comments as belonging to one theme or another. For
instance, some comments were too short or too ambiguous to capture
t h eu n d e r l y i n gi s s u e( e . g . ,“It was well done”), while other comments
touched on multiple themes in the same sentence (e.g.,“It was very
interactive and engaging. Plus, it helps for people to think about how
different people think and interact with each other”). Thus, the
analysis team made decisions about how to interpret Knowles’
andragogy theory in the context of the workshop evaluation data
and developed a codebook that included key words and phrases as
examples of a particular theme to help facilitate our analysis [25]. The
development of the codebook took place over several months of
analysis team meetings in which each andragogical theme was
reviewed and discussed, and both general and speciﬁck e yw o r d s
and phrases that correlated with a theme were identiﬁed. For
example, comments that referred to a participant’s career stage or
role in a team were coded under the theme“Readiness to Learn,”
since this suggests that a learner’s readiness to learn is predicated on
their social or professional role in life. Participants’ comments about
activities that addressed speciﬁc problems (such as communication
skills or team charters) and that utilised experiential learning that
required learners to practise team science skills to solve a problem
were coded under “Orientation to Learning,” an andragogical
principle that relates to adults learning best through a problem-
based approach. Fewer than 2% of participants’ comments were
coded in multiple categories if the comment encompassed more than
one theme (e.g.,“Something less generic that I can actually apply to
my team and current situation” has aspects of three themes:
Readiness to Learn, Orientation to Learning, Need to Know/
Why). More often a participant comment could be broken down
into multiple themes by phrase or sentence (e.g.,“Much more focused
on ‘what can I do’ things and concepts. Take home messages much
more tangible.” The ﬁ
rst sentence of this comment was coded as
Intrinsic Motivation, while the second sentence was coded as
Orientation to Learning.Table 2 provides additional information
on the key words and phrases that were incorporated into the
codebook. This was essential to enabling the team to interpret the
theoretical framework consistently within the speciﬁc context of the
data set. Additionally, the data collected during the in-person
workshops (2016-early 2020) were compared to the data collected
during the virtual period (2020– 21) to identify potential thematic
differences that may have emerged as a result of this shift.

After deductively coding the evaluation data using andragogy
as our theoretical framework, the analysis team inductively
analysed the remaining data for themes that fell outside of the
constructs of andragogy [24]. Quantitative data were summarised
using means and standard deviations.
RESULTS
During the study period, 26 workshops were offered.
Participation was voluntary for 23 workshops and required for
3 workshops as part of an institutional grant award. Workshop
evaluations were collected anonymously; thus, individual
participant demographics cannot be reported. In general,
workshops included faculty, staff, and graduate students from
UC, UC Medical Center, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical
Center (CCHMC), and a small number of members from outside
the biomedical research community. In total, 363 evaluation
surveys were received from participants in the 26 workshops.
Of the 363 evaluation surveys received, 605 unique pieces of
feedback data were identiﬁed (i.e., individuals responded to more
than one open-ended question and sometimes gave more than
one response to individual questions). Approximately 85% of the
comments provided by the participants were connected to
Knowles’ theory of andragogy. All six of the themes of
andragogy were present in the data set, although there were
differences in frequency and emphasis on particular principles.
The ﬁrst ﬁve themes listed inTable 1 were the most frequently
coded themes in the entire dataset, including self-directed
learning, role of experience, readiness to learn, orientation to
learning, and need to know/why. Intrinsic motivation was
apparent in the evaluation data but to a much lesser extent.
Interestingly, participant responses to positive questions such as
“why would you recommend this workshop to others?”, “what did
you learn today that you are most likely to use in your work?”,a n d
positive “other comments” were largely related to two themes: 1)
participants’ readiness to learn based on their current professional
roles or the roles of those they work with and 2) participants’
problem-based attitude to learning. Participant responses towards
negative questions such as“why would younot recommend this
workshop to others?”, “what suggestions for improvement do you
have?”, “what were you hoping would be covered but was not?”,a n d
negative “other comments” were most often connected to two
different themes: 1) the role of experience and 2) the need for
greater self-direction in their workshop experience. Participant
responses coded under the need to know/why theme were more
evenly spread throughout the evaluation data, with no consistent
alignment with negative or positive questions. Deductive themes
remained consistent across the complete data set for both in-person
and online workshops.
The inductive analysis for themes unrelated to andragogy
revealed one theme that participants greatly valued: meeting
their biological needs for food, drink, and workshop breaks that
allowed them to use the toilet or check in on their personal or
professional business. This theme was particularly important in
workshops that extended beyond 1.5 h. Given the shift to a virtual
format in 2020, we reviewed the data for thematic changes between
in-person and online workshops and this inductive theme was the
only one no longer present.Table 3provides a summary of each
theme and representative quotes taken from the data set, with an
approximate percentage of distribution within the dataset.
In the embedded mixed methods design, we analysed relevant
quantitative data from the evaluation survey to determine
whether it supported our qualitativeﬁndings. The quantitative
data analysis showed that, when asked to rate aspects of the
workshops that related to andragogical principles, participants
mostly felt that the facilitators did a good-excellent job (scoring
between 4 and 5 on a 5-point Likert scale) in addressing these
needs. Table 4provides the mean scores and standard deviations
for the evaluation questions that are related to adult
learning theory.
The quantitative evaluation results support the qualitative
ﬁndings by illustrating that participants felt that the team
science workshops addressed key aspects of adult learning
theory, and incorporated these aspects very well, based on
high ratings in the good-excellent range.

DISCUSSION
The results indicate that andragogy is a useful and relevant learning
theory to integrate into the development of effective team science
training in a biomedical research setting. In this study, training
effectiveness was measured by participant satisfaction, as evidenced
by quantitative scoring of workshop components and qualitative
feedback. These data alsoﬁll an important gap in the literature on
learning theory as it relates to professional team functioning and the
education of work teams in academic health. Adult learning theory
has been explored in many disciplines; however, this study was the
ﬁrst to apply andragogy to team science training in an academic
health centre through deductive analysis of workshop
participant feedback.
Andragogy was well represented in the study data, with
approximately 85% of participant evaluation feedback connecting
to one or more of the six andragogical principles. Interestingly,
participants commented positively on workshop aspects that
addressed their readiness to l earn and their problem-based
attitude towards learning. When asked how to improve the
workshop methods, the participants primarily requested teaching
methods that addressed their desire for self-directed learning and the
discussion of their own and others’ experiences as a learning
resource. We speculate that this is because the workshop
development team adequately addressed participants’ readiness to
learn and problem-based learning orientation, but less so their need
for self-direction and use of experience as expertise. Addressing adult
learners’ desire for“why” they “need to know” information was a
ﬁfth theme that was widely represented in the data set, no matter the
question type. Incorporating andragogical principles into training
development and implementation is straightforward, requiring an
awareness of adult learning principles and a process to ensure that
“active learning” occurs during each educational event [26]. Study
results demonstrate that learners respond positively to training
designed with this theoretical framework in mind.
Our data suggest that the principles of andragogy are important
to learners in our workshops; participants expressed their strengths
and opportunities for improvement using language thatﬁts within
the themes of andragogy. Ourﬁndings suggest another important

insight related to the application of andragogical principles to the
ﬁeld of team science training, which is that adults who pursue
education to improve their work team functioning also value
collaborative learning. Collaborative learning is an instructional
approach that emphasises the pursuit of shared knowledge by both
the instructor and the learners, while also asserting that learning
and understanding are social in nature [27]. One study showed that
social factors such as interacting with peers and instructors as part
of the learning process improved learners’ academic performance
[28]. Placing andragogy within a larger framework of collaborative
learning expands the potential for learning in a complementary
way, such that the team science workshop facilitator becomes a co-
learner with the workshop participants. The facilitator determines
the basic scaffolding to support learning; however, andragogical
principles emerge as workshop participants help to direct the
speciﬁcs of a discussion or learning experience, with both the
facilitator and the participants co-creating knowledge as a
collaborative team. There are several beneﬁts to collaborative
learning, some of which are uniquely suited to team science
training because they inherently support several of the
andragogical principles that were highly valued by participants
in this study [ 27]. For example, in a collaborative learning
environment, learners would be more active participants in the
learning process to improve team functioning, and they would
engage in self-directed, problem-based activities that rely heavily
on learning from their own and other participants ’ past
experiences. By allowing learners to guide the direction of a
workshop, they are likely to steer it towards content and
discussions that are most useful and interesting to them, and to
provide new information that addresses a need in their professional
or personal lives, two other key principles of andragogy. However,
in an increasingly hybrid or online learning environment, the use
of technology to support active, collaborative learning presents
challenges to instructors trying to meet the needs of adult
learners [29].
Although present in the data set, intrinsic motivation was not a
strong theme compared to the otherﬁve principles of andragogy.
This may reﬂect the nature of the content of the team science
training workshops, which certainly included self-assessment and
encouraged self-reﬂection, but in the context of a team. Our
evaluation survey may also lack questions that prompt comments
on this motivation. Exploring intrinsic motivation in a different
training setting that is more individual-focused, such as wellness
seminars, courses aimed at improving technical skills, or leadership
and management training might yield different results that suggest
that internal motivation is equally important. Although it was not a
major theme in this study, intrinsic motivation is an important
andragogical principle that also aligns with the collaborative learning
approach. Co-creation of educational activities and developing a
shared understanding of team science topics would increase the
likelihood of satisfying adult learners’ intrinsic motivation to learn.
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
This study has many strengths and some limitations. First, it
offers an analysis of the importance of andragogical principles in
an educationalﬁeld that was previously unexplored: team science.
Using participant feedback as the primary source of data, this
study demonstrates that adult learners express their training
needs in ways that can be readily connected to andragogy,
making it a useful learning theory for educators to consider
when designing team science workshops. A limitation of this
study is its focus on a training topic that is narrow in scope: team
science training at an academic institution. Thus, generalisability
to other institutions may be limited. Future research could
expand the database to include evaluation data from team
science training events at other institutions. Another possible
limitation is the data set itself, which is bound to the written
evaluation feedback provided by workshop participants. The data
collection instrument was not originally designed with andragogy
in mind, requiring the research team to identify and connect
survey items to andragogical principles post hoc . Pre-hoc
incorporation of questions speciﬁc to andragogy would likely
allow for a more robust and comprehensive analysis of how
important these principles are to team science trainees and what
aspects of the workshop training were most successful in meeting
the needs of adult learners. For example, the survey instrument
could ask participants to rate how important each principle is to
their individual learning, and the extent to which the workshop
met each principle. Such targeted feedback would allow our
workshop team to adjust content and instructional methods
accordingly, increasing the likelihood of training success. Our
data set did not include comments from all participants, nor did it
include any other data source, such as longitudinal follow-up via
survey or interview/focus group. We integrated quantitative data
into an embedded study design in an effort to augment the
qualitative ﬁndings. Finally, our primary method of analysis
was deductive in nature, actively looking for themes that were
corollary to the six principles of andragogy. Although we did
employ an inductive analysis of any data that remained after the
primary analysis, qualitative analyses that are deductive are
limited by their nature.
The study results point to the importance of having a strong
evaluation component in team science training programmes for
continuous improvement that accommodates learner needs.
Andragogy was found to be a valuable and relevant theoretical
lens for interpreting adult learner feedback in a team science
education and training context. Future studies that explore the
relevance of collaborative learning principles to the needs of adult
learners would be useful. Additionally, collecting participant
feedback using an evaluation instrument that incorporates
andragogy a priori may provide more explicit and robust data
in relation to our research question.
CONCLUSION
Since its development in the 1970s, andragogy has been applied to
many ﬁelds of education and professional development. It is a useful
and practical theoretical framework that can be applied to almost
any adult learning experience, including team science training. Using
direct participant feedback, our results show that andragogical
principles are important in a biomedical research setting and that
instructors should incorporate andragogy into the development and
implementation of team science training opportunities in order to

better meet the needs of adult learners. This work represents an
advance in biomedical science because it demonstrates that
andragogy can serve as a useful theoretical framework when
designing team science training for biomedical researchers.

of adult learners.

What This Paper Adds
 Using learner feedback, we evaluated the usefulness of

that the incorporation of andragogical principles was valued
by learners.
 This work represents an advance in biomedical science
because it demonstrates that andragogy can serve as a
useful theoretical framework when designing team
science training for biomedical researchers.
