Evidence synthesis for knowledge exchange: 
balancing responsiveness and quality in providing 
evidence for policy and practice

Barriers to using research in practice are well documented. This paper describes an innovative process 
developed by the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships to address these barriers. We 
supported people to define what they needed to know; how existing evidence could help; and how 
to use evidence in practice. An action-focused evidence review process was developed to synthesise 
and appraise varied relevant literatures, and communicate this in meaningful, timely, relevant and 
action-focused ways. Both making evidence accessible and facilitating processes for deliberating 
evidence were essential in supporting evidence users to understand the extent and usefulness of 
evidence and identify implications for policy, practice and services.

Introduction
Issues in getting evidence into action are well documented (for example, Nutley et 
al, 2007) and highlight that traditional evidence synthesis methods are not always 
appropriate for responding to those issues (Oliver and Dickson, 2015). Knowledge 
Exchange (KE) practitioners at The Centre for Research on Families and Relationships 
(CRFR) (a consortium research centre which produces, supports, stimulates and shares 
social research, and works to make research more accessible for diverse audiences) 
were aware of these needs and worked in partnership with research user organisations 
to address them. Through several projects we worked with partners in the third and 
public sectors to develop evidence services culminating in the Evidence Request 
practice

Bank Project: an evidence-to-action service to help identify and use evidence in 
policy and practice. The programme aimed to help close the evidence-to-action gap 
around delivering services for children and families, focusing on how to help those 
planning and delivering policies and services to understand what existing relevant 
evidence was available, and how this might help frame new approaches to service 
and policy delivery.
The Evidence Request Bank Project devised an evidence to action (E2A) cycle, 
which includes three key stages: identifying gaps in knowledge; an evidence review 
process to gather, synthesise and present evidence in action-focused ways to address 
those gaps in knowledge; and planning evidence use. It built on methods previously 
developed by CRFR to address well-documented issues around using evidence 
including accessibility, relevance, and timeliness. 
This paper describes how an evidence-to-action process was developed by the 
Evidence Request Bank Project, offering reflections throughout, and giving an 
example of how the process was used in practice. It shows how this process successfully 
supported those working in children and family settings to identify gaps in knowledge 
and use evidence to address those needs. Finally, it offers concluding thoughts and 
outlines next steps for the Evidence Request Bank Project.
Background
Problems and issues in getting evidence into action
Barriers to research use by policymakers and practitioners are well documented 
(Mitton et al, 2007; Nutley et al, 2007; Oliver et al, 2014). Research evidence is just 
one source of knowledge for practice (Gabbay and Le May, 2004), and it needs to be 
translated and often animated through discussion (Walter et al, 2005). Often paywalls 
(where a paid subscription is required to view articles) and other cost issues prevent 
practitioners or policymakers accessing evidence. When research users can access 
research (through for example an increased emphasis on open access), they do not 
have the time and resources to synthesise findings, or published synthesis is frequently 
in language and formats that are difficult to use. Whilst a recent UK survey shows 
that university research is highly trusted by policymakers and practitioners, it is also 
less used than evidence from government, third sector and think tanks (McKormick, 
2013). The same source found that evidence was often seen as interesting but not 
useful, with a particular gap in evidence being directly relevant to respondents’ work. 
Barriers to research use extend beyond access and trust issues. Support and 
infrastructure for evidence use within organisations are important in both policy 
and practice (Cherney and Head, 2011, Elueze, 2015). Processes and approaches that 
combine both access to evidence and activities to help apply evidence to problems 
or issues are necessary (Best and Holmes, 2010; Seditas, 2014). Research use is a 
process rather than a one-off event, with the need for learning about what might 
be effective in different situations sitting alongside the need to reframe, rethink and 
address issues at a more conceptual level (Morton and Wright, 2015). Research users 
often rework evidence to apply it to the real world issues they face (Morton, 2015a), 
and this implies commitment and resources from settings where research is used.
Supporting research users through the processes described above has been a key 
element in the approach to research synthesis described in this paper.

In this paper ideas of what constitutes evidence was open to discussion with 
practitioners involved in each synthesis process. Research evidence and published 
grey literature that were: relevant to the topic under investigation, seen as appropriate 
and relevant by both researchers and practitioners, and that met the quality criteria, 
were included in the term ‘evidence’. 
Synthesising evidence for policy and practice
Our experience of working with third and public sector organisations at the time 
highlighted lack of relevant, focused and robust reviews of literature which responded 
to their needs. Limitations of current methods for synthesising research were also 
apparent in the literature, for example the inability of the ‘standard’ Cochrane 
Collaboration type systematic review to accommodate variations in study design and 
acknowledge different types of research (Boaz et al, 2006).
The value of qualitative evidence to inform policy and practice is increasingly 
recognised and methods for reviewing qualitative research in systematic ways are 
emerging (Thomas and Harden, 2008; Ring et al, 2011). Y et methods such as thematic 
synthesis (see Thomas and Harden, 2008) and realist synthesis (Pawson et al, 2005) 
require significant time and labour (Boaz et al, 2006; Saul et al, 2013), which are often 
outwith the available resources and policy or practice timeframe of third and public 
sector evidence users. Since this project, the literature around systematic syntheses 
has been further developed (for example, Oliver and Dickson, 2015)
The Evidence Request Bank Project drew on a range of evidence synthesis methods 
(including systematic review, rapid realist review, and qualitative synthesis), consulted 
experts in the fields of evidence synthesis and evidence to action, and worked closely 
with project partners to understand their needs, to develop an evidence review process 
which balances quality with pragmatism to provide relevant and timely evidence 
for third and public sectors. It also supported research use in policy and practice by 
producing evidence syntheses in actionable formats appropriate to context, and by 
including research users at each stage of the synthesis process to ensure relevance 
and accessibility.
Policy and practice context
The CRFR is a consortium research centre which produces, supports, stimulates and 
shares high quality social research on families and relationships. Established in 2001 
with a mission to make research more accessible and relevant to non-academics, the 
centre is a leader in the knowledge exchange field, with extensive experience in 
making research more accessible for policymakers, practitioners, research participants, 
academics and the wider public in order to increase its impact and open up debate and 
discussion about research questions and research findings, exploring ways in which 
knowledge can lead to action. The Evidence Request Bank Project was developed in 
partnership between CRFR, the Scottish Government, two third sector intermediaries 
(Children in Scotland and Parenting Across Scotland), and West Lothian Council, a 
local authority in central Scotland.
1 This arrangement of partners ensured cross-sector 
issues were represented, and built on the work of a previous project, About Families.2

The evidence-to-action process cycle
The evidence-to-action process described in this paper was developed through 
two projects. Initially About Families was an evidence request service for third 
sector organisations working on parenting issues. In that project we developed and 
experimented with different ways of understanding the evidence base and with 
processes for getting that evidence into action in the organisations we worked with. 
Below we present how we refined the process in the second project, The Evidence 
Request Bank, which took learning from About Families and developed it with 
partners from the third and statutory sectors. The project was internally evaluated.

The diagram below outlines the process explained in this section.
The timescale for the Evidence to Action process outlined in Diagram 1 varied 
according to partners’ decision-making process and organisational schedules, and the 
size and scope of the literature. The pilot attempted to develop a more rapid evidence 
review process than other systematic review methods. While the stages of the review 
process outlined below varied, generally evidence reviews produced during the pilot

were completed within three months of confirming a review question, using a part-
time researcher. In development work since the pilot, larger reviews using the same 
process have taken up to six months using a part-time researcher.
Supporting practitioners to identify gaps in knowledge
How people understand and define what they need to know in social policy and 
practice settings is not a straightforward process. In this project our non-academic 
partners were interested in questions such as ‘What factors affect children’s transition 
to primary school?’, and ‘How have families in Scotland changed over 2001–2011’? 
Addressing these kinds of gaps in knowledge required exploration of different types 
of evidence (for example, programme and service evaluations, literature reviews, 
qualitative research) from a range of sources (for example, government agencies, 
academic papers, public and third sector services, specialist centres), within a limited 
timeframe, using limited resources. Evidence addressing complex issues is often not 
clear-cut, meaning that identifying what action should be taken in response to the 
evidence can be challenging.
We found that even when people wanted to use evidence to inform their work, 
they found it difficult to articulate what they wanted to know and to make decisions 
about what should be prioritised and why. Often initial research questions were too 
broad or multi-faceted or, through exploration, emerged as not the right question 
to address the specific service need in hand.
CRFR developed a facilitative tool to support our partners to consider what they 
wanted to know and how this would help them develop policies and services relevant 
to their roles. The tool used a series of questions to drill down from the general area 
of interest to specific issues in team discussion. In particular it considered:
1. Whether the research questions being posed were appropriate to the problem 
2. How existing research and other evidence could help to address those issues 
3. plans for using the evidence 
4. How those plans fitted with organisational direction and strategy 
5. Capacity to engage in the evidence to action process (amongst the partners and 
more widely within their agencies) 
6. Timescales in which an evidence review would be needed for action
This process of identifying and interrogating what our partners wanted to know was 
fundamental to ensuring that the evidence review process would result in something 
useful and relevant. Providing this support to consider how and why the evidence 
was needed, and involving whole teams in discussions in the early stages of service 
planning, worked well for the partners and was valued as a useful part of the project. 
Producing a user-focused evidence report: the Evidence Review Process
Using the above process to establish what research users wanted to know and why, a 
clear, accessible, user-focused evidence review was produced using specific methods 
we developed to keep the focus on future knowledge use. 
The evidence review process comprised four distinct though iterative stages:

<<<PAGE=6>>>
Sarah Morton and Karen Seditas
160
1. Refining the research question 
2. Retrieving the evidence
3. Synthesising the evidence 
4. Reporting on evidence
T emplates and tools were developed for each stage. A team approach was led by a 
dedicated member of staff, the Evidence Request Bank lead (review co-ordinator). 
The production process included a number of people with defined roles to ensure 
robustness and relevance. The evidence review author searched for and led appraisal 
of the evidence, and wrote initial drafts. These were edited for language clarity by a 
knowledge exchange editor, and reviewed by an evidence user (individual or team), 
academic peer reviewer, and field (non-academic expert) peer reviewer. 
Refining the research question
Building on the identified gaps in knowledge, the evidence review process further 
refined the research questions posed through developing a research strategy and 
scoping the research questions. An academic peer review of the research strategy and 
scoping report was conducted and guidance given.
The research strategy was checked with our partners to ensure relevance, for example 
checking that keywords include policy and practice terminology and potential grey 
evidence sources. 
In scoping the research questions, two stages were devised for pragmatism and relevance 
checking:
1. An initial top-level scoping of the evidence – to test key words, the extent and 
manageability of evidence, and initial inclusion / exclusion criteria, refining 
parameters (such as geography, time period) as necessary.
2. A deeper scoping and report (peer-reviewed and discussed with the requester) 
– detailed the methods, initial comments on the evidence landscape, key themes 
arising, and posed questions and/or suggestions to the requester over parameters. 
It allowed the requester to consider the relevance of the evidence to their needs 
(including whether their needs have changed), make prioritising decisions over 
the direction and scope of the forthcoming evidence review, and agree a realistic 
timeframe.
Facilitating open, whole-team discussion considering the scoping report fostered 
shared understanding, managed expectations over what available evidence does and 
does not cover, and helped ensure that reports addressed the gaps in knowledge 
previously identified while allowing opportunity to refine evidence needs and, if 
necessary, research questions.
Retrieving the evidence
As outlined previously, different types of evidence (academic and non-academic) 
from varied sources often need to be considered to address gaps in knowledge in 
policy and practice settings.

The Evidence Request Bank Project developed a specific range of tools to gather, 
record and appraise diverse evidence and maintain a focus on potential uses. T o do 
this we ensured that evidence retrieval:
• Linked findings directly with knowledge gaps 
• Captured research quality issues
• Facilitated reporting the ‘evidence landscape’ in ways which support non-
academic readers to orientate the evidence within their own practice or policy 
setting, such as what it does and does not say about particular population groups, 
which disciplines and topics dominate the published evidence.
For example, an evidence log was created. This provided systematic record-keeping 
and a critical appraisal record. The evidence log specifically documented characteristics 
of evidence and issues arising of direct relevance to the policy and practice context of 
the evidence requester, for example, how gender or ethnicity feature in the available 
evidence. This was used to create accessible summaries to open conversation about 
what we called the ‘evidence landscape’ and gaps in evidence within evidence reviews.
Synthesising the evidence: quality review
T o quality review non peer-reviewed qualitative literature, the Evidence Request 
Bank Project drew on critical appraisal criteria appropriate for the type of research 
Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP , 2013; Spencer et al, 2003). Qualitative 
evidence is often relevant and valuable in addressing policy and practice knowledge 
gaps. This meant using qualitative appraisal approaches that address issues such as the 
variation in types of literature and difficulties in weighting different aspects of study 
quality (which makes applying a standard measure impractical) (Thomas and Harden, 
2008; Ring et al, 2011).
While literature published in peer review journals was initially included as having 
met a first stage quality threshold, papers were examined and excluded if, for 
example, they featured unaddressed limitations (for example study design), or were 
too conceptual or problem-focused for the needs of the review. 
Quality issues were captured using data extraction and evidence log tools. While 
Evidence Request Bank Project resources often had a single lead author, consensus 
was gained in the review team where there were uncertainties in quality. This 
included where synthesis of different types of evidence raised questions about overall 
conclusions that might be drawn in the reviews. Any contradictions, debates and 
conflicts in the evidence synthesis were reported in the reviews (see point 3 below).
Reporting on the evidence
The Evidence Request Bank Project developed a new accessible and action-focused 
way of reporting syntheses of evidence while acknowledging that evidence rarely 
provides clear directions for action in policy and practice settings. 
A format and approach was designed to link evidence to action which:

1. Provided enough background for the reader to understand the issue/s under 
consideration 
2. Provided information about what actions might help to address those issues, for 
whom and in what circumstances
3. Supported the reader to understand uncertainties in the evidence, what it can 
and cannot tell us, what the gaps in evidence are
4. Included ‘Talking Points’ to stimulate the reader to reflect on the evidence, 
consider its implications for public service development and use it to plan those 
developments, and open up discussion where evidence isn’t clear
5. Signposted the reader to further sources of information and examples of practice
6. Used clear language and structure
Training and tools were provided for review authors, who were mentored by the 
project lead throughout the review process. Project evaluation reported that training 
and supporting review authors helped them appreciate the complexity of the evidence 
user’s environment.
As well as being peer-reviewed, draft reviews were field reviewed by an expert in 
the sector to check clarity, accessibility and relevance. T ools were provided to support 
the peer and field review process. These outlined the purpose, context and process 
of Evidence Request Bank Project work, specified what was required of reviewers, 
and provided templates for providing comments. The draft review was then discussed 
with the requester to further check accessibility. Involving external peer reviewers 
increased their understanding of how to present information for third and public 
sectors in action-focused ways.
Whilst the whole review process is distinct from other systematic reviews in its 
focus on evidence for knowledge exchange and action, we believe that the approaches 
detailed in points 3 and 4 above are particularly innovative and were particularly 
useful to our partners.
Planning research use
Once finalised and published, review findings were presented to, and discussed with, 
those who requested them, including any wider teams intending to use the evidence. 
The Evidence Request Bank Project process included a facilitated discussion 
to support evidence users to reflect on findings and gaps in evidence, consider 
implications for practice, plan how to use and share the evidence and with whom, 
and consider what they want to do differently as a result of having the evidence. The 
Evidence Request Bank Project approach was informed by CRFR’s understanding 
of barriers and enablers to evidence use and utilised knowledge exchange features 
devised for inclusion within the evidence review (for example, talking points). From 
this discussion, the Evidence Request Bank Project produced an evidence use plan 
with partners to take forward and monitor action. All evidence reviews were logged 
into a project website, along with examples of how the evidence was used, allowing 
further access and learning. 
Acknowledging the evidence use environment and providing knowledge brokerage 
were both essential in enabling those who requested evidence to take it forward into 
action in a meaningful and focused way. Discussing how to use evidence fostered 
shared understanding and managed expectations over what the evidence did or did

not say, and helped to link evidence with specific gaps in knowledge while managing 
uncertainty. Involving evidence-using teams helped to integrate team thinking and 
direct resources effectively.
How the evidence to action process has been used
West Lothian Council social policy team, a pilot project partner, wanted an evidence 
base for their improvement work within the area of transitions to primary school. 
They wanted to know more about the factors that affect children’s transition, what can 
help in managing transitions, and what the barriers might be for services and families.
The Evidence Request Bank Project worked with the team to explore and refine 
this knowledge gap, and subsequently produced the evidence review: ‘What factors 
affect children’s transition to primary school?’
The evidence was used in four key ways:
• Staff at West Lothian Council created a driver diagram demonstrating successful 
transition to primary school based on the evidence review.
• Talking points contained within the evidence review were used to facilitate team 
discussion about any uncertainties in the evidence, the findings and planning 
action. This element of the Evidence Request Bank Project process has been 
reported as particularly useful.
• The driver diagram was used with nursery and primary school staff to identify 
ways they could improve transitions.
• This has been shared with the council to reinforce the value of evidence-
based practice and has also informed others via the Scottish Government Early 
Y ears Collaborative (an outcomes-focused, multi-agency quality improvement 
programme).
Limitations and reflections
The Evidence Request Bank pilot project was funded for one year with one full-time 
staff member and was subject to the limitations of a short project: with the resources 
and timeframe available, it was difficult to develop and test a range of processes, tools 
and report formats, complete full evidence to action cycles in a staggered process 
to enable learning from each cycle to inform the next, and demonstrate outcomes 
relating to evidence use. Engagement, developments and activities needed to align with 
partners’ existing strategic priorities, workplans and timeframes, limiting the progress 
that can be realistically made within a short project. It takes time for organisations to 
consider and embrace new ways of working. However it did build on the previous 
About Families three-year project which had developed and refined methods, allowing 
us to build and improve approaches.
There was some diversity amongst the project partners that affected their ability to 
engage with the project. These included differences in approaches to using evidence 
often depending on the context and purpose of why evidence was needed, and 
on the previous experience of staff in using evidence in their work, for example, 
as a springboard for debate or to direct resources for practice change. Supporting 
organisations to engage with this kind of project will vary based on experience and

attitudes to evidence-informed planning. People vary in their capability to interpret 
and use evidence, and a consideration of training may be important.
The process of evidence use was engaged with in different ways by different partners, 
with varying understanding and commitment to the idea that evidence use is not 
a one-off event. Engaging with research users throughout the cycle of defining the 
question, scoping, synthesis, writing, reporting and action planning helped to develop 
a process focus, and through different iterations of the programme we developed tools 
to help with this (for example, a tool to help define ‘knowledge gaps’, and an action-
planning template). It was not always easy for research users to stick with the process 
and see it all the way through. The most sophisticated evidence-use organisations also 
then linked the process to their own improvement, planning and strategy processes. 
Others engaged in a more basic way, with a focus on one-off events or single actions. 
Producing quality reviews takes time, yet balancing timescales to meet user needs 
while ensuring sufficient discussion and high quality reports can be difficult. While 
the evidence review process described here is less resource intensive than other review 
methods, it still requires sufficient time and resources. Using researchers on an ‘as needs’ 
basis can help with capacity but requires repeated training in the processes methods.
Concluding comments
The Evidence Request Bank Project process described above helps to address the well-
documented barriers to using research in developing social policies and services. The 
project developed new ways to help research users overcome difficulties in accessing 
evidence in affordable and timely ways and in formats which are appropriate to them 
and the contexts they work within. Linking evidence to real-world issues and seeing 
using research as a process rather than an event were important parts of the process. 
Developing this process was informed by knowledge exchange literature and by 
working with non-academic partners which offered insight into the needs of the 
evidence-use environment. We were able to develop a process in direct response to 
sector needs, yet grounded in robust approaches to synthesis.
Pilot partners valued support to identify what they wanted to know in the early 
stages and to develop the processes and tools needed to implement change in response 
to the evidence base.
The project involved partners who were interested in using evidence. A range of 
contextual factors can get in the way of engaging with and using evidence such as 
changes in strategic priorities, the political environment, and internal staff changes. 
In this project organisations with clear leadership and vision for using evidence to 
help drive organisational change were the most effective partners.
The Evidence Request Bank Project produced accessible reviews which offered 
clear, concise, and readable syntheses of diverse literature relevant to policy and 
practice contexts. These enabled evidence users to plan and implement tangible action 
from evidence, direct resources more effectively, and demonstrate the importance of 
considering evidence at all stages of planning and implementation to peers. 
Facilitating whole team and open discussion in practice contexts fostered shared 
understanding of evidence including what it does and does not cover. Including 
research users at each stage of the process ensured relevance, accessibility, and facilitated 
consideration of evidence needs and plans to use the evidence. An additional benefit 
of the project was that the knowledge exchange process helped academic review

authors and peer reviews to better understand how to present evidence in language 
and formats for use in policy and practice.
Further development
Further work is needed to build upon the pilot work and develop tools, and consider 
how such a knowledge service could be sustained to support evidence-informed policy 
and practice. CRFR is leading the further development of the Evidence Request Bank 
Project in the context of public service delivery as part of What Works Scotland, an 
initiative to improve the way local areas in Scotland use evidence to make decisions 
about public service development and reform.
