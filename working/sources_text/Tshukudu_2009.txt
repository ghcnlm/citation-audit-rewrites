ABSTRACT 
 
The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated model  for evaluating 
training and development initiatives used by the Botswana public service. To 
achieve this goal, the following actions were taken: 
 
 A literature study was conducted to identify the scope and impact  of an 
effective training and development initiative and its evaluation; 
 
 A literature study was conducted to identify strate gies for evaluating 
training and development initiatives. The theoretical study focused on  
effective training and development strategies and their evaluation and 
critical organisational factors that contribute to successful training 
evaluation; 
 
 The findings from the literature study were integrated into a model for  
evaluating training and development initiatives to be used by the 
Botswana public service; and 
 
 This model was used as the basis for the development of a survey 
questionnaire to determine wheth er trainers, training managers and 
supervisors who were responsible for training and development in the 
public service agreed with the effective strategies for evaluating training 
and development developed in the study. The survey was conducted in 
ministries and departments in the s outh east district of Botswana, 
mainly in Gaborone, where ministries and government departments are 
located. 
 
The empirical results from the study showed that the majority of respondents’ 
training and development activities were not evaluated and that there is no 
link between training and development and performance management. In

particular, disagreements were shown with regard to ten strategies and critical 
organisational factors. 
Evaluation of training and development in general , is an issue that 
organisations are challenged with on a daily basis. Lack of skills by trainers on 
how to evaluate training and development is one major contributing factor to 
this problem. An integrated and strategic approach towards the evaluation of 
training and development is required to effectively and constructively train and 
development employees according to strategic organisational goals , rather 
than according to individual trainee’s goals.

CHAPTER 1 
 
INTRODUCTION, PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OUTLINE OF THE 
RESEARCH PROJECT 
  
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The background of the problem of the study relates to the work 
performance of the Botswana public service employees which can be 
traced to the time of Botswana’s  independence in 1966. The Botswana 
public service periodically undergoes reforms aimed at transforming its 
structures, systems, and operations. One of the reforms was localisation 
of management positions from the days of colonial administration. These 
reforms resulted in the rapid expansion of the Botswana public service. 
The Botswana public service’s share of the formal employment sector was 
about 36 per cent in 1999, employing about 105 200 out of 255 600 
employees. As of March 2001, the formal employment sector was 
estimated at 270 331 people ( World Bank Fiscal Report of 1999). The 
expansion of the Botswana public service created the following problems: 
high wage bills, creation of unwarranted posts, lack of manpower 
planning, ad hoc recruitment and selection and unco -ordinated human 
resources development. 
 
Over the years the government has been concerned with poor service 
delivery in the Botswana public service. In his address of the 107th 
parliament session, the President of Botswana, Mr Festus Mogae, 
lamented the continuing decline in productivity levels. H e pointed out that 
billions of p ula are spent on the development of senior government 
officials with little or no improvement in the productivity levels of service 
delivery. The President described the government‘s budget on training 
and development initiatives as non- profitable, given the current
<<<PAGE=24>>>
- 2 -  
productivity levels in the Botswana public service.  He urged legislators to 
use their political influence to change public service employees’ attitudes 
towards productivity (Daily News, 2007).  
 
Stake (2003, p.19) points out that in order t o deal with this problem of low 
productivity in the Botswana public service, the government has in the 
past introduced reform programmes aimed at improving productivity in the 
service. These reforms include amongst others the following: 
 
 Manpower training and development;  
 Work improvement teams; 
 Salary reviews; 
 Decentralisation of human resources functions; 
 A performance management system; and 
 A performance -based reward system.  
 
The reforms occurring in the public service placed obligations on 
ministries and departments to embark on vigorous training and 
development initiatives aimed at improving service delivery. However, 
training and development in t he Botswana public se rvice were not without 
problems. Poor service delivery and the lack of accountability in the public 
service continued regardless of efforts t o curb this problem (Somolekae 
2001, p.45). 
 
According to a report in the Mmegi (2005, p.7), the government is yet to 
embark on another phase of the public service reform where thousands of 
public service employees would be retrenched.  Nkala (2006, p.2) shares 
these sentiments that the Botswana public service is hierarchical and that 
drastic measures should be taken t o keep it lean and efficient. The 
Business Economic Advis ory Council R eport (2003, p.97)  indicates that 
the Botswana public service sector is large and not efficiency oriented.
<<<PAGE=25>>>
- 3 -  
The Business and Economic Advisry Council Report (2003) proposes that 
drastic m easures be taken to improve service delivery in the public 
service. The report further states that , past reform programmes have not 
yielded much with  a continuous decline in performance standards across 
the public service sector, hence the need for public service transformation. 
Nkala (2006, p.6) advocates for the management of training and 
development and their evaluation to improve service delivery in the 
Botswana public service. 
 
In 1996 the government embarked on restructuring senior management 
positions with a view to enhancing service delivery.  Nkala (2006, p.3) 
points out that amongst other changes was the introduction of contract 
agreements with all permanent secretaries. This move was generally 
criticised by some.  However, the exercise was in line with the founding 
pillars of Vision 2016. This vision recognises the importance of improving 
public service delivery by the year 2016 (National Development Plan 9 of 
2004, p.79).  
 
Nkala’s (2006, p.6) proposition is based on the fact that measures should 
be put in place for training managers in different levels in the public 
service structure and that they must be held accountable for their 
subordinates’ performance. He further argues that the training manager’s 
input is critical when diagnosing individual,  team and organisational 
performance. Training managers should answer to all the stakeholders on 
matters of formulation, implementation and the evaluation of performance-  
improvement strategies.

1.2 STATEMENT OF THE MAIN PROBLEM 
 
The work performance of t he Botswana public service has been a major 
concern to the government, civil society, development partners and the 
nation at large.  The prevailing situation in the work -place has been that of 
low work performance, poor service delivery and high labour turnover. The 
poor work performance has led to a decline in the economic growth from 
an average GDP of 8 per cent to 7.1 per cent between 1990 and 2003 
(World Bank Report 2003, p.40). Mpabanga (2003, p.51) emphasises the 
importance of an effective public serv ice which provides an atmosphere in 
which all stakeholders in the economy are able to operate efficiently and 
effectively.  
 
One major problem in the Botswana public service has been the inability 
for permanent secretaries and training managers to evaluate first-line 
managers’ training and development against the backdrop of a continued 
decline in service delivery (DPSM report 2003, p.44). In the State of The 
Nation Address, President Festus Mogae, lamented that Botswana is 
ranked amongst countries whose labour force has a very poor work ethic. 
He pointed out that amongst the 14 factors identified as the most 
problematic for doing business in Botswana, the poor work ethic has been 
emphasised. The president assured the nation that his government will 
continue to come up with strategies to address the issue of poor service 
delivery. 
 
According to the Department of Public Service Management (Report 2003, 
p.44), the Botswana public service is experiencing the following problems: 
 
 Unclear lines of accountability between ministries and departments;  
 Communication breakdown between the Department of Public 
Service Management and ministries due to bureaucratic practices;
<<<PAGE=27>>>
- 5 -  
 Lack of managers’ commitment to training and development in their 
ministries and departments; and 
 Lack of training and development evaluation strategies for 
ministries and departments.  
 
This study aims to focus on the last -mentioned problem, namely the lack 
of training and development evaluation strategies in the Botswana public 
service. 
 
After independence Botswana inherited administrative systems and 
practices from the colonial administration, hence the existence of 
bureaucracy and a hierarchy in the Botswana public service. In the 
Botswana public service, bureaucracy and hierarchy thus represent t he 
best model of administration to date. The public sector bureaucracy 
conforms to Werber’s legal and rational type of authority, which is 
characterised by job specialisation, authority hierarchy, impersonality, 
rules, proce dures and records (Mpabanga 2003, p.24). After 
independence, training and development became the government’s 
priority with a view to localising decision -making posts occupied by 
expatriates. 
 
The government has played a significant role in human resources’ 
development in the past 40 years and continues to do so even today. 
Despite some achievements in training and development, Botswana 
continues to be faced with the problem of poor performance which directly 
hampers the country’s competitiveness i n the world economy (DPSM, 
2001, p. 17). T his problem persisted even when vigorous training and 
development initiatives were undertaken by ministries and departments to 
improve service delivery. Mpabanga (2003, p.26) reiterates that in the 
absence of evaluation training and development initiatives , training is 
irrelevant and has less or no impact on improvement in service delivery.
<<<PAGE=28>>>
- 6 -  
Training and development in the public service have been aimed at 
satisfying a few individual’s needs rather than those of the department or 
ministry. Issues of corrupti on and nepotism are prevalent in training and 
development in the pubic service. The following compounded the problem 
of poor service  delivery in the public service:  lack of training and 
development policies and procedures, training initiatives not aligned with 
the strategic objectives of the department or ministry  and lack of training 
evaluation strategies to determine efficiency (DPSM 2001, p.34). 
 
Somolekae (2001, p.41) concurs that poor service delivery can be 
attributed to a lack of or non- evaluation of training and development in the 
Botswana public service. She explains that a good share of the budget 
goes towards funding training and development without monitoring and 
accounting of the same.  
 
Somolekae (2001, p.42) reiterates the following reasons that may affect 
the evaluation of training: insufficient budget allocated, insufficient time 
allocated, lack of expertise, and blind trust in training solutions.  Part of the 
explanation may be that the task of evaluating training and development 
interventions is complex in itself. Evaluating training interventions with 
regard to learning, transfer, and organisational impact involves a number 
of complex factors. These factors are associated with dynamic and 
ongoing interactions of various dimensions such as organisational culture, 
training goals, trainees, training situations, and instructional technologies.    
 
The performance of the Botswana public service has been a major 
concern to the Botswana authorities. It has been characterised by low 
work performance  and poor service delivery. The problems that exist 
include: absenteeism, lateness, a high degree of complaints, low quali ty 
work and high staff turnover  (Department of Public Sservice Management 
2001, p.56).
<<<PAGE=29>>>
- 7 -  
Somolekae (2001, p.42) notes that one of the r easons for poor service 
delivery includes the decentralisation of human resources’ functions to 
ministries without proper training of officers responsible for the 
implementation of the process. She indicates that during the 
decentralisation process, senior  officers were attached to the Department 
of public service management for a crash course on human resources. 
The majority of these officials did not have any background knowledge o f 
human resources functions. 
 
On completion of a crash course these officer s were sent back to their 
respective ministries and departments to implement a decentralisation 
process. This process resulted in a lack of planning and co -ordination of 
training, and inadequate development initiatives by implementers (DPSM 
Review 2003, p. 62). The hasty implementation of the decentralisation 
process resulted in poor planning and co- ordination of training and 
development in the public service. 
 
Eseryl (2005, p.55) notes that evaluation is an integral part of training and 
development interventions that help determine the effectiveness of 
instructional interventions, which in return increase organisational 
performance. She further observes that despite its importance, there is 
evidence that evaluation of training is either inconsistent or missing.  
 
Chepkilot (2005, p.85) indicates that the emphasis on training in recent 
years has led to many organisations investing substantially in employee 
training and development. He notes that the need for training has been 
necessitated by technological advancement and organisational change 
and the realisation that organisational success is dependent on the skills, 
competencies, and abilities of employees. This has been underscored by 
the rise in human resources management with its emphasis on the
<<<PAGE=30>>>
- 8 -  
importance of people and the skills they possess in enhancing 
organisational performance. 
 
Goldstein and Ford (2001, p.2) note that training and development 
programmes are enormous business in terms of both effort and money 
spent. For example,  the following are illus trations on how much training 
and development cost s. The American Society of Training and 
Development in its report estimated that $55 billion was spent on formal 
training by employers.  The survey, known as the Human Performance 
Practices Survey (HPPS), w as based on a random sample of 540 
organisations with more than 50 or more employees. In another survey  
conducted by the same company involving 500 firms, it was found that 
91% of the firms provided training for middle management, 75% for sales 
training, 56% for secretarial training, 51% for executive development, and 
44% for technical training.  
 
Foxon and Lybrand ( 2005) state that there is ample evidence that 
evaluation continues to be one of the vexing problems facing the training 
fraternity. Marsden (20 05, p.43 ) observes that training managers have 
given evaluation a low priority in the instructional process.  However, in 
the current economic environment and in the light of a training guarantee, 
training managers are faced with a hard economic decision about the 
viability and value of the training programmes  they offer. In the minds of 
many practitioners, evaluation is viewed as a problem rather than a 
solution, and an end rather than a means.  
 
Marsden (2005, p.44 ) reiterate s that when training evaluation is 
undertaken, it is often rushed through and limited in scope. It can be 
overawed by quantitative measurement techniques, and can lack both in 
budget and the time required for the evaluation process.

 The researcher will endeavour to develop a model for evaluating training 
and development in the Botswana public service. The above discussion 
offers the basis for exploration of the main problem and sub- problems of 
this study and will be represented by the following questions. 
 
What strategies can be used by the Botswana public service to 
evaluate the effectiveness of training and development initiatives? 
 
1.3 SUB-PROBLEMS 
  
An analysis of the main problem allows identification of the following sub-  
problems: 
  
Sub-problem One 
What outcomes are expected from training and development initiatives?  
 
Sub-problem Two 
What evaluation strategies can be used to determine whether training and 
development initiatives are effective?  
 
Sub-problem Three 
What strategies, as in sub- problem two, are used by the Botswana public 
service to evaluate training and development initiatives?  
 
Sub-problem Four 
What strategies can be utilised by the Botswana public service to evaluate 
training and development initiatives?

1.4      REASONS FOR AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  
 
The p roblem statement highlights major problems in the poor service 
delivery of the public service such as bureaucracy, which is characterised 
by job specialisation, the authority hierarchy, impersonality, rules, 
procedures and records (Mpabanga 2003, p.27).   
 
As discussed in the problem statement (refer to section 1.2), despite some 
achievements in training and development, Botswana continues to be 
faced with the problem of poor performance which directly hampers 
competitiveness in the world economy.   
 
Bakwena (2001, p.15) supports the notion that poor service delivery is a 
bone of contention and she adds that performance in the Botswana public 
service underlies the notion that the government is not able to improve the 
country’s competitiveness. Bakwena further states that globalisation of 
world economies is placing sustained pressure on governments to 
improve competitiveness across the board. 
 
It was also indicated that training and development in the public service 
have been characterised by corruption and nepotism, a lack of training 
and development policies and procedures, and training initiatives not 
aligned with the strategic objectives of the department or ministry (DPSM 
2001, p.67). 
 
From the above discussion it can be concluded that performance in the 
Botswana public service has been a major concern to most stakeholders 
and the nation at large, characterised by low work performance and poor 
service delivery.  Therefore,  it is only meaningful to undertake a study 
which is aimed at the development of a model for the evaluation of training
<<<PAGE=33>>>
- 11 -  
and development in the Botswana public service. The result of this study 
can be used by: 
 
 Policy makers in all ministries of the Botswana public service who 
are responsible for the development and implementation of a 
training policy and procedures; 
 Managers in the Botswana public service who are responsible for 
the management of training and development; 
 Training officers and managers in parastatal organisations; 
 Training officers and  managers in the private sector;  
 The B otswana Public Service Training Advisory Committee 
members (PASTAC); 
 The Directorate of Public Service Management (Division of training 
and development); 
 Ministerial training co-ordinators and managers; and 
 Departmental training co-ordinators and managers. 
 
1.5  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 
 
The purpose of this research was to develop an integrated model for the 
evaluation of training and development initiatives in the Botswana Public 
service. More specifically, the objectives of this research are to: 
 
 Determine from relevant literature what evaluation strategies should 
be utilised to effectively evaluate training and development in 
organisations;     
 
 Develop a theoretical model or framework of evaluation strategies 
that can be used by the Botswana public service; and
<<<PAGE=34>>>
- 12 -  
 Make recommendations to the Botswana public service and private 
sector organisations on effective strategies to be used for 
evaluating training and development initiatives.  
 
1.6   DEMARCATION OF THE RESEARCH 
 
Demarcation of the research enables t he research to be focused and 
manageable. 
 
1.6.1 Training co-ordinators and managers 
 
The research targeted training coordinators and managers and 
departmental training co -ordinators in the Botswana public service. 
Training co -ordinators and managers are directly in contact with 
employees and responsible for the management of training and 
development in the Botswana public service, while the employees are the 
beneficiaries of the strategies. 
 
1.6.2 Geographical demarcation 
 
The empirical component of the st udy was limited to the Botswana public 
service organisations within Gaborone, Botswana. 
 
1.6.3  Organisation demarcation 
 
The study was limited to the public service for the purposes of this study 
and entails: 
 
 The civil service; 
 Local authority; and 
 Government parastatals.

1.7     RESEARCH DESIGN 
 
This section describes strategies or procedures that were used in data 
collection and analysis in order to come up with answers to the problem. 
This section focuses on the research design. 
 
This study was intended to investigate the strategies for evaluating 
training and development initiatives used by the Botswana public service 
and to suggest concrete and effective practical evaluation strategies. The 
following procedures were used to solve the main problem and the sub -
problems. 
 
1.7.1 Literature study 
 
A thorough study was conducted to explore what the literature reveals on 
strategies for evaluating training and development initiatives. The literature 
addressed sub- problems one and two. The literature focused on: 
 
 The definition of training and development; 
 The effectiveness of training and development initiatives in 
organisations;  
 Issues in the evaluation process; 
 Evaluating change due to training and development; and 
 Effective strategies for the evaluation of training and development 
initiatives.
<<<PAGE=36>>>

1.7.2 The empirical study 
 
A quantitative research design was used. This approach requires that data 
be expressed in numbers (Struwig & Stead 2001, p.7). This design is 
suitable when large amounts of data are collec ted from a large target 
group. For the empirical study a self -administered questionnaire was used 
as the data collection method. A self -administered questionnaire is easier 
to administer and allows for greater anonymity than interviews. 
 
The development of  the questionnaire was based on key aspects of 
training evaluation as explored and identified in the literature study. The 
questionnaire was used to explore the extent to which the strategies for 
evaluating training and development initiatives identified i n the literature 
study are applied by the Botswana public service. The questions asked 
were to try to establish current strategies for evaluating training and come 
up with recommendations on strategies for evaluating training and 
development in the Botswana public service. A Likert -type scale was 
utilised for sections B to C of the questionnaire. T he questionnaire 
consisted of the following sections. 
 
Section A: Biographical data. 
 
Section B Training and development evaluation strategies. 
 
Section C: Critical organisational factors.

CHAPTER 2 
 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOTSWANA PUBLIC SERVICE 
AND REFORM PROGRAMMES 
 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
In c hapter one, the main problem, sub- problems, de marcation and the 
significance of the study were discussed. Poor ser vice delivery in the 
Botswana public service which forms the main problem of the research 
study was discussed in details. Key concepts were also defined and the 
research methodology used for this study was discussed. 
 
This chapter focuses on the historical  perspective of the Botswana Public 
service. This chapter will also cover a discussion on reform interventions 
introduced by the Botswana government to improve service delivery in the 
public serv ice, reform endeavours which  include amongst others: the 
Botswana National Productivity Centre, privatisation, w ork improvement 
teams, and performance management system, performance based reward 
systems, decentralisation initiatives of service provision, and training and 
development in the Botswana public service, f uture government reform 
programmes and conclusion. 
 
The above reform programmes  were aimed at addressing poor service 
delivery in the Botswana public service which persisted over a long period 
of time. These reforms were intended to not only improve servic e delivery, 
but also to improve the country’s competitiveness in the global village.    
 
According to Leigh (1997, p.57), positive changes have occurred in the 
economy especially with respect to g ross domestic production growth and 
to some extent employment creation.  Factors that have impacted on the
<<<PAGE=40>>>
- 18 -  
productivity of the country include amongst others the development in the 
usage of factor inputs over time. Leigh (1997, p.67) states that Botswana’s 
capital stock has grown at rates that are faster than those of the labour 
force.  It is estimated that over the three decades following independence, 
Botswana’s capital stock grew at an average rate of 7.2 per cent whilst the 
labour force grew at an average of only 2.8 per cent. 
 
Consequently, the capital intensit y in production increased dramatically 
over this period.  On the labour front, there have been significant changes 
in the quality of the labour force as evidenced by the improvements in the 
skill composition of employed Batswana and the general increase in  
literacy rate of the population as a whole. The joint effects of the rapid 
increases in both quantity and quality of inputs  are expected to yield rapid 
output gains over time. 
 
Leigh (1997, p.  77) further notes that although Botswana’s economy has 
recorded remarkable growth rates in the past and continues to register 
positive growth rates in output, this growth has been falling short of the 
targets set in Vision 2016.  Simultaneously, several privations confronting 
the country have emerged.  Key concerns dampening the celebration of 
past economic development achievements include high and growing 
unemployment, a lack of economic diversification, high HIV/AIDS infection 
rates and increasing poverty rates. 
 
Botswana’s unemployment remains in the two digit level and in recent 
years has been on the increase compared with the trend observed in the 
1980s. The latest estimates put unemployment rates at 24 percent 
whereas in the early 1980s it was estimated to be 10 percent.  During the 
National Development Plan 8 period the unemployment rate averaged 20 
percent, thus highlighting the need for more intensified efforts in
<<<PAGE=41>>>
- 19 -  
employment creation during the National Development Plan 9 period 
(Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, 2005, p.167). 
 
Research findings fro m a National Productivity Perception Study (2001, 
p.89) indicates that about 41.3 per cent of the population have full 
knowledge about productivity in Botswana and that this percentage is not 
reflected in the productivity levels of the country. In other words , 
knowledge of productivity by at least half of the population is not translated 
into performance.  
 
The central task facing developing countries like Botswana is to move 
away from the straightjacket of fact -driven national advantage. Too often 
competitive advantage in the developing countries tends to be almost 
exclusively in industries where natural resources, cheap labour, 
localisation factors and other basic factor advantages provide a fragile and 
often fleeting ability to export. Competitive advantage based on innovation 
and productivity rather than the abovementioned factors is however , 
created over a decade or more, not over three to four years of business 
cycles.  It is conditioned by issues such as investment in human capital, 
improved technology , better management systems, optimal resource 
allocation, and a positive relationship between labour and management. 
 
In his State of the Nation Address, President Festus Mogae (2006) 
challenged Batswana that now is the opportune time to translate 
productivity awareness into the right attitude and goals to improve 
performance in all activities at all levels of government. 
 
The President further pointed out that recent global developments point to 
the growing importance of productivity, particularly at the country’s present 
stage of development. Festus Mogae stated that similarly, recent 
international competitive rankings for the country have presented a mixed
<<<PAGE=42>>>
- 20 -  
bag scenario, with admirable/laudable rankings for some indicators and 
hideous rankings for other in dicators especially in relation to business 
competitiveness factors. 
 
President Mogae reiterated that for the country to continuously improve its 
international competitiveness there is a need for all concerned parties to 
concentrate on those factors that are known to lead to a low international 
ranking as indicated in various internal competitiveness reports.  A starting 
point in this regard could be addressing those factors that have been 
highlighted as the most problematic for doing business in Botswana 
because they are putting the country in a bad light with respect to 
productivity and global competitiveness. 
 
Mogalakwe (2001, p.20) observes that labour productivity is one area that 
unites people across various ideological and political persuasions. He fully 
realized that without productivity human societies will cease to exist.  
Productivity is the centre of civilization. The author notes that productivity 
cannot be learnt but must be perfected. 
 
Ramaphosa (1997,  p.67) urges the public service to move away from 
simplistic notions that paying workers less and working longer hours will 
increase productivity. He further notes that the public service needs to 
examine the structural, institutional and managerial shortcomings in the  
economy, and develop better a pproaches to effectively provide service 
delivery. He urged companies to invest in training and development in 
order to remain in business and competitive.
<<<PAGE=43>>>

2.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE 
 
The Botswana public service has grown by leaps and bounds since 
independence in 1966. The public service sector accounts for about a 
third of the total employment and central government is the single largest 
employer in the country.  According to recent statistics total employment in 
the Botswana Public service stands at around 100 000 (Department of 
Central Statistics 1998, p.97). The statistics indicate that government 
employs about 82 000 and local authorities employ about 18 000 people. 
According to Mogalakwe (2004, p.21), the public service has g rown 
tremendously compared with the 9,000 at independence. He further poses 
the question of whether the management style is changing or is still that of 
1968. This in turn impacts on the quality of service delivery in the public 
service. 
 
While the public service has expanded steadily over the years the 
following problems have emerged: absenteeism and lateness to work, 
poor public relations, and outright public criticism have been posing 
serious challenges to management. This trend has affected the 
government’s efforts to improve the economic and social well-being of the 
public. The national economic development does not only depend on 
natural resources but the quality of the public services rendered is also 
equally important and can therefore,  not be overem phasised. There is 
therefore a need to improve productivity in the Botswana Public service. 
 
Botswana has gone through major transformation since independence in 
1966.  The major achievement for the country has been the development 
of the National Vision 2 016, which sets out in detail strategies that will 
enable Batswana to reach their national aspirations. Botswana has 
National Development Plans, which are earmarked every six years when 
priorities are set and reviewed. The government also introduced public
<<<PAGE=44>>>
- 22 -  
service reforms that are aimed at improving and promoting quality service 
in the public service. According to B otswana Institute of Development 
Policy analysis (2005, p.89), the Botswana public service has formulated 
policies, procedures and plans. Howeve r, implementation of these 
guidelines remains the biggest challenge and delivery eludes the entire 
government system. 
 
Like any other performance improvement initiatives, there have been 
significant improvements in improving performance and productivity levels 
through implementation of reform initiatives in the public service.  Magosi 
(2005, p.78) concurs with Mogalakwe (2004, p.22) in that the performance 
of the Botswana public service has been a major concern in view of the 
many government efforts to impr ove performance. He further notes that 
the government has spent millions of pula on consultancy endeavours to 
revitalise public service performance, but to no avail. 
 
Magosi (2005, p.78) identifies the following areas as major factors 
contributing to poor service delivery: 
 
 Firstly, there are plans and resources; nonetheless the public 
sector has been unable to deliver on the promises that the 
government made to the constituency; 
 Secondly, the public service has become insensitive and assumes 
that civil servants are masters not servants; 
 Thirdly, planning in the public service is not aligned with budgeting 
processes; and  
 Finally, the government should harmonise individual and 
organisation performance with the intended governmental strategic 
plan to achieve effective performance and quality service delivery.

Mogalakwe (2004, p.34) brings another dimension on the issue of poor 
performance in the Botswana public service sector. He points out that 
Botswana public service managers in different levels do not kno w the 
aspirations, desires, fears and personal troubles of their staff. 
 
Mogalakwe (2004, p.34) suggests that the impersonality of the 
bureaucratic system is compounded by its numerical immensity. Thus, 
most employees feel lost in the bureaucratic jungle, they feel that their 
contribution is not appreciated or that no matter how hard they work, 
nobody notices.  At the same time, even the demography of the public 
sector has changed. New and young people with different expectations, 
values and lifestyles have entered the service. Mogalakwe (2004, p.67) 
further notes that these young people are on the average better educated 
than the 1960s entrants were. The younger entrants have either “O” levels 
or junior degrees, and they are ambitious. Mogalakwe concludes by 
stating that the productivity problem in the public service is not the 
expansion of the labour force, but management style does not take 
onboard all these changes. The psychological disposition alluded to above 
requires new management techniques to deal with the new and fast 
changing public sector. 
 
 
2.3 PAST REFORM PROGRAMMES 
 
Botswana has gone through major transformation since independence in 
1966.  The major achievements for the country include the development of 
the National Vision 2016 for the publi c service, which sets out in detail 
strategies that will enable the nation to realise its national aspirations.  In 
addition, since independence the Botswana governments have been 
committing the available national resources to providing essential public 
service to the citizens.
<<<PAGE=46>>>
- 24 -  
 
Productivity in the Botswana civil service is the facilitation of the total 
development of its employees, and the assurance of efficiency and 
effectiveness. The government has introduced many reforms to shape the 
public service into an efficient instrument. The purpose of reforms is to 
improve existing structures, functions, and systems for effective and 
efficient service delivery by the public service. It has now established the 
Botswana National Productivity Centre (BNPC) as a parastatal which will 
entrench productivity at a national level.  The government of Botswana 
has approved the strategy for productivity improvement in the public 
service based on the Singapore model of Work Improvement Teams 
(WITS).  This work improvement should shape the public service into an 
effective and efficient entity (D epartment of Public Service Management  
1993, p.3). 
 
Reform programmes are aimed at bringing pride to the employees in the 
good service they provide and to earn them the recognition and th e 
respect of the public they serve with dedication, honour, respect and in so 
doing, to provide essential services for the development of the country and 
its people.  Performance improvement strategies may also result in self -
actualisation and a happier and more productive workforce. These 
strategies rely on constant improvement of skills, merit assessment and 
open competition for progress, good labour practices and positive 
attitudes of civil servants to embrace productivity in the public service 
sector. 
 
According to the African Competitiveness report (D epartment of Public 
Service Management 1998, p.117) indicates that Botswana’s civil service 
was rated 15th, for hiring and dismissing practices, out of a total of 23 
African countries that have been surveyed by the World Economic Forum. 
This means that although the overall position was 3 out of 23 African
<<<PAGE=47>>>
- 25 -  
countries (the best after Mauritius and Tunisia), the civil service as one of 
the determinants of thi s position did not perform well.  Therefore, the 
performance of the civil service forms part of Botswana’s “burning 
platform”. The question is what is the government doing to improve the 
situation?  Vision 2016 made it clear that the performance of the public 
service is not incidental to Botswana’s success. Countries are competing 
internationally not only in the market place but on the quality of their public 
sectors. 
 
Bakwena (2000, p.34) observes that the international competition and 
globalization of economies is placing sustained and strong pressure on 
government to improve competitiveness. Across the board and, as a 
result, public sectors everywhere are under the spotlight.  This enables the 
public service to compete with the best practice organisations worldwide.  
The public service leaders must adopt and a pply the values and 
characteristics that are common to high performing organisations.  These 
organisations have the following characteristics: 
 
 Committed, participative leadership; 
 Focus on the customer; 
 Are driven by performance; 
 Seek continuous improvement; 
 They are innovative and flexible; 
 Emphasise trust, integrity and personal growth; 
 Communicate through simple, focused information systems; and 
 Re-engineer management systems (Bakwena 2000, p.34).

2.3.1 Botswana National Productivity Centre 
 
The Botswana National Productivity Centre was established by the 
government with assistance from the Singaporean government to begin 
productivity campaigns and provide training for all stakeholders both from 
the public and private sector on issues of producti vity. In this section the 
scope and review of productivity will be covered and also the concept of 
science and technology and information technology will be highlighted and 
they impact on competitiveness of the organisation both in the public and 
private sector. Issues of organisational behaviour and productivity , quality, 
challenges, readiness for change, management and creating a viable 
organisation will be covered in the latter part of this section. 
  
Since independence in 1966, National Development Plans, which covered 
a period of five years each, have been drawn up as instruments to be 
followed in the orderly and prioritized delivery of service to the nation.  
Packages of priorities that each ministry had indicated they could tackle 
within the planned period were formalised. Adequate manpower resources 
were at the same time provided to enable the projects to be executed and 
after execution, maintained (D epartment of public service management  
2002, p.2). 
 
The Botswana National Productivity Centre was establi shed in January 
1993 to spearhead the Botswana Productivity Movement. It became a 
parastatal organisation in 1993 with the passing of the Botswana National 
Productivity Centre Act.  Under this act, the objectives of the Botswana 
National Productivity Centre included the following: 
 
 Stimulate and generate productivity consciousness in the Botswana 
public service;  
 Promote increased productivity in all aspects of the economy;
<<<PAGE=49>>>
- 27 -  
 Improve and develop standards of management in all aspects and 
at all levels; 
 Promote good labour/management relations; and 
 Foster equitable productivity gain sharing between management, 
workers and consumers. 
 
Mogalakwe (2004, p. 77) points out that it was in recognition of the 
importance of productivity that the government created the B otswana 
National Productivity Centre in an attempt to raise productivity 
consciousness in the country. 
 
The mission of the Botswana National Productivity Centre (BNPC) is to 
become the national facilitator of productivity and quality knowledge and 
methods.  Through empowering others to act as change agents, the 
centre will enable individuals, organisations and the nation as a whole to 
use productivity and quality practices to bring about personal and 
collective success. 
 
2.3.1.1 Scope of the project 
 
According to Lebang (2006, p.14), the BNPC needs to set realist ic goals 
to fulfill its mandate.  The centre has to have relevant data on productivity  
and quality.  This project was undertaken in response to BNPC’s invitation 
to tender and to conduct a survey and analysis of productivity, quality 
awareness and perceptions in Botswana. The main objectives of the 
above mentioned productivity study were to evaluate productivity and 
quality awareness in Botswana since 1997 under the following guidelines: 
 
 Establish the  level of awareness to enable the Centre to develop 
strategies for further awareness campaign packaging and targeting 
of productivity interventions;
<<<PAGE=50>>>
- 28 -  
 Find ways of promoting and encouraging increased productivity to 
improve standards of management, foster g ood labour -
management relations and generally stimulate productivity 
consciousness in Botswana; 
 Measure the level of productivity and quality awareness. 
 Identify productivity and quality needs in rural and urban areas; 
 Formulate recommendations that will guide the campaign strategy; 
 Uncover perceptions regarding productivity and quality with 
particular emphasis on customer service and competitiveness; 
 Elicit views regarding appropriate actions necessary to i mprove 
productivity and quality; 
 Identify most or at least receptive groups to productivity and quality 
concepts; 
 Identify factors attributable to increase/decrease or cause 
stagnation of productivity awareness levels; and 
 Measure the degree to which organisations have embraced a 
mindset of doing things i n a better way with a view to improving 
productivity, and identifying potential pressure groups that can 
assist in enhancing productivity and quality awareness (Productivity 
Statistics report 2004, p.106). 
 
2.3.1.2 A brief review of productivity 
 
Concern about the low productivity in the Botswana Public service and in 
the country generally dates back several years. Political leaders and 
researchers have noted repeatedly that productivity levels in the country 
left much to be desired, and had made regular reference to serious 
shortcomings such as absenteeism, lateness at work, poor public relations 
and outright failure to implement government policies and projects.  While 
admitting the existence of these problems, many observers have also 
pointed out that these are not insurmountable problems.  The issue of
<<<PAGE=51>>>
- 29 -  
tackling the problem of low productivity featured prominently at a  
conference held in Francistown in 1988 on Private Sector Development, 
which consequently recommended the establishment of a Productivity 
Centre to help promote and improve productivity in the country.   
 
Government consequently accepted the recommendation, but it also 
decided that, a search for an appropriate productivity initiative- by-way of a 
study tour of countries that have already implem ented productivity 
improvement programmes would be carried out. 
 
Productivity is a measure of the relationship between inputs such as 
labour, capital or natural resources, and the quantity outputs such as 
goods and services.  It is a concept that is used t o measure how well the 
inputs are used to achieve outputs.  Productivity indicates the efficiency of 
operations and thereby suggests their profitability. However , there are 
factors that affect productivity such as information communication 
technology, science and technology and human resources (Bakwena 
2000, p.90). 
 
Productivity represents an individual’s or an organisation’s ability to 
convert resources into quality goods and services that meet market needs.  
Two notions that can be used to best define productivity are effectiveness 
and efficiency.  Effectiveness is long -term oriented whilst efficiency is 
short-term oriented. Thus productivity is the effective and efficient use of 
resources (inputs) to produce goods and services (outputs) required to 
satisfy human needs. The definition is consistent with that of 
contemporary literature which states that efficiency is “doing things right” 
and effectiveness is “doing the right things”. 
 
Mogalakwe (2005, p.67) states that the output of the country’s economy 
depends on the individual outputs of the companies, organisations and
<<<PAGE=52>>>
- 30 -  
any other group engaged in economic activities.  The outputs are grouped 
together in a single figure that expresses the efficiency of the entire 
economic activities and is termed the Total Productivity Index  (TPI). It’s 
formulation includes a statement of the value of the product or service 
produced and a summary value of all its inputs.  The summary value in 
this contest refers to the overall inputs from different sectors of the 
economy. The companies, organisations and any economically active 
groups in turn depend on individual employees to produce high quality 
goods and services. It is important that a productivity awareness 
campaign be extended to the lowest level of economic activity.  F or the 
long-term benefit of the country and maximum achievement of goals and 
objectives of the project, the consultant agrees that productivity must be 
cascaded down the different levels of the organisational structure to 
leverage productivity and quality awareness in Botswana. 
 
2.3.1.3 Science and technology in Botswana  
 
Botswana has a science and t echnology policy which can be regarded as 
a set of government directions backed by strategies to stimulate, organize 
and use scientific and technological potentials in order to achieve national, 
economic, social and cultural development goals. The policy is multi -
sectoral and its overall goal is to achieve sustainable and social economic 
development to meet the present and future needs of the nation through 
the standard and quality of the lives of Batswana (Botswana Technology 
Centre, 1996).  In addition, the science and t echnology policy includes 
amongst others the following basis of production: 
 
 Establish and strengthen the national capacity to evaluate, select, 
adapt develop, generate, apply and disseminate suitable 
technologies to realise national socio- economic objectives, as well 
as conversion of  natural resources;
<<<PAGE=53>>>
- 31 -  
 Develop, improve and raise the national productive capacity and 
competitiveness through efficient application of S&T; 
 Promote and develop traditional, new and innovative technologies; 
and  
 Improve and develop the scientific and technological awareness, 
knowledge and culture of Botswana (Botswana Technology Centre, 
1996, p.6). 
 
2.3.1.4 The impact of science and technology on productivity 
 
The vision of any government is to provide balanced economic growth and 
development, political stability and security, and mobiliz e the country’s 
own resources for sustainable development. 
 
It has been emphasised that development does not merely imply a high 
per capita income.  Rather, it implies a capability to produce a wide variety 
of goods and services at reasonable cost with minimal wastage. 
 
Bakwena (2000, p.95) explains that Botswana can be regarded as a rich 
country, while its citizens are poor.  The reason for the growing disparity 
between the country’s fortunes and that of it’s people is due to Botswana’s 
inadequacy in science and t echnology. In the modern world, development 
and technology are becoming amore and mo re synonymous with science 
and t echnology (S&T), including  information and communication 
technology (ICT).  These are acknowledged as the most important tools 
for industrial and economic development.  
 
They are powerful drivers of economic growth and improvements of 
quality of life in a nation, and investment in science and technology has 
produced real results and paid handsome dividends in the advanced 
countries of the world.  In this context, science can be defined as
<<<PAGE=54>>>
- 32 -  
ascertained and verifiable knowledge about nature accumulated from 
observed and tested facts, while technology can be defined as a scientific 
knowledge for the production of goods and services (Mshingini 2001, 
p.96). Also, ICT is the interconnected set of technological and 
organisational innovations in electronic computers, software engineering, 
control systems, integrated circuits and telecommunications that have 
made it possible to collect, generate, analyse and diffuse large quantities 
of information at minimal cost.  Through the use of science and technology 
and information and communication technology the public service can 
improve its service delivery. 
 
2.3.1.5   Information and communication technology 
 
The world is currently going through an information era revolution and it is 
facing the deepest, fastest and most generalised transformation 
throughout history.  Production and management today is characterised 
by productivity and competitiveness based on the generation of 
knowledge, and diffused through the global economy, influencing the 
spatial distribution of economic activities (Elull 1999, p.67). 
 
The power of information is overwhelming. Events in one part of the world 
can be transmitted instantaneously to every corner of the globe. 
Information highways have resulted in instantaneous decision making, 
thereby reducing time, effort and the cost of transactions within and across 
borders.  There is a radical economic shift where the value of information, 
knowledge and processes is fast outgrowing the sum of agricultural and 
industrial commodities , and computers are becoming the liv elihood of 
today’s business (Elull 1999, p.67). 
 
Elull (1999, p.67) adds that i nformation technology has become an 
indispensable tool that can be used to advance productivity in all spheres
<<<PAGE=55>>>
- 33 -  
of life.  Information technology has increased the ability of individuals and 
organisations to influence operations beyond their geographical 
boundaries, thus enhancing the process of globalisation. People advertise 
through the internet and access markets without using the middleman.  
Some of the emerging trends include e- commerce, e- business, tele-
medicine, tele-conferences, e-education, borderless education and virtual 
universities with no campuses. 
 
Certainly, the opportunities presented, by ICT, and its ripple effects on 
productivity and the way people work, are enormous and mind boggling.  It 
will however be naïve to think that ICT offers only opportunities and no 
challenges. 
 
As a result of the current advances in S&T especially in ICT, production is 
shifting from low -wage developi ng countries to high- wage developed 
countries, and having a large or cheap labour force will not be an 
advantage in the new global economy (Meadows 1992, p.90).  The wealth 
of the future will be created largely by knowledge and technology and not 
by natural resources and large populations.  Even right now, rich nations 
use information to create wealth.  African countries, including Botswana, 
try to create wealth by exporting raw materials to the more affluent 
nations. 
 
Undoubtedly though, ICT is already par t of people’s daily lives, and it will 
be a critical part of the country’s productivity process.  It is important to 
note that ICT is a double- edged sword and its successful exploration will 
depend on a delicate balancing act. Information communication 
technology offers Botswana opportunities that should be harnessed, and it 
poses risks that should be minimised (Elull 1999, p.68).
<<<PAGE=56>>>
- 34 -  
2.3.1.6 Human resources 
 
Human resources and technological material resources are factors that 
complement each other in any productiv ity process.  However, one of the 
biggest problems facing Botswana today is the acute shortage of 
scientists, professionals and technical manpower, and that certainly has 
serious repercussions on the level of productivity.  Assimilation of science 
and t echnology prescribes a fairly well -educated and trained workforce.  
Education fosters “belief”, while training fosters confidence, two elements 
which are essential in the production of goods and services in any 
industry. 
 
The increased value placed on acquiri ng, manipulating and 
communicating data and knowledge increasingly places work not in a 
particular geographical location but wherever the knowledgeable and 
skilled workforce resides.  Industrial jobs are being transformed into 
technological jobs. In additi on, analysis of major policy issues facing the 
citizenry, whether in healthcare, social policy or the environment, 
increasingly requires some familiarity with science and technology (Elul l 
1999, p.89). 
 
Although Botswana has made commendable progress in IC T and has 
computerised networks in government and institutional offices, many 
computers are merely used as glorified typewriters, and are not used to 
their full potential due to a lack of adequate knowledge.  Worse still, as a 
result of ‘technology lag’ and probably decay in the work ethos, these 
computers are being used as gadgets of leisure like playing cards and 
surfing the internet during working hours, activities that are certainly not in 
the employee’s job descriptions.
<<<PAGE=57>>>
- 35 -  
Another serious problem facing  Botswana is that of qualified personnel in 
fields such as engineering, medical, research and development. Elul l 
(1999, p.101) argues that one of the critical elements which determines 
the competitiveness of nations is the population density and quality of  its 
engineers.  The author argues that a key to the success of countries such 
as Japan and the USA which could be directly linked to the emergence of 
technological advancement. 
 
 
The key to understanding the importance of fields such as engineering is 
to note that an economy is constituted on assets (accumulated wealth) 
and the transformation process (production, etc .). Competitiveness 
combines assets and processes assets which are inherited (natural 
resources) or created (e.g. infrastructure),  and then in ternationalisation 
which tests the formula in the international markets creates a competitive 
world. 
 
2.3.1.7 Organisational behaviour issues on productivity and 
quality 
 
One of the major focus areas of Botswana National Productivity Centre is 
aiding insti tutions in the country to improve their level of awareness of 
productivity and quality issues and, where possible, aid them in 
implementing productivity and quality related policies. The following 
section will focus on the relevant section of literature in  the field of 
organisational behaviour with a focus on both structural and human 
behaviour issues.
<<<PAGE=58>>>
- 36 -  
2.3.1.7.1 Challenges 
 
Porter (1998, p.256) explains that in the modern global economy, 
prosperity is a nation’s choice. Competitiveness is no longer limi ted to 
those nations with a favourable inheritance. Nations choose prosperity if 
they organise their politics, laws and institutions based on productivity. 
 
Kgarabe (2004,  p.6) observes that even though Botswana has 
experienced phenomenal economic growth during the last thirty years, this 
growth was not evenly spread across both the private and public service 
sectors and this presents challenges to economic development. The 
biggest challenge facing Botswana in its industrialisation efforts is the 
need to foster sustainable growth of non- mineral economic sectors 
(economic diversification) and employment creation. It is however, 
important that the aspiration of the country be matched by the levels of its 
commitment on productivity issues. Kgarebe (2004, p.44) alludes to the 
fact that it is unwise to further create development without taking into 
consideration the productivity levels that inform the competitiveness of the 
country. 
 
2.3.1.7.2 Readiness for change 
 
Readiness for change is an imperative attitude for organisations to 
successfully implement the new p roductivity and quality assurance 
policies. Change management theory asserts that for change to be 
successful, change should match the prevailing culture of the entity 
initiatives, and resistance to change must be overcome. Harvey, Donald 
and Brown (2001, p.438) emphasise the importance of changing the 
corporate culture and further state that there is general agreement that 
effective organisation culture can result in superior performance. There is 
also considerable agreement that organisations facing discontinuity −  out
<<<PAGE=59>>>
- 37 -  
of touch with the environment  may need large- scale cultural change. 
However, changing the organisational culture is often difficult because the 
culture is based upon past success. Therefore,  members of the 
organisation may hold deeply entrenched beliefs and strong personal 
investment in the existing culture.  
 
Harvey et al ., (2001, p. 439) note that the organisational culture may 
inhibit the implementation of strategy and prevent the firm from meeting its 
competitive threats or from adapting to changing economic conditions. 
This can lead to a firm’s decline, stagnation, or even ultimate demise 
unless the culture is changed. Likewise , it is important for the public 
service culture to change in order to accommodate performance 
improvement initiatives and that these endeavors become fruitful. 
 
2.3.1.7.3 Management 
 
Though the following literature focuses on quality, it should be noted that 
productivity and quality responsibilities for management c annot be de-
linked.  They are two sides of the same coin. 
 
Somolekae (1996, p.67) places a heavy responsibility on management for 
quality achievement. The author  argues that 75% of quality deficiencies 
can be traced to management.  She further adds  that quality must be led 
from the top  and that the CEO must be directly involved in quality, 
spending a significant amount of his or her time on quality issues. 
 
2.3.1.7.4 Creating a viable institution 
 
Somolekae (2005, p.67) notes that an institution is viable i f it can adapt 
and evolve in its operational environment. Failure to evolve may result in 
collapse of the enterprise. The ability for the organisation to evolve is
<<<PAGE=60>>>
- 38 -  
constrained by the dysfunctional part of the enterprise. The Botswana 
public service has been evolving at a slow rate due to its bureaucracy, 
lack of implementation capacity and change in organisational culture. 
 
Mogalakwe (2001, p.90) argues that the government has not done enough 
in the improvement of capacity building in the Botswana public service.  
He further laments the inconsistency on implementation of various 
government policies designed to improve service delivery in the public 
service sector and other parastatals. Mogalakwe (2001, p.93) 
recommends that all stakeholders should play a cri tical role in the creation 
of a viable public service based on the founding principles of the Vision 
2016 so that the quality of service delivery may become an integral part of 
every public service manager’s; strategy and planning. 
 
Based on the above, the  author can infer that productivity, quality 
initiatives and achievement or failure in organisations are all dependent on 
institutional viability. 
 
The latest endeavours to raise productivity in the public service by the 
Botswana government include amongst  others, the establishment of the 
Botswana National Productivity Centre and through the exhortations by 
government officials. But the scientists including the social scientist 
distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions for the 
phenomenon to oc cur.  The creation of the BNPC and other productivity 
initiatives are certainly necessities for high productivity, but are not 
sufficient on their own.  The development of a sense of national pride will 
create self-confidence. The creation of capacity -building institutions such 
as the BNPC will go a long way in improving productivity in Botswana. It is 
important that stakeholders do not only talk about productivity, but create 
material conditions for its existence. Privatisation is one of the public
<<<PAGE=61>>>
- 39 -  
reform programmes introduced by the government to improve public 
service delivery.  
 
2.3.2  Privatisation in Botswana 
 
Privatisation has been adopted by other African countries to improve 
service delivery in public entities and enterprises. In Botswana, the issue 
of privatisation was received with mixed feelings particularly with 
organised labour who felt for morale reasons the government should not 
go head with the implementation of the process as it has far reaching 
implications to the workforce. 
 
In the previous section the BNPC was discussed with a view to 
establishing how the institution has met its mandate of improving service 
delivery in the Botswana public service sector. This section will cover an 
in-depth discussion on privatisation and how far the strategy yielded fruits, 
its demerits and where it went wrong. 
 
Gergis (1999, p.8) notes that the performance of public sector institution s 
has been disappointing to say the least in many developing countries. 
While privatisation is among the policy options for public sector reforms, 
other reform mechanisms can also be powerful tools when properly 
implemented. 
 
2.3.2.1 Background 
 
Privatisation in Botswana was formally adopted by Parliament in the year 
2000.  While many Sub- Saharan countries have adopted privatis ation at 
the insistence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World 
Bank, this has not been the case in Botswana.  Privatisation in Botswana 
is an internally generated strategy that is intended to improve not only the
<<<PAGE=62>>>
- 40 -  
performance of the public enterprise sector, but also that of the public 
sector in general.  Privatisation is also the fulfilment of government’s 
commitment to make the private sector an engine of economic growth 
(Molosiwa 2001, p.64). 
 
According to the government Policy Paper on Pr ivatisation (Paper N0 16 
of 2001, p.77), the strategy to be adopted is dependent on the existing 
situation in as far as policy implementation is concerned. These include 
commercialisation, corporatisation, contracting out, franchises, leases, 
concessions, liquidation, selling assets, fragmentation and unbundling and 
stock market floating.  The choice of any method is dependent on the 
objectives to be achieved, and in Botswana, the methods adopted were 
through the recommendation of the Public Enterprises Evaluation and 
Privatisation Agency (PEEPA) whose mandate is to work out all the 
modalities and logistics of the privatisation exercise. However, it has 
become apparent that the Government’s intention is not to sell public 
enterprises, but to commercialise and contract out some of the activities 
both in government departments and public enterprises. 
 
Molosiwa (2001, p.64) explains that any method of privatisation has its 
own distinct characteristics, and hence will have a distinct form of 
implications. She further observes that, any form would require a particular 
policy framework to be put in place before it can be implemented.  This 
implies that any choice of strategy would be made with such peculiar 
characteristics in mind.  
 
2.3.2.2  Implementation of privatisation 
 
The questions that arise are;  has the Botswana government achieved the 
above mentioned objective on privatisation or not, and if not what went 
wrong?  Sceptics and proponents alike, have arguments for and against
<<<PAGE=63>>>
- 41 -  
privatisation even before its implementation.  It is obviously important to 
define what is meant by privatisation.  According to Gergis (2001, p.71) 
privatisation must be well defined in privatisation programmes. He defines 
privatisation as: 
 
 The transfer of ownership from the public to the private sector; 
 Leasing of such assets while maintaining public ownership; 
 The transfer of management of public entities to the private sector 
through management contracts; and 
 Contracting out (outsourcing) of public services to the private 
sector; and deregulation and liberalisation. 
 
Potential benefits and costs of privatisation must be critically examined 
and evaluated. 
Privatisation plans should   identify ways to overcome or mitigate the worst 
potential impacts of privatisation and structural transf ormation and to 
support and reinforce positive outcomes. 
 
Privatisation in Botswana has been adopted on the premises that it would 
bring about the following benefits: 
 
Firstly, it promotes competition; it improves efficiency and increases the 
productivity of enterprises;  
 
Secondly, it i ncreases direct citizen participation in t he ownership of 
national assets;  
 
Thirdly, privatisation accelerates the rate of economic growth by 
stimulating entrepreneurship and investment;
<<<PAGE=64>>>
- 42 -  
Fourthly, it withdraws from government those commercial activities which 
no longer need to be undertaken by the public sector; 
 
Fifthly, it reduces the size of the public sector; and  
 
Finally, privatisation relieves the financial and administrative burden of 
government in undertaking and maintaining a constantly expanding 
network (Molosiwa 2001, p.57). 
 
Taking into account the objectives and the definition of privatisation in the 
Botswana’s context, it is evident that like other government policies, 
procedures and strategies, the implement ation of privatisation in 
Botswana has been a major problem. 
  
Sentsho (1999, p.14) notes that privatisation could have yielded positive 
results if  it had something unique to B otswana or thoroughly creative to 
give the country competitive advantages. Sents ho further observes that 
the privatisation process has failed to come up with values, norms or 
beliefs that can make Botswana globally competitive.  The author is of the 
opinion that there is a need to search in every nook and cranny for 
something uniquely indigenous that can make the country competitive and 
have a diversified economy. Sentsho (1999, p.15) believes that 
privatisation should not create institutions that do business as usual.  It 
should create situations in which it will be unusual. This is particularly so 
when public service delivery is factored into the equation. 
 
2.3.2.3 Case studies  
 
The Tanzanian experience shows that improving individual and collective 
performance requires changing people’s attitudes, and values together 
with a complete overhaul of the management system. In Tanzania,
<<<PAGE=65>>>

problems have been identified and strategies have been developed to 
overcome them. These included increasing the involvement of the private 
sector in the service delivery as it continues to grow and mature and 
taking initiatives to improve the performance of the public service sector 
workforce (Gergis 1999, p.13). 
 
Gergis (1999 , p.17) further states that, judging from experience in 
Singapore harnessing the qualitivity (combining quality and productivity) of 
employees seems like a good idea that can be adopted by the public 
service.  Top management must be willing to listen, supervisors, must be 
willing to change, while employees at the operating level must be willing to 
trust the organisation.  
 
Gergis (1999, p.35) points out that the lesson learnt from the Dairiboard 
Zimbabwe Limited case study is that the development of strategic 
alliances is one way of enhancing the operational efficiency and 
effectiveness as well as the productivity of state enterprises.  T he essence 
of turnaround is to focus on core- business activi ties and sharpen 
competitive advantages. Outsourcing or outcontracting is one avenue 
through which competition and productivity can be enhanced. 
 
Kenya Airways is one of the success stories in Afr ica in recent times.  The 
success of Kenya Airways privatisation experience can be attributed first 
and foremost to the Government’s political will and clear objectives and 
sense of purpose. The three factors are the choice of top management, 
the choice of a competent privatisation advisor and the choice and use of 
a competent strategic partner (Gergis 1999. p.45).
<<<PAGE=66>>>
- 44 -  
According to Gergis (1999, p.45) the Jamaican experience confirms that: 
 
 Privatisation must be part of a comprehensive reform programme; 
 Privatising public utilities requires a new regulatory framework; 
 Privatisation will only succeed when the problem is transparent; 
 Undeveloped capital markets in themselves are not major 
impediments to privatisation; and 
 In the early stages it is important to develop the technical skills 
required to execute the privatization process. 
 
Malasyia’s privatisation was also a success. Unlike Botswana, Malaysia’s 
privatisation policy has proven to be successful due to several factors 
which include the following . The acceptance of the privatisation process 
by both the government and people; privatisation is based on the Malaysia 
Incorporated concept that is to foster close co -operation between the 
private and public sector to achieve economic development. The 
Government is concerned with the viability and performance of the 
companies that undertake privatisation projects. Privatisation must be 
broad-based, covering various sectors of the economy. Malaysia’s 
privatisation is transparent, and encourages the private sector  
participation, through various incentives (Gergis 1999, p.47). 
 
When making comparisons between Botswana’s privatisation and those of 
the abovementioned countries, it is clear that Botswana privatisation lacks 
credibility in many areas to improve public s ervice delivery.  Tanzania’s 
case study on countries that have successfully implemented privatisation 
show that there were no external forces pressing privatisation upon them.    
 
There is a growing need for reform measures to be introduced in the 
public service sector. Privatisation in Botswana has failed to enhance the 
productivity and efficiency which was anticipated. In an endeavour to
<<<PAGE=67>>>
- 45 -  
improve public service delivery the government of Botswana introduced 
yet another initiative namely Work Improvement Teams.  
 
2.3.3 Work Improvement Teams 
 
This section will cover a discussion on the mission of the Botswana public 
service, definition, and background, objectives of WITS, achievements 
and problems  
 
2.3.3.1   Definition of Work Improvement Teams 
 
Work Improvement Teams are a group of civil servants or teams of public 
officers from the same work unit, irrespective of divisional status who meet 
regularly to: 
 
 Identify, examine, analyse and solve problems pertaining to work in 
their department or work unit; 
 Identify and examine improvement opportunities and propose and 
implement improvement measures; 
 Help to adapt the work unit and hence the department to changing 
circumstances; 
 Discuss and conduct studies on how to improve their working 
environment, efficiency, effectiveness, quality of service, knowledge 
and skilled team work, work performance, use of resources, work 
goals, objectives and targets, systems, methods, procedures etc .; 
and  
 To ensure job satisfaction (DPSM 1994, p.4). 
 
The establishment of the National Productivity Centre and the privatization 
process are noble endeavours in addressing productivity-related problems 
and hopeflly assisting organisations, private and public sectors in their
<<<PAGE=68>>>
- 46 -  
workforce.  The government of Botswana has identified the impro vement 
of productivity in the public service as a critical need.  In respect to the 
public service, the government has approved the creation of Work 
Improvement Teams in the public service.  This was yet another initiative 
deliberately undertaken in order to address productivity -related issues in 
the public service.  This strategy is a tried and tested method and could 
still be used elsewhere in the economy as a productivity-improvement tool. 
 
2.3.3.2 The mission of the Botswana public service 
 
Members of t he public service are appointed on the basis of merit. They 
should serve Batswana by delivering the programmes  of government and 
assisting ministers of the government in devising effective policies and 
programmes necessary for good government. The public s ervice should 
adhere to the following values: 
 
 Prompt and courteous service to people and loyalty to the 
government; 
 Honesty and integrity, faithfulness to the principles of fairness 
and impartiality; 
 Neutrality, transparency and permanency in the service; 
 Professionalism and quality service; 
 Frugality and prudence in the use of resources; 
 Perseverance and patience in the pursuit of good service; and 
 Respect for ministers, parliamentarians, and senior officials, 
members of the public and members of the publ ic service 
(DPSM 2004, p.98). 
 
In order to achieve the above objectives it is mandatory that the 
government introduce yet another performance -improvement initiative to 
facilitate the quality of public service delivery desired through teams.
<<<PAGE=69>>>
- 47 -  
2.3.3.3 Background of Work Improvement Teams 
 
According to the DPSM titled Strategy for productivity improvement in the 
Botswana Public Service, the fundamental mission as mentioned in 
section (2.4.2.1) is to serve Botswana by delivering the programmes  of 
government and assisting ministers in devising effective policies and 
programmes necessary for good government. 
 
Ayeni and You ng (1998, p.13) note that the importance of productivity 
improvement as a way of enhancing these and other vital attributes of the 
public service cannot be overemphasised.  Productivity enhancement is at 
the core of all contemporary economies, particularly in the developing 
world.  With recent phenomenal advancements in the political, economic, 
technological and other aspects of society, there has been increasing 
public awareness of, and a demand for, even higher quality goods and 
services.  Improved performance is the key to the ability of countries and 
organisations to compete effectively in the prevailing environment of 
growing interdependence and interaction. 
 
Ayeni and You ng (1998, p.13) add that by the same token, raising 
workers’ productivity has become an absolute necessity.  With this reality 
in mind, the government of Botswana decided to adapt the WITS from 
Singapore as a tool for increasing productivity in the public sector. The 
programme was launched in 1993 as an integral part of a broader 
productivity enhancement drive. 
 
Thus in 1991, a mission embarked on a study tour of Productivity Centres 
in South East Asia, which had achieved tremendous economic 
development over the previous decade. On its return, the mission re-
affirmed the proposal for the establishment of a Productivity Centre.  The 
committee further recommended that Singapore should be the model
<<<PAGE=70>>>
- 48 -  
country for the Botswana initiativ e. Following government’s acceptance of 
its recommendations, a National Productivity Movement was officially 
launched in April 1993, beginning with the establishment of the BNPC with 
a nationwide mandate. At the same time, Work Improvement Teams 
(WITS) strategies were introduced as a means of improving the efficiency, 
effectiveness and quality of service provided by the civil service 
organisations (Ayeni & Young 1998, p.14). 
 
During a three day state visit to Botswana, the President of the Republic of 
Singapore Mr Nathan encouraged his Botswana counterpart to 
continuously seek to improve public service performance for the country to 
be competitive in the global arena. President Nathan further commended 
Botswana on her achievement through public service refor m programmes. 
The President Mr Nathan however cautioned the Botswana government 
and all stakeholders to ensure that the implementation process is done 
with the utmost caution to avoid failure (Botswana Daily News 2007, p.27). 
 
2.3.3.4 Objectives of Work Improvement Teams 
 
Work Improvement Teams (WITS) provide the channel through which 
management can directly and positively enhance employee morale and 
team spirit, and direct these to bringing about improvements in people, 
teams and organisational performance.  Most importantly, the objectives 
of WITS are: 
 
 Satisfying the civil service’s needs: 
  Inspiring a higher degree of teamwork and morale; 
  Promoting job-involvement; 
  Creating a problem-solving capacity in the team work; 
  Instilling system, service, group quality consciousness or 
awareness in the team members;
<<<PAGE=71>>>
- 49 -  
  Encouraging self-management by members; 
  Improving employee relations; 
  Creating a problem-prevention attitude; 
  Enhancing the quality of service, for example service to the public, 
service to other  sections of the same organisation and service to 
other departments; 
  Improving communication; 
  Developing personal and leadership qualities and capabilities; 
  Improving employee motivation, performance and productivity; and 
  Creating a cheerful and harmonious job environment (DPSM 1997, 
p.4). 
 
2.3.3.5 Achievements and problems of implementation 
 
There are a number of achievements by WITS since they were formed. It 
is however important to note that there  have been problems particularly 
during the implementation phase. These problems include amongst 
others; dysfunctioning of teams, lack of project completion, lack of senior 
management support and lack of evaluation of WITS. 
 
2.3.3.5.1 Participation 
 
It is mandatory for civil servants to participate in WITS ac tivities.  The civil 
service is broadly defined to include central government administration 
and local authorities. There are also plans to extend the programme  to 
foreign missions. The strategy documents detail the responsibilities of all 
relevant role-players, regardless of in which sector they are located, in the 
implementation process. Ayeni and Young (1998, p.21) note that , the rate 
of participation differs from one ministry/department to another. A crude 
measure of participation is the registered WIT S relative to persons in the 
workforce.
<<<PAGE=72>>>
- 50 -  
2.3.3.5.2 Problems of implementation 
 
The WITS evaluation team identified the following problems of the WITS 
implementation process. 
 
Firstly, According to (WITS Evaluation Report 2003, p.45), although the 
numbers o f existing teams are appreciably close to the 550 projected  
1998 in the strategy document, it should be noted that being registered is 
not sufficient to maintain an active and well -functioning team. Ayeni  and 
Young (1998, p.21) add that some of the teams cannot, in all seriousness, 
be described as functional. Meetings were not frequently held, and the 
further one moves from Gaborone, the less satisfactory is the situation 
one finds. The evaluators further observed yet more concerns when team 
members are in small field offices, they do not work within the 
geographically specified area.  
 
Secondly, the problem associated with the WITS  implementation process 
is that teams do not complete their projects on time and this can be 
attributed to the fact that meeti ngs are few and far apart which results in 
projects either being suspended or completely abandoned. According to 
the report, new projects are registered annually, although at the time of 
evaluation a total of 11 had been documented. Importantly , no project has 
been completed since 1998. Similarly, at least six teams are yet to settle 
down to identify any definite projects. Even in this apparently successful 
case, there are obvious areas of concern.     
 
Thirdly, the WITS Development Unit (WDU) evaluation report indicates 
that the unit’s performance is unsatisfactory and observers note that this 
unit has failed the WITS implementation process in the public service. The 
report indicates that in some cases teams chose projects beyond their 
scope and were consequently unable to effectively implement them (Ayeni
<<<PAGE=73>>>
- 51 -  
& Yo ung 1998, p.2). Teams in such situations need help. Apparently, 
WDU does not currently have a qualified staff with the expertise to carry 
out the actual improvement projects. Such people should be trai ned in 
organisation and m anagement (O & M) to serve as consultants to coach 
and develop the teams concerned. It was also observed that 
communication between teams is generally poor.  
 
For example, there is no established newsletter which regularly publishes 
useful concrete experiences. There were similar concerns about the level 
of support received from top management, especially as regards their 
willingness to direct organisational resources towards the implementation 
process.    
 
Fourthly, since 1997, the WDU begun conducting regular two- day WITS 
appreciation seminars for senior fficers to enhance their understanding, 
and hopefully to give greater support to tackling WITS performance 
issues. However, it is evident from the response of senior officers that,  
WITS is not a priority or they are not concerned with the concept of WITS. 
It will take quite some time for the impact of these seminars, provided that 
they are sustained, to become manifest. Nevertheless, the initial 
impression, at the level of participa tion is significantly influenced by a 
degree of leadership, support and commitment. Where top managers are 
supportive and involved, the participation of the rest of the staff turns out 
to be high. The opposite is the case where top management is indifferen t 
to the concept, which is the case in the Botswana public service (Ayeni  & 
Young 1998, p.22). 
 
Fifthly, the evaluation of teams and trained facilitators is complicated, 
since they are too busy to evaluate the process. Others complained about 
the consequence of transfers and postings of officers by DPSM without 
regard to their role in the WITS programme.
<<<PAGE=74>>>
- 52 -  
It can be concluded from the above discussion that, the WITS 
implementation process had numerous problems and this has impacted  
on the programme in the Botswana public service. Some of these 
problems include amongst others, lack of interest by top managers as one 
of the highlighted problems that hampered the implementation of WITS. 
Manpower staffing (transfers for WITS members) has also grossly affected 
the implementation of WITS as a performance- improvement strategy. The 
performance management sysytem is one of the reform initiatives 
introduced by the government to improve service delivery. 
 
 
2.3.4 Performance Management System 
 
Performance management is based on the proposition that when people 
know and understand what is expected of them and have been able to 
take part forming these expectations, they will be able and willing to meet 
these expectations (Armstrong 1999, p. 8). 
 
The performance of the public servi ce sector employees in Botswana has 
been a major concern to the Botswana gov ernment. It has been 
characterised by low work performance and poor service delivery. 
Problem indicators included; absenteeism, lateness, corruption, theft, and 
a high degree of complaints, low quality work and poor turnover 
(Tshukudu 2006, p.8).  
 
This section will cover a discussion on the background, benefits, problems 
of implementation relating to performance management system s and 
recommendations to supervisors managers, and human resources 
managers.
<<<PAGE=75>>>
- 53 -  
2.3.4.1 Background of performance in the Botswana public 
service 
 
Any government’s agenda often changes in response to the demands and 
expectations of the nation it is serving, including other internal obligations, 
and the external environment, in particular the competitive world.  The 
government of Botswana and indeed the public service has nevertheless, 
achieved a lot over the past years since independence. A number of 
reforms and performance improvement initiatives were implemented 
during this period, some of which achieved their intended objectives.   
 
The Training and Localisation Commission was established immediately 
after independence with the aim of ensuring that jobs are placed in the 
hands of Botswanans. Over the years l ocalisation has succeeded in 
providing some of the local employees in the country and continues to do 
so, without any compromise to efficiency.  The financial and manpower 
ceiling, introduced in the late seventies, has served a most useful purpose 
in that there no unaccounted for posts, ghost employees in the public 
service. The job- evaluation exercise, introduced to ensure that 
remuneration was commensurate with job responsibility, has sustained the 
pay-structure of the public service for many years. Organisation and 
methods (O&M) reviews were introduced to facilitate the establishment of 
clear goals and objectives by ministries and departments (DPSM 2002, 
p.134). 
 
Since Botswana attained independence on the 30th September 1966, 
National Development Plans, which covered the period of five years each, 
have been drawn up as instruments followed in the orderly and prioritized 
delivery of services to the nation. Packages of priorities that each ministry 
had indicated they could tackle within five- year periods were listed and 
funding sought for their execution within the plan period. Adequate
<<<PAGE=76>>>
- 54 -  
manpower resources were at the same time provided to enable the 
projects to be executed and after execution, maintained (DPSM, 2002, 
p.42). 
 
Execution of all the individual projects for the purpose of delivering 
services did not have any firm commencement and completion dates. With 
no target dates set for the commencement and completion of delivery of 
services to the nation, some projects were executed to fruition whilst 
others were not, necessitating their carry -over from one development plan 
to the next. The reasons for this have been many and varied, but the 
crucial one has been a lack of the performance management system to be 
used as an instrument for guiding the public se rvice performance at both 
ministerial and departmental level. There were no detailed operational 
plans in place to guide ministries in their effective service delivery of 
projects. This has more often than not, resulted in major implementation 
problems (DPSM 2002, p.52). 
 
Somolekae (2005, p.98) states that the achievement referred to above 
was also not without problems, which eventually made the public service 
inefficient. The current state of affairs, described below, has earned the 
government and the publ ic service a bad reputation compounded by a 
perceived insensitivity to public demands, non- performance and the 
overall lack of accountability and discipline.  More specifically: 
 
 There is a perceived general waste of resources and inefficiency in 
managing these resources in ministries and departments. Lack of 
proper planning and management of funds have repeatedly 
resulted in non- completion of key projects, more funding for some 
projects and this has greatly affected the fiscus. Inefficient 
management of hu man resources has at times resulted in 
unwarranted posts in some ministries;
<<<PAGE=77>>>
- 55 -  
 
 Batswana are generally not involved in the decision- making 
processes, particularly with regard to their demands and 
aspirations. The public service is often viewed as being insensitive 
to what really matters to the public in  terms of the services 
provided; 
 
 The National Development Plans (NDP) present a macroplan for 
ministries and departments to follow, but often times there are few 
or no operational plans at organisational level to ensure delivery. 
There are no strategic plans, key goals and objectives coupled with 
very little information on performance and achiev ements of 
strategic obligations;   
 
 There is a general lack of confidence in the public service by the 
nation compo unded by unending public disquiet about the 
government as an ineffectual and inefficient service provider. The 
tax-payer is convinced that they are not getting their p ula’s worth; 
and 
 
 The wind of change is continually sweeping across the globe and 
compels countries and their nations, often with limited choices and 
resources, to become competitive if they are to survive and sustain 
themselves. Botswana is no exception to this global frenzy and the 
public service is no doubt the main driver of this important  initiative 
as the majority employer (DPSM 2002, p.134). 
 
What started as a murmur by the public about non- delivery of services by 
Ministries and Departments of government has now become a loud 
accusation against the government at large, including local au thorities. 
Government has for a long time been worried about  this situation and
<<<PAGE=78>>>
- 56 -  
from 1994 and 1997 it has conducted an investigation into what steps 
could be taken to put things right.  The outcome of the investigation was a 
recommendation that a completely modern system be adopted to improve 
the existing public service way of management, if productivity of these 
services were to be restored. The recommendation included the 
introduction of three reforms namely: decentralisation, computerisation of 
the pers onnel management system and a performance management 
system (DPSM 2001, p.111).  
 
An efficient and effective public service is a prerequisite for higher 
economic performance. The Botswana government took a decision, based 
on the past history of the country 's performance, to introduce the 
Performance Management System as a reform strategy to improve the 
government’s service delivery system and enable it to drive the economy 
to the desired level of performance ( Botswana Public Service Reforms 
Unit 2006, p.3).  The Performance Management System has been 
identified as the appropriate system to facilitate the necessary transition. 
This followed the recommendations made by A frica Economic 
Development consultants from their investigations into public service 
performance and evaluation of past reforms.  
 
2.3.4.2 The benefits of a performance management system 
 
Armstrong (1999, p.432) notes that a well -implemented performance 
management process is beneficial to the organisation, its managers and 
employees. The organisa tion is able to grow and satisfy both customers 
and stakeholders. Management directs and manages the organisation at a 
higher level of efficiency, characterized by performance management and 
maintenance of skills and values. Employees develop a sense of 
belonging and attachment since they view  themselves as an integral part
<<<PAGE=79>>>
- 57 -  
of the organisation. But more specifically, the performance management 
system is beneficial in that: 
 
 There is integration in the organisation, characterized by a shared 
vision, common v alues, communicated strategy and a universal 
focus on output. Everybody knows and understands where the 
organisation is going, why and how it is taking that direction, how 
they fit into the picture, and what is expected from them; 
 
 There are clearly defined sets of standards or requirements for 
ministries, departments, divisions, units, and individual employees.  
They all know what is expected of them in terms of performance or 
achievement. There are no surprises for anybody at any given time. 
 The system encourages open communication in the organisation. 
Communication between management and employees is 
enhanced, and more importantly, they deri ve outputs and plans of 
actions; 
 
 Customers/clients’ needs are addressed and there are greater and 
committed efforts  to satisfy these needs.  The organisation is 
responsive, through a regular feedback process, to the needs and 
aspirations of the customer. The organisation thus provides the 
required services, and it perceives what the customers want; 
 
 Due to the fact that a performance management system is holistic, 
integrated and self -sustaining in design and approach it therefore 
facilitates the use of IT and other performance -improvement 
initiatives like re -engineering, restructuring, performance -related 
pay, WITS, etc. in the organisation;  
 
 Performance management encourages and supports team building
<<<PAGE=80>>>
- 58 -  
and team work at every level of the organisation. Strategic 
objectives are achieved through committed and collective effort by 
all, and everyone becomes an important part of the whole process; 
 
 The use of this system enhances the effective management of 
training and development in ministries through focused and specific 
training on identified needs emanating from strategic requirements;  
 
 Through the PMS, any training and development initiatives will 
support and be related to the strategy; 
 
 This system also gives public officers the opportunity to attain and 
use more effective tools, techniques and skills to improve 
performance and management generally; and  
 
 Through the development of strategic goals and plans ministries 
are able to objectively justify their budget and funding requirements 
in any given period (DPSM 2002, p.7). 
 
2.3.4.3 Problems of implementation  
 
Somolekae (2005, p.78) observes that like any other reform programme, 
the performance management system has been seen by experts as yet 
another exotic strategy that does not conform to the culture and work 
ethics of the Botswana work force. These analysts are of the opinion that 
the performance management system sh ould have some degree of 
conformity to the culture of the public service or more importantly that of 
the nation. Raditlhokwa (2006 , p.13) supports Somolekae’s views that 
some observers have questioned the effectiveness of the Botswana 
performance managemen t system since its implementation in 1998 
against the backdrop of a continued decline in the productivity levels in the
<<<PAGE=81>>>
- 59 -  
country. There is an outcry from the business community that on the 
contrary, the PMS has adversely affected public service delivery bec ause 
government officials are always out attending PMS seminars and 
workshops, and leaving junior officials in charge who are either unsure of 
their role or just incompetent. 
 
Mogalakwe (2004, p.34) explains that  even if there is no official PMS 
evaluation report to date, there is evidence that the Performance 
Management System adopted by the government of Botswana in 1998, is 
not without problems. Critics have always been concerned with the 
implementation of this initiative, noting that top government off icials are 
likely to sabotage the initiative, because they are either too scared or not 
ready to change their management styles. How then is it possible to for 
them to spearhead the initiatives?  
 
Mpabanga (2003, p.78) concurs with Mogalakwe that fear of c hange by 
top public service officials has led to the ineffectiveness of the PMS to 
date. Mpabanga (2003, p. 78) emphasizes the need to review the PMS 
stating that the process has been running for rather a long time without 
being evaluated and he cautions the government of Botswana will 
continue spending millions of pulas on an ineffective endeavour. 
Mpabanga reiterates that the government should take a clearer stand on 
ensuring that the PMS becomes a success given the money spent on the 
exercise. On the cont rary, during the ongoing parliament debate on the 
budget speech, the Minister of Education Mr Nkate informed the House 
that his Ministry will be sending 80 Ministry employees to the United 
States of America to be trained in Change Agent Training and Leader ship 
Strategies (CATALYST) to the tune of pula 41.6 million. The Minister met 
a great resistance from his fellow legislators and cabinet m inisters noting 
that the time has come for the government to reconsider its position when 
sponsoring non-viable initiatives like performance management systems.
<<<PAGE=82>>>
- 60 -  
 
According to the Business Economic Advisory Council (BEAC  2003, p.91) 
report, since the adoption of PMS in the public service,  the government 
has spent over pula 956 million on performance management systems, an  
exercise which has not yielded much in the way of results. The BEAC 
further recommends comprehensive transformation of the Botswana 
public service. At the outset, the BEAC  (2003, p.92) states the belief that 
the civil service should be used as a vehicle f or job creation should be 
abandoned; instead the lethargic civil service needed strict standards of 
discipline, behaviour, attitudes, as well as dress and uniform standards. 
The BEAC recommends the pay for performance principle at all but the 
lowest levels . The government was further urged to benchmark its 
remuneration packages against the private sector norms while at the 
same time setting performance criteria. The report further states that in the 
new look civil services, high performers would be rewarded through 
bonuses, while underperformers would be identified and eliminated.  
 
It is clear from the above recommendation that the performance 
management system is not a success story as people may think. The 
business communities through the BEAC view the PM S as a non- starter, 
in which resources (money and time) have been spent with little or no 
improvement in the public service performance.   
 
In his research titled, Performance Management Strategies Used by the 
Botswana Public Service, Tshukudu (2006, p.174) recommends eight 
performance management strategies to be used by the Botswana public 
service, namely: re- visiting business plans and objectives, establishing 
key performance areas, defining performance expectation, establishing 
performance measures, planning to facilitate performance, monitoring 
performance, appraising performance, providing feedback, improving 
performance and recognising and rewarding good performance.
<<<PAGE=83>>>
- 61 -  
 
Tshukudu (2006, p.174) identifies in addition to the ten performance 
management strategies, four critical factors to be taken into consideration 
for performance management to be effective: establishing a performance 
culture, developing performance leadership, creating a learning 
organisation and aligning individual, team and organisational goals.  
 
The empirical study was done by means of a survey with a questionnaire 
as a data- gathering instrument. The empirical study revealed that most 
respondents felt that the first four strategies were adequately addressed. 
These strategies are: revisit ing strategic business plans and objectives, 
establishing performance areas, defining performance expectation, and 
defining performance measures. However, though the majority of 
respondents felt that performance measures were adequately addressed, 
a large number of respondents did not agree (Tshukudu 2006, p.174).  
 
The results indicated that strategies five, (facilitate performance), six 
(monitor performance), seven (appraising performance), eight (providing 
feedback), nine (improve performance) and ten (r ecognise and reward 
performance) were not adequately applied in the Botswana public service. 
It is indicated that the assumption could be made that in general, 
employees knew what they had to do, but that the individual management 
of performance was lacking. It could be concluded these areas needed 
attention (Tshukudu 2006, p.174).  
 
In terms of critical organisational factors for effective performance 
management, responses to culture, leadership and alignment of individual, 
team, and organisational goals w ere more positive than negative. 
However, the respondents were not positive enough to convince one that 
the organisation did in fact have a culture of performance and leadership 
that encouraged performance, or that individual, team and organisational
<<<PAGE=84>>>
- 62 -  
goals were aligned. Respondents indicated that they did not believe that 
their ministries and departments were learning organisations. In the 
literature review, it was revealed that perhaps factors that could guarantee 
future effective organisational performanc e management is the one that 
takes into consideration strategies and critical organisational factors 
(Tshukudu 2006, p.175). 
 
2.3.4.4 Recommendations to managers and supervisors 
 
On the basis of the analysis of the data obtained in the empirical study  
conducted by Tshukudu (2006, p.178) the following recommendations 
regarding the effective implementation of performance management in the 
Botswana public service are made:  
 
Firstly, managers and supervisors should continuously appraise employee 
performance as  indicated in the literature review. Managers and 
supervisors should give their employees direction for future performance, 
based on the results of their performance appraisal.  Employees want to 
know what direction they should take to improve; therefore t he results of 
appraisal influence decisions about strategic organisational goals. 
 
Secondly, managers and supervisors should facilitate employee 
performance.  It is critical for managers and supervisors to assist 
employees with the necessary resources as a way of facilitating employee 
performance. This also implies an open relationship between managers 
and employees so that managers can become aware of the problems 
employees experience.  
 
Thirdly, managers and supervisors should monitor employee performance  
to ensure the effective implementation of performance management. If 
performance is not monitored, it would be difficult for managers to
<<<PAGE=85>>>
- 63 -  
determine the success of performance management initiatives. 
Performance appraisal should be based on clearly defined goals and 
clearly defined performance measures.   
 
Fourthly, monitoring of performance leads to providing employees with 
performance feedback. Managers and supervisors should provide 
employees with immediate performance feedback. 
Fifthly, it is the respons ibility of managers/supervisors to improve 
employee performance through facilitation, appraising performance and 
providing performance feedback to their employees. 
 
Finally, performance rewards should be implemented to act as a strong 
motivator. The Botswana public service should ensure that budgetary 
provision is made for rewards.  If money is to act as a strong motivator, 
then employees must believe that the reward is real and that better 
performance will be followed by monetary and other rewards. The 
research revealed that many types of rewards other than monetary 
rewards could be used to improve performance (Tshukudu 2006, p.178).  
 
2.3.4.5 Recommendations to human resources management 
 
Tshukudu (2006, p.178) maintains that  for a performance management 
system to be effective, human resources managers should take 
cognisance of the following recommendations. 
 
Firstly, for any performance management system to be successful, it 
should be well-developed and implemented in an organisation. 
 
Secondly, managers s hould be well trained in the pursuit of performance 
management and the implementation thereof.  Performance management
<<<PAGE=86>>>
- 64 -  
should not be done in a mechanistic manner, but should be understood as 
an essential, tool in achieving the vision and mission of the organisation.  
Thirdly, performance management does not take place in a vacuum.  It is 
therefore essential that the organisational culture be analysed to see in 
which aspects it fosters or hinders effective performance.  The 
organisational culture should be c rafted and re- inforced to create a high 
performance environment. Specific attention should be given to 
leadership, learning and the alignment of individual, team and 
organisational goals.  
 
Performance management is aimed at obtaining better results from 
individuals, teams and the organisation by understanding and managing 
performance within the agreed framework of planned goals, standards and 
competencies. However, there are other critical oganisational factors that 
have to be taken into consideration for performance management to be 
effective. These are to create a performance culture, develop performance 
leadership, create a learning organisation and align individuals, teams and 
organisation’s goals with the strategic overall organisational goals.  
  
Performance management strategies can be used to improve 
performance, provide feedback, and increase motivation, identify potential, 
to let individuals know what is expected of them, to focus on employee 
development and to recognise and reward good performance . Tshukudu 
(2006, p.179) emphasises that the Botswana pubic service reshapes itself 
to cope with the turbulent competitive conditions of doing business 
(service delivery) by becoming leaner, fitter, and losing its belly. Many of 
the formal techniques of hu man resources management strategies need 
to be changed or adapted to motivate and develop people appropriately.
<<<PAGE=87>>>
- 65 -  
Tshukudu (2006, p.180) notes that performance management systems 
should be built on the premise that the vast majority of people come to 
work to do their best for themselves and for the organisation.  
Management’s role is to support them, help them understand what their 
best has to be, and how they can develop themselves as individuals.  
 
Performance management strategies used in isolation canno t improve 
performance or productivity. However, once deficiencies or inadequacies 
are identified and rectified within the current performance management 
strategies, then the effective implementation of performance management 
can take place (Tshukudu 2006, p.180). 
 
It can therefore be concluded that in  the nine years since its inception, 
Botswana performance management has not enhanced public service 
performance. The reasons for this may be attributed to many factors which 
include amongst others senior manag ers’ commitment to the initiatives 
and their ability to spearhead the endeavour. Organisational cultures also 
have to be conducive for change to occur because employees’ beliefs and 
values are embedded in the very culture. Unless culture is accommodative 
of initiatives such as performance improvement strategies it would be 
difficult for such initiatives to be successful. There is much room for 
improvement of the performance management system used in the 
Botswana public service and the internal organisational environment 
should be shaped in such a way that it emphasizes high performance. 
Shortly after the introduction of PMS, the government embarked on a 
performance-based reward system with a view to reward good performers.
<<<PAGE=88>>>
- 66 -  
2.3.5         Performance-based reward system 
 
It is the policy of the government of Botswana to continuously improve the 
effectiveness of its organisations and people so as to realise the National 
Development Plans and National Vision. The intention of the policy 
framework is to provi de an objective approach for improving and 
rewarding employee performance in a manner that will facilitate the 
improvement of the organisational overall performance. To that end, the 
performance based reward s ystem provides a process that allows a 
linkage between the Performance Management System and individual 
accountability through the development of performance objectives and 
employee performance reviews in a manner that will encourage 
continuous improvement (DPSM 2001, p.74). 
 
In this section, PBRS will be discussed, more specifically its objectives at 
individual, supervisor and organisational levels. Also the discussion will 
cover the evaluation outcome of the initiative. 
 
2.3.5.1 Performance-based reward system objectives for 
employee 
 
Employee performance remains one of the critical factors in determining 
the competitiveness of the company. It is therefore apparent , that 
employees’ performance should be rewarded in order to create a positive 
behavioural pattern amongst employees. Creating performance c ulture by 
rewarding good performance remains the most highly recommended 
performance management strategy in the modern human resources 
management. The objectives of the performance- based reward s ystem 
include amongst others the following: 
 
 Rewards that reflect performance results (non-monetary);
<<<PAGE=89>>>
- 67 -  
 Career support and guidance;  
 Clarity of work expectations; 
 Coaching to solve work problems and develop talents; 
 Support for new ideas; 
 Empowered to make work and training decisions with the 
supervisor; 
 Opportunities to improve the work environment; and  
 Honest and objective performance feedback (DPSM 2004, p.56). 
 
 
2.3.5.2 Performance-based reward system o bjectives for the 
supervisor 
 
Supervisors are individual employees and form  the lower management 
level in the or ganisational structure. Being part of management, 
supervisors are faced with the responsibility of motivating their 
subordinates and most importantly , to mentor their subordinates in the 
workplace. It is therefore important for supervisors to reward their 
subordinates for a job well done. Performance objectives for supervisors 
include the following: 
  
 Opportunity to motivate employees; 
 Better utilisation of scarce resources; 
 Opportunity to promote the vision of the organisation    
 Opportunity to build capacity; 
 Increased employee accountability; 
 Clear supervisory responsibilities and accountabilities; 
 Opportunity for team building; and 
 Providing for employee retention (DPSM 2005, p.78).
<<<PAGE=90>>>
- 68 -  
2.3.5.3 Performance- based reward system objectives for the 
organisation 
 
Organisations stand to benefit from rewarding their employees. When 
individual employees are rewarded according their performance standards 
they take ownership of their work and become motivated in performing to 
their optimal level. This: 
 
 Enhances the accountability framework and improves alignment of 
objectives; 
 Provides meaningful performance-based reports;  
 Enhances communication channels;      
 Provides for the effective allocation of resources; 
 Provides for the efficient delivery of services; and  
 Establishes a performance-improvement mindset. 
 
2.3.5.4 The evaluation of a performance-based reward system  
 
Even though there is little literature on the PBRS, and that the strategy 
has not been formally evaluated since its adoption in the Botswana public  
service, it was clear during a Public Convention held on the 29th to 31st 
August 2005 that the majority of ministries and departments were faced 
with difficulties in implementing the PBRS. 
 
The majority of presenters at the convention highlighted the fact  that the 
PBRS was adopted and implemented by the government prematurely. 
The presenters' arguments were premised on the fact that hardly two 
years after the adoption of the Performance Management System, the 
government immediately launched its PBRS. As in dicated under section 
(2.6.4), the PMS was not without problems. The majority of the problems 
highlighted related to the implementation of the PBRS in the public service
<<<PAGE=91>>>
- 69 -  
and that even to date some of these problems are prevalent. These 
include amongst ot hers; a lack of interest by middle management, an 
unco-ordinated implementation process and lack of interest by permanent 
secretaries in ensuring that their ministries and departments fully complied 
with the government's Vision 2016 which strives for "A pros perous, 
productive and innovative nation" by the year 2016.  Various presenters 
reiterated that, as regards the viability of implementing PBRS, the bottom 
line is that many of their subordinates are still struggling with implementing 
performance management , particularly at lower levels of their respective 
ministries and departments. It was resolved at this convention that the 
government should revisit the implementation of PBRS, with the majority 
recommending that the process be postponed indefinitely until PMS is fully 
implemented and evaluated. They argued that the current setup is 
confusing and a lack of credibility on the part of government has been a 
major contributing factor thus far (DPSM 2004, p.34). 
 
Responding to queries raised by the ministries an d d epartment 
representatives at the convention. The Minister for Presidential Affairs and 
Public Administration Mr Phandu Skelemani, agreed fully with the 
concerns raised during the convention. He noted that, it was important for 
government to tirelessly l iaise with all stakeholders prior to the 
implementation of such strategies as PBRS. The Minister however added 
that poor service delivery in the public service sector has been a major 
concern and that some of the government's decisions on adopting and 
implementation of reform measures were premature,  due to the rampant 
corruption and underperformance of public servants (DPSM 2004, p.35).  
 
From the above discussion, it is clear that the performance- based reward 
system has not yielded the expected results. T his can be attributed to the 
failure on the part of government to plan and most importantly the 
indigenisation of foreign interventions such as PBRS. There is a tendency
<<<PAGE=92>>>
- 70 -  
for government to adopt and implement policies and strategies as they 
think without pr oper investigation as to whether such policies will be 
applicable to the Botswana context. It is evident that the PBRS in its 
current state cannot enhance or even improve public service performance. 
In the next section, the decentralisation process will be discussed 
highlighting how the process impacts on service delivery and challenges, 
and its evaluation and recommendations. 
 
 
2.3.6 Decentralisation in the Botswana public service 
 
In this section decentralisation in general terms will be discussed and the  
focus will be narrowed to how decentralisation has improved public 
service delivery in the public service sector.  The evaluation of the process 
will be highlighted and closing remarks will be made. 
 
2.3.6.1 Background 
 
According to Cheema and Rondenelli ( 1983, p.137), decentralisation is 
the transfer or delegation of the legal and political authority to plan, make 
decisions and manage public functions from the central government and 
its agencies to field organisation of those agencies, subordinate units of  
government, semi -autonomous public corporations or regional 
development authorities, autonomous local governments, or non-  
governmental organisations.  
 
A system of democratic decentralisaion has to be so organised that the 
relations between central and l ocal government reflect a balance between 
centralisation and decentralisation of authority and functions. Cheema and 
Rondella (1983, p.139) note that while the central government has to 
delegate some of its authority, and encourage autonomy of local
<<<PAGE=93>>>
- 71 -  
authorities, it has to continue to retain some responsibilities relating to 
control, direction, supervision and guidance , particularly during the infant 
stage of development of local authorities.  
 
Central government has to retain the function which local government may 
not be able to undertake due to the magnitude of resources or expertise 
required. It may have to provide the local government with financial and 
manpower resources and technical assistance of different kinds without 
which these bodies may not be able to perform their functions. It may have 
to direct these bodies on the nationally defined priorities for the utilisation 
of scarce resources. Some central controls may be required for 
maintaining nationally a ccepted standards of performance and integrit y 
and for  the sound management of finances. Over and above all, central 
controls have a role in developing administrative capacities of local 
institutions through various measures which could include training, 
manpower development and gradually increasing autonomy (Cheema & 
Rondenelli 1983, p.138). 
 
Democracy, decentralisation, public participation and accountability have 
been considered to be objectives of good governance in Botswana. 
Decetralisation is a key factor in realising the Botswana national princ iples 
of self -reliance, unity, development and democracy, which have guided 
the country’s social, economic and political development since 
independence in 1966. In 1997, Botswana adopted a Long Term Vision for 
Botswana (Vision 2016) with the theme "Towards  Prosperity for all". The 
vision 2016 ideals include "building an open, democratic and accountable 
nation". Decentralisation may contribute significantly to attaining this ideal. 
Efforts to strengthen democracy and good governance in the country have 
to be  complemented by invigorating the institutions as well as the 
decentralisation process (BIDPA Report 2003, p.8).
<<<PAGE=94>>>
- 72 -  
Mogalakwe (2004, p.56) states that the role of government is to serve as 
an instrument of democratic decentralisation, development and good 
governance. He adds that throughout Africa, moves are being made to 
give more power to the people at grass roots level. The government 
decentralises for its geographical, social, political, economic and 
administrative advantages and creates organisations of local government 
and administration. Mogalakwe (2004, p.56) points out that certain 
geographical features such as the size and underdeveloped 
communication and infrastructure facilities in the country create the need 
for decentralisation.  
 
Decentralisaion could also  facilitate the administration of societies with 
cultural and social heterogeneity and it could promote national unity by 
accommodating the demand from diverse groups for political participation 
and limited self -government. Mogalakwe (2004, p.60) observes that by 
resorting to decentralisation, the national development plan could come 
closer to the felt needs, problems and priorities of the people. 
Administrative decentralisation could reduce the concentration of authority 
in the central government, promote decongestion of activities from the 
centre to the periphery. It could relieve the central government 
bureaucracy of involvement in purely local issues, check excessive and 
straight-jacketed central directives, reduce delays, and introduce speed in 
decision making. 
 
 
2.3.6.2 Botswana's accomplishment and progress towards 
decentralised governance 
 
Botswana established a democratic political framework after 
independence and developed local government structures below the 
central government level. A  number of features stand out in Botswana's
<<<PAGE=95>>>
- 73 -  
experience with decentralisaion. The country has run its administration 
under a democratic political framework since independence. Although 
Botswana has produced a holistic, overarching, cross -sectoral 
decentralisation policy statement, several initiatives have been undertaken 
by the government to decentralise functions and authority. The 
government has also established the enabling conditions (policies and 
practices) from 1964 onward that promote decentralisation. In 1964, two 
years prior to independence, a government white paper expressed the 
government's commitment to decentralisation through the elected rural 
urban councils. Various presidential commissions such as O & M review; 
consultancy reports and interministerial committees have examined the 
question of decentralisation and recommended reforms. As a result the 
government has undertaken decentralisation of administration, personnel 
and finances for both local government and within the central government 
itself. 
 
2.3.6.3 Administrative decentralisation to district administration 
 
The office of the District Commissioner has operated as a representative 
of central government in the district from the pre- independence days. It 
was strengthened with additional and primary responsibility for the co -
ordination of rural development and decentralised district level 
development planning. In addition to the above organisations of 
administrative decentralisation, the country has established a 
development planning machiner y at district level and six development 
plans have been formulated so far against nine national development 
plans. Procedures for the formulation, implementation and monitoring of 
district plans are in  place and are being constantly improved.
<<<PAGE=96>>>
- 74 -  
2.3.6.4 Challenges in promoting decentralisation 
 
In spite of the above positive attributes, the country faces difficult 
constraints and challenges in enhancing the effectiveness of 
decentralisation in the institutions of local government. These constraints 
and challenges relate to the limitations of human and financial resources, 
public participation and central -local government co -ordination in 
development planning and management. 
  
Shortage of qualified staff is a major constraint on local government. 
There is wi despread concern about the continuing shortage of qualified 
staff in district and local level organisations and the quality of training 
available to them. The government a sumes the responsibility for human 
resources development in the country and efforts have been made by 
strengthening educational and training programmes . There has been a 
large expansion in the capacity of primary, secondary and tertiary 
institutions. Pre -service and in- service training programmes  have been 
introduced and/or strengthened. M ore concentrated efforts are however 
needed for human resources development in district and local government 
level organisations.  
 
Mogalakwe (2004, p.47) notes that besides the need for strengthening 
education and training, local authorities require a per sonnel management 
system and service conditions that can attract, retain and motivate staff of 
good calibre. Local authorities continue to lose qualified staff to 
competitors in the labour market. Innovative measures could help in 
retaining deserving staff  and in keeping them motivated. Mogalakwe 
further adds that the decentralisation of the human resources function has 
been problematic, especially when it comes to council employees. People 
are unwilling to work in rural areas and councils lack attractive benefits to 
lure them to be transferred to rural areas. More specifically, people with
<<<PAGE=97>>>
- 75 -  
skills are attracted to work for the private sector in urban areas. The 
shortage of qualified and skilled staff thus accounts for poor service 
delivery by the councils.   
 
In some districts, especially in the central, where there has been 
considerable decentralisation to the sub- districts, decentralisation of 
responsibilities was not matched with the provision of necessary staff and 
capacities. Skilled personnel were retai ned at the centre, leaving the sub-
districts with inexperienced and poorly qualified staff, and yet that is where 
services are provided. The headquarters retains most of the skilled and 
yet there is minimal actual work (Mogalakwe 2004, p.123). 
  
The introduction of the Performance Management System (PMS) is one of 
the major decentralisation initiatives introduced by the government. District 
officers had little to say about the PMS, which is only now (2006) being 
introduced to local authority councils, altho ugh the PMS was initiated in 
1997 in the central government. There are no substantive comments from 
districts on whether it had an impact on councils' service delivery. But one 
of the views held by lower and middle managers in the local government 
are that the performance  management system is impractical, given that 
it aimed at changing work practices but not the officials' attitudes. Negative 
work attitudes were at the root of inefficiency and ineffectiveness (DPSM 
1998, p. 92).  
 
The work environment is also such that planning may be done, but 
implementation tends to be problematic because of constant diversions 
and 'emergencies" that officials had to attend to. Other key informant 
views are that even though the PMS is supposed to encourage 
decentralisation, it is not backed by the decentralisation of decision 
making to lower and middle management levels (e.g. in career 
progression and performance rewarding of subordinates). The central
<<<PAGE=98>>>
- 76 -  
government still exercises considerable control over human resource 
functions and rewarding systems and by so doing defeats the goals of the 
PMS.   
 
Against the backdrop of the continued decline in performance of the local 
government, the government assigned the Botswana Institute for 
Development Policy Analysis (BIDPA) to assess the decentralisation of 
performance improvement initiatives at local government level. The 
Botswana Institute for Development Policy Analysis (BIDPA) was 
commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme  (UNDP) to 
undertake a review of the dec entralisation initiatives in Botswana (Project 
BOT/02/M03/A/MX). This report deals with component number four of the 
project, which is the assessment of the impact of the decentralisation 
initiatives on the intended beneficiaries. As the decentralized 
organisations are at the forefront of the implementation of decentralisation 
initiatives, the major thrust  of the research was to assess the 
effectiveness of these organisations in service provision (BIDPA Report 4 
2003, p.5).  
  
 2.3.6.5 Evaluation of the decentralisation in Botswana 
 
The report based on a questionnaire that was randomly administered to 
about a thousand people across the country, also draws on key informant 
interviews of public officers at district and central government levels. The 
aim of the questionnaire was to determine the people’s perceptions of the 
effectiveness of government’s decentralisation initiatives, through local 
authority provision of services. The key informant interviews were 
designed to seek perceptions and views about servi ce provision, from 
officers that are involved in the provision of services in the rural areas.
<<<PAGE=99>>>
- 77 -  
This project thus aimed at examining the effects of decentralisation 
service provision on the intended beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are 
ordinary people or members of the communities whose perceptions on the 
effectiveness of the government’s decentralisation initiatives  were sought. 
The intention was to determine the respondents’ perceptions of whether 
any improvement to their wellbeing could be attributed t o decentralisation, 
especially in regard to access to service, and their efficient and effective 
provision. The next section summarises the responses of the key 
informants to questions regarding the objectives, design and strategy of 
decentralisation; impl ementation of decentralisation initiatives; the 
effectiveness of decentralised service provision and the future direction of 
decentralisation in Botswana (DPSM 2004, p.89). 
 
The objectives and the strategies for achieving decentralisation are not 
clearly d efined or specified. Despite an enabling democratic political 
tradition, and several decentralisation initiatives, Botswana does not have 
a holistic, overarching, cross -sectoral decentralisation policy statement. It 
is unclear what decentralisation is supposed to achieve, its direction, 
targets and goals. Hence the decentralisation process appears to ad hoc, 
unintegrated and unco-ordinated. 
 
Decentralisation by the central government to lower levels appears 
illusive. Some of the functions that are ostensibly decentralised to the local 
authorities are actually not, or are only partially so. These include financial 
management, human resources management, and management of 
information technology services. 
 
Views on the attainment and effectiveness of the decent ralisation process 
are doubtful even though the process is regarded as important for 
improving productivity, efficiency and the effectiveness of service delivery 
at local government level.
<<<PAGE=100>>>
- 78 -  
 
The reasons for this low attainment of decentralisation objectives  differ 
significantly between district and central officers. Whereas the district 
officers emphasised that major constraints were centralised control and 
inadequate local resources and authority, central government respondents 
laid the blame on decentralis ation organisations’ capacity constraints and 
negative attitudes. 
 
To most district level officers, the lack of localised revenue collection (and 
utilisation) in the council areas of jurisdiction appears to be the stumbling 
block towards an effective decentralisation process. 
 
From the above discussion, it may be concluded that there is a general 
perception that for the benefits of decentralisation to be fully  realised, the 
implementation process must be optimal. The objectives, and the strategy 
for implem entation, must be clear. Also, the human and material 
resources must be available at local level. Importantly, managerial and 
technical capacity must be built for decentralisation. In addition, there 
must be regulatory mechanisms and safeguards against possible abuse of 
the system.  
 
 
2.3.7 Training and development in the Botswana public service 
 
Training and development is used by many organisations to enhance the 
performance of their employees. The availability of training and 
development opportunities is  a motivating factor for employees in the 
organisation. Most importantly the objective of training and development in 
the public service context is aimed at improving products and the service 
delivery to the citizens. Since independence the Botswana government 
has committed financial resources (billions of pula) on public service
<<<PAGE=101>>>
- 79 -  
training and development with a view to improving the overall efficiency 
and effectiveness of the public service at large. The need for training and 
development has been precipitat ed by technological developments and 
organisational changes and the realization that success relies on the skills 
and abilities of the employees. However, this performance improvement 
initiative has not yielded results for the following reasons; lack of tr aining 
and development policy and non- evaluation of training initiatives 
(Somolekae 2005, 164).  
 
2.3.7.1 An overview of training and development in the 
Botswana public service 
 
The current situation concerning training and development in the 
Botswana publ ic service was covered under section (section 1.2) of the 
research. However, it is important to highlight the current state of affairs in 
Botswana public service’s training and development. It is therefore,  
meaningful to further explore reasons for training and development to 
enhance service delivery in the public service sector. Different scholars 
and stakeholders are concerned by lack of training evaluation and the 
justification thereof. Kgarebe (2004, p.16), Somolekae (2005, p.112) 
Raditlhokwa (2007, p.22) and Mogalakwe (2004, p.78) reiterate that there 
is a need for the Department of Public Service Management to account for 
training and development in the Botswana public service. The authors 
lament that in -service training should be well co -ordinated and evaluated 
by DPSM a s the custodian of training in the public service for both local 
and external training.  
 
Non- Governmental Organisations which provides financial assistance to 
candidates from the public service have been calling for the formulation of  
a training policy by the Botswana public service as guidelines for the 
management of training in the country.
<<<PAGE=102>>>
- 80 -  
2.3.7.2 Training  policy 
 
Government policies are guidelines that are intended to give the public 
service direction when implementing various strategies,  procedures and 
programmes. Having no policy is not only tragic but also detrimental to 
good governance and accountability. As indicated earlier, the government 
of Botswana has invested resources in training and development. It is 
therefore ironical that s ince independence, the Botswana public service 
has not formulated training and development policies when this very 
government is continuing to train and develop employees locally and 
internationally (Mpabanga 1998, p.94).  
 
Mpabanga (1998, p.99) explains t hat the importance of a training and 
development policy has been to state government intentions on, and 
provide guidelines for, the efficient and effective training and utilisation of 
human resources in order to achieve optimum individual and 
organisational performance in the public service.     
 
The objectives of government in pursuing training and development for the 
public service personnel are defined in the civil service legislation act or in 
specific regulations or in a training policy; in some cases the objectives 
are fixed in the constitution. Though these objectives differ from country to 
country in content and correctness, one common goal of public service 
training can be observed throughout, and that is to support the 
implementation of administrat ive reform and modernization. Other 
operational objectives that are specific objectives of training and 
development policy are: 
 
 Ensure that training is relevant, systematic, co- ordinated and, most 
importantly, evaluated in order to meet the needs of the public 
service;
<<<PAGE=103>>>
- 81 -  
 Increase efficiency in executing the tasks to reduce costs; 
 Improve staff motivation; 
 Improve human resources management (equal treatment of men 
and women, etc.); 
 Improve the relationship between the public service and the user 
and improving the services provided to the public; 
 Support staff development; 
 Ensure the efficient and effective utilisation of trained personnel in 
the public service; and  
 Ensure that there is transparency in the selection process (DPSM 
2005, p. 89). 
 
The importance  of a training and development policy is that  the policy 
should not only reflect the procedure and guidelines but should explicitly 
indicate how training and development should be evaluated, and the 
techniques for such evaluation must be clearly stated. As  stated earlier , 
the main objective of training and development is to enhance public 
service and the overall organisational performance. 
 
Chepkilot (2005, p.345) adds that training and development are powerful 
tools for the development of employees in an organisation. Probably the 
most effective type of training  in preparing employees to take increasing 
levels of responsibility, will take place  in a planned on- the-job programme 
in which areas of responsibility for specific tasks are handed over. In this 
way the public service can ensure training for succession takes place over 
a period of time. Unfortunately due to lack of any training policy, very little 
pressure is put on managers or supervisors to ensure that they 
concentrate on the training and development of subordinates. Many public 
service training managers do not have the skills to provide on- the-job 
training or its evaluation.

2.4 FUTURE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROGRAMMES 
 
The Botswana government continuously seeks to better performance 
improvement strategies to enhance service delivery in the public service 
sector. Future reforms will focus on the delivery of core government 
service and move away from commercial activities that can be performed 
more efficiently and effectively by the private sector. The  government 
recognises that the private sector provides the basis for long -term, 
sustainable economic growth (Raditlhokwa 2006, p.90). The government 
therefore, intends to accelerate the public service reduction programme . 
These include amongst others reducing the public service through 
retrenchment of public service sector employees, particularly those who 
have reached retirement age. The government also intends to introduce 
performance contracts for top managers in the public service as a means 
of closely  monitoring its senior public service employees; and lastly the 
introduction of Total Quality Management (Raditlhokwa 2006, p.99). 
 
2.4.1 Downsising of the public service 
 
Much has been said and done in an endeavour to address Botswana’s 
public service del ivery paralysis. Firstly, the Botswana National 
Productivity Centre was established in 1993. A plethora of productivity 
enhancement initiatives have been introduced in the public service. These 
include privatisation, WITS, PMS, PBRS, and decentralisation. These 
performance improvement initiatives have not yielded any results to meet 
the expectations of many Batswana and other stakeholders.  
 
Public service delivery remains the one of the biggest challenges that 
government has had to deal with in recent times. In his budget speech for 
the financial year 2007/2008, the Minister of Finance and Development 
Planning, Mr Balidze Gaolathe informed the nation that his government is
<<<PAGE=105>>>
- 83 -  
committed to revitalising service delivery and productivity improvement in 
the Botswana public service. He further observed that for the past decade, 
the government has adopted various strategies to deal with the low levels 
of productivity in the public service. The Minister stated that it is about time 
the public service sector was reduced to make it leaner and more efficient. 
He further noted that it is important to harmonise pay and benefits and put 
in place interventions to enhance the efficiency of the public service. 
Gaolatlhe (2007, p.46) further observed that the government is currently in 
a difficult situation because on the one hand, the salaries of the public 
sector employees are low and on the other the wage bill is high. He 
however, indicated that his government is committed to accelerating the 
public service reforms to create a leaner, efficient, motivated and 
productive public service.  
 
For the umpteenth time, the BEAC report observed that the Botswana civil 
service is too fat and drastic measures need to be taken to keep it lean. It 
is still not fit and mentally ready to self -transform. Raditlhokwa (2007, 
p.35) explains that Botswana is far from achieving satisfactory levels of 
improved service delivery. Raditlhokwa (2007, p.35) asserts that reasons 
for the public service’s failure are that the professionals tasked with the 
mandate to change in public service transformation lack any clear focus, a 
sense of urgency, and sufficient authority to actualise their mandate. 
Secondly, these professionals lack the capacity to adapt foreign ideas to 
the local context.  Raditlhokwa attributes poor performance to socialization 
at family level. Raditlhokwa (2007, p.35) believes that unless a massive 
cultural revolution, even with plenteous resources, is implemented, public 
service performance will remain a nightmare.
<<<PAGE=106>>>
- 84 -  
2.4.2 Introduction of performance contracts for senior managers 
 
The number one problem thwarting progress in Botswana is the failure of 
leadership. There are no outstanding credible managers who are capable 
of inspiring the nation to surpass itself (Raditlhokwa 2007, p.56).  
Raditlhokwa laments that managers are not sufficiently developed to 
understand and produce the requisite conditions of change, transformation 
and superior development. Many of these managers are self -serving and 
are therefore, not fully committed to serving the country and its people.  
As previously stated, the continued decline in public service has been a 
major concern to the government and civil society. There are observations 
that the need for managers to take their rightful place in improving service 
delivery in the public service sector is long overdue. The decline in 
productivity levels forced the government to introduce performance 
contracts for senior and middle management to account for both their 
individual performance and that of their employees . Accountability on the 
part of managers has been lacking in recent times and the government 
has acknowledged the importance of rigorously dealing with the 
underperforming senior and middle public service managers (DPSM 2005, 
p.11).  
 
2.4.3 Introduction of Total Quality Management  
 
The search for sustained competitive advantage in the public service has 
focused to a large degree on product and quality service delivery. More 
recently in the developing countries, Total Quality Management (TQM) 
has become a f ocus in manufacturing and service industries including 
public service sector product and service delivery. The drive for quality 
improvement has become a nationally recognised goal (Lejuta 2007, 
p.22). Total Quality Management focuses on quality and continuous 
improvement which are essential elements for productivity and an integral
<<<PAGE=107>>>
- 85 -  
part of the organisational strategy. One of the recommendations made by 
BEAC to the government is the introduction of TQM as a quality 
improvement strategy. The commission notes  that it is important for the 
government to review the quality of products and services rendered for 
Botswana to compete both regionally and globally. It is on the basis of the 
quality improvement that the government of Botswana has resolved to 
introduce T QM as a quality improvement strategy in the public service 
sector.  
 
2.5 CONCLUSION 
 
The government is concerned about enhancing performance both at 
central and local government. The continuous decline in productivity levels 
prompted the government to come up with strategies for improving service 
delivery in the public service sector. As part of its effort to increase 
productivity, the government established the Botswana National 
Productivity Centre (BNPC), which organises productivity improvement 
and manag ement programmes, conferences, and workshops for public 
servants from central and local government. Most of the observers have 
criticised the centre for failing to deliver on its main objectives particularly 
on behavioural changes of public service managers.  
 
Privatisation is one of the initiatives that the government has adopted with 
the view to enhance productivity in the public service. However, the 
initiative proves to be problematic even though the government was under 
no duress to adopt and implement  privatisation in Botswana. According to 
the recent report on evaluation of WITS, the initiative lacks have been 
unable to deliver the expected results on raising performance levels in 
departments and ministries across the public service sector and in 
parastatals. Even though  there is not much literature on the Botswana 
performance management system, there is evidence to indicate that much
<<<PAGE=108>>>
- 86 -  
has not been achieved through the process. Hence it has  become an 
expensive endeavour for government as regards both money and time.  
 
Many  see the PMS as an exotic exercise that does not fit into the 
Botswana public service work culture. Therefore, it has become an excuse 
for many to be away from their work stations to attend seminars and 
conferences on PMS. It is impos sible to reward unmanaged employee 
performance. If PMS has been a non- starter, it will be difficult to embrace 
the next initiative, which is a Performance-Based Reward System. 
Commentators are of the opinion that a Performance-Based Reward 
System has been prematurely introduced in the public service while most 
of the departments and ministry official s are still battling with the 
implementation of the former. 
 
The final initiative aimed at was decentralisation of authority to local 
government structure. This has been problematic, in that  there is a lack of 
qualified staff that are prepared to work in rural areas, and local 
government resource strategies have failed to cater for the attraction and 
retention of skilled personnel due to under-funding.  
 
The next  chapter will provide a comprehensive literature review on the 
subject of training and development. The concept of training and 
development, learning organisation and various theor etical models will be 
discussed. The strategies for  effective training and development in an 
organisation will be highlighted and discussed. This chapter will also focus 
on the relationship between training and performance management and 
performance appraisal.

CHAPTER 3 
 
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
In chapter two, the historical background of the public service and 
government reform programmes was discussed as well as the 
organisation in which the study was conducted. Different performance 
improvement initiatives (reforms) introduced by the Botswana government 
since independence in 1966 to improve productivity levels were also 
discussed. These include the Botswana National Productivity Centre, 
privatisation, Work Improvement Teams, the Performance Management 
System, a Performance-based reward system, and the decentralization of 
authority to local government. These were adequately covered in c hapter 
two. The main thrust of the discussion was premised on how these 
initiatives have improved service delivery in the public service sector to 
date.  
 
This chapter defines and discusses the concept of training, development 
and learning, the objectives of training, a systematic approach to training 
and development, critical organisational factors such as culture, 
leadership and performance manageme nt and performance appraisal as 
part of the training process. This chapter will also cover a discussion on 
various theoretical training models which scholars and training managers 
have formulated to explain their understanding of the concepts of training 
and development. Most importantly , the chapter will conclude with a 
discussion on the implementation and management of a learning 
organisation.
<<<PAGE=110>>>
- 88 -  
As training often occurs in a haphazard manner, thereby reducing its 
effectiveness of the activity, it is imper ative that any training undertaken 
should be well planned, structured and directed towards a real need. 
Provision must also be made to ensure that transferability of new skills 
into the work environment takes place. 
 
 Different authors define training and development differently and in the 
next section, definitions of training will be presented and a working 
definition for this research will be presented. 
 
 
3.2 DEFINING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT  
 
The skills challenges facing business include international c ompetition 
from companies that have highly skilled employees, the need to increase 
productivity, the need to improve performance and service quality, a skills 
shortage, the need for skilled employees, poor quality education and 
training, the need to develop affirmative action candidates and the need to 
increase diversity. Those companies that are able to meet the challenges 
well and become responsive will gain competitive advantages over those 
that struggle or fail to meet the challenges. For a company to m eet these 
challenges, skills development must be fully aligned to business strategies 
and objectives, as well as to employee performance levels. From the 
employee’s point of view, the only valid objectives of skills development 
are competencies and performance management.  
  
Schultz (1997, p.10) states that the training function is positioned in 
various ways in different organisations, although the responsibility for 
training management is almost always perceived as belonging to the 
human resources function and the growing devolution of responsibility to 
line management has resulted in perceptual changes, promoting the
<<<PAGE=111>>>
- 89 -  
conceptual format of the learning organisation.   
  
Folscher (2003, p.12) states that in the past, training has been demand-
led and most skil ls development has been conducted without the realistic 
assessment of how skills are employed. Often training achievement is 
measured by the number of days employees spend on training and the 
amount of money the company spends on training and development. 
Training departments/functions were more concerned with their activities 
than the value they are adding to the company, or the impact they made in 
their organisations.   
  
Folscher (2003, p.12) further explains that departments were trapped in 
the so -called 'activity trap', and neither training managers nor training 
providers were held accountable for training and development outcomes. 
The focus must now shift to the skills and competencies required to 
support productivity, international competitiveness, the mobility of workers, 
self-employment and meeting the desired and articulated community 
needs.  Schultz (1997, p.20) concurs with Folscher (2003, p.12) by stating 
that organisations are challenged to develop, maintain, update and fully 
apply skills in order to survive. Schultz (1997, p.20) maintains that, instead 
of being concerned with only the skills level of employees, the application 
of skills and the management of performance have become more 
important in the work environment.  
 
Measuring the impact r ather than the activities of a training department 
means that there is a need to transform organisational approaches 
towards performance improvement both at individual, team and 
organisational levels. Shultz (1997, p.21)  further notes that training 
expenditure should be viewed as investments improve productivity, rather 
than as expenses or costs of doing business. For the training function to 
be accepted as a strategic organisational investment it is essential that the
<<<PAGE=112>>>
- 90 -  
return on investment is worthwhile. Sc hultz (1997, p.23) advocates the 
use of improved training and development strategies so that the value, in 
monetary terms, of training to the organisation is increased.   
 
3.2.1 Definitions of training, learning, education, and development  
 
Before examining how training is initiated and then organised, it is useful 
to define training and to distinguish it from the closely related concepts of 
learning, education and development. Drawing from a number of sources, 
the following definitions will be used as working definitions in this study. 
 
3.2.1.1 Training   
 
Burcley and Caple (2000, p.1) define training as a systematic effort to 
modify or develop knowledge, skills, abilities, and attitudes through the 
learning experience, to achieve effective performance in an activity or 
range of acti vities. Goldstein and Ford (2001 , p.1) add that training is the 
systematic acquisition of skills, rules, concepts, or attitudes that result in 
an improved performance.   
 
Armstrong (2003, p.527) concurs with other authors in def ining training as 
a planned and systematic modification of behaviour through the learning 
event, programme and instruction which enable individuals to achieve the 
levels of knowledge, skill and competencies needed to carry out their work 
effectively. 
 
Sims (1993, p.2) summarises the above definitions by defining training as 
a systematic planned approach to teaching knowledge, skills, abilities, and 
attitudes, with certain features. Furthermore, training is a process of 
changing behaviour and motivation to i mprove the match between 
employee characteristics and the demands of a job. The process consists
<<<PAGE=113>>>
- 91 -  
of planned programmes  designed to improve competence and 
performance at the individual employee, group, and organisational levels. 
Improved competence and perf ormance, in turn, imply that there have 
been measurable changes in knowledge, skill, abilities, attitudes, 
behaviour. 
 
3.2.1.2 Learning 
 
Davis and Davis (1998, p.11) define learning as a process by which an 
individual, group and organisation obtains inform ation and use s new 
knowledge, tools, behaviours, and values. Individuals learn as part of their 
daily activities, particularly as they interact with each other and with the 
outside world. Groups learn as their members co -operate to accomplish 
common goals. The entire system learns as it obtains feedback from the 
environment and anticipates further changes. At all levels, newly learned 
knowledge is translated into new goals, procedures, expectations, role 
structures, and measurements of success. Davis and Davis (1998, p.12) 
and Armstrong (2003, p.526) add that learning is a relatively permanent 
change in behaviour that occurs as a result of practice or experience. 
 
3.2.1.3 Education 
 
Armstrong (2003, p.526) defines education as the development of the 
knowledge, values and understanding required in all aspects of life rather 
than the knowledge and skills relating to particular areas of activity. Mayo 
(2004, p.16) states that education involves reframing, refining or 
developing the mind and also can affect people's attitudes and values.
<<<PAGE=114>>>
- 92 -  
3.2.1.4 Development 
 
Managers and supervisors and the organisation at large are faced with the 
mammoth task of developing employees. Helping employees develop is 
the greatest contribution managers and supervisors can make to the 
wellbeing of their subordinates. Developing employees should be taken 
seriously as this leads to increased organisational productivity, efficiency, 
effectiveness and all-round job satisfaction.  
 
Armstrong (2003, p.526) and Marching ton and Wiki lnson (2000, p.158) 
define development as the growth or realisation of a person's ability and 
potential through the provision of learning and educational experiences. 
The authors view development as a broader term than learning, in terms 
of its complexity and elaboration, as well as its continuity, but nevertheless 
others see it as rooted in the individual. Many organisations are facing the 
challenge of developing greater confidence, initiative, solution- finding, and 
problem-solving capabilities among their people.  Organisations need staff 
at all levels to be more self -sufficient, resourceful, creative and 
autonomous. Employees' efforts produce better results and many 
organisations are striving to achieve improved performance through 
employees' contributions. This behaviour enables employees to operate at 
a higher strategic level, which results in increased organisational 
productivity and competitiveness. 
 
3.2.1.5 Training and development  
 
All managers and supervisors should provide training and development for 
their people. Training develops people, it improves performance, raises 
morale; training and developing people increases their health and 
organisational ability and raises the productivity levels of the organisation. 
Ethics and behaviour set the standard for people, which determines how
<<<PAGE=115>>>
- 93 -  
productively they will use their skills and knowledge. Training is nothing 
without the motivation to apply it effectively. A strong capability to plan and 
manage skills training, the acquisition of knowledge, and the development  
of motivation and right attitudes, largely determines how well people will 
perform in their jobs.   
 
3.3 OBJECTIVES OF TRAINING  
 
The objectives of training both in the public and private sector are aimed 
at addressing training needs of the individual employee, the team and 
those in the organisation (DPSA 2006, p.12). 
 
3.3.1  Definition of objective 
 
According to the Merriam Webster on- linedictionary, objective is 
“something toward which effort is directed or a strategic position to be 
attained or a purpose to be achieved by an individual, team or an 
organisational operation”. Armstrong  (2003, p. 550) notes that the 
objective of training and development in an organisation is to achieve its 
human resources strategies by ensuring that it has the skilled, 
knowledgeable and competent people required to meet its present and 
future needs.  
 
Shandler (1996, p.54), identifies three main objectives of training in 
organisations, namely: competition, rapidly changing business trends and 
improving both individual and organisational performance. 
 
3.3.2 Competition  
 
The main focus for training is seen as a key to achieving empowerment for 
individuals and in maintaining the focus on the customer in order to remain
<<<PAGE=116>>>
- 94 -  
competitive. Not only is training the epicent of empowerment with as much 
as 10% of employees’ time spent on it, but successful companies use 
training and development as a competitive strategy. Sloman (1999, p.9) 
emphasises that it is universally accepted that competition has become 
more intense. Two forces that have given rise to this growing intensity are 
an increasingly global economy underpinned by the 
information/telecommunications revolution. There is incontrovertible 
evidence that these forces have exerted a powerful influence on the 
competitive environment in which all large organisations operate. An 
important issue facing the training manager is to consider how the 
influence will be felt in the organisation (Sloman 1999, p.23). 
 
3.3.3 Rapidly changing business trends 
 
Sloman (1999, p.43) suggests that over and above the three main 
objectives, the specific training obj ectives include the following: t raining 
makes a significant and distinctive contribution to the development of an 
organisation’s competitive strategy, based on enhancing the skills and 
capabilities of employees, and giving individuals in the organsiations 
appropriate opportunities to develop their own capability both in the short 
and long term. Borders and boundaries have collapsed and the general 
effect of globalisation is well known and that less attention has been to the 
given dramatic collapse of traditional business boundaries. This 
phenomenon forced managers to change their management approach to 
adapt to new business trends (Sloman 1999, p.43). 
 
 
The objectives of governments , parastatals and private companies to 
pursue training and development for their employees are defined in the 
civil service legislation, civil service act or in specific regulations on 
training and development; in some cases the objectives of training and
<<<PAGE=117>>>
- 95 -  
development are fi xed in the constitution of the country (DPSA 2006, 
p.13).  
 
In the case of the private sector organisations, objectives are included in 
the company’s training policy or any training guidelines. Though these 
objectives may differ from country to country in content and correctness, 
one common goal of the public service sector training can be observed 
throughout, and that is to support the implementation of administrative 
reform and modernisation (Bakwena 2004, p.90).  
 
The government -wide objective of training is to develop government 
employees through the establishment and operation of progressive and 
efficient training programmes , thereby improving the public service, 
increasing efficiency and economy, building and retaining a work force of 
skilled and effic ient employees, and installing and using the best modern 
practices and techniques in the conduct of government business 
(www.doi.gov./hrm). Operational objectives of training and development 
include the following:  
 
 Adaptation of skills and qualifications to technological and other 
changes in the organisation to improve the performance of 
employees by helping them to adapt to changes in the work routine 
due to new technologies, new legislation, etc.; 
 Increasing efficiency in executing the tasks to reduce costs; 
 Promoting horizontal mobility by providing training to acquire the 
expertise necessary to fulfill a new task on the same hierarchical 
level to improve the flexibility and adaptability of employees; 
 Improve motivation; 
 Improve human resources managemen t (equal treatment for both 
men and women etc.; 
 Improving the relationship between the organisation and
<<<PAGE=118>>>
- 96 -  
customers;  
 Improving the quality of products and services delivered to 
customers; 
  Support staff development (career paths); and  
 Developing international co-operation (www.doi.gov/hrm). 
 
 
3.3.4  Improve individual and organisational performance 
 
Broad (2005, p.81) states that the main and important objective of training 
and development is to address performance de ficiencies both at 
individual, team and organisational level. She further notes that training 
and development consist s of structured learning experiences to help a 
learner gain new knowledge and skills to assist them do their job.  
Bakwena (2000, p.98) dif fers with Broad’s view that training improves 
performance. Bakwena (2000, p.98) argues that researchers have not 
been able to clearly demonstrate that indeed training and development 
improve individual and team performance , a sentiment held by many. 
Bakwena (2000, p.98) adds that it is not necessarily true that training and 
development improves performance.  
 
The assumption  that if they are not performing the way they should, 
training and development are the solution,  is no longer true (Broad 2005, 
p.82). T he question then is, if training and development were not 
improving performance, why then have organisations spent $ billions on 
training and development for many years. There must be a bit of the truth 
in that to some extent  training and development improves individual, team 
and organisational performance. The main question may -be would be,  to 
what extent training and development contributes to the effective and 
efficient operation in the organisation (Bakwena 2000, p.98).
<<<PAGE=119>>>
- 97 -  
After discussing the concept of the objectives of training, it is important to 
critically look at a systematic approach to training and development for the 
endeavour to be effective and achieve its primary objective. Organisations 
need to take into consideration the following critical organisational factors 
when planning, delivering and implementing training plans. 
 
 
3.4 CRITICAL ORGANISATIONAL SUCCESS  FACTORS 
 
Some of the organisational characteristics that distinguish an effective and 
efficient organisation from the rest include: establishing a training culture 
in the organisation, developing leadership that encourages learning in the 
organisation and lastly, an organisation which manages  its employees’ 
performance and appraises them accordingly. 
 
3.4.1 Creating  a training culture 
 
The training culture indicates to employees what behaviours are 
acceptable and what types of behaviour are not. As a result, establishing a 
culture that is supportive to the attainment of excellence in an organisation 
ensures improved performance. Important questions are therefore , what 
type of culture is most conducive to effective training and development 
and how such a culture can be established in the organisation.   
Johnston and McClelland (1994, p.30) note that the challenge now is to 
develop a market -driven training culture without losing reliability, and giving 
meticulous attention to detail, underpinned by sound ethical principles, which 
remain  essential to c ontinued and sustained success. There is a common 
agreement that training and development must be driven by the strategy of 
the organisation. Due to this scenario, trainers are now expected to define 
where the emphasis will be on organisational needs through individuals so as
<<<PAGE=120>>>
- 98 -  
to arrive at an organisation which strives for long -term learning, rather than 
short-term training. These learning demands are continuous and demand 
meaningful interaction between people and their work environment. An 
environment which  is both supportive and stimulating will lead to 
considerable learning, and, through this, to individual and organisational 
growth (Johnston & McClelland 1994, p.30).       
Training and development cannot be separated from the organisational 
culture as cul ture directs the behaviour of employees, creates greater 
commitment to organisational goals and objectives and serves as a yardstick 
to employees when they have to make decisions and sol ve problems 
(Kreitner & Kinicki 2001, p.75).  Hall & Meh (2004, p.1) suggest that culture is 
the key to organisational excellence and the creation and management of a 
performance culture.  
From the above, it can be concluded that organisational culture is the deep 
structure of the organisation which consists of the collectiv e values, beliefs 
and assumptions of organisational members.  Therefore, the management of 
training and development will be more effective in an organisation where 
training is embedded in the organisational culture.  
Kreitner and Kinicki (2001, p.75) ident ify three types of cultures, namely 
constructive, passive- defensive, and aggressive cultures. A constructive 
culture is one in which employees are encouraged to interact with others and 
to work on tasks and projects in a manner that will satisfy their needs for 
growth and development. This kind of culture is appropriate in a learning 
environment because it encourages interaction and effective communication 
between the trainer and the trainees. A constructive culture is more 
conducive to performance than an aggressive - defensive or passive-
defensive culture because in the constructive culture, the organisation values 
help members to set and accomplish their goals (Kreitner & Kinic ki 2001, 
p.77).
<<<PAGE=121>>>
- 99 -  
Wright (1994, p.117) provides the following characteristics for an ideal 
training culture: 
 A unifying philosophy and spirit emanating from the top;  
 The conscious cultivation of an internal guidance system by 
inculcating basic values and beliefs; 
 Intensive communication; 
 Encouragement of internal competition; 
 Allowance for mistakes; 
 The use of heroes or role models, rites and rituals; 
 Work will be meaningful through a general emphasis or orientation on 
caring and on people rather than the mechanistic side of 
management.    
 Stimulated to achieve superior results; 
 Inspired to communicate progress and results; and 
 Willingness to accept responsibility for results. 
Robbins ( 2003, p.528) states that culture influences employees’ behaviour. 
Culture reduces formalisation and creates a common understanding on how  
employees’ efforts are recognis ed and rewarded.  According to Robbins 
(2003, p.528), a person who receives a job offer, is appraised as a high 
performer and subsequently gets promoted, is strongly influenced by a 
positive individual-organisation fit. It means that the applicant’s or employee’s 
attitude and behaviour are compatible with the organsitional culture. Culture 
enhances organisation commitment and increases the consistency of 
employees’ behavior. Culture is valuable because it reduces ambiguity. It 
tells employees how things are done and what is important. 
Alu (2004, p.117) states that to establish a culture that supports training, 
organisations need to give careful attention to their vision and the values they 
endorse.  He further states that successful organisati ons have strong values 
and strong guiding visions that communicate appropriate behavior. These
<<<PAGE=122>>>
- 100 -  
values are shared across the organisation and they reflect in the everyday 
actions of employees, individually and collectively. Organisational culture and 
values are sources of competitive advantage for the organisation. Culture 
and values provide a link between the way people are managed and the 
overall performance of the organisation.  
 From the above discussion, it is clear that a training culture promotes   
development and growth in the organisation. The next section presents a 
discussion on the importance of effective leadership in a training 
environment.  
 
3.4.2 Developing organisational  leadership 
 
Friedman (2000, p.181) lists and describes the various characteri stics of a 
training leader and these include: 
 
 Managers are pragmatic visionaries seeing their work in the larger 
context of the training system as a whole; 
 Centrality of values reinforcing the core set of training department 
values; 
 Effective training man agers are master strategists and tacticians 
being able to ascertain how external forces will shape the 
organisation and as a consequence also being able to articulate a 
realistic path for the future; 
 The essence of organisational training and development i s the 
skillful devolution of power developing the leadership capabilities of 
subordinates; 
 Effective training managers are stewards of learning and will 
continuously encourage others to learn;   
 Training managers are learners themselves despite their capability 
to direct and strategise; and
<<<PAGE=123>>>
- 101 -  
 Effective training managers realize that there is no single path for 
organisational training and would depend on the culture and 
processes in an organisation.  
Leadership in a training environment also contributes to the establishment of 
an effective learning culture in the organisation (Dobson 2001, p.11). 
Leaders influence employees through their position of authority and 
employees become acute observers of how leaders act and frequently 
emulate their leaders, in words  and deeds. Establishing a training culture 
needs leadership commitment and support for the process through goal 
setting. Purcell (2004, p.56) emphasises that the behaviour of leaders, who 
are responsible for both training and performance management, contr ibutes 
to the establishment of a high performance culture in the organisation.  
Daft and Morco (1998, p.420) state that leadership plays an important role in 
the development and implementation of training and development in the 
organisation. These authors define leadership as the ability to influence 
people toward the attainment of goals.  A leader is someone who sets 
direction in an effort to influence people to follow that direction. How leaders 
influence and set direction depends on the organisational culture.  
According to McGill (2004, p.136), one study of 167 firms in 13 industries 
over a 20-year period found that the administration factor (i.e. a combination 
of leadership and managership) had a limited effect on sales and profits. Re-
analysis of the s ame data found that leadership accounted for more change 
in performance than other variables studied. McGill (2004, p.124) states that 
a leader can make a difference by influencing training and subsequently 
performance, goal attainment, individual growth and development.  
In the training and development process, the manager draws on his/her 
personal competencies to influence employees  and social competencies to
<<<PAGE=124>>>
- 102 -  
establish a constructive relationship and cognitive competencies to influence 
the training process.  
Effective managers do not give orders and discipline staff.  They draw the 
best from their people through encouragement, support and personal 
charisma for individual employees to develop (Price 2004, p.18).  Blake and 
Mouton perceive an effective manag er as one that has concern for both 
employee and task and can integrate personal needs and organisational 
needs.  Situational leadership theory, such as that of Hersey and Blanchard, 
postulates that an effective leader is one who has the ability to organis e and 
spell out the task to the group and maintain a constructive interpersonal 
relationship with group members (Werner 2003, p.193).  
 
From the above discussion, it may be concluded that an effective training 
manager who is able to lead subordinates into a learning environment, 
should be aware of his or her own training and development priorities. An 
effective training manager is able to guide, direct, influence, plan, and 
implement training and development priorities that would not only address 
departmental needs but will also be able to attract and retain individual 
commitment to departmental learning.     
 
 
3.4.3 Develop a performance management system 
 
There is often confusion about the role of performance management and 
performance appraisal. It is therefore  necessary to understand the 
difference between the two. In order to clear the confusion about the two 
concepts, brief definitions of performance management and performance 
appraisal will be provided. Performance management is an overall 
strategy to improv e performance in an organisation. According to Bacal 
(1999, p.3) and Viedge, Schultz, Bagraim, Portgieter and Werner (2003,
<<<PAGE=125>>>
- 103 -  
p.78), performance appraisal is a sub- component of an overall 
performance management system. The isolation of performance appraisal 
from other performance management processes will render the entire 
performance management system inadequate and incomplete. The main 
difference between performance management and performance appraisal 
is that performance management is a continuous process while 
performance appraisal is performed once or twice a year (DPSM 2001, 
p.12).   
 
Training and development cannot improve both employee and 
organisational performance if there is no performance management 
system in place. There is a need for organisations to continuously manage 
and appraise employee performance in order to have effective training 
and develop programmes  addressing issues of poor performance. Both 
performance management and performance appraisal determine the type 
and the quality of the training programme to be delivered. 
 
The main objective of this research is to formulate strategies that can be 
used by the Botswana public service to evaluate the effectiveness of 
training and development initiatives. In c hapter two, the Botswana 
performance managemenet system was discussed and this section 
provides guidelines for an effective performance management system and 
performance appraisal that effectively informs training managers on the 
type and the quality of training required for the organisation. 
 
In order to clarify the function and the role of performance management, 
the definition of performance management, its purpose and the application 
at individual, team and organisation level, will be discussed in this section. 
The discussion will also include how both performance management and 
performance appraisal influence training and development decisions.
<<<PAGE=126>>>
- 104 -  
Performance management is an ongoing communication process between 
an employee and his/her immediate supervisor. It involves establishing 
clear expectations and an understanding of the essential job functions the 
employee is expected to fulfill , Bacal (1999, p.5) suggests that s pecific 
aspects of the employee’s job, which should be discussed with him/her, 
include the following:  
 
 How the employee contributes to the goals of the organisation; 
 What performing a job well means in concrete terms; 
 How the employee and supervisor will work together to sustain, 
improve or build on the current performance level of the employee; 
 How job performance will be measured; and 
 Which barriers prevent performance and how to remove them? 
 
According to Joubert and Noah (2000, p.18), performance management 
entails formally guiding, directing, measuring, evaluating and rewarding 
employee effort, competence and talent to achieve organisational strategic 
objectives. It is therefore evident , that performance management is a 
combined effort between the supervisor and employee to achieve 
organisational goals. 
 
Performance management is aimed at obtaining better results from 
individuals, teams and the organisation by understanding and managing 
performance within an agreed framework of planned goals, standards and 
competencies (Armstrong 2000, p.45).               
 
Firstly, performance management is concerned with individual, team  and 
oganisational effectiveness. Secondly, performance management is 
concerned with continuous employee development. Thirdly, performance 
management is concerned with satisfying the needs and expectations of 
all organisation stakeholders which include owners, management,
<<<PAGE=127>>>
- 105 -  
employees, customers, suppliers and the general public. During 
performance management, the needs of individuals, teams and the 
organisation should be considered and respected.  
 
Finally, performance management is concerned with communicati on, 
involvement and participation. It is aimed at creating a climate in which a 
continuous dialogue between manager and team members takes place to 
define expectations and share information of the organisation’s, mission, 
values and objectives (Organisational Performance 2000, p.2).  In order to 
understand the scope of performance management in an organisation, 
three levels of performance management are identified, namely 
performance management at individual, team and organisational level. 
 
3.4.3.1 Performance management at individual level  
 
The development phase at individual level is concerned with employee 
skills development and comprehensive performance feedback, which 
results in the necessary performance adjustments. According to 
Ivancevich et al (1997 , p.7), individual performance is the foundation of 
organisational performance and the understanding of individual behaviour 
is therefore critical for the effective management of performance. Viedge 
et al (2003, p.82) state that a discussion of performance  and the 
understanding of behaviours form the basis of performance improvement. 
During the discussion, the manager is able to identify the training needs of 
the individual. The next step is the review, analysis and evaluation of the 
employee’s performance. Management should also establish a reward 
system that enhances the attainment of individual, team and 
organisational goals. Once the employee has attained the desired goals, 
performance goals and responsibilities are redefined.
<<<PAGE=128>>>
- 106 -  
Teams play a crucial role in the modern business and therefore,  it is 
important for the organisation to maximis e the capability of teams in 
achieving their strategic goals. Team performance like individual 
performance is critical for not only organisational effectiveness, but also  
for competitiveness. 
 
The next section will present a discussion on the management of team 
performance. 
 
3.4.3.2 Performance management at team level 
 
Performance management actions at team level do not vary from 
performance management at individual level , except that they are aimed 
at the collective efforts of tea m members. For any organisation to perform 
effectively at team level, interdependent individuals and groups must 
establish working relationships across organisational boundaries, between 
individuals, and between groups. The management of individual 
performance can be used to foster this interdependence. Top 
management must be committed to the team and the management of its 
performance. Through their time, attention, and other behaviour, leaders 
must continually express and reinforce the notion that team work is the 
only way to achieve planned performance goals.  
 
Gibson, Ivancevich and Donell ey (1997, p.215) observe that, just like 
individuals, teams need nurturing and support. It is not enough to develop 
a mission, goals, and performance strategies for a team without 
continuously managing its performance. Managers must, through team 
building and communication, co -ordinate and adjust the performance 
activities of teams to maximise effectiveness.  Te am performance must 
continually be reviewed, analysed and evaluated. Organisations also need 
to establish a reward system for teams. Team rewards must be
<<<PAGE=129>>>
- 107 -  
commensurate with the value of organisational performance and team 
contribution. Performance expectati ons for teams are continuously 
redefined through the development of suitable strategies. 
 
It can be concluded that the role of teams in improving organisational 
performance is equally important as individual performance and therefore 
it is important to manage team performance  to improve the overall 
organisational performance.  
 
 3.4.3.3 Performance management at organisational level 
 
An organisation consists made of individuals and teams whose 
performance has to be managed  continuously. Performance may also  be 
managed at organisational level. This section will cover performance 
standards and measures, and characteristics of an effective performance 
management system. 
 
Performance management at organisational level begins with the 
development of a strategic business plan and organisational design which 
enhances performance management. Performance management at this 
level also entails a review of organisational performance against the 
strategic business, training and development plan and financial goals.   
 
It can therefore be concluded,  that performance management must be 
based on the strategic plans of the organisation. Individual and team 
objectives are deduced from the organisational strategic objectives and 
the strategic human resources development plan of the organisation.  
 
From the above discussion, it is evident that the development of a 
performance management system begins with establishing the 
advantages of the current management system and re- engineering it
<<<PAGE=130>>>
- 108 -  
according to the strategic needs and objecti ves of the organisation. The 
next section focuses on the performance standards and measures. 
 
3.4.3.4 Performance standards and measures 
 
An important aspect in the development of a performance management 
system is the development of performance standards and measures. The 
first step is to determine the employee key performance areas, also called 
critical performance areas. Performance standards and measures are 
developed for the key performance areas and must subsequently be 
rectified by training and development. 
 
Critical performance areas are responsibilities or accountabilities of such 
importance that unacceptable performance will result in a poor 
performance appraisal. Key performance areas must be formulated 
thoughtfully because an employee’s unacceptable performance can result 
in disciplinary action. 
 
According to Thomas (1999, p.41), the following questions assist in 
identifying key performance areas: 
 
 Is the performance area a major component of the work? 
 Does the performance area address individual performance 
only? 
 Are there serious consequences if the employee does not 
complete his/her work? 
 How does underperformance affect the work if the employee 
fails to perform in one of the key performance areas? 
 
Productivity can be measured in terms of quali ty, quantity, timeliness and 
cost effectiveness. Quality addresses how well an employee and
<<<PAGE=131>>>
- 109 -  
department perform work and the accuracy or effectiveness of the final 
product(s). Quality refers to accuracy, appearance, usefulness or 
effectiveness.  Quality measures include error rates such as the number 
or percentage of errors allowed per unit work and customer satisfaction 
rates (determined through a customer survey). Quality deals with how 
much work an employee or department produces in a given time. Quantity  
measures can be expressed as the number of products produced. 
Timeliness entails how quickly, when, or by what date the employee or 
department produces work. 
 
Time measures include maintaining or reducing unit costs, reducing time 
taken to produce or prov ide a product or service or reducing waste 
(Thomas 1999, p.54). 
 
Performance standards are management -approved expressions of the 
performance requirements or expectations that employees must meet to 
be appraised at particular levels of performance.  Performance standards 
and measures are developed for both departments and individual key 
performance areas. Performance standards can be profit, market or 
productivity based (CIMA Study Text 2000,  p.222). Profit standards 
indicate how much profit the organisation wishes to make in a specific 
period. Market share standards indicate the total market share the 
organisation is aiming to have. 
 
Productivity standards express the relation between the inputs and 
outputs. The ratio indicates the relative productivity with which tasks are 
performed (CIMA Study Text 2000, p.222). 
 
It is evident from the literature that managers and supervisors should set 
department and individual performance standards and measures in 
collaboration with employees and according to the overall organisational
<<<PAGE=132>>>
- 110 -  
objectives. Managers should ensure consistency when formulating 
employee standards and measures. In the next section, the characteristics 
and requirements of an effective performance management system are 
discussed. 
 
 
3.4.4 Characteristics o f an effective performance management 
 system 
 
Various characteristics for an effective performance management system 
are provided by different authors. According to Renton (2000, p.43), the 
key to an effective performance management system is to align bot h team 
and individual performance to the current strategy and goals of the 
business.  
 
Renton (2000, p.44) provides the following requirements for an effective 
performance management system: 
 
 The performance management system should be owned by line 
managers and driven by senior  management; 
 Managers should understand and accept the need to consistently 
measure performance at all levels; 
 Managers should accept that defined performance management is  
essential for the business; 
 Managers should have the neces sary knowledge and skills to 
manage subordinates;  
 Consequences and rewards should be utilised to reinforce the 
process consistently and positively;  
 Other human resource processes should be aligned with the 
performance management process;
<<<PAGE=133>>>
- 111 -  
 Performance management should be transparent, openly 
challenged and defendable; 
 Each team should develop measurable unit targets for the current 
planning period that reflect their contribution to the short and long - 
term strategy of the business; 
 All performance targets should add significant value to the business 
and be specific and measurable;  
 Individuals should perceive their targets as contributing to the 
team’s  overall  performance targets; 
 Managers and team members should accept that rewards should 
reflect the achievement of targets; 
 The manager and the employee should assess the employee’s 
performance for the period under review; 
 Managers and subordinates should sign off the assessment as 
valid, balanced and fair; and; 
  The effectiveness of the performance management system should 
be formally evaluated at least once a year and appropriate 
improvements made for the next cycle (Renton 2000, p.44). 
 
According to Dobson (2001, p.14), supervisors play a crucial role in 
performance management by promoting employee commitm ent, 
motivation, retention and development. He adds that effective 
performance management strategies are necessary during the 
performance review cycle. Some of these strategies include: 
 
 Set meaningful, attainable expectations aligned with the mission 
and broad objectives of the programme; 
 approach this process as a collaborative effort, engaging 
employees in the process; 
 provide employee access to the necessary tools, resources and 
provide a  supportive environment that enhances performance;
<<<PAGE=134>>>
- 112 -  
 continually assess and communicate performance progress;  
 Provide for on-going coaching, mentoring and active pursuit of new 
knowledge and learning; 
 Provide employees with a mid- year progress review and final 
evaluation feedback; and 
 Appreciate employee performance thro ugh the use of many 
available forms of recognition and reward. 
 
It could be concluded that certain characteristics and requirements have to 
be met for the organisation to benefit from an effective performance 
management system.  It is important to distingui sh between performance 
management and performance appraisal and not confuse the two.  
 
It could be concluded that performance appraisal is an integral part of 
performance management. It could mistakenly be assumed that 
performance management is concerned o nly with following regulatory 
requirements to appraise and rate performance, when in actual fact it is 
part of the overall performance management process. In the next section , 
attention is given to performance appraisal and the rating techniques used 
to appraise the performance of employees. 
 
3.4.5 What is performance appraisal? 
 
Performance appraisal is an integral part of an effective training cycle. The 
trainer needs performance appraisal results to determine the kind of 
training to be provided. 
 
In this  section, performance appraisal will be discussed and how it is 
linked to training in an organisation. It is important to note the appraisal 
outcomes determine the kind of training for an individual employee or for 
collective training. Performance appraisal is one critical step in the training
<<<PAGE=135>>>
- 113 -  
process that should not be overlooked. It can also be argued that the 
success of a training process is dependent on the validity and reliability of 
the appraisal process. When employee performance appraisal has been 
poorly conducted, the information given to the training department will be 
inaccurate and to a large extent misleading. It is therefore important , to 
provide detailed guidelines on performance appraisal.  
  
Hilgert and Leonard (1998, p .387) state that a for mal performance 
appraisal by a supervisor consists of two phases: completing a written 
appraisal form and conducting an appraisal interview. 
 
Completing a written appraisal form implies facilitating the appraisal 
process and making it more uniform. There are numerous types of forms 
which can be used for employee evaluation and the human resources 
department prepares these forms with input from employees and their 
supervisors. Once these forms are prepared, the human resources 
department usually trains super visors and employees on how to complete 
them. The supervisor informs new employees on the appraisal process.  
 
 
Employee appraisal forms normally make provision for the following 
information:  
 
  Job knowledge; 
 Conduct; 
 Ability to learn; 
 Attitude; 
 Timeliness output; 
 Suggestion and ideas; 
 Quality of work; 
 Safety;
<<<PAGE=136>>>
- 114 -  
 Co-operation (effectiveness in dealing with others); 
 Effectiveness in use of resources; and  
 Judgement (Kreitner & Kinicki 2001, p.275). 
 
The supervisor should ensure that only information that is relevant to the 
employee’s performance is included in the appraisal form and the 
appraisal interview. The appraisal interview is based on the written 
appraisal report. Approaches that may be used for the appraising 
interview include the tell -and-sell method,  tell-and-listen method or the 
problem solving method. 
 
 With the tell -and-sell method the manager tells the employee 
how he/she has been assessed and tries to sell the evaluation 
and the improvement plan to the employee; 
 With the tell -and-listen method the  manager tells the employee 
how he/she has been assessed and then invites the employees 
to respond; and 
 With the problem -solving approach the manager abandons the 
role of critic and becomes a counsellor and a helper (CIMA 
Study Text 2000, p.132). 
 
Factors that enable the supervisor to make performance evaluations 
rather than personality judgments should be used whenever possible. 
According to Erasmus , et al . (2000, p.430), there is no best -appraisal 
interview method. The choice of interview method depends on the 
employee and the job specifics. These authors state that the effectiveness 
of the appraisal interview is dependent on the supervisor’s knowledge of 
variables and how to apply the necessary skills for a flexible and 
situational approach towards the appraisal interview.
<<<PAGE=137>>>
- 115 -  
The performance appraisal process becomes less objective when the 
appraiser is biased. The leniency error occurs when supervisors give 
employees higher ratings than they deserve (Joubert and Noah 2000, 
p.19). Some supervisors may be m ore severe than others in appraising 
the employee. A supervisor who gives a low rating might damage the 
morale of the employee being appraised. Such a situation might arise 
when the supervisor feels that a good rating will result in the employee 
being promoted to other departments in the organisation.  
 
According to Newstron and Davis (1997, p.176), most appraisal systems 
require supervisors to assess employees on various aspects of their 
performance, behaviours and personal traits. Many appraisal systems 
focus on historical performance and the individual’s potential for growth 
and advancement.  An effective performance appraiser is one who: 
 
 Is knowledgeable about the employee’s job; 
 Has previously set measures for performance standards; 
 Gathers specific information about performance; 
 Seeks and uses inputs from other observers in the organisation; 
 Provides acceptable support and praise for tasks well 
completed; 
 Listens actively to employee inputs and reactions; 
 Shares responsibility for outcomes and offers f uture assistance; 
and  
 Allows participation during the discussion (CIMA Study Text 
2000, p.34). 
 
In a study conducted by McNeill (1999, p.78) it became evident that 
managers generally express discomfort with playing the role of 
performance appraiser. The r esearch concluded that most supervisors 
dislike “playing God and try to avoid responsibility for providing their
<<<PAGE=138>>>
- 116 -  
subordinates with performance feedback”. Charges of racism, sexism and 
perceptual distortion have also been leveled at appraisers.  In a study that 
monitored the fate of 173 unionised employees who filed grievances 
against their supervisors over an eight -year period, it became evident that 
those who filed grievances previously received lower performance ratings 
than their co -workers who had not f iled grievances. The researcher 
concluded that supervisors may use performance appraisal as a weapon 
to get even with employees they dislike. 
 
A lack of performance appraisal skills may hinder the performance 
appraisal process. According to research, 25 per cent of managers 
responsible for appraising employee performance are not trained (McNeil  
1999, p. 79).  The research indicated that when training is provided, it 
focuses on aspects such as procedures, deadlines for submitting the 
appraisal forms and other administrative functions and not on appraisal 
skills.   
 
The appraiser should have the following skills to be effective in appraising 
the performance of employees: 
 
 Be in a position to observe the behaviours and the performance of 
the employee; 
 Be knowledgeable about measuring employee performance goals; 
 Have an understanding of measuring employee performance and; 
 Must be motivated to do a continuous job rating.  
 
According to Armstrong (1999, p.356), managers need to ensure that all 
four abovementioned criteria are satisfied if performance appraisal is to be 
conducted properly.
<<<PAGE=139>>>
- 117 -  
The appraisee has to play an active part in performance appraisal.  McNeil 
(1999, p.78) states that employees often play a passive, listening and 
watching role when their performance is being appraised. To overcome 
this problem, some organisations, in both the public and private sector, 
include self-appraisal as part of their performance appraisal process. Self -
appraisal allows the employee a personal assessment of his/her 
accomplishments, strengths and weaknesses. This approach has several 
advantages: 
 
 It saves the manager time as the employee identifies the areas of 
competence which are relevant to the job, and his/her relative 
strengths in these competencies; 
 It offers increased responsibility to the individual, which may 
improve motivation; 
 It may be a way of reconciling the individual’s and organisational 
goals; 
 Self-appraisal reduces the need for a skilled appraiser, thus cutting 
training costs and reducing the manager’s  role in the appraisal; 
and  
 It offers more flexibility in terms of timing, with individuals 
undertaking ongoing self -evaluation (Organisational management 
2001, p.215). 
 
However, this approach has its problems, which include the employee 
diminishing their responsibility and blaming structural factors for their poor 
performance.  
 
According to Newstron and Davis (1997, p.178), self -appraisal can be 
problematic as the employee has to perform multiple functions in the 
appraisal interview. Self -appraisal can be diff icult and threatening for 
many managers. In addition, there are several behavioural problems
<<<PAGE=140>>>
- 118 -  
inherent in the process. It can become confrontational when each party is 
convinced that their views are right. Self -appraisal is an emotional 
approach because the manager‘s role calls for critical evaluation while the 
employee desires to “save face”, which leads to defensiveness.  However, 
self-assessments are much less threatening to one’s self -esteem than 
those received from others. Therefore,  self-appraisal prov ides more 
chance for growth and change, and it has many advantages. 
 
3.4.5.1 Performance appraisal approaches 
 
According to Viedge, et al. (2003, p.483), four approaches can be used to 
appraise employee performance. These include the traits, the behavioural, 
the results and the contingency approach. 
 
The traits approach involves rating the employee’s personal traits or 
characteristics such as initiative, decision- making and dependability. The 
traits approach method is considered to be the weakest of the four 
appraisal methods as it focuses on the person rather than the actual 
performance.  For example, rating an employee low on initiative does not 
tell him/her how to improve his/her job performance. This approach also 
makes employees react defensively to feedback (Schultz 2001, p. 525).  
 
The behavioural approach focuses on an employee’s behaviour rather 
than on his/her personality. The advantage of this approach is that 
examples of specific behaviours can be highlighted during the feedback 
process. 
 
The resu lts approach, unlike the traits approach, is based on what the 
individual has accomplished. Management by objectives is the most 
common example of a results approach.
<<<PAGE=141>>>
- 119 -  
The contingency approach is the most useful approach as, unlike the 
other three approac hes, it focuses on the reasons why the employee has 
not achieved the desired targets and provides an opportunity to correct 
these. The traits approach, unlike the contingency approach, is poor when 
promotion decisions are to be made for candidates with dif ferent jobs. The 
results approach method fails to specify why the appraisee’s objectives 
have not been met, while the behavioural approach is subject to 
situational limitations, such as when employees with different jobs are 
being evaluated for promotion (Schultz, et al. 2001, p.484). 
 
Toffler (2005, p.18) states that it is not enough to simply assert that 
training leads to better workers, better workers lead to higher quality work, 
which leads to higher customer satisfaction, to more loyal customers to 
higher revenue. Toffler argues that it is important to show the connection 
between training, improved performance and more profit. Toffler 
recommends that one needs to show training skills critical to the 
organisational objectives, and to focus on the most im portant of those 
skills. 
 
The overall purpose of this research is to develop effective training and 
development evaluation strategies to be used by the Botswana public 
service. It is therefore important , to first investigate how performance 
management func tions and performance appraisal contribute to an 
effective training and development and the evaluation thereof. The 
objective of this section was to gain an understanding of elements of 
performance management and the relationship between the various 
components including performance appraisal.

3.5 IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT OF A LEARNING 
ORGANISATION  
 
This section presents a discussion on the implementation and the 
management of a learning organisation. Also highlighted in this section 
are building block s for a learning organisation, challenges facing 
managers in creating a learning organisation and various step for creating 
a learning organisation. 
 
The challenge of implementing and managing a learning organisation lies 
in facilitating the learning of all employees, thereby ensuring the continued 
transformation of the department itself. Thus, the learning organisation 
does not fit itself within the bureaucratic forms of management with fixed 
chains of command or lines of communication. The purpose of 
organisation learning is to enhance individual capabilities in order to 
strengthen departmental capability, in order to ensure responsive product 
and service delivery. The management of organisational learning cannot 
be addressed through human resources development and training but 
rather through the implementation of a holistic human resources 
management system that would address all aspects regarding the 
management and development of human resources. 
 
In this section, attention will be focused on the characteristics and culture 
of a learning organisation, the addressing of the challenges hindering the 
implementation of learning organisation, steps involved in the 
implementation of a learning organisation and the management processes 
involved in facilitating the implementation of a learning organisation.

3.5.1 The building blocks of a learning organisation  
 
The building blocks of a learning organisation can be further explained by 
focusing on different types of learning. The different types of learning, 
according to Farago and Skyrme (1995, p.2), include: 
 
 Level one learning, which involves learning facts, knowledge, 
processes and procedures as they apply to known situations; 
 Level two learning consists of the learning of new job skills that are 
transferable to other situations; 
 Level three learning describes the learning or the adaptation to 
more dynamic situations where the solution need to be developed; 
and  
 Level four learning implies the learning to new learners levels, 
which includes characteristics suc h as innovation and creativity in 
problem solving. 
 
Establishing a learning organisation depends on creating a learning 
culture. A learning culture does not mean sending employees on as many 
training courses as possible without evaluating the outcomes , but rather 
identifying on a continuous basis those training courses that will satisfy 
both the individual and the organisational developmental needs. A 
learning culture should support learning and be based on ensuring the 
free and fair exchange of information  to put expertise where it is most 
needed and encouraging individuals to network extensively in order to 
develop their knowledge and expertise as well as supporting commitment 
to learning and personal development where learning is rewarded and 
encouraged. The learning culture will be characterised by creativity, 
diversity and a climate of openness and trust. The learning culture 
presupposes that learning from mistakes can often be more rewarding and 
instructional, than learning from success (Farago & Skyrme 1995, p.2).
<<<PAGE=144>>>
- 122 -  
 
Organisations learn through employee learning but employees who learn 
will, by no means, guarantee that departmental learning will take place. 
Without employee learning , organisations will not evolve into learning 
organisations. The basic bui lding block for a learning organisation is its 
commitment to individual employee learning. Senge (1998, p.11) 
maintains that a manager’s fundamental task no longer lies in planning, 
organising, and controlling but in providing the enabling conditions for an 
employee to lead the most enriching life he or she can. Senge (1998, 
p.56) proposes five disciplines that underwrite the building blocks for a 
learning organisation. The five disciplines are personal mastery, mental 
models, shared vision, team learning and systematic thinking. 
 
The phrase ‘personal mastery’ is used to describe the discipline for 
personal growth and learning. Employees with high levels of personal 
mastery continuously expand their ability to create the results in life that 
they truly seek.  Their quest for continuous learning is the basic spirit for 
the learning organisation. Personal mastery goes beyond mere 
competence and skill , although it is grounded in achieving competence 
and obtaining appropriate skills.  
 
Personal mastery embodies tw o underlying movements including to 
continuously clarify what is important and to continually learn how to see 
the current reality more clearly. The gap between the vision of what an 
employee wants to achieve and the realities of the current position shoul d 
generate a creative tension force to bring them together. The essence of 
personal mastery is to learning how to generate and sustain the creative 
tension in the day-to-day functions of employees (Senge 1998, p.142). 
 
Mental models, according to Senge (1998, p.8), are deeply ingrained 
assumptions and generalisations that influence the way in which
<<<PAGE=145>>>
- 123 -  
employees will understand and take action. The mental model focuses on 
turning the attention inward, to the development of self and realising what 
can be learned from others, without making assumptions about whom 
these persons are.  
 
Senge (1998, p.174) maintains that new insights are not implemented 
because they are in conflict with deeply held internal images on how a 
department works. These images limit the way  employees think and act 
and the managing of mental models would then imply the surfacing, 
testing and improving of internal images of how a department functions. 
Developing employee capability to work with mental models involves 
leaning new skills and implementing departmental innovations that will 
help bring the new skills into regular practice. The purpose of mental 
models is to ensure that managers focus on chang ing ways employee 
perceive work  through a systematic thinking (to be discussed shortly). 
Hodgkison (2000, p.5) stipulated that establishing new mental models in 
an ever- changing environment will not be an easy task to accomplish, but 
that the first step towards it should be for all employees to acknowledge 
their mental preconceptions and learn to deal with them.   
 
 
A shared vision creates a sense of commonality that penetrates the whole 
organisation or department and provides a sense of cohesiveness to all 
diverse activities and employees. When employees truly share a vision, 
they are bound by i t. The shared vision is crucial to departmental learning 
because it provides focus and energy for learning. It could be argued that 
through shared vision employees will strive to learn because learning a 
new skill becomes part of the vision and is thus important to them. A 
shared vision is a vision to which employees are committed, because it 
also reflects their own personal vision. Senge (1998, p.233) maintains that 
aligning the team becomes a prerequisite for empowering the individual
<<<PAGE=146>>>
- 124 -  
that will empower the team. Team learning is the process of aligning and 
developing that capacity of the team in order to ensure the departmental 
effectiveness and efficiency.  Focusing on team learning presupposes that 
individual learning is not enough to be responsive to departmental training 
priorities and thus focusing on the team accomplishments sets the tone for 
and establishes the standards of learning for the whole organisation. 
 
Hendricks (2000 , p.88 ) states that organisations are moving away from 
strictly hierarchica l structures to a more matrix -oriented structure, 
promoting team effectiveness and efficiency above individual 
performance. Only when team functioning characterises a department can 
team learning be propagated, but in a hierarchical structure, placing 
emphasis on the importance of the individual position in the realisation of 
departmental effectiveness and efficiency will provide the basis for 
instilling a new learning culture. Hodgkinson (2000, p.6) states that team 
learning could be achieved through an at titude of give and take and that 
sharing visions for the team would co-ordinate the team effort efficiently.  
 
Team learning is also significant for individuals who could show personal 
mastery and talented team members should be used to develop others.  
However, lack of any organisational support in terms of counselling and 
mentoring could hinder team learning.  
 
The fifth discipline is titled systems thinking which is based on utilising the 
way of thinking about language for describing and understanding the 
relationships that shape the behaviour of systems (Frydman,  et al. 2000, 
p.5). ‘System thinking is a discipline for seeing the wholes’    (Senge 1998, 
p.123). System thinking analyses the interrelationships and patterns that 
bind the system together. Systems become more complex and complexity 
can undermine confidence and responsibility. System thinking is labelled 
the fifth discipline because it is the cornerstone for all the other four
<<<PAGE=147>>>
- 125 -  
disciplines. System thinking sees the interrelationships rather than just 
cause-and-effect situations and identifies the processes of change rather 
than providing snapshots. The practice of system thinking begins with 
creating an understanding of what is meant by feedback in trying to 
simplify the work situation by identify ing the deeper patterns that shape 
events and details (Senge 1998, p.71). Individual challenges, ident ified by 
Hodgkinson (2000, p.6)  pertain to the laziness and apathy of employees, 
highlighting once again, the importance of identifying the role of the 
individual within the department. The problem statement of this thesis 
describes the fact that training and development are not evaluated, even 
though at this stage they can be categorized as integral parts of a learning 
organisation. Training and development in a learning organisation should 
be part  of the daily activities of employees and the not seen, as it is at the 
moment, as a measure to try and address the gap between actual 
performance and desired performance.  
 
Critten (1993, p.204) states that the learning organsiation has a climate 
that fosters individual learning and development. The learning culture will 
also be extended to include customers, suppliers and all other 
stakeholders. Furthermore, human resources development strategies will 
become synonymous with one another. The learni ng organisation has to 
be realised from building on the principle of continuous transformation.        
 
The importance of aligning the individual employee’s position with 
departmental strategic goals cannot be overemphas ised. Throughout the 
implementation of the process of the five disciplines, the foundation for a 
learning organisation can be created. Without alignment however, 
individual employees will not share a departmental vision, focus on 
departmental team thinking  or learning, and the complexity of the system 
will never be understood. Facilitating the creation of a learning 
organisation is dependent on the reciprocal meaningful relationship
<<<PAGE=148>>>
- 126 -  
between the individual employees and the departmental effectiveness and 
efficiency (Van Dijk 2003, p.185). 
 
Armstrong (2003, p.550) states that a systematic training is one that is 
specifically designed, planned and implemented to meet the defined 
needs. It is provided by people who know how to train, and the impact of 
training is carefully evaluated.   
 
Brookes (1995, p.30) adds that for training and development to be 
successful it needs to be organised effectively. The organisation needs to 
have and support a training department or at the least someone with 
dedicated responsibil ity within the personnel. It is essential to have a 
training and development policy and training plan and to allocate a 
realistic budget to the training, and for training and development to be 
represented and supported at board level. Brookes (1995, p.30) cautions 
that it is important to recognise that training is not the solution to all 
problems, and indeed, that it could sometime exacerbate the situation.  
 
Training is usually identified or associated with performance problems, 
either existing or potential, and therefore it is important for training to be 
systematically organised.   
 
Swanepoel, et al. (1998, p.480) argue that one of the many reasons why 
training fails in the organisation is due to a lack of systematically 
developing training models. The authors add that it is essential to translate 
the needs identified into measurable objectives that will guide the training 
process. These objectives will state what a person will be able to do, 
under what conditions, and how well the person will be able to d o it. Once 
the needs have been identified and behavioural objectives stated, training 
methods can be developed to achieve these objectives. Appropriate 
training methods must be selected and suitable materials developed to
<<<PAGE=149>>>
- 127 -  
convey the required knowledge and skills identified in the objectives. Most 
importantly, training management is a single and critical component that 
contributes to the effective training and development in the organisation.  
 
When training and development are well managed, they can contribute to 
the achievement of organisational goals. Training and development play a 
more long -term strategic role directly or indirectly. The direct role is 
pursued within the context of training and development. In this respect, 
training and development can m ove away from focusing on individual 
skills to a more strategic approach such as leadership, team, and an 
organisational strategic plan (Burcley & Caple 2000, p.4).  
 
Sloman (1999, p.73) notes that an effective link between training and 
strategic planning is one of the most important challenges facing training 
managers in recent times. Sloman further adds that in the majority of 
instances, training managers attach strategic organisational goals to their 
training and development priorities. He attributes thi s failure to poor 
planning on the part of training managers. It is therefore crucial that a 
strategic training plan be in place for training to be effective.   
 
Creating a learning organisation is not easy and therefore managers have 
to deal with diverse and difficult situations. The next section presents a 
discussion on some of the challenges in creating a learning organisation. 
 
 
3.5.2 Challenges faced in creating a learning organisation 
 
Managers are faced with quite a number challenges in creating a learning 
organisation. These include amongst others; operational preoccupation, 
hierarchal thinking, reluctance to train and lack of empowerment.
<<<PAGE=150>>>
- 128 -  
Garrant (1990, p.78) identified specific conditions that would facilitate 
departmental learning, including creat ing the perception that learning is a 
cyclical process.  The free flow of information is a necessary prerequisite 
for the creation of a learning organisation as well as the ability of 
managers to value employees as the key assets for departmental 
learning. Managers need to understand that a new approach to training 
and development (the creation of a learning organisation) will not be 
implemented without challenges.  Specific challenges deal, for instance, 
with the lack of strategic awareness on the part of managers as well as a 
lack of personal development processes. 
 
3.5.2.1 Operational preoccupation 
 
The first challenge faced by managers in creating a learning organisation 
is operational preoccupation  
 
Farago and Skyrme (1995, p.3) maintain that not creat ing time to sit back 
and think strategically will only hinder the successful management of a 
learning organisation. Strategic thinking can be a powerful tool in ensuring 
human resource development and training because strategic thinking will 
ensure the creation of the important link between human resource 
development (individual employee effectiveness and efficiency) and 
organisational development (departmental effectiveness and efficiency). 
 
Garrant (1990, p. XV) maintains that managers lack awareness in terms of 
their own strategic leadership roles in the creation of a learning 
organisation. Day -to-day functioning prevents managers from being able 
to sit back and strategically think about the department’s positioning and 
how to improve and adapt to the ever -changing external environment. No 
learning system is able to keep up with the changes taking place in the
<<<PAGE=151>>>
- 129 -  
external environment and thus no department can ever, in the true sense 
of the concept, become a learning organisation. 
 
3.5.2.2 Hierarchical thinking  
 
The second challenge that managers have to deal with in creating a 
learning organisation is hierarchical thinking. 
 
The tendency to focus too much on systems and processes to the 
exclusion of other factors inhibits the management of a learning 
organisation (F arago & Skyrme 1995, p.3). The challenge is evidenced 
when a departmental structure is too hierarchical and the free flow of 
information is not promoted.   
 
Employees hold on to their positions and status, because they do not 
understand the larger role that they play within the overall department. 
Their territory has to be protected, and innovation or development might 
just harm their status quo.  
 
3.5.2.3       Reluctance to train 
 
The third challenge facing managers in creating a learning organisation is 
reluctance to train. 
 
The reluctance to train or invest in training is a great challenge for public 
managers to overcome (Farago & Skyrme 1995, p.4). The reason for not 
investing in training could be due to personal fears or prejudice, but it does 
hamper t he successful implementation and management of a learning 
organisation. Garr ant (1990, p.XV) identifies the lack of a personal 
development plan as a stumbling block to the successful implementation 
of a learning organisation.  Lack of training could be as a result of a lack of
<<<PAGE=152>>>
- 130 -  
resources.  Budget constraints could prevent training from occurring or the 
employee workload could discourage the release of employees for 
training.  Whatever the reasons, the fact remains that a department that 
does not train, will not be able to respond to changing demands, will not 
be able to transform itself and cannot be defined as a department valuing 
human resource development. 
 
3.5.2.4    Lack of empowerment 
 
The final aspect that poses a challenge to managers in creating a learning 
oranisation is lack of empowerment. 
 
Farago and Skyrme (1995, p.4) state that the lack of real empowerment is 
due to a management approach that is too top- driven and based on tight 
supervision. The management of a learning organisation is based on 
enhancing individual capacity and relying on creativity and innovation but 
too much supervision or control would only impede these goals. 
 
Lawrence (1998, p.4) identified specific individual and organisational 
barriers to the implementation and management of the learning 
organisation. Individual employees may tend to think that they know 
everything that they need to know to function effectively and efficiently, 
they might feel a degree of discomfort with the idea of giving up what they 
believe or have implemented for a long time, they fear that they might be 
incompetent for the period it would take them to learn a new skill or they 
might just experience a degree of mental laziness. 
 
Organisational barriers deal with the assumption that senior 
management’s decisions should not be questioned. A blaming rather than 
trusting departmental culture would inhibit learning together with an 
environment where questioning and challenging are not encouraged; it
<<<PAGE=153>>>
- 131 -  
would block the sharing of learning.  A learning organisation characterised 
by a cross -functional structure and a strictly hierarchical or too 
bureaucratic structure could impede the implementation of a learning 
organisation. Other organisational barriers could include a lack of training 
time, resources and materials, a lack  of recognition for improving 
capabilities and contributions and a lack of knowledge transfer (Lawrence 
1998, p.5). 
 
Managers need to be able and capable of identifying possible challenges 
in the implementation of a learning organisation. The challenges 
themselves offer good learning opportunities for managers. The 
implementation of a learning organisation is, as has been stated before, 
an approach to employee training and development.  It can be equated 
with the highest level of self -actualisation in a mot ivational theory.  
Managers should always strive to provide the best learning environment 
for their employees. The process and steps involved in the creation of a 
learning organisation will now be discussed. 
 
Having established the challenges facing traini ng managers in creating a 
learning organisation, it is important to consider the follow steps in 
creating a learning organisation.  
 
3.5.2.5 Steps to a learning organisation 
 
Kline and Saunders (1993, p.5) identified ten steps in the creation of a 
learning organisation: 
 
 Including assessing the learning culture;  
 Promoting the positive; 
 Making the workplace safe for thinking;  
 Rewarding the risk-takers;
<<<PAGE=154>>>
- 132 -  
 Helping employees become resources for each other;  
 Putting learning power to work; 
 Mapping out the vision, bringing vision to life;  
 Connecting the systems and the implementation thereof; and  
 Getting the show on the road. 
 
Redding & Catalanello (1994, p.135) reduce steps identified by Kline and 
Saunders’ (1993, p.5) to five stages and these include:   
Stage one is working with no intentional learning programme but 
becoming aware of a training need that would lead to the second stage, 
namely treating learning as a consumable.  
Stage three is bringing learning inside the department and through 
strategic linkin g, identifying a department with a learning agenda (stage 
four).   
 
Stage five is integrating work and learning through systemic skills and 
work integrity. During the first stage, learning occurs unintentionally , 
usually because a department is newly creat ed and everybody is still 
trying to figure out their own positions and strengths. The second stage is 
institutionalisation of training and development strategies. However, 
training occurs outside a department and is used as a reward for good 
performance. S tage three tries to evaluate the link between training and 
job performance. More training is provided within a department but the 
training is aimed at arbitrarily chosen perceived training priorities. 
 
Stage four introduces an important shift. Learning needs are established 
based upon the strategic training needs of a department. A department is 
able to determine the skills gap between what it has available and what it 
needs, and  can thus target the development of specific skills and 
knowledge.
<<<PAGE=155>>>
- 133 -  
During sta ge four, most learning still occurs outside a department, but 
during stage five the transformation occurs. The department (its senior 
management) realises that they have to move learning out of the external 
classroom and into the day -to-day work for learni ng in order to achieve 
maximum benefit for the department.  
 
Stage five is the alignment of all departmental systems towards the 
achievement of performance through learning. This fifth stage coincides 
with the fifth discipline as promoted by Peter Senge an d described earlier 
in this chapter (section 3.5).  
 
Lawrence (1998, p.7) places an emphasis on the importance of senior 
management to be the role models for the implementation of the learning 
organisation. The management styles should thus be based on open and 
honest communication with managers being capable of influencing the 
processes and structures of a department.  Senior managers need to first 
realise the extent to which they can still contribute and what they need to 
learn from others. Lawrence (1998, p.9) notes that empowerment and 
innovation lie at the heart of the learning organisation. The threat of 
empowerment and innovation is located in the fact that managers will 
have to give up the control that they perceive to have over subordinates 
and replace that with participation, accountability and transparency. 
 
The learning organisation could be characterised as possessing a learning 
approach to strategy, basing decisions on participative processes, 
distributing information freely and without prejudic e, and not perceiving 
budgets and financial controls as barriers to becoming a learning 
organisation. The learning organisation perceives their managers as 
asserting their primary task of experimentation and learning from 
experience. The learning organisat ion is built on feedback (evaluation as 
discussed in the previous chapter), in order to obtain information that
<<<PAGE=156>>>
- 134 -  
would create an understanding of the importance of self -development 
opportunities for all employees (Critten 1993, p. 219). 
 
Lawrence (1998, p.5) suggests that a learning organisation could be 
implemented if senior managers learn faster and become involved in 
teaching subordinates. Organisational teams are more effective than 
individuals in problem solving while managers should encourage 
innovation, drive for continuous improvement and promote openness to 
new ideas. 
 
In the learning organisation, learning takes place on three levels, namely 
individual, group and organisational learning. The importance of identifying 
the link between individual and organisational learning becomes apparent.  
In the problem statement of this thesis the assumption was made that 
training within the B otswana public service does not address both 
individual and departmental training priorities and thus does not promote 
the creation of a learning organisation.  It has proven that even though 
employees are able to identify the departmental training priorities, they are 
not able to clearly determine how the link is drawn between departmental 
training priorities and individual training courses offered. Neither is specific 
regarding the extent to which the public service is successfully able to 
identify the strategic importance of the individual employee within a 
learning environment. The different management functions facilitating the 
creation of a learning organisation will now be discussed. 
 
 
3.5.3 Key management functions in a learning organisation  
 
Managers have critical functions in the creation, implementation and 
management of a learning organisation. These management func tions 
include strategic planning, organising, influencing, and control.
<<<PAGE=157>>>
- 135 -  
 
The key management processes in the establishing and management of 
the learning organisation deals with strategic planning, organising, guiding 
and control through effective and effic ient performance management. 
However, it is also important to note some of the leadership characteristics 
that can be identified with a manager able to be an organisational learning 
leader. 
 
Frydman, et al. (2000, p.181) list and describe the various characteristics 
of the organisational learning manager. The characteristics include that: 
 
 Managers are pragmatic visionaries seeing their work in the 
larger context of the system as a whole; 
 Centrality of values reinforcing the core set of departmental 
values; 
 Organisational learning managers are master strategists and 
tacticians being able to ascertain how external forces will shape 
the organisation and as a consequence also being able to 
articulate a realistic path for the future; 
 The essence of organisational learning management is the 
skillful devolution of power developing the leadership capability 
of subordinates; 
 Organisational learning managers are stewards of learning and 
will continuously encourage others to learn; and 
 Organisational learning mangers are learners themselves 
despite their capacity to direct and strategise. 
 
Creating a clear picture that future goals are not only  optimistic but 
attainable, is the responsibility of the inspirational motivator.  Managers 
will set high expectations and communicate a vision to employees in 
simple language.  Employees should react willingly and increase their
<<<PAGE=158>>>
- 136 -  
effort to achieve the vision. Managers who are role models for employees 
are idealized as influential leaders. Managers will show great persistence 
and determination in achieving department objectives and goals, they will 
reinforce high standards of ethical conduct and share their success with 
their employees. Managers are thus admired, respected and trusted. 
Employees will desire to emulate them and follow  them without any 
prejudice (Coad & Berry 1998, p.3). 
 
Armstrong (1999, p.170) identified the primary and accessory leadership 
roles of the manager.  The primary leadership roles of the manager are as 
a visionary, an executive, a planner, a policy -maker, a controller and a 
provider of rewards and punishments. The accessory function is vested in 
a management position. The manager acting as a role model, a symbol of 
group unity, an object for identification and, sometimes, a target for 
aggression when employees are frustrated, disappointed and 
disillusioned, are all examples of the accessory leadership roles ascribed 
to managers.    
 
The leadership roles assumed by managers will vary according to the task 
at hand. For the management of the learning organisation  the manager 
will, for instance, need to be a visionary, an expert, a role model and a 
symbol uniting his or her employees and guiding them through the 
changing learning environment. 
 
Team and organisational development are integral parts of establishing a  
learning organisation and include the use of facilitators to help groups with 
work, job and organisational design and team development by reinforcing 
values, developing a vision and creating an organisational culture based 
on a climate of cohesiveness, sh aring, support and stretching goals 
(Farago & Skyrme 1995, p.3).
<<<PAGE=159>>>
- 137 -  
3.5.3.1 Strategic planning 
 
The first management function is strategic planning. Strategic planning is 
a process of determining the future course of action. In terms of training 
and development, strategic planning would imply determining the extent to 
which the organisation and its senior management are able to formulate 
training goals and priorities as well as the ability to describe the way in 
which goals and priorities are achieved.  
 
According to Briscoe (2004, p.77), the planning process can be divided 
into seven phases which include assessing the situation, establishing 
objectives, determining an alternative course of action, evaluating and 
selecting alternatives, implementing selected plans and evaluating the 
progress of the plan in terms of assessed needs, the stated objectives and 
set control standards.    
 
Strategic planning should be based on encouraging assumptions and 
thinking that test management ’s innovative and creative problem solving 
(Farago & Skyrme 1995, p.3). Shuk la (1997, p.249) titles it creating a 
strategic intent to learn. Training managers are able to visibly and formally 
communicate their commitment to learning to their subordinates. The 
ability to promote visionary sk ills should stimulate strategic planning . Two 
ways can be identified to promote the creation of new knowledge in the 
organisation including articulating high, seemingly impossible goal to 
stimulate employees to review their assumptions about work and redes ign 
their tasks and functions. The discrepancy between present and desired 
levels of performance should be magnified in order to provide direction to 
the problem -solving efforts of the organisation. Vision building exercises 
stimulates a departmentwide process of reflection, discussion, and 
questioning resulting in the organisation being able to refine its training 
processes (Shulka 1997, p.250).
<<<PAGE=160>>>
- 138 -  
Briscoe (2004, p.89) identifies specific reasons for planning being an 
important management function. Planning  contributes to the effective 
handling of change and if one is to consider the degree to which an 
organisation needs to change to strive to become a learning organisation, 
planning becomes crucial. Planning provides direction and contributes to a 
sense of purpose for a department. Planning creates a higher level of 
predictability because employees gain a better perspective of what is 
going to be expected of them, but most importantly, planning provides an 
increased opportunity for participation in the department.  
 
The creation and implementation of the learning organisation should be a 
goal that is not only important to senior management, but also to all levels 
of the hierarchy in the department. Involvement, commitment and 
participation are key concepts for the successful implementation of 
learning in an organisation and can be facilitated through appropriate 
planning. Planning and organising affect one another and the organising 
function of managers in the learning organisation is important in terms of 
creating an enabling learning environment. After the planning process, 
managers must organise resources in order to achieve their strategic plan. 
      
3.5.3.2 Organising 
 
Managers are also charged with the responsibility of mobilizing resources 
to promote a learning organisation. 
 
Organising can be defined as the arranging and grouping of jobs, the 
allocation of resources and the assignment of work in the department in 
order to ensure that functions are implemented according to plan (Robbins 
1995, p.164). Cloete (199 8, p.167) states that when two or more people 
work together, an organisational structure should be put in place in order 
to facilitate the activities of employees. The organisational structure is the
<<<PAGE=161>>>
- 139 -  
mechanism through which training functions are effectively and efficiently 
implemented. With regard to training and development, the organising 
functions of establishing lines of communication is important for both 
feedback and evaluation purposes. Training managers must ensure that 
communication between struct ures is effective for organisational learning 
to be enhanced. The other function of managers is using their influence to 
change employee behaviour towards learning.  
 
3.5.3.3      Influencing  
 
The status and powers of managers influence the way in which employees 
learn in an organisation and therefore , managers may use their influence 
to create a learning environment in an organisation.  
 
A leader practises influencing and leadership refers to the leading, 
directing, actuating and motivating of subordinates. The basis for 
leadership is that it is an action aimed at influencing the actions of others. 
Thus, leadership cannot be taught, but it is inherent in the characteristics 
of a person. Effective leadership skills can, however be taught to training 
managers. Leadership also influences the way in which employees 
perceive their work situation. Employees would like to be challenged 
because employment is the tool to empower the employee in order to 
pursue more desirable activities during his or her time in the department.  
 
Chung (1989, p.359) best describes the difference between a leader and a 
manager. A leader has followers, a leader has emotional appeal and a 
leader meets the needs of his or her followers. Managers have to 
supervise and subordinates have to follow the directive of the manager, 
whether it appeals to them or not. Leaders are expected to be charismatic, 
while managers are expected to make rational decisions. Most 
importantly, a leader is chosen and a manager is appointed. Thus leaders
<<<PAGE=162>>>
- 140 -  
carry the interest of their followers first while managers are expected to 
places a department’s attainment of goals and objectives first. Managers 
are concerned with the wellbeing of employees, but the strategic link does 
not begin with the employee and end with management, but rather, it is 
usually the other way round. 
 
Coad and Berry (1998, p.2) have identified seven leadership styles that 
are applicable to the implementation and management of a learning 
organisation, including lasses -faire, management –by-exception, 
contingent reward, individualised consideration, intellectual stimulation, 
inspirational motivation and idealised influence. The laissez -faire leader 
allows employees to do as they please and abdicates any responsibility 
towards them. Management -by-exception and contingent reward 
management are categorized in each  transactional leadership styles. 
Transactional leadership involves role clarification, creating structures, 
attempts to meet the social needs of the employees and the distribution of  
punishment and reward based on performance.  
 
Management–by-exception means that managers will only take action 
when they realise that functions are implemented contrary to the strategic 
plan of a department. Contingent reward is an exchange process based 
on the manager and employee following agreed- upon roles and 
responsibilities for each predetermined goal, and the manager offers 
rewards when employees have performed adequately. This leadership 
style is effective to a department and satisfies the employee, because they 
receive feedback on individual performance (Coad & Berry 1998, p.3).      
 
Individualised consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspiration motivation 
and idealised influence are other types of transformational leadership 
styles. Transformational leadership is defined as creating a heightened 
awareness of the key issues impacting on employee development and
<<<PAGE=163>>>
- 141 -  
influencing achievement, growth and development. Transformational 
leadership stimulates interest among employees to view their work from a 
new perspective, to generate an awareness of the vision and mission of a 
department, to develop employees to achieve their potential and to 
motivate employees to transcend their self -interest so as to benefit a 
department as a whole (Coad & Berry 1998, p.4).  
 
Managers provide employees with personal attention through 
individualised consideration. A trust relationship is built focusing on 
employee needs.  The manager provides challenging work assignments to 
boost the confidence and skills of employees. Intellec tual stimulation 
supposes that managers will encourage their employees to use their 
imagination and to re- think the ways of doing things.  The manager 
generates the flow of ideas, questions assumptions and encourages 
employees to come up with their own str uctures and solutions to problems 
(Coad & Berry 1998, p.4).    
 
The final management function involves taking control of activities in an 
organisation to promote learning. 
 
3.5.3.4     Control 
 
Managers are also required to control systems and activities in the 
organisation to promote learning. 
 
Control is implemented to ensure that departmental activities are 
implemented according to a pre- determined standard. Plunkett and Attner 
(1989, p.359) emphasise that control is the systematic effort of identifying 
performance standards and comparing the actual performance with the 
planned performance goals and objectives.  Control intends to ensure
<<<PAGE=164>>>
- 142 -  
optimal utilisation of resources.  The main aim of control is to ensure that 
departmental effectiveness and efficiency are promoted. 
 
The factors that will have an impact on the behaviour of employees are 
experiences, environmental influences, such as the value of the 
department, and the perception regarding the availability of rewards for 
good performance.  In addition to these f actors, specific aspects such as 
the skills of employees and the incentives offered by the department to 
enforce compliance will encourage employees to perform (Plunkett & 
Attner 1989, p.297). 
 
Stahl (1983, p.246) states that motivation should be used to promote the 
establishment and implementation of specific new processes, such as the 
concept of a learning organisation. The motivation should be based on 
participative management, sharing decisions, keeping communication 
channels open and fluid, and encoura ging suggestions on how 
performance could be enhanced. 
 
With regard to the learning organisation, control will manifest itself in the 
ability of the manager to manage individual employee performance 
through a system of performance management and development (as was 
discussed in the previous chapter). The ability to offer rewards and 
incentives for learning will also enable the attainment of the learning 
organisation.  The performance measurement tool should encourage the 
investment in learning by identifying appropriate measures and indicators 
of performance. Processes and systems that recognise the acquisition of 
new skills should be in place in order to facilitate individual effort, team 
accomplishments and continued personal development (Farago & Skyrme 
1995, p.3).
<<<PAGE=165>>>
- 143 -  
The implementation of the management function could be enhanced by 
using specific management tools and techniques available to ensure 
compliance with a new process or in this case, a new approach to human 
resource training and development. 
 
 
3.5.4 Tools and techniques to enhance the learning organisation 
 
Tools and techniques used for enhancing learning in an organisation 
include the following: learning creativity skills, communication, coaching 
and mentoring. 
 
Popper and Lipshitz e (2000, p.12)  maintain that effective learning is 
enhanced through an investment of time and money in the training 
process and by creating an environment that would protect transparency 
of performance. The manager should devote his or her time in terms of 
participating and therefore, re-inforcing the learning experience.  Ensuring 
that the learning experience is evaluated is another way of ensuring that 
the learning environment is created. Specific tools and techniques that 
could be utilised by managers to ensure compli ance with the concept of a 
learning organisation include fostering learning and creativity skills, 
enforcing effective and efficient communication and providing a mentoring 
programme to re-inforce the learning experience. 
 
3.5.4.1 Listening and creativity skills 
 
Listening skills are not natural skills and different styles of listening can be 
identified. Puth (2002, p.51) categorises listeners as interpretative, 
supportive, probing, understanding and empathetic. Interpretative listening 
is defined as being judgment al in the sense that the receiver of the
<<<PAGE=166>>>
- 144 -  
communication tells the sender what the problem with the communication 
is, but not what he or she should do about it.   
 
A supportive listener wants to merely reassure the sender that the 
message was understood in order to avoid any conflict or problems. The 
probing listener will require further information until his or her needs are 
satisfied in terms of the original message. Understanding listening implies 
that the receiver will paraphrase the message to ensure that the message 
was communicated effectively and the emphatic listener will encourage an 
atmosphere for the sender to express him or herself in order to solve any 
problems with the communication. 
 
Puth (2002, p.51) identified specific barriers to listening i ncluding that 
listeners have preconceived ideas, they think they might know more than 
the speaker, they might worry about something else, they might be tired or 
uncomfortable or they might be afraid of the speaker, and  thus, refrain 
from commenting on the communication.  The ability to resist distractions , 
learn to concentrate as well as the ability to be a critical listener and 
making sure that a person understands the message, are all guidelines for 
improving listening skills (Puth 2002, p.55). 
 
The rewards of effective listening are that employees will be able to add to 
their knowledge, they will encourage others to be more open in their 
communication thereby improving interpersonal relationships, 
misunderstanding will be eliminated and possible problems  could be 
detected early (Puth 2002, p.55).  Thus, creating a conducive environment 
for the implementation of a learning organisation can be facilitated through 
open and honest communication.  Learning and creativity skills can be 
clarified through seeking  information, brainstorming, associating ideas, 
deciding on courses of action, observing outcomes and reframing new 
knowledge into mental models (Farago & Skyrme 1995, p.3).
<<<PAGE=167>>>
- 145 -  
 
Innovation is a cornerstone for continuous improvement. Unfortunately, 
managers are not always equipped to deal with innovation especially 
where the organisational structure is bureaucratic.  Regarding any new 
idea with suspicion, just because it is new and a subordinate suggested it, 
and insisting that people need managerial approval before acting on new 
ideas could stifle innovation. Critten (1993 , p.218) states that employees 
should not be asked to challenge or criticise each other’s suggestions and 
management should not just offer criticism freely, without counteracting it 
with praise. Treating problems as failures, controlling everything carefully 
and assuming that just because a manager is placed in a senior 
management position, he or she would automatically know everything, will 
hinder innovation and creativity in a department. 
 
From the above, it could be concluded that effective listening and 
creativity skills should be taught to managers who would assume 
leadership positions in the creation and management of a learning 
organisation. Listening is the ability to understand the feedback on original 
communication, and without effective listening skills, managers will not be 
able to implement performance management systems or be able to 
determine whether departmental training priorities are aligned with 
individual training needs. The ability to promote innovation is an important 
principle in the implementation of a learning organisation. Managers 
should be aware of behaviour and perceptions that could hinder the 
creative learning environment and should always strive towards creating 
an enabling training and development framework for departmental 
effectiveness and efficiency.
<<<PAGE=168>>>
- 146 -  
3.5.4.2 Communication 
 
Effective communication should never be taken for granted and managers 
should never assume that they are good communicators. Messages can 
very easily become obscured in the implementation of new processes, or 
in this case, a new approach to departmental training and development. 
The ability to communicate the intentions of senior management becomes 
imperative to the successful implementation of t he approach. Bendix 
(1996, p.328) identifies specific physical barriers such as temperature, 
noise, distance and methods of communication as hindering the 
successful transfer of understanding. Additional barriers to effective 
communication, such as languag e, poor listening habits, differences in 
perceptions, lack of honestly and trust, were stipulated by Robbins (1995, 
p.358). 
 
Communication is the process of creating understanding and should be 
based on the principles of observing and listening.  Communica tion, 
according to Farago & Skyrme (1995, p.3), should be encouraged 
especially across departmental boundaries ensuring that all employees 
have equal access to pertinent information regarding, for instance, human 
resource development and training initiatives. 
 
Rainey and Watson (1996, p.768) identified specific strategies to enforce 
effective communication.  Firstly, managers should develop a vision for 
the desired future by examining past experiences, the present situation 
and the future goals.  All inform ation should be disseminated and the 
vision communicated to all employees.  Secondly, communication of the 
vision should lead to the creation of meaning and trust among all 
employees. Thirdly, management should choose the best course of action 
so as to ins till trust, identity and integrity, by being consistent in the 
application of the communication. Fourthly, the manager should always
<<<PAGE=169>>>
- 147 -  
keep his or her own skills and weaknesses in mind and strive to overcome 
his or her limitations by using employees that wil l compensate for 
managerial weaknesses.   
 
Improving relational communication increases job satisfaction and worker 
involvement and could also contribute to higher productivity even though 
the link between communication and productivity has not been 
conclusively proven. The fact does remain that the perceived openness in 
communication develops good interpersonal working conditions and 
improves overall job performance.  A learning organisation is built on the 
premise that employees are able to work in teams,  effectively and 
efficiently, to further departmental goals. Thus, effective group 
communication and group cohesion would have an impact on the ability of 
a department to transform itself into a learning organisation. 
 
Effective alignment of training and development of priorities between 
individual employees, the group and the department require departmental 
change on three levels. First, cultural change involves the changing of the 
organisation’s basic assumptions, values, beliefs and ideologies that 
define its view of itself and the environment within which it operates. 
Second, structural change entails changing the grouping of positions and 
departments within the organisation and third, behavioural change 
involves changing the behaviour, attitude and perc eptions among 
individuals and work groups (Sadri & Tran 2002 p.3). 
 
From the above, it could be concluded that communication is an important 
ingredient for effective and efficient training and development. 
Communication should, however, reflect the alignment of individual 
training priorities with that of the group and thus with the department as 
well. Communication is a process that, when implemented effectively and 
efficiently, should provide employees with the opportunity to participate i n
<<<PAGE=170>>>
- 148 -  
training evaluation and, thus  influence decisions regarding department 
training priorities.  Having established how communication can enhance 
learning in an organisation, it  is important to consider  how coaching and 
mentoring contribute to an affective learning organisation.  
 
Before discussing how coaching and mentoring enhance learning in an 
organisation, it is necessary to clarify the difference between the two 
terms. Berry (2003, p.50) states that there is often much confusion as to 
whether coaching and mentoring are synonymous or whether coaching is 
one of the activities of mentoring.   
 
Parsloe and Wray (2000 , p.1) as cited By Berry (2003, p.50) argue that 
coaching and mentoring are very similar activities  the only real difference 
being that the coach focuses on bui lding the coachee’s ability to 
accomplish specific tasks, whereas the mentor has a wider perspective. 
They see the mentor as having a longer-term relationship with the mentee, 
or as a cousellor on a broader range of issues, at any given time. 
 
3.5.4.3 Coaching 
 
Wilson (2005, p.511) states that coaching is primarily about performance 
and the development of specific skills. Coaching is a person to person 
approach used by organisations to develop individual skills, knowledge 
and attitudes. Coaching is most effective if it takes place informally as part 
of the normal process of management or team leadership. This type of 
coaching consists of: 
 
 Helping people to become aware of how well they are doing and 
what they  need to learn; 
 Contolled delegation; 
 Using whatever situations arise as learning opportunities; and
<<<PAGE=171>>>
- 149 -  
 Providing guidance on how to carry out specific tasks as necessary, 
but always on the basis of helping individuals t o learn rather than 
force-feeding them with instructions on what to do and how to do it  
(Armstrong 2005, p.898).    
 
In a learning organisation, coaching can be used to assist senior 
management, someone outside the organisation who helps managers 
think through situation at work. In a learning organisation, line managers 
also take the respons ibility to coach their subordinates. Some managers 
find coaching to be an easy task, while other need training and support to 
effectively coach their employees. Through coaching the individual skills 
are enhanced and the problem -solving techniques are enha nced resulting 
in a holistic growth and development of the individual and that of the 
organisation (Wilson 2005, p.511).  
 
Coaching and mentoring go together, therefore after coaching employees 
have to be taken through a mentoring process. 
 
3.5.4.4    Mentoring 
 
Berry (2003, p.81)  points out that mentoring is concerned about knowing 
the most effective way of assisting newcomers in the organisational 
culture.  
 
Mentoring entails establishing a relationship between a senior and junior 
employee with a view to  increase and promot e communication between 
them.  All three levels of change (cultural, structural and behavioural) have 
to be in place before mentoring can be successful as a strategy to 
facilitate diversity management Berry (2003, p.83 ).  For example, 
management must publicly announce and support the mentoring 
programme (cultural level) proceeding by ensuring that enough
<<<PAGE=172>>>
- 150 -  
experienced employees are on board to serve as mentors, especially 
during times of organisational restructuring (structural level). The mentor 
must be willing to share his/her experiences and wisdom with younger 
employees and in turn, the younger employees must not be too scared to 
ask questions (behavioural level). 
 
Mentors play a developmental as well as psychosocial role.  The 
developmental rol e entails being a coach, sponsoring advancement, 
providing challenging assignments and fostering a positive visibility in the 
work environment. The psychosocial role comprises offering personal 
support, friendship, acceptance, counseling and being a role m odel (Berry 
2003, p.84). 
 
All activities characterising mentoring are interpersonal in nature and are 
built on and extend to reciprocal and open communication between 
mentor and employee.  The advantages of mentoring are that employees 
will be better able to make the transition from being outsiders to being part 
of the group. They will be able to establish interpersonal relationships 
more effortlessly and perhaps most importantly to the department , they 
will be able to discover their role in the department clearly.  Conflicts will 
be solved more easily and the assessment of the relationship between 
self-evaluation, as it relates to one’s own performance, and departmental 
performance evaluation could be more easily established (Sadri & Tran 
2002, p. 4). 
 
However, the departmental culture, structure or behaviour, judgements 
made between mentor and employee who became too involved in each 
other’s personal lives, mentors being tyrannical or selfish and, employees 
only becoming a clone of the mentor and not reali sing their own potential 
and role to be played are examples of barriers to mentoring ( Berry 2003, 
p.86).  The key to overcoming the problems or barriers to mentoring lies in
<<<PAGE=173>>>
- 151 -  
successfully placing the mentor with the correct employee. This goes 
beyond personality and should be based more on trust and respect if the 
relationship is to be enhanced. The mentoring programme  should 
however, follow a structured approach beginning with a training session 
informing both mentor and employee what could be expected from each. 
The most important positive result from mentoring is that group dynamics 
will be enhanced and employees will see an improvement in their work 
performance and their ability to interact with each other (Berry 2003, p.93). 
 
From the above discussion, it  could be concluded that mentoring is a 
technique that could be utilised by managers to ensure that individual 
employees understand the importance of their positions within the group 
structure and thus within the overall departmental structure. Through 
mentoring the process of determining appropriate training and 
development priorities could be facilitated. Thus, mentorship should form 
part of the creation of a learning environment.  
 
Lastly, intensive knowledge for members of the organisation is one 
essential tool for promoting learning in an organisation.   
 
3.5.4.5     The knowledge-intensive organisation: a new challenge  
 
The knowledge- intensive organisation is based on the assumption that 
information, knowledge and learning are central to any organisat ion 
operating in a technologically advanced environment. While Grieves 
(2000, p.8) maintain s that the nature of knowledge can mostly be 
observed in high technology environments, the importance of applying the 
knowledge intensive/learning phenomenon to all organisations should not 
be underestimated, since all organisations, and especially the public 
service, operate in an increasingly complex environment. Knowledge 
management reflects on the primary role of the organisations and thus the
<<<PAGE=174>>>
- 152 -  
essence of the organisational capability that manifests itself in the 
creation, integration and dissemination of knowledge (Beeby & Booth 
2000, p.3).   
 
This process is called knowledge conversion and can be divided into four 
types, including: 
 
 Socialisation referring to the sharing of implicit knowledge 
between individuals either through formal or informal 
communication channels; 
 Externalisation referring to the conversion of implicit knowledge 
into explicit knowledge through a process of codification to 
ensure formal conversion and widespread dissemination; 
 Combination referring to the spread of explicit knowledge to all 
individuals and teams mainly through the use of information 
systems; and 
 Internalisation depicting the reinforcement of explicit knowledge  
(Beeby & Booth 2000, p.3). 
 
The attention focused on the knowledge-intensive organisation stems from 
the fact that the important factor of production in any department is no 
longer capital, but intellectual labour (skilled employees).  Knowledge is 
seen as the primary sourc e of competitive advantage, while employees 
are no longer satisfied with the traditional command and control 
management styles. Knowledge is incorporated into an organisation’s 
knowledge assets comprising its core competencies, technology, value-
adding act ivities, processes, systems, procedures and structures. The 
embodied knowledge constitutes the assets through which an organisation 
can maintain its competitive advantage.
<<<PAGE=175>>>
- 153 -  
The role of departmental learning is to continuously create new knowledge 
that wo uld lead to the more effective and efficient handling of the 
departmental assets.  The matrix structure (organisational structure) is the 
only structure that would accommodate a knowledge- intensive 
organisation. As previously mentioned, Hendricks (2000 ), s tated that 
modern organisations are moving towards a more matrix -organised 
structure, but if the learning processes to facilitate a learning organisation 
have not yet been implemented, the creation of a knowledge- intensive 
organisation would not be possible.   
 
The implementation of the learning organisation will not happen in 
isolation and managers should expect challenges to arise including 
operational pre- occupation, bureaucratic structure and the reluctance to 
train. However, specific steps have been id entified by various author on 
how to implement the learning organisation. Different approached to the 
implementation of the learning organisation were discussed, but since the 
concept of the learning organisa tion is only used, in this thesi s as an 
approach to improving training and development for the organisation, no 
one approach to implementation was proposed. 
 
The key management functions as well as the tools and techniques 
available to managers to facilitate the learning organisation, were 
discussed and the chapter concluded with a new challenge presented to 
the organisation: the knowledge- intensive organisation and what that 
would mean for the organisation.  
 
In the next section, various theoretical training models will be presented to 
highlight the sys tematic approach to training and development in 
organisations.
<<<PAGE=176>>>
- 154 -  
3.6 AN OVERVIEW OF THEORETICAL TRAINING MODELS 
 
Various models will be discussed to demonstrate how best systematic 
training and development can be conducted in an organisation with a view 
to improve performance at individual, team and organisational level. The 
following training models will be analysed  to determine the logical steps to 
be taken by the trainer not only for ensuring that training and development 
initiatives are delivered, but also to determine the impact of such training 
initiatives on performance. Even though there are similarities between 
these training models, the main focus of this section is to critically assess 
each model with the aim of developing a comprehensive trainin g and 
development model. 
 
The decision to apply a systematic approach in training and development 
is made when the trainer is convinced that training and development are 
initiatives aimed at overcoming current and anticipated shortfalls in 
performance.   
 
Seven training models will be discussed. The reason for specifically 
selecting these training models is to indicate when and how training and 
development may be evaluated. 
 
Noe (2000, p.21) argues that the validity of traditional models of 
management of training has become questionable. In order to understand 
the critical steps involved in an effective training and development 
process, it is important to examine various training models to determine 
whether evaluation is conducted by that process.  
 
According to Noe (2000, p.21), the majority of training models are 
systematic, in that they describe the training and development undertaken 
as a logical series of steps. In practice, the number and description of
<<<PAGE=177>>>
- 155 -  
these steps vary. However, these models cover the following aspects: 
 
 Establish  terms of reference; 
 Investigate the performance problem; 
   Analyse  knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSA);  
 Analyse the target group; 
 Training needs and content analysis; 
 Develop criterion measures; 
 Prepare  training objectives; 
 Consider  the  principles of learning and motivation; 
 Consider and select training methods; 
 Design and pilot training; 
 Delivery of training and development; 
 Conduct internal validation; 
 Conduct  training (transfer of learning); and  
 Evaluation of training and development (Noe 2000, p.21).  
 
 
3.6.1     A Systematic Training Model  
 
This model is based on the sequence at which trainers should approach 
training and development initiatives. The systematic training model  
enables the trainer to check at ever y step what is it that they have to do 
and how to do it.  
  
The systematic model is based on the role of training in an organisation. 
The model emphasises that training and development should be 
undertaken on a planned basis as a result of a logical series  of steps 
(refer to f igure 3.1).  However in practice, the description of these steps 
tends to vary, but generally they would cover the following:
<<<PAGE=178>>>
- 156 -  
 Development of a training policy; 
 Identification of training needs; 
 Development of training objectives and plans; 
 Implementation of planned training; and 
 Validation, evaluation and review of training. 
 
According to Sloman (1999, p.47) and Noe (2000, p.22), a systematic 
model has four identifying characteristics: 
 
 Training can be perceived as a set of sequential steps;  
 Identification of training needs can be introduced into the training 
cycle at the appropriate stage; 
 The systematic model centres the attention on the need to act in a 
structured and disciplined way; and 
 The models stress the place for effective ev aluation of training and 
development at an activity point and how evaluation affects the 
training cycle.  
 
Sloman (1999, p.47) states that a systematic model has two important 
characteristics. Firstly, training can be perceived as a set of sequential 
steps; secondly, the identification of training needs can be introduced into 
the training cycle at the appropriate stage. These are discovered when 
carrying out individual or group training requirements, or by interpreting 
overall objectives set by the organisation or by a combination of the two.
<<<PAGE=179>>>

Figure 3.1:   A Systematic Model 
Source:  Sloman (1999, p.47). 
 
 
Sloman (1999, p.47) however, notes that the model above (refer to figure 
3.1) has been widely criticised by many including Taylor (1976, p.13) for 
the reason that the model is firmly based on a strategic management 
paradigm. Critics of the model also observe that the three basic 
assumptions that underlie this model: In this model, training is seen as an 
investment in the organisation; a mechanism is r equired for the allocation 
of resources between competition investment opportunities; and there is a 
degree of commonality between the interests of  individuals’ interests and 
those of the organisation.
<<<PAGE=180>>>
- 158 -  
It can be concluded that the systematic model offer s the basic steps to be 
followed by the trainer in ensuring that the training and development 
initiative produces the anticipated change.  
 
3.6.2 The transitional model  
 
The transitional model is a training model which demonstrates various 
steps in the organisational strategic learning process. 
 
This is a revised traditional model which Taylor (1976, p.13) describes as 
a double- loop corporate strategy for learning. Sloman (1999, p.47) adds 
that the transitional model retains the attractiveness of the systematic 
model as a route map (see figure 3.2). It also embeds training strategy in 
a wider corporate context and recognises organisational strategic 
development. However, the following weaknesses have been identified.  
 
The Taylor (1976, p.123) model offers two loops which differ in quality. 
The inner systematic training loop is robust and clear, while the outer loop 
of strategy and learning varies in its visibility and exploration.  
 
Secondly, Taylor’s model  (1976, p.13) does not offer any practical 
guidance for t raining managers on how best they should carry  out all the 
stages in the training and development process.  The systematic training 
model re mains the most simplified model  that can be easily followed by 
trainers and evaluators alike. Regardless of its crit icisms, the systematic 
model is the commonly used model in training. The transitional model will 
be presented in the next section.

Source: Sloman (1999, p.49) 
 
Noe (2000, p.23) concurs with Sloman (1999, p.49) in concluding that a 
systematic model may be improved by embedding the map of the wider 
corporate strategy into the model. On the other hand Sloman (1999, p.49) 
maintains that the models brings a different dimission that over and above 
the wider corporate strategy, organisations should also take into 
consideration their training objectives, plans, how they implement such 
plans and most importantly the most effective way of evaluating traini ng 
and development initiatives (refer to Figure 3.2 above).   
 
It can be concluded unlike the systematic model, the transitional model 
over and above the normal training sequence, takes into consideration the 
strategic aspects of learning in the organisati on. In the next section the 
national training award model will be presented.

3.6.3 The national training award model 
 
The national training award model is rarely used as compared to the 
systematic and transitional models : However, it offers a much deeper 
understanding of what the trainer must consider in the training process. 
 
Sloman (1999, p.49) states that the national training award model  (refer 
figure 3.3)  recognises the need to l ink training objectives with  
organisational requirements. This model also reveals how training has 
contributed significantly to improved organisational performance.

It can be concluded that unlike the systematic and transitional models, the 
national training award model probes the many questions which guide the 
trainer on how best they should approach training.

3.6.4 Goldstein’s instructional systems model 
 
The Goldstein’s instructional systems model focuses on the thre e basic 
training phases which includes: needs analysis, training and delivery and 
the evaluation phase.  The model highlights the following phases: 
 
Figure 3.4:  Goldstein’s Instructional System Model

It can be concluded that the model focuses on three primary phases with

each phase dealing with specific issues in the training process. Nadler’s 
critical event model will be presented in the next section.  
 
 Needs assessment phase 
 
The first phase in this model is the needs assessment phase.  
Goldstein and Ford (2001 , p.25) state that this phase of the instructional 
process provides the information necessary to design the entire 
programme. The authors (1994, p.67) note that many programmes  are 
ineffective because trainers are more interested in conducting the training 
programme than assessing the needs of the organi sation. Goldstein and 
Ford (2001, p.41) and Berry (1995, p.11) provide the guidelines for a 
needs assessment phase and these include amongst others: 
 
 Organisational analysis-that encompasses the examination of 
short-term and long -term goals for the organisation as well as 
trends likely to affect these goals; 
 
 Task and knowledge, skill and ability analysis which involves a 
careful analys is of the job to be performed by the trainees upon 
completion of the training programme. During this analysis both the 
job description and the task specification are used; and 
 
 Person analysis considers how well a particular employee is 
carrying out tasks which constitute he/her job. 
 
The information obtained from this phase enables the trainers to describe 
objectives to be achieved by the trainee on completing the training 
programme. 
 
Training and development phase
<<<PAGE=185>>>
- 163 -  
 
Goldstein and Ford (2001, p.89) state th at this phase involves designing 
the environment to achieve the objectives, using a blend of learning 
principles and media based on the tasks that the trainee is eventually 
expected to perform. 
 
The evaluation phase 
 
Goldstein and Ford (200 1, p.30) maintai n that the evaluation process 
centres around two procedures  establishing measures of success(criteria) 
and using experimental and non- experimental designs to determine 
changes that have occurred during training and the transfer process.  
 
From the model (refer to figure 3.5) it can be seen that there is a need for 
criteria be established for evaluating trainees both on completion of the 
programme and on -the-job. Berry (1995, p.12) and Goldstein and Ford 
(2001, p.30) identify the following goals ; training, intra-organisational and 
inter-organisational validity. 
 
Training validity: whether trainees learn during training; 
Transfer validity: whether what has been learned in training transfers as 
enhanced performance in the organisation. 
Intra-organisational vali dity is concerned with determining whether the 
performance for a new group of trainees in the same organisation that 
developed the training programme  is consistent with the performance of 
the original training group. 
 
Inter-organisational validity -determining whether a training programme  
validated in one organisation can be used successfully in another 
organisation.
<<<PAGE=186>>>
- 164 -  
Goldstein and Ford (2001, p.31) suggest that a training programme should 
be a closed- loop system in which an evaluation provides for continual  
modification of the programme as an open -loop system. This does not 
have any feedback or is not responsive to such information for two 
reasons, firstly to develop a programme which achieves their objectives 
and secondly to make programme modifications where necessary.   
 
A simple instructional system model was presented by Goldstein and Ford 
(2001, p.24). They view all the components of this model as important to 
any instructional system, although they maintain that the degree of 
emphasis would change according to a particular programme.  
 
Goldstein and Ford (2001, p.24) conclude by stating that the trainer should 
take into consideration the three phases in the instructional system model 
to ensure that training achieves its objectives. 
 
3.6.5 Nadler’s critical events model 
 
This model unlike the previous models is more comprehensive and brings 
the issue of job performance into the training process. Training should not 
be done but rather it should be conducted to correct a particular 
performance deficiency. I t is therefore meaningful for the trainer take into 
consideration the current employee’s performance and what best training 
option is to be taken. 
 
According to Nadler (1995, p.12), this model recognises the importance of 
identifying organisational needs and is seen as critical to the entire 
process. The critical events model comprises the following critical stages 
in a training process: identification of the needs of an organisation; 
specifying job performance; identifying learners’ needs; determining 
objectives; building a curriculum; selecting instructional strategies;
<<<PAGE=187>>>
- 165 -  
obtaining instructional resources; conducting training and the evaluation of 
training (refer to figure 3.5). 
 
Organisational needs assessment 
 
Nadler (199 5, p.12) states that it is important for the organisation to 
determine its training needs before anything else in the training process. 
The first step in the training process is coming up with proper 
organisational needs analysis will assist the trainer in designing and 
developing a relevant and effective training and development initiative that 
will go a long way in addressing organisational performance problems.

<<<PAGE=188>>>
- 166 -  
Specify job performance 
 
The second step is to specify employee’s job performance.  Employees 
have to understand what their jobs entail for them to be developed in their 
area of speciality. 
 
Nadler (1985, p.13) argues that often employee’s jobs are not specified 
and as a result it  becomes difficult for the trainer to tell whether the 
employee performance problem is skill, knowledge or behaviour related. 
Without specifying employee job performance it becomes impossible for 
the trainer to plan, design, deliver, and evaluate the neces sary training 
initiative aimed at improving the individual’s performance. Having specified 
job performance, the trainer can now identify the learner’s  needs in 
relation the organisational needs. 
 
Identify learner’s training needs 
 
Nadler (1985, p.13) believes  that the identification of learners needs must 
be in line with the overall organisational needs. There should be a 
correlation between the individual’s needs and those of the organisation. 
The primary purpose of training in any case is to improve performance 
and therefore,  the link between individual training and organisational 
performance improvement must be borne in mind. Individual training 
should impact directly or indirectly  on the overall performance of the 
organisation and therefore,  addressing t he learner’s needs will 
automatically have a bearing on the type of training required. Having 
identified the learner ’s training needs, the nex t stage is to determine 
training objectives.  
 
Determine objectives
<<<PAGE=189>>>
- 167 -  
Nadler (1985, p.14) states that training objectives identify what training 
and development initiatives must deliver  to address a performance 
deficiency. It is therefore important , for the training objectives to be clear 
so that the trainer may know what to expect from training. The next stage 
after determining objectives is to build the curriculum. 
 
Build the curriculum 
 
The next stage according to the Nadler’s critical event model is building 
the curriculum.  
 
According to Nadler (1985, p.14), having determined  training objectives, 
the next stage is for the trainer to develop the curriculum in line with the 
learner’s needs. The curriculum should focus on addressing performance 
issues, an ultimate aim of the training initiative. The next stage involves 
the selection of the strategy. 
 
Select of instructional strategy 
 
According to Nadler (1985, p.15), the selection of instructional strategy is 
about how training will be delivered. Trainers must ensure that the 
selected instructional strategy is suitable for all trainees for them to benefit 
from the programme. Nadler (1985, p.15) reiterates that even if when 
curriculum is well built, it is important that the method used enhances the 
learner’s skill, knowledge, attitude and behaviour. It is imperative that the 
strategy be understood by all for it to be effe ctive. For training initiatives to 
take place, resources must be made available. The next stage is obtaining 
instructional resources. 
 
Obtain instructional resources
<<<PAGE=190>>>
- 168 -  
Nadler (1985, p.16) states that for any training to take place managers 
should  show their commitment by providing the training department with 
instructional resources and other training related assistance for that 
matter. After obtaining the resources training can be conducted. 
 
Conduct training 
 
The next stage after acquiring  the instructional resources is for the trainer 
to conduct training. The trainer should be mindful of the rates at which 
learners learn and he or she must make the necessary provision to cater 
for the various learning needs of learners. The final stage in the Nadl er’s 
critical event model is evaluating the training and development initiative. 
 
Evaluate training  
 
This is the most crucial stage in a training process. Evaluating training 
provides important information to all stakeholders about the training 
programme. Nadler  (1985, p.18) recommends that organisation s must 
have qualified training evaluators in order to carry  out the evaluation 
process. He argues that more often than not , trainers are given the 
responsibility of evaluating training and development initiatives w ithout the 
necessary training. Nadler(1985, p.18) further observes that information 
on a given programme will assist both the trainees, trainers, training 
departments, directors and management in determining the value of 
training and the information may be used for further training programmes. 
 
It can be concluded that the Nadler’s critical events model provides 
important organisational issues to be taken into consideration for training 
to be effective. These include the assessment of learner’s needs and 
those of the organisation, provision of instructional resources, and 
selection of instructional strategy.
<<<PAGE=191>>>

Having critically analysed four models which each having a slightly 
different approach to the training process it is meaningful to make a 
comparison of the singer’s four phase model to the others. 
 
3.6.7 Singer’s four-phase model 
 
One of the reasons why the researcher chose the Singer’s four phase 
model is because the model clearly indicates when and how training 
should be evaluated, the stage that forms the basis of this research.   
 
Phillips (1991, p.174) states that this model is similar to the Goldstein 
model but he makes use of four clearly defined phases: viz, assessing 
training needs, designing the training programme, choosing the training 
method; and evaluating training results  
 
A brief description of the model is provided below. 
 
Assessing training needs 
 
Singer (1990, p.174) explains that the analysis process should be an 
ongoing process and should interface with other organisational areas 
using organisation, task and person analysis. 
 
Design training programme 
 
During this phase the trainer must determine the most appropriate formats 
as well as select the trainees and decide on the methods to be used for 
the final programme evaluation. It is i mportant for the trainer to be 
knowledgeable on learning principles to assists him to effectively design 
the training programme.
<<<PAGE=192>>>
- 170 -  
 
Choose Training Methods 
 
The trainers should decide on the most appropriate location for the 
training to be conducted i.e. whether the trainees are taught relevant 
knowledge, skills and abilities in their actual workplace (on-the-job), or at a 
location other than the real job site (off -the-job). The trainer should take   
cognizance of both the advantages and disadvantages of each  approach 
(Singer 1990, p.179). 
 
 
Evaluate training results 
 
Singer (1990, p.193) argues that understanding the learning principles and  
designing appropriate training programmes is only of value when trainees 
acquire knowledge, skills and abilities which they can pass on to their 
actual jobs. Singer further states that after the training has been 
conducted, trainers should expend a significant effort determining how 
effectively the training goals were met. He argues that those programmes 
which fail to reac h their goals should be eliminated and those which are a 
success should be retained. 
 
Singer (1990, p.193) recommends  that to simplify the evaluation process, 
the evaluation programme should be divided into to four logical steps: 
 
 Reaction-establishing the degree to which the trainees enjoyed the 
programme through the use of reaction forms; 
 Learning-establishing whether the training material which has been 
taught, has been learned. Appropriate measures should be 
developed to measure the amount of learning t hat has taken place 
during training;
<<<PAGE=193>>>
- 171 -  
 Behaviour-establishing whether what has been learnt in the training 
process has been transferred into practice. Before and after 
measure should be used to evaluate behavior; and 
 Results-establishing the overall impact t hat training has had on the 
organisation.  
  
Singer (1990, p.195) is of the belief that organisations which conduct 
reasonably comprehensive training evaluation rarely progress beyond the 
learning stage. He further argues that failure to evaluate behaviour  and 
results may leave significant doubt as to whether the training programme  
achieved its intended goals of facilitating transfer of the training to the 
work situation,  with a positive contribution to the functioning of the 
organisation. 
 
It is clear that Singer views the evaluation the same way as training 
practitioners, that being to establish through the evaluation process the 
training programme’s effectiveness.

resources development model.

Development    Model

<<<PAGE=196>>>
- 174 -  
Below is brief description of the various activities related to each step: 
 
 Step 1: Conduct a needs analysis and development  
 
The first part of this step involves the conducting of a needs analysis in 
order to determine specific deficiencies in performance or lack of 
information necessary for the job. Phillips (1991, p.64) states that a needs 
analysis is conducted by interviews with potential trainees or their 
superiors or by administering attitude surveys and questionnaires. 
 
The needs analys is should reveal information to develop tentative 
programme objectives which will be finalised in step six. 
 
Step 2: Identify the purpose of evaluation 
 
Phillips (1991) as cited by Berry (1995, p.32), maintains that before the 
trainer commences with any pr ogramme development he should 
determine the purpose of evaluation in order to establish what basel ine 
data should be collected and the evaluation of methods to be used. 
 
Step 3: Establish baseline data 
 
Before any evaluative comparisons can be made, data needs to be 
collected prior to the programme and after its comparison. By collecting 
data such as the number of grievances in the past six months, the trainer 
is able to answer basic questions on what to evaluate. Phillips (1991, 
p.66), maintains that by es tablishing the baseline data after the needs 
analysis, the trainer is able to focus more clearly on what change the 
programme should bring about.
<<<PAGE=197>>>
- 175 -  
Step 4: Select evaluation method/ design  
 
Phillips (1991, p.67) is of the opinion that this step of selecti ng the 
evaluation method and design should precede the step of finalising of 
programme objectives as the selection of evaluation methods may 
influence the objectives established for the programme . Phillips (1991, 
p.67) states that “it is useless to set objectives in an area for which there is 
no way of gathering information -  if methods of gathering information are 
finalised first, then the objectives are tailored to those methods”.   
 
Step 5: Determine evaluation strategy 
 
According to Phillips (1991, p.68), in this step, answers must be provided 
for the following questions who, where, and when as they relate to the 
evaluation. Some of the questions to be answered include the following: 
 
 Who will conduct the evaluation? 
 Who will analyse the data? 
 Where will  evaluations occur? in the training room, on the 
job or a combination of both?  
 When will evaluation be conducted? 
During the course (reaction and learning) 
At the end of the course (reaction and learning) 
On the job (behaviour change) 
At a specific follow -up date (results achieved by the 
individual or group). 
 
Step 6: Finalise programme objectives  
 
Phillips (1991, p.68) states that it is important for the trainer to finalise the 
programme objectives before getting into the next stage of the evaluation
<<<PAGE=198>>>
- 176 -  
process. Phillips argues that failure on the part of the trainer to observe 
this step may lead to an inappropriate selection of the evaluation method 
and subsequently the evaluation strategy. 
 
Step 7: Estimate programme costs/benefits 
 
Phillips (1991, p.70) states that this step should be undertaken before any 
programme development work commences, in order to determine whether 
or not to proceed with the programme.  
 
Berry (1995, p. 33) states that a comparison between the cost for 
developing and conducting a t raining programme against the potential 
benefits to be derived from this particular programme have to be made to 
determine cost/benefits. The anticipated return on investment can then be 
calculated. 
 
Once this step is undertaken, the trainer can then move to the next step of 
preparing and presenting a proposal to management regarding the 
implementation of the programme. 
 
Step 8: Prepare and present proposal 
 
The proposal presented to management should be presented in a formal 
and professional manner and sho uld focus on the information collected 
(Phillips 1991, p.71).  Phillips further provides a useful action checklist that 
can be used when preparing a proposal for a significant training project. 
Some of the items which he includes in the checklist are the following: 
 Determine the best timing to present the proposal after those 
concerned have concurred with the proposal; 
 Understand the numbers in the financial justification section of the 
proposal;
<<<PAGE=199>>>
- 177 -  
 Present the proposed implementation schedule for the programm e 
with estimated completion dates; and  
 Ask for approval to proceed with the programme.  
 
Step 9: Design the evaluation instruments 
 
In this step the trainer will design or select, specific instrument to be used 
in the evaluation process. Phillips (1991, p.72) proposes that the 
instruments should be statistically reliable and easy to use and should be 
designed before the programme  is developed, since some additional 
information might be uncovered that may alter the course development 
and course content. 
 
Step 10: Determine and develop programme content 
 
Phillips (1991, p.72) recommends that the programme content be 
determined by subject matter experts who decide what trainees need to 
know (principles, facts and skills) to meet programme objectives or  the 
trainer may rely on previous or similar programmes  conducted with other 
groups in his own and other organisations. 
 
Phillips (1991, p.72) believes that if the training programme  is result -
oriented, material that is “nice to know”, but not related to programme  
objectives, should be omitted. By systematically completing the previous 
step in the model, the trainer will be able to focus on those areas that will 
produce the desired results. 
 
Step 11: Design or select Training and Development Methods 
 
Phillips (1991, p.72) suggests that the choice of the appropriate method 
will depend on the following factors:
<<<PAGE=200>>>
- 178 -  
 
 Budget constraints; 
 Resources available; 
 Programme objectives; 
 Time frame; 
 Ability of participants; 
 Ability of programme developers; 
 Ability of instructors; and 
 Location of training. 
 
Berry (1995, p.35) states that the trainer needs to design or select the 
most appropriate methods for presenting the programme. Some examples 
of the methods that can be used are the following: 
 
Presentation-discussion (including lectures and listening and questioning) 
 Case studies; 
 Role plays; and  
 Programmed instruction. 
 
Step 12: Test programme and make revision 
 
Phillips (1991, p.74) recommends that the trainer conducts a pilot test of 
the programme particularly if the programme is to be repeated with many 
participants. This step provides an opportunity for the trainer to test and 
adjust if necessary some of the evaluation methods such as the pre-
programmed evaluations, participants reactions and behaviour 
simulations.  
Phillips (1991, p.74) makes the important point that  a well -planned pilot 
programme can take months of analysis, interviews and programme  
development payoff and by taking the appropriate steps before, during 
and after the pilot, the odds can be turned in favour of a flawless, fail –safe
<<<PAGE=201>>>
- 179 -  
pilot programme, while at the same time finding an opportunity to analyse 
the strengths and weaknesses of the programme.   
 
Step 13: Implement or conduct the programme 
 
Phillips (1991, p.74) believes that the trainer should make the trainees 
aware of what results are expected , as communicati ng expectations to 
them can influence the results achieved. 
 
Step 14: Collect data at a proper stage 
 
Phillips (1991. p.75) emphasises the importance of establishing a 
schedule for collecting data for evaluation purposes at the right time and 
adhering to the schedule to ensure that evaluation data are collected at 
the proper time intervals. 
 
Step 15: Analyse and interpret data 
 
This step involves the analysis of data and the interpretation of those data. 
Phillips (1991, p.75) states that during this step, responses to 
questionnaires should be tabulated and prepared for the presentation and 
the variances should be analysed,  making use of three general groups of 
the statistical analysis that are useful  for analysing evaluation data viz: 
measures of central tendency;  measures of dispersion; and  measures of 
association.     
 
Step 16: Make programme adjustments 
 
Out of the information collected from the anaysis it may be necessary to 
make changes to the programme.  If it is established that the programme  
produced no results , or that certain parts of the programme  were not
<<<PAGE=202>>>
- 180 -  
effective, the programme  may need to be adjusted, cancelled or re-
designed in those areas which according to the evaluation were not 
effective (Phillips 1991, p.76). 
 
Step 17: Calculate return on investment (ROI) 
 
Phillips (1991, p.76) suggests that if the trainer plans an economic 
justification of the programme, he should consider using the following 
basic return on investment (ROI) formula: 
 
Rate of return = Financial value of results
 
          Programme cost 
 
Step 18: Communicate programme results 
 
This step involves the communication of programme results to the 
following stakeholders: 
 The staff of the human r esources department, who may require 
the information to make the necessary improvements to the 
programme; 
 Management, who must be make decision regarding the future 
of the programme; and  
 The participants,who need to know how well they did in the 
programme and see their performance compared to others?. 
 
The last step in the Phillips, result-oriented human resources development 
model, puts more emphasis on evaluating training initiatives than the 
actual training process. Certain features of the ashridge model best 
explains different a pproaches to training , namely: the fragmented, 
formalised and focused approach.
<<<PAGE=203>>>
- 181 -  
These approaches will be presented in more details in the next section.  
 
3.6.8  The Ashridge model 
 
The Ashridge model is concerned with the role of training and 
development. The model highlights the important activities within the 
organisation to be considered at three levels of sophistication: 
 A fragmented approach; 
 A formalised approach; and 
 A focused approach.

THE ROLE OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT  
 
1. The fragmented approach 
 Training is not linked to organisational goals 
 Training is perceived as a luxury or waste of time 
 Approach to training and is non-systematic 
 Training is directive 
 Training is carried out by trainers 
 Training takes place in the training department 
 Emphasis on knowledge-based courses 
 The focus on training (discontinuous process) rather than development 
(continuous process) 
 
2. The formalised approach 
 Training becomes linked to human resources (HR) needs 
 Training becomes systematic by linking it to an appraisal system 
 The emphasis is still on knowledge-based courses but the focus of the courses 
broadens, with greater emphasis on skills- based courses 
 The link which is established between training and HR needs encourages the 
organisation to adopt a more developmental approach  
 Training is carried out by trainers, but the range of skills demands placed on a 
trainer develops with the new breadth of courses offered 
  Line managers become involve in training and development as the appraisers 
 Pre-and post-courses activities attempt to facilitate transfers of off-the-job 
learning 
 Training is carried out off-the-job, but through the career development the value 
of on the-job learning gains formal recognition  
 There is more concern to link a programme of individual needs  
   
3. The focused approach 
 Training and development and continuous learning by individuals is perceived 
as necessary for the organisational survival in a rapidly changing business 
Environment 
 Training is regarded as a competition weapon 
 
 Learning is linked to organisational strategy and individual goals 
  The emphasis is on-the-job development so that learning becomes a totally 
continuous activity  
 Specialists training courses are available across the knowledge /skills/value 
spectrum 
 Self selection for training courses 
 Training is generally a non-directive , unless knowledge-based  
 New forms of training are utilized, e.g. open and distance learning packages, 
self-development programmes,etc 
 More concern to measure effectiveness of raining and development   
 Main responsibility of training lies with line management  
 Trainers adopt a wider role 
 New emphasis on learning as a process 
 Tolerance of some failures as part of the learning process.

Ashridge (1990, p.132) points out that certain features of the model 
describes that as the sophistication of the delivery of training and 
development increases, organsiations adopt a more formalised approach.  
Training and development become more structured and linked into the 
organisational process such as appraisal systems.  
 
Sloman (1999, p.56) states that the full potential of training and 
development is realised in those organisations that are adopting a focused 
approach.  Training and development are then intrinsic to the organisation 
and occur continuously. The emphasis moves away from formal training to 
personal development, driven by both the goals of the organisation and 
the needs of the individual (refer to figure 3.8).  
 
Sloman (1999, p.56) adds that line managers and individuals assume the 
main responsibility for development, while trainers adopt wider roles as 
advisers, facilitators and change agents. According to Sloman (1999, 
p.56), organisations which achieve this level of sophistication (focused 
approach) are described as learning organisations,  a term which will be 
considered in more detail under section 3.6. 
 
From the above it could be concluded that evaluation of training and 
development is eq ually as important as any performance improvement 
strategy which can be used by organisations. Most importantly, training  
and development should part ly address the performance analysis results, 
primarily to inform training managers on the systematic plan, design, and 
presentation and to evaluate the training and development programmes. 
In the majority of these models, emphasis is placed on the systematic 
approach to training and development.   
 
The majority of the eight models discussed in this chapter clearly indicate 
the sequential steps to be followed if training and development are to be
<<<PAGE=206>>>
- 184 -  
effective. Most importantly, these models bring about the issues of training 
as a strategic tool for training managers to enhance employees’ skills, 
knowledge and compet encies. The next section presents a 
comprehensive model for training and development initiatives.  
 
 
3.6.9  A comprehensive training and development model 
 
The researcher is of the conviction that to effectively evaluate training and 
development initiatives, a systematic approach towards training must first  
be adopted. It serves no purpose to evaluate a training programme  which 
is ad-hoc and unplanned, poorly delivered, and has little or no relevance 
for both the individual’s needs and those of the organisa tion. A 
comprehensive training and development model was developed (refer 3.9) 
to provide the necessary guidelines on how trainers and training 
managers should conduct training in the organisation. The model was 
developed from the literature and the eight training models presented in 
section 3.5. T he comprehensive training and development model 
comprises the following steps: 
 
Phase 1 Plan for training 
 
Planning is an important step in a training process and the most 
commonly ignored stage of them all. It is  important for the trainer and 
training manger to plan ahead for the next training programme . The first 
step in the planning process is to collect data about the training, determine 
how this time around training will be delivered, who the beneficiaries, what  
their needs are and how the training department hopes  to achieve their 
goal, which is to conduct a successful training programme (refer to figure 
3.9).

Figure 3.9 A Comprehensive Training and Development Model 
 
Data collection and diagnosis are essential parts of determining the 
necessity for training. Training needs are to be developed from 
organisational, operational and person analysis. 
 
Organisational analysis identifies how successful the organisation has 
been in achieving specified goals. Short -term goals will indicate whether 
needs are reactive or remedial. Long-term goals produce preventative pro-
active or developmental pro-active needs.

At the operational or task level, an analysis will identify the performance or 
skills required to achieve the required organisational goals. A person 
analysis determines the strengths and weaknesses of the current 
workforce. It also identifies performance problems which may have 
occurred as a result of the performance requirements specified in the 
operational analysis.    
 
Phase 2 Identify support for and the constraints against the 
transfer of training 
 
At this stage probable opportunities for successful performance and 
causes of performance problems should be examined. The repertoire of 
managerial and organisation, trainer’s and trainees’ pre-training strategies 
which will enhance training should be identified. Information flow, work 
procedures, equipment, reward systems or workplace learning systems 
which support the desired performance must also be considered. 
 
Phase 3  Consider training as a solution of performance 
problem/opportunities 
 
It is essential to determine whether a job aid could replace some or all of 
the training before taking decisions to proceed with training as a solution 
to a performance problem or opportunity. 
 
Phase 4 Identify resources 
 
Once the decision has been taken to proceed with training, available 
resources must be identified. These considerations must include the 
following: 
 
 The time available to solve the performance deficiency; 
 Budget limitations;
<<<PAGE=209>>>
- 187 -  
 Qualification of trainers; and  
 Facilities, training materials and equipment. 
 
The success or failure of training progra mmes depends on the availability 
of resources which ensure that effective training takes place. If training is 
embarked upon wi thout taking into consideration the availability of 
resources, the consequences in wasted time and money could be 
disastrous for the organisation. 
 
Phase 5 Develop training objectives  
 
Once the training needs have been identified and prioritised, programme  
objectives should be established. These objectives should spell out what 
the organisation or the trainer wants to achieve with the training. These 
training objectives form the basis of training standards and the evaluation 
of training. The objectives should also be specific in terms of terminal 
behaviours trainees should display at the end of the training programme . 
Each objective must describe a specific behavioural action. It must 
indicate the standard of performance required, expressed in terms of 
number, degree and accuracy.  
 
Phase 6 Design and deliver training 
 
The amount of learning which must be absorbed to produce new 
behaviour is used to develop the curriculum. Resources which have been 
identified are allocated and training methods based of specific objectives 
are selected. 
 
Having established the training and development objectives, the trainer 
needs to plan and design the programme. Decisions need to be taken on 
the best approach to be used for presenting the programme . The
<<<PAGE=210>>>
- 188 -  
development of all the knowledge, skills and attitudes cannot be dealt with 
in one training session. The programme  therefore, needs to be divided 
into a number of different modules  or meaningful units which need  not be 
of the same duration, but should form a coherent whole.  
 
When the programme has been planned and designed the trainer is in a 
position to present the programme . The trainer needs to ensu re that the 
right learning climate is created at the beginning of the programme. 
 
Phase 7 Maintain the transfer of training and development 
 
The transfer of training must be ensured through the design and delivery 
of the training programme . The role of the manager, trainer and trainee 
during training , must be determined in order to eliminate barriers and 
encourage support for effective training to take place. 
 
Phase 8  Compare training and development outcomes against  
  criteria 
 
Descriptive and evaluative feedback provides an indication of how 
successful the training has been. The evaluation should be built into the 
phases of the programme  from the initial identification of the training 
needs to the maintenance of the training. Evaluation should not be vie wed 
as an action which must be undertaken by the trainer at the completion of 
the course, but rather viewed in relation to the evaluation of the course 
content prior to presenting the programme, a continual evaluation of the 
presentation and progress of th e programme and the comparison of the 
final results of the programme with a set of criteria. Once the evaluation 
has been conducted,  it is necessary to decide who should be given 
feedback on the evaluation information. This information should not be 
filed away for future use. Continuous improvements also need to be made
<<<PAGE=211>>>
- 189 -  
to the programme , based on the information/data obtained from the 
evaluations. 
  
It can be concluded that for training and development to be effective, the 
organisation should become a learning organisation, whereby learning is 
encouraged by all stake holders from individual employees to 
management. It is therefore imperative, for management to implement and 
proper learning processes in the organisation.  
 
Training and development are strateg ies used by modern organisation s 
aimed at enhancing individual, teams, and organisational performance. 
For training to have an impact on organisational performance, a conducive 
learning environment must prevail. It is not enough for organisations to 
spend millions on training and development initiatives without first creating 
an atmosphere for learning. The organisation must first become a learning 
organisation for it to flourish and benefit immensely from investing i n its 
people.  
 
3.7 CONCLUSION 
 
The main obj ective of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness 
of training and development initiatives in the Botswana public service 
sector. The preliminary step in achieving this objective was to carry out a 
literature review in order to identify critica l organisational factors which 
affect training and development. These factors include the following: 
training culture, leadership, performance management and performance 
appraisal, and the implementation and management of a learning 
organisation which were discussed in section 3.4. Various theoretical 
training models were analysed to determine the systematic approach to 
effective training and development. From the literature and theoretical 
models, a comprehensive training and development model was develope d

as depicted by figure 3.9. 
 
 
In the following chapter, the evaluation process will be considered in terms 
of issues affecting the evaluation process, approaches and measures to 
be used for effectively evaluating training and development. The chapter 
will conclude with evaluating training and development through the 
implementation of a performance management system.

CHAPTER 4 
 
EVALUATING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
From discussion s in chapters two and t hree, it could be concluded that 
effective training and development play a critical role in ensuring that the 
strategic objectives of the organisation are achieved. The main objective 
of this study was to develop a model for the evaluation of training and 
development initiatives to be used by the Botswana public service. This 
objective was pursued by examining the past reform programmes  and by 
undertaking a literature review to identify how training and development 
should be approached, from the training manager, trainer  and trainee’s 
perspectives.  
 
This chapter will cover a comprehensive discussion on the evaluation of 
training and development with a view to establishing the best approach to 
the effective evaluation of training and development. The evaluation 
strategies discussed in this chapter formed the basis for the design of the 
questionnaire used to establish the extent to which training co -ordinators, 
managers and trainers employed in the Botswana public service agreed or 
disagreed that the training evaluation str ategies identified in the literature 
review would be effective in evaluating training and development initiatives 
in their organisation. The results of the survey were integrated with a 
model to develop an integrated model for evaluating training and 
development initiatives in the Botswana public service sector  (refer figure 
4.4).
<<<PAGE=214>>>

Evaluation is an integral part of most instructional design models.  
Evaluation tools and methodologies help determine the effectiveness of 
instructional interventions. Despit e its importance, there is evidence that 
evaluation of training and development initiatives are often inconsistent or 
missing (Eseryl  2002, p.1). Possible explanations for inadequate 
evaluations include: insufficient budget allocated; insufficient time 
allocated; lack of expertise; blind trust in training solutions; or lack of 
methods and tools (Eseryel 2002, p.1). 
 
According to Eseryl (2002, p.3), part of the explanation may be that the 
task of evaluation is complex in itself. Evaluating training initiativ es with 
regard to their learning, transfer, and organisational impact involves a 
number of complex factors. These complex factors are associated with the 
dynamic and on- going interactions of the various dimensions and 
attributes of an organisation and trai ning goals, trainees, training 
institutions, and instructional technologies. 
 
4.2 DEFINITION OF EVALUATION 
 
Various definitions of evaluation can be found in the literature, many of 
them stipulative, and the inconsistencies in the use of the terminology 
cause confusion in training evaluation, affecting the success of evaluation 
efforts. 
 
A review of the literature on training and development was conducted to 
identify methods employed in effective training programmes . According to 
Berry (1995, p.54), having know ledge and understanding of learning 
principles, designing and conducting training sessions is important so that 
trainees are able to transfer the learnt material to their job situation. He 
further notes that after training has been conducted, it is worthwhile for the 
organisation to determine how effective the training goals were.
<<<PAGE=215>>>
- 193 -  
Brown and Seidner (1998, p.57) define evaluation as a disciplined inquiry 
to gather facts and other evidence that will allow an evaluator to make 
assertions about the quality, effectiveness, or value of a programme, a set 
of materials or some other object of evaluation in order to support decision 
making. 
 
Holli and Calabrese (1998, p.60) define evaluation as a comparison of an 
observed value or quality with a standard or criteri on of comparison. 
Evaluation is the process of forming value judgements about the quality of 
programmes, products, and goals.     
 
Wilson (2005, p.409) defines evaluation as a structured analysis of 
learning, training and development, by stakeholders. The evaluation could 
be of an event, process or outcome. The stakeholders could include 
learners, employers, designers, trainers, managers, owners, consultants 
or researchers.    
 
Combs and Fallet ta (2000, p.143) define evaluation as the systematic 
process of gathering and analysing data and other objective human 
performance-improvement processes and outcomes within the context of 
a business or organisational setting to determine the quality, value and 
effectiveness of the intervention. 
 
It can be concluded that evaluation is the application of systematic 
methods to periodically and objectively assess the effectiveness of 
programmes in achieving expected results, as well as their impacts, both 
intended and unintended, and also continued relevant and alternative or 
more cost-effective ways of achieving the expected results.  
The definitions of  evaluation have been discussed.  It is therefore 
appropriate; to define the purpose for evaluating training and development
<<<PAGE=216>>>
- 194 -  
initiatives. It is important to be clear from the onset as to what the purpose 
of evaluation is.  
 
4.3 PURPOSE FOR EVALUATING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
The purposes of training and development  are rather broad and are 
determine by the primary focus of the kind of training and development  
initiative. Foxon and Lybrand (2005, p. 4), concurs there is lack of agreed-
on definitions of evaluation and therefore there are an equally broad range 
of opinions on the purpose of evaluation.  
 
Foxon and Lybrand (2005, p.4) observe that more than 20 per cent of the 
writers n either describe nor imply a purpose for evaluation. Where 
purposes are outlined, they provide some telling insights. For example,  15 
per cent see the purpose for evaluation as justifying the training 
department’s existence and providing evidence of any cos t benefit to the 
organisation. The majority of these articles surfaced in the period 1980-83, 
and clearly reflects the preoccupation of many practitioners with keeping 
their jobs during the economic downturn and resulted in human resources 
development budgets being cut (Foxon & Lybrand 2005, p.4). 
 
While a mere 2  per cent consider assessing trainees’ reactions to be the 
purpose of evaluation, and 50 per cent see the purpose of judging the 
quality and worth of the training and development programme  in order to 
effect improvements and/ or identify the benefit of training , it should be 
remembered that studies already referred to provide evidence that many 
trainers are not evaluating beyond the level of the trainee reaction. What 
trainers believe should be done and what they do in reality differ 
remarkably. Despite the regular reference in the literature to Kirkpatrick’s 
four-stage model which highlights the following stages, (reaction, learning,
<<<PAGE=217>>>
- 195 -  
behaviour and results), only a small percentage consider the purpos e of 
evaluation specifically in these terms (Foxon & Lybrand 2005, p.5). 
  
Evaluation goals involve multiple purposes at different levels. These 
purposes include student learning, instructional material, transfer of 
training, and return on investment. Attaining these multiple purposes may 
require the collaboration of different people in different parts of the 
organisation.  
 
4.3.1 Feedback  
 
Bramley (1991, p.87) brings in a different dimension to the purpose for 
evaluating training. He  further states that the common view of evaluation 
is that it completes the training cycle. The purpose for evaluation is 
therefore integral to the cycle and has a key role in the quality control of 
the cycle by providing feedback on: 
 
 Effectiveness of the methods being used; 
 The achievement of the objectives set by both trainers and 
trainees; and 
 Whether the needs originally identified, both at organisational and 
individual levels, have been met.  
 
Bramley (1991, p.88) identifies five purposes for evaluating training and 
development, namely: feedback, control, research, intervention and power 
games. 
 
Feedback provides quality control over the design and delivery of training 
and development activities. Feedback to trainees is critical for imparting a 
learning process during training and development. Timely feedback to 
participants on the effectiveness of particular methods and on the
<<<PAGE=218>>>
- 196 -  
achievements of objectives set for the programme will help in the 
development of the programme currently being run and those planned for 
future occas ions. Information which needs to be collected for feedback 
evaluation is: 
 
 The extent to which the objectives are being or have been met;  
 Before and after measures of levels of knowledge, concepts used, 
skills, attitudes and behaviour; 
 Sufficient detail a bout content to be able to estimate the 
effectiveness of each topic; 
 Evidence of transfer of learning back to the workplace; and  
 Some identification of those for whom the programme was of most 
and least benefit so that the target population can be more cl osely 
defined. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.88) concludes by noting that the main purpose of 
feedback evaluation is the development of learning situations and training 
programmes to improve what is being offered. The secondary aspect in 
identifying is what is good an d what is not so good in improving the 
professional ability of members of a training department. Reports based 
on feedback evaluation tend to have conclusions in them which the 
training department can consider and act upon (or not act on) as 
appropriate.  
 
Evaluation cannot be conducted without guidelines and procedures to help 
the trainer confine themselves within the context of the process without 
interference.
<<<PAGE=219>>>
- 197 -  
4.3.2 Control  
 
Control measures for the evaluation are crucial and the organisation must 
ensure that policies on the evaluation of training and development are in 
place before they begin the evaluation. 
 
Control evaluation relates training policy and practice to organisational 
goals. There could also be concern for the value added to the organisation 
of the contribution and costs of the training function. Control evaluation 
may be the answer to such questions as: Will the main focus on training 
give a better solution to the problem than re- structuring the department or 
re-designing some of the jobs? T he information required for control 
evaluation is therefore: 
 
 That which is required for feedback; 
 Some measures of the worth of the output of the training to the 
organisation;  
 Some measures of costs; and  
 Some attempts at a comparative study with different combinations 
of methods for tackling the problem (Bramley 1991, p.88). 
 
It can therefore be concluded , that control evaluation is something that an 
organisation might require of a training manager or might impose through 
the creation of a group which is  responsible for evaluating, but is not part 
of the training function in an evaluation cell. Training evaluation may be 
carried out for research purposes.
<<<PAGE=220>>>
- 198 -  
4.3.3 Research  
 
This evaluation seeks to add to knowledge of training principles and 
practice in a way which will have more general application than feedback 
evaluation. Studies of ways in which people learn or studies of factors 
which facilitate transfer would be examples. Research evaluation can also 
serve to improve the techniques available for other purposes like 
feedback, control and intervention. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.89) states that research evaluation is particularly 
concerned with two types of validity. Internal validity may be described as 
the extent to which particular conclusions may be drawn from the data.  
The data should be derived from a carefully controlled situation with good 
experimental design so that alternative explanations cannot be ruled out. 
External validity is defined as the extent to which the conclusions that are 
drawn from the expe rimental situation may be generally applicable to 
other situations. Research evaluation into training and development within 
organisations is particularly difficult due to few opportunities to set up well -
designed projects with true control groups and adeq uate time for a series 
of observations.  
 
4.3.4 Interventions  
 
Training evaluation can be used for internal communication between all 
stakeholders such as trainers, trainees, and managers. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.89) states that it is an illusion to believe that the process 
of evaluation is able to provide some objective measuring instrument that 
is independent of the programme being evaluated. The evaluation will 
almost inevitably affect the way in which the programme  is viewed and 
can be used to redefine the sharing  of responsibility for the learning
<<<PAGE=221>>>
- 199 -  
between the trainers, trainees and employing managers. Planned 
intervention through evaluation can:  
 
 Involve the line manager in pre- and post- measurement; 
 Involve the line manager in the extension of training after the event 
by debriefing and helping with the implementation of the action 
plan; 
 Change the way in which the employing managers select and brief 
people before the learning event; and 
 Cause the training department to rethink the deployment of trainers 
to the functions within the organisation and to strengthen the liaison 
role (Bramley 1991, p.89).  
 
 Training evaluating may be used for power games. 
 
4.3.5 Power games 
 
The use of information as a power game is common in some 
organisations where by evaluation,  information is used as bargaining chip 
in certain instances.  
 
Bramley (1991, p.90) explains that all information is powerful but certainly 
evaluative information about training and development events can be used 
within the organisation in a political way. A s it is probably not possible to 
avoid these power games, perhaps it is not desirable to aim to do so. It 
does however, place responsibility on the evaluator to make sure that the 
evidence which is being used is based on a sound study. It can be 
concluded that the purpose of training evaluation differs according to the 
type of training delivered and the organisational politics.

4.4      STRATEGIES FOR EVALUATING TRAINING AND 
 DEVELOPMENT  
 
There is ample evidence that evaluation continues to be one of the mos t 
vexing problems facing the training fraternity. Catanello and Kirkpatrick’s 
1968 survey of 110 industrial organisations evaluating training (Burgoyne 
and Cooper 1975, p. 60) revealed that very few were assessing anything 
other than trainee reactions.   
 
This section will cover strategies for evaluating training and development, 
as well as various approaches to the evaluation of training and 
development. Also covered in this section  is the need for evaluating 
training and development, evaluating changes due to training and 
development and lastly, evaluating training and development through the 
implementation of a performance management system.    
 
Wigley (1988, p.13) describes a “production approach” to training in which 
evaluation activities are seen as being isolated from the training itself.  In 
this approach evaluation is focused on statistics that describe the number 
of training days per year, the number of courses per year and the number 
of trainees attending each course , among other things.  Whilst these 
statistics are useful in providing data about how popular the programmes  
offered by the training department are, they have little effect in showing 
whether the training department is fulfilling any useful purpose for the 
organisation. 
 
Having knowledge of and understanding learning principles, designing and 
conducting training sessions is only relevant when trainees learn material 
that they can subsequently transfer to their actual jobs.  After training has 
been conducted, it would seem only natural tha t organisations would 
devote significant effort determining how effective training has been i.e.
<<<PAGE=223>>>
- 201 -  
have training goals been met ? (Berry 1995,  p.54). This discussion leads 
to an important question, why evaluate training and development?  
 
4.4.1 The need for evaluating training and development 
 
Other than determining the effectiveness of the training and development 
initiative, why is there a need for evaluating training and development? 
Most importantly, before answering the question of why evaluate training 
and development, it would be appropriate to consider possible reasons 
why systematic evaluation of training and development is not carried out in 
organisations.  
 
There is a strong belief amongst trainers and those involved with training 
that mos t of the t raining they conduct are once-off programmes and 
therefore why bother to evaluate such programmes . Berry (1995, p.56) 
states that one of the reasons why training evaluation is neglected by the 
trainers is because many academic analysts have been strong on telling 
trainers that evaluation should be conducted but they have offered trainers 
limited practical guidance and few examples which show trainers how the 
evaluation ought to be conducted. He  further states that academic 
researchers create the impression that evaluation must be conducted in 
laboratory-like conditions of experimental control and that such rigour is 
unattainable and practitioners tend therefore to conclude that evaluation is 
impossible. 
 
It is possible that training evaluations are not conducted because of the 
fear amongst trainers who, like most job incumbents, tend to avoid 
performance appraisal unless a positive outcome is guaranteed, hence 
the popularity amongst trainers of end- of-course reaction forms (or “happy 
sheets”). Evaluation also  makes it possible to question training
<<<PAGE=224>>>
- 202 -  
programmes that have been allowed to continue for many years (and 
often at great cost) unchecked (Berry 1995, p.56). 
 
Simmonds (2003, p.168) identifies some of the reasons given by the 
trainer for not evaluating their training efforts: 
 
 Are training efforts  cannot be measured; 
 What information can be collected; 
 When calculating return on investment, is it valiable to evaluate the 
training programme; 
 Measurement is only effective in the production and financial 
departments; 
 Chief officer (CEO) does not require ev aluation, so why should I do 
it; 
 There are too many variables affec ting any behaviour change for to 
evaluate the impact; 
 Evaluation will lead to criticisms; 
 Measuring progress toward achievement of objectives i s an 
adequate evaluation strategy; and 
 Evaluation will be costly.      
 
Berry (1995, p.57) acknowledges that although the reasons for and theory 
of evaluation are convincing and sound, there is enough evidence in the 
literature that, in practice the actual  evaluation of training is not normally 
done. 
 
Now that arguments and reasons have been advanced against the 
evaluation of training and development, it will only be proper to explore the 
reasons for training evaluation.
<<<PAGE=225>>>
- 203 -  
There are numerous reasons for training evaluation efforts. Berry (1995, 
p.58) states that, there are few arguments against the fact that training 
and development of whatever nature needs to be evaluated. Training and 
development without evaluation is like manufacturing goods without 
keeping production figures. 
 
Somolekae (2005, p.123) argues that if management invest s in training 
and development for employees, it unconditionally expects to see results 
from the initiative. When a training director approaches top management 
for approval for a new training and development activity, the question can 
reasonably be posed as to what good the course will bring and why the 
company should invest such a sum of money in it.  
 
According to Somolekae (2005, p.124), the other school of thought is that 
there is a direct connection between failure to evaluate training, the low 
standing of the training function in many organisations, and the 
inadequate support training is given in many organisations. She further 
stresses that the credibility of training and development is influenced when 
it can be demonstrated that the organisation has benefited immensely 
(tangibly).  
 
Mangori (2001, p.45) is of the view that the idea of a training department 
as a passive provider of a menu of course has become obsolete. A new  
approach is needed which the concept of training as a management 
function that contributes to the growth and development of the 
organisation and its training departments is required in order to give 
evidence of their effectiveness. This evidence has usual ly been 
established by the reputation of the trainers, the training manager, or 
repeat business and not by the indices of changed participants’ behaviour 
or increases in organisational effectiveness.
<<<PAGE=226>>>
- 204 -  
Mangori (2001, p.51) further explains that to demonstr ate the importance 
of training and development, trainers must not only conduct excellent 
programmes, but must also prove the programmes by their results, 
improved performance, more efficient use of resources and satisfactory 
returns on the training rands invested. 
 
Zara (2005, p.411) beliefs that the main objective for evaluating training 
and development in any organisation should be to measure the extent to 
which training and development programmes  and processes achieve the 
purpose for which they were intended, i.e. the organisation learns, 
whether personal and impressionistic or systematic and comparatively 
objective. In other words, the purpose of training and development is to 
ensure that the organisation workforce has the skills and knowledge which 
are necessary to achieve its strategic business objectives  
 
Marsden (2005, p.16) confesses that  evaluation is given a low priority in 
the instructional process, a content that is supported by the small number 
of articles in the literature that deal with it. H owever, in the current 
economic environment and in the light of the Training Guarantee, training 
personnel are going to be faced with hard economic decisions about the 
viability and value of the programmes they offer. Marsden (2005, p.16) 
maintains that training personnel are going to need evidence of the quality 
of their programmes in order to make such decisions and to influence the 
decisions of organisational management. He believes  that this evidence 
can only come about through evaluation.  Thus, evaluation must be given 
a high priority and must be fully incorporated into the instructional 
development process.  Marsden (2005, p.17) believes  that in order for this 
to happen the meaning of evaluation must be clarified and its purpose(s) 
must be clearly identified.
<<<PAGE=227>>>
- 205 -  
Training and development must be evaluated to determine whether the 
main objective has been achieved. Only then will training and 
development initiatives in organisations become justifiable and the training 
function become a genuine part of the organisation. Operating divisions 
take extra miles to measure their actual results against the agreed 
objectives. The question that comes to mind is why training should be 
treated differently from other departments when dealing with the issue of 
evaluation (Marsden 2005, p.21). 
 
Mangori (2001, p.52) acknowledges that there could be arguments for the 
opposite of the above statement in that some of the trainers may argue 
that training is more difficult to evaluate taking into consideration the many 
non-tangibles involved, as well as on-  the-job training that can skew the 
results. However, this does not mean training and development cannot be 
evaluated. 
 
In order to determine which method should be used for evaluating the 
training and development effort, the trainer needs to obtain answers to the 
following questions: 
 
 Who wants evaluation information? 
 What measure should be used to determine training effectiveness? 
and 
 How should a training evaluation study be designed?  
 
This study will now attempt to answer these questions by identifying the 
different stakeholders who require evaluation information.
<<<PAGE=228>>>
- 206 -  
4.4.2 Who requires training evaluation information? 
 
Berry (1995, p.60) points out that several people or groups of people need 
the evaluation information for different purposes and reasons whenever 
training occurs in the organisation.  They include the following. 
 
4.4.2.1 Trainees  
 
Trainees need information on what and how much they have learned and 
benefited from the training and how they will improve in their work as a 
result. They also want to know how their perceptions and reactions to the 
training compare with those of their peers. They may be eager to pick up 
on the group’s norm, which will influence whether they accept or reject 
what they were taught (Berry 1995, p.61).  
 
4.4.2.2 Trainers 
 
Berry (1995, p.61) states that those who want evaluation information are 
the trainers. The information is important because it is through this 
information that they can improve their own performance. The feedback is 
required specifically to determine what they did or failed to do that trainees 
liked or disliked, and enjoyed or did not enjoy, as well as the extent they 
stimulated their trainees’ enthusiasm and their learning of material 
presented. They would want to know which as pects of the training 
programme the trainees found difficult to grasp and which aspects were 
easy. Lastly, trainers want to know which training method, examples and 
exercises were most stimulating and productive in causing learning to take 
place.
<<<PAGE=229>>>
- 207 -  
4.4.2.3 Training directors  
 
A third group that requires evaluation information are  the training directors 
or programme co-ordinators in an organisation. They require the same 
information required by the trainers for an advisory role and as future 
programme presenters, what will or will not be effective. They also want 
the information to evaluate trainers’ performance and also to know which 
aspects of the training proved to be benefiting the trainees and which were 
of little or no value (Berry 1995, p.62).  
 
Phillips (1991, p.19) states that a new and persistent trend is that though 
measurement is the requirement from chief executives that human 
resources development should show some evidence of impact. 
 
4.4.2.4 Training managers 
 
Berry (1995, p.62) is of the view  that as the managers have supported the 
training programme by giving the trainee time off to attend the course and 
by providing funds for the course, they obviously want to know the extent 
to which their subordinates have developed and in what ways their 
departments will be more effective as a result of the training. 
 
There is a notion that, in an uncertain economic climate, fewer resources 
will be allocated by the chief executives to support training programmes  
without evaluation. The training and develop ment functions must be able 
to justify, with concrete evidence, that programmes  are actually effective. 
The most preferred evaluation method is a multi -evaluation method that 
provides accurate measures of programme  effectiveness that will assist in 
the cost justification of training efforts (Berry 1995, p.62).
<<<PAGE=230>>>
- 208 -  
The chief executive will want to know to what extent the training function is 
making a contribution to the overall effectiveness of the organisation. 
Chief executives will also want to know to what extent individuals have 
become enriched by the training experience and whether they have 
become more committed to the organisation and their own personal 
development. Having established who requires evaluation information, it is 
important to consider different types of evaluation and their characteristics. 
 
It can therefore be concluded,  that not only those directly involved with 
training require evaluation information, but the rest of management as 
well. 
 
4.4.3 Types of evaluation 
 
Erasmus, Loedolff, Mda and Nel  (2006, p.221) identify two main 
distinguishable types of training evaluation, namely: process and outcome 
evaluation. 
 
Process evaluation deals with what occurred during the development and 
implementation phase of training. Outcome evaluation focuses  on the 
effects of the training of trainees and their performance as well as the 
effects of training on the organisation (Berry 1995, p.63).  
 
4.4.3.1 Process evaluation 
 
As previously stated, process evaluation involves the assessment of what 
occurred dur ing the development and implementation of training. Berry 
(1995, p.63) states that the value of conducting process evaluation is that 
it allows the outcomes of training to be interpreted in the light of what took 
place during training. Process evaluation enables trainers in establishing
<<<PAGE=231>>>
- 209 -  
what accounted for  the effects that training has  on various levels of the 
organisation. 
 
By using this evaluation method, the trainer can analyse what took place 
in the training process if, for example, the trainee did not display 
appropriate behaviour after training. The trainer can therefore, based on 
the evaluation, make the necessary changes to the programme . Even 
thought the results may be acceptable by the trainer’s standard through 
the use of the process evaluation, a greater insight can be provided which 
may ultimately lead to even more desirable outcomes. 
 
The basics methodology process of process evaluation involves the 
recording of what occurred during the development and training through 
the use of training staff l ogs, films, video tapes, direct observations or any 
other method of recording what has occurred. After obtaining the recorded 
activities and procedures that took place, the trainer can thereafter 
compare what took place with the ideal model of what activit ies and 
procedures should have taken place. 
 
Erasmus, et al. (2006, p.221) suggest that trainers should use formative 
evaluation to determine if the programme is operating as originally 
planned or if any improvements are necessary before the programme  is 
implemented. The trainer would make use of dry and dummy runs prior to 
the training and revision processes, primarily using process criteria.  
 
It is important for trainers to be clear on the purpose and objectives they 
want to achieve using the formative evaluation (See figure 4.4). In addition 
to focusing on the quality of learning materials or methods, they suggest 
that the following should be established:
<<<PAGE=232>>>
- 210 -  
 How the learner enjoyed the instructional materials, content or 
methods; 
 How much the participants will  learn; 
 How much impact the learning material will have on the 
participants’ job performance; and 
 How much impact the planned learning experiences will have on 
the enterprise (Erasmus, et al. 2006, p.222). 
 
Berry (1995, p.64) presents a set of quest ions that might be answered or 
considered in the process of evaluation: 
 
 Were needs diagnosed correctly? 
 What data sources were utilised? 
 Was there a knowledge or skill deficiency? 
 Was the need organisationally important? 
 Were the needs transferred into objectives? 
 Was the organisational need translated into an organisational 
objective? 
 Was the overall training objective derived from the organisational 
objective? 
 Were prerequisite learning objectives derived from the overall 
training objective? 
 Were trainees assessed to determine the number of prerequisite 
learning objectives they were deficient in? 
 Was the evaluation system designed to measure achievement of 
the objectives? 
 Was the training programme designed to meet the specific learning, 
training and organisational objectives? 
 Was there any previous learning that might support or inhibit the 
current learning objective identified?
<<<PAGE=233>>>
- 211 -  
 Were individual differences determined and taken into 
consideration? 
 Was trainee motivation to learn assessed? 
 Were steps taken to increase trainee motivation in the learning 
environment? 
 Were steps taken to call attention to key learning events? 
 Were steps taken to aid trainees with symbolic coding and cognitive 
organisation? 
 Was opportunity made for symbolic practice? 
 Was opportunity made for behavioural practice? 
 Was feedback available after practice? 
 What steps were taken to facilitate positive transfer of learning back 
to the job? 
 Was there a match between the trainer characteristics, training 
techniques, and learning objectives? 
 Were trainer characteristics assessed?   
 Were training techniques likely to achieve the learning objectives? 
 What alternative training techniques were examined and why were 
they rejected? 
 Were the trainer’s lesson plans designed to capitalise on his or her 
strengths and weaknesses? 
 Was the trainer able to follow his or her lesson plan?  
 
The above questions can be used to evaluate the training process during 
the development and implementation stages of training and development.  
 
Erasmus, et al. (2006, p.222) note that the important aspect about process 
evaluation is to control learning performance and to remedy learning 
errors. Process evaluation should be meaningful to the learner and must 
be continually applied.
<<<PAGE=234>>>
- 212 -  
4.4.3.2 Outcome evaluation 
 
Goldstein (1991)  as cited by Berry (1995,  p.66), states that trainers use 
the summative evaluation to evaluate the final product with more 
emphasis being on programme appraisal using the outcome criteria. From 
the literature the Kirkpatrick four -level evaluation model is the most well-
known framework for classifying areas of evaluation. Various authors 
recommend this model when evaluating training and development 
outcomes. 
 
According to Kirkpatrick (1998, p.42), the first level is reaction, and it is 
defined as how well the trainees liked the training programme. The second 
measurement level, learning, is designated as the determination of what 
knowledge, attitudes, and skills were learned in the training. The third 
measurement is defined as behaviour. Behaviour outlines the relationship 
of learning (the previous measurement level) to the actualisation of doing. 
Kirkpatrick recognised a big difference between knowing principles and 
techniques and using those principles and techniques on the job.   
 
Having looked at different types of evaluation, the next stage is to 
investigate different techniques used to effectively evaluate training and 
development with a view to their impact on the bottom line of the 
organisation.
<<<PAGE=235>>>
- 213 -  
4.4.4 Techniques for evaluating training and development 
 
Goldstein and Ford  (1998, p.178) and Wynne and Clutterbuck (1994, 
p.231) reckon that managers and trainers must be introduced to different 
types of evaluation techniques which they can use to assess the 
effectiveness of training and development initiatives in the organisation. It 
is important to see evaluation as an integral part of the training cycle. 
Evaluation may appear to be the final phase/stage of the training cycle, 
but consideration should be given to each stage. It is also important to 
build it in as a phase on its own in order to evaluate the total process. 
 
The following evaluation techniques will be covered in this section and 
these include: interviews, pre- test/post-test, questionnaires and surveys, 
observations, documents, simulations, ac tion plans, tracking charts and 
gap analysis.   
 
4.4.4.1 Interviews 
 
Holcomb (1994, p. 40) states that interviews can be formal and structured, 
or very informal, a “how did it go?” kind of a discussion. The main 
objective of the interview as the evaluation technique is to ask people 
about the specific training programme. 
 
Buckley and Caple (2000, p.243) note that in a structured interview, both 
the trainer and the trainee get involved in a face- to face conversation 
structured around the checklist of prepared questions (usually a mixture of 
open-ended, problem-solving and closed questions, i.e. Yes/No or related 
answer questions) that can take place in or away from the workplace. The 
interview can be conducted with any individual or a small group who may 
have relevant information. These might include job holders, supervisors,
<<<PAGE=236>>>
- 214 -  
higher management or, in some cases, the customer may be involved as 
well.  
 
The main purpose of the interviews both formal and informal , is to 
investigate reasons why certain units or in dividuals in the organisation 
have benefited from training or to gather information about the training 
programme. The great benefi t of interview -based evaluation however, is 
that the trainer can gain a great deal of information through the use of both 
open and closed questions designed to probe the trainee’s views on the 
programme and other training -related issues. These issues can cover 
knowledge, skill and attitude assessment both in the initial and at a later 
phase of the evaluation. If the approach is l inked to a more quantitative 
approach, it can provide the trainer with a good feel for the effectiveness 
of the programmes delivered (Wynne and Clutterbuck 1994, p.239).  
 
The interview evaluation technique is the most cost effective and reliable 
technique that can be used to evaluate training and development 
initiatives. Pre -test and post -test is the next evaluation technique to be 
discussed. 
 
4.4.4.2 Pre-test/post-test evaluation technique 
 
Wynne and Clutterbuck (1994, p.236) state that an ideal way of measuring 
learning is to measure it at the start of the programme, and then measure 
the same set of knowledge when the training programme is completed. It 
is often helpful in deciding what needs to be built on, particularly when 
teaching is targeted at a specific skill. 
 
Holcomb (1994, p.44) describes the pre- test and post -test as the most 
common and reliable ways to evaluate training and development initiatives 
in an organisation. In its basic form, the evaluator simply finds out what
<<<PAGE=237>>>
- 215 -  
the trainees know or ca n do before training. When they finish training, 
trainees are expected to know more and be able to perform better. A pre-
test/post-test is generally a set of written questions to determine 
knowledge. A similar question is given before and after, to see if the 
trainee has learned anything. A pre- test/post-test is also applicable to 
behaviour and skills, and does not need to be written. A manager could 
test behaviour before training commences by observing performance on 
the job. Counting mistakes, complaints,  widgets produced before training 
and counting change afterwards is a pre- test/post-test method. The same 
method used before training could be used afterwards. Training is aimed 
at improving performance and a post -test is used to evaluate the 
improvement. 
 
Other than the last -mentioned disadvantage, the pre- test/post-test 
evaluation technique is reliable and most effective. The other technique 
that can be used to evaluate training and development is questionnaires 
and surveys. 
 
4.4.4.3 Questionnaires and surveys 
 
Wynne and Clutterbuck (1994, p.237) are of the opinion that a systematic 
approach to training and development evaluation often requires the 
training department to follow up with people who have attended specific 
programmes. These authors believe that, if the objective of evaluation is to 
assess retention and application, the questionnaire should be designed 
primarily to assess the levels of skill or knowledge that the trainee has 
retained during the periods following the training, after six months, or 
twelve months, whichever period the trainer believes is right. It is 
important for trainees to answer the questions as honestly and openly as 
possible without referring to their notes or hand-outs.
<<<PAGE=238>>>
- 216 -  
Wynne and Clutterbuck (1994, p.237) state that questio nnaires and 
surveys can be used to identify how and how well learning has been 
applied. What benefits trainees have gained and what opportunities they 
now have for increasing learning? It must be noted that considerable 
benefit can also be obtained from negative responses. The trainer would 
be keen to know what learning has not been applied and why. Is it 
perhaps due to the fact that the learning was not relevant, or is it because 
the timing was not right? On the basis of such responses, the trainer can 
then assess the relevance of the delivered training programme  and its 
applicability (Wynne & Clutterbuck 1994, p.237).  
 
As stated, these evaluation techniques are common and thus people are 
comfortable in completing them. The next eval uation technique is 
observation. 
 
4.4.4.4 Observation 
 
An observation is made at the job site while employees are working. It is 
aimed at determining how well employees are able to perform a particular 
task or skill. Only behaviour can be observed, not feelings or attitudes. It is 
therefore for the evaluator to determine what kind of behaviour he or she 
is looking for before conducting this type of evaluation.  
 
Like interviews, observation can be formal or informal. The trainer can 
observe how behaviour has changed as a result o f learning and feedback, 
and can reinforce this with additional feedback from trainees after a 
particular exercise or experience. It must be noted that the trainer cannot 
expect sound behaviours they observe to be repeated unless trainers 
provide some kind of positive reinforcement (Wynne & Clutterbuck 1994, 
pp.240-241). As in previously discussed techniques, observation has its 
own advantages and disadvantages.
<<<PAGE=239>>>
- 217 -  
 
Every company keeps some form of written records or documentation for 
future reference or as a way of evaluating training and development. 
 
4.4.4.5 Documents/records 
 
Marshal and Wallace (1994, p.243) state that there is a need for training 
documents or records to be kept for various reasons.  
 
According to Holcomb (1994, p.59), some companies do a sterling job 
when it comes to documenting training information. But even poorly kept 
records can give the evaluator information about training needs and how 
to evaluate them. There are a number of documents that lead to training 
efforts and these include performance appraisal, profit and loss, employee 
grievances, and accident reports.  
 
Marshal and Wallace (1994, p. 243) believes  that performance appraisal 
may indicate areas where employees need improvement. If an employee 
is performing badly, on a perform ance appraisal, the company also needs 
to allow that particular employee to rectify his/her performance through 
training. Poor performance may be due to lack of skill, knowledge, 
behaviour or an attitude. 
 
Profit and loss documentation often leads to training. Companies are 
always trying to find better ways to produce goods or services of higher 
quality and lower cost. This often requires technical or skill training to 
improve speed or to reduce errors and waste. Evaluating training is 
directly related to improvement in the bottom line, resulting in higher profit 
margins, lower costs or both (Marshal & Wallace 1994, 243).
<<<PAGE=240>>>
- 218 -  
These authors suggest that employee grievances, especially in an 
environment where a labour movement is militant, can cost the company 
time and money. Supervisory and management training is normally 
provided as a response to complaints about how supervisors and 
managers are treating employees. If grievances decrease after training, 
then those documents can be used to evaluate the results of training.       
 
Marshal and Wallace (1994, p.244) note that customer complaints or 
response cards guide much of the training done in hotels and other 
service-based businesses. Customers’ responses tell management how 
the organisation is doing and if trai ning is needed. The practice in modern 
business is that customers play a critical role in providing the organisation 
with the necessary feedback that guides the organisation’s direction. 
 
According to Marshal and Wallace (1994, p.244), accident reports and 
occupational health and safety inspections lead to required employee 
safety training. Evaluation of these programmes  varies according to the 
significance of the accidents. In the case of a hazardous job with the 
possibility of serious accidents, then safety training is required and the 
evaluation of results is critical. 
 
4.4.4.6 Simulations 
 
Simulations are exercises that trainees participate in to demonstrate the 
real job situation. 
 
The simulations are planned to mimic the problems or tasks that are faced 
on the job. Simulations probably present the greatest diversity and variety 
for evaluating training and development initiatives. Many organisations 
have introduced different games to equip their employees to deal with 
certain situations.
<<<PAGE=241>>>
- 219 -  
4.4.4.7 Action plans  
 
Action plans, commonly known as learning contracts, are developed by 
the participants at the end of a training programme. They are some of the 
commonest forms of evaluation because they follow the adult learning 
theory that stipulates that adults learn what they are ready to learn.  
 
Holcomb (1994, p.70) believes  that this technique allows the participants 
to decide exactly what changes they will make based on the things they 
learned during training. When adults are learning in a situation, a wide 
variety of maturity, experience and interests are brought into the session. 
People can learn valuable but different things, or they can learn the same 
things but apply them differently. Action plans are designed to allow 
participants flexibility. 
 
The next training evaluation technique is tracking charts.  
 
4.4.4.8  Tracking charts 
 
Tracking charts are simply a way of keeping score, which people love to 
do because it gives them a way of competing.  
 
Holcomb (1994, p.70) explains that tracking charts can be us ed on an 
individual basis to keep track of one’s scores. Tracking charts can also be 
used for teams to keep score on each other. Keeping score is highly 
motivating. According to Holcomb (t racking charts were used in the 40s 
when time/motion studies were being done in factories to improve 
productivity. The development of tracking charts gained popularity when 
used for Total Quality Management as a way of recording changes in 
employees’ performance. This resulted in training initiatives being 
designed to meet the employees’ shortfalls.
<<<PAGE=242>>>
- 220 -  
  
Tracking charts can also be used to motivate employees. Employees are 
individually asked what they perceive as a fair day’s work and what pay 
should be given for such work. The supervisor keeps track of an individual 
employee’s day performance and gives feedback to the employee on how 
he or she has performed over a specific period of time and reward him or 
her for their performance (achievement).  
 
A gap analysis checklist evaluation technique will be discussed in the next 
section.  
 
4.4.4.9 Gap analysis checklist 
 
A gap analysis checklist is developed by determining “what is’ and “what 
needs to be done”. It is based on individual competencies and helps 
trainees become competent in identified skills. Its purpose is to help 
trainees improve by finding out what they can do, checking if they are 
alright, and then training for what still needs to be improved. A Gap 
analysis checklist is useful especially when one needs to be certified or 
competent in several areas before being allow ed to face the public . It is a 
developmental process where 100 per cent efficiency is the goal, but not 
immediately attainable after training.  
 
Holcomb (1994, p.71) states that the checklist allows trainees to develop 
at their own pace, realising that som e trainees enter a programme  with 
more skills than others. Once they are checked off as competent in all 
areas on the list, attention no longer needs to be focused on that 
employee. Time needs to be devoted to those who need reinforcement in 
order to bring them up to the standard. The checklist allows the evaluator 
to focus on small steps in the evaluation and development of employees. 
Some checklists are sequenced and follow a precise progression, others
<<<PAGE=243>>>
- 221 -  
simply check off “can they or can’t they?” do something. The checklist’s 
goal is to have employees competent in all items on the list and then be 
checked off.  
 
The gap analysis checklist appeals to managers who view training as a 
developmental process with small steps leading to competence. Ideally, 
rewards are given when trainees have successfully demonstrated their 
competence and completed all the items on the checklist. 
 
It can be concluded that different training and development evaluation 
techniques discussed in this section provide the evaluator with different 
approaches to determine the value of changes that occurred during and 
after training.  
 
This section cover ed the pros and cons for evaluating training and 
development initiatives in the organisational context.  The next section will 
cover evaluat ion approaches that can be utilised by trainers and 
evaluators for the effective evaluation of training and development 
initiatives in the public, parastatal and private sector organisations. The 
thrust of the discussion is premised on the effective evaluation of training 
with the view to improving organisational performance.
<<<PAGE=244>>>
- 222 -  
4.4.5   Evaluating changes due to training and development   
 
Changes due to training and development should bring about changes in 
knowledge, skills and behaviour at indivi dual and group levels. At 
organisational level changes should occur in effectiveness and cost. This 
section will cover discussion on strategies that can be used to assess 
changes in the organisation.  
 
Organisational change occurs at many levels and takes many forms. 
Consequently, development criteria by which changes can be evaluated 
may result in a range of indices. A good place to start is by establishing 
that learning has taken place at the individual level. This is one of the 
necessary conditions of th ose strategies of organisational change which 
focus on people. It may not be assumed, however, that individual changes 
will lead to a change in effectiveness and this will need to be evaluated in 
its own right (Bramley 1991, p.37).   
 
In this section the r esearcher will discuss techniques intended to measure 
changes in knowledge, skills and attitudes and the criteria for evaluating 
an increase in effectiveness at the individual, team and organisational 
levels. To conclude this section an outline of some aspects in comparing 
the costs of training with outcomes will be presented.  
 
4.4.5.1  Measuring changes in knowledge 
 
All jobs require the holder to have some knowledge. It is therefore 
important to measure an employee’s knowledge to determine their training 
needs.  
 
Bramley (1991, p.37) states that the very issue of the job brings about the 
following questions:
<<<PAGE=245>>>
- 223 -  
 
 What type of knowledge is required? 
 How can the knowledge be analysed? 
 Is it helpful, in attempting to answer these questions, to have a 
framework in which to carry out the analysis?  
 
According to Bramley (1991, p.37), the one which has proved to be useful 
is to describe the sort of knowledge required at three levels: 
 
 The basic level is that of isolated pieces of information, the ability to 
recall simple lists or state simple rules, knowing a range of simple 
facts about the job area. For instance, a counter clerk at the post 
office would need to know what forms have to be filled in and what 
documents produced in order to apply for a vehicle license disc;   
 A higher level is to be able to arrange many of the pieces of 
information into a procedure, how to do things, how to order a set of 
actions. For example,  starting up a processing plant involves a 
series of actions which must be done in a certain sequence; and 
 
 The next level is the knowledge with which to analyse any particular 
situation for its key elements and thus make a decision about 
whether procedure A is more likely to be successful than procedure 
D. This approach requires a skill to be able t o select the most 
appropriate procedure or method of doing something. Taking an 
example of a social worker who may have to decide that a 
particular client’s (youngster’s) needs are best met by being left in 
the family of origin, or by being taken into fost er care, or  in a 
residential home (Bramley 1991, p.37).    
 
According to Bramley (1991, p.37), the above- mentioned levels are a 
hierarchical set and it is not possible to achieve the higher levels without
<<<PAGE=246>>>
- 224 -  
knowing the lower levels. The function of training could therefore, be seen 
as: 
 
 Analysing what is required at each of the three levels of satisfactory 
job performance; 
 Discovering what trainees know at each level before they attend the 
training; 
 Trying to close that gap; and 
 Communicating to the superviso r or manager to what extent 
trainees are below satisfactory job performance levels at the end of 
training. 
 
The three levels of knowledge have quite different implications for the 
training process. Isolated pieces of information can be easily transferred 
by lectures to large groups or by a paper -based text or by programme d 
packages. All these methods are relatively inexpensive. Procedures too 
can be learned fairly cheaply by using checklists and supervised practices.      
 
The implications of the third (analytical) level are quite different. This can 
only be achieved when the trainee practises in realistic situations and 
makes decisions on how best to handle such situations. This is a 
simulation of some of the job aspects, and therefore,  it will be more 
expensive to design and it is time consuming to practice as it would occur 
in a real job situation (Bramley 1991, p.40).  
 
Bramley (1991, p.40) further observes that the implications for the 
sophistication of measurement of changes in knowledge are also differ ent. 
It is relatively easy to test knowledge of isolated pieces of information and 
of procedures. This measurement can be done by using simple testing 
where the answer can be easily seen to be right or wrong. At the analytical 
level, the solutions to probl ems posed will often have a qualitative aspect
<<<PAGE=247>>>
- 225 -  
to them. This implies that an evaluator will have to scrutinise the solutions 
and decide which are acceptable and which are not. With highly 
developed simulations, these decisions are built in but this approac h can 
be a costly process.  For example the fight simulations which allow the 
practice of a wide range of emergency procedures, cost airlines a 
minimum of $ 50 million.  
 
4.4.5.2 Testing knowledge 
 
The following can be used for testing, open- ended questions, short -
answer items, objective test items, multichoice  questions, true or 
falsequestions, and gain ratios.   
 
4.4.5.2.1 Open-ended questions 
 
The traditional way of testing knowledge in the educational system is by 
the use of the essay. Questions like di scussing the extent to which the 
triple Entente contributed to the First World War’ are said to distinguish 
between those who know some facts about the subject and those who do 
not know. The question does not necessarily test the student’s knowledge 
but how well he or she can assemble a logical argument on paper. This 
skill is important for success in many professions, including the jobs of 
lecturers who set questions, but it is unimportant in other jobs. This form of 
testing is inappropriate when applied i n training, not because of the open-
ended nature of the question, but because it is often testing an irrelevant 
skill (analytical approach).   
 
4.4.5.2.2      Short-answer items 
 
Open-ended questions can be asked to test knowledge of isolated pieces 
of information and procedures. Open-ended questions may be used to test
<<<PAGE=248>>>
- 226 -  
the power of analysis. These questions normally start with a verb like:  
state, list, calculate, label, describe (in your own words), define, determine 
write. 
 
Answers to these questions are expected t o be short and some indication 
of length should be specified. It is relatively easy to write these types of 
questions in order t o measure the trainees’ knowledge on a particular 
topic. 
 
4.4.5.2.3 Objective test items  
 
An alternative to testing is by using  open-ended questions to ask the 
trainee to write one or two words, or to select the correct alternative from a 
number offered. With these objectives test items the rules for the scoring 
are made clear so that the answer can be recognised as being right or  
wrong and can be marked so by someone who knows nothing about the 
subject area being tested.  
 
Bramley (1991, p.41) notes that this kind of question is suitable for testing 
low levels on the hierarchy but it takes some ingenuity to write them at 
higher levels. This has led to a belief that objective test items are only 
suitable for trivial scraps of knowledge, which is not necessarily true. The 
Open University does a lot of course assessments by using objective 
items, and some of these items are not testing recognition of simple facts. 
An example is the sort of question where the understanding of a theory is 
being tested by asking which set of statements is consistent with the 
theory.    
 
Some of these questions are testing the ability to apply the theory i n new 
situations, a procedure which is quite close to the ‘analysis’ level of 
knowledge. Objective test item questions have an advantage over open-
<<<PAGE=249>>>
- 227 -  
ended questions in that they take less time to answer and the test item 
can cover a much wider area of the to pic in the same time. Objective test 
items are also less likely to be testing the level of literacy of the 
candidates. They have the disadvantage of being much more difficult to 
write (Bramley 1991, p.41).  
 
4.4.5.2.4 Multichoice questions 
 
Multichoice questions consist of a stem and four or five alternative 
responses, and can be in the form of a statement or a question, for 
example: 
 
Statement   Question 
A tachometer indicates What does a tachometer indicate? 
  Road speed   Road speed 
  Oil pressure   Oil pressure 
  Engine speed  Engine speed 
  Battery charge  Battery charge 
 
Trainees circle or cross the alternative selected; anyone with a mar king 
brief can decide whether the answer is correct or not. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.42) provides the following guidelines when dealing with 
multichoice questions. Stems should be: 
 
 Clear and brief; 
 Not include negatives, as well as; and 
 Not give clues by using key words which are repeated in the correct 
alternative answer. 
 
Incorrect alternatives (usually called distractors) should:
<<<PAGE=250>>>
- 228 -  
 
 All be plausible; 
 All be incorrect; and 
 Be arranged in random order so that the correct answer cannot be 
guessed because of its place in the sequence of alternatives. 
 
General considerations when dealing with multichoice are: 
 
 Each item should test a concept which is important for the trainee 
to know; 
 No item should reveal the correct response to another item; and 
 The items should be grouped by type so that the instructions can 
be made simple. 
 
4.4.5.2.5 True or false questions 
 
Multichoice items are o ften difficult to write because insufficient plausible 
alternatives cannot be found. In this case, it is possible to use a specific 
form, the true or false item. For example:  
 
‘Fillet mignon is obtained from the best end of mutton’.   True or False? 
With this type of question there is the likelihood that only trivial information 
will be tested. There is also the possibility of giving clues by using words 
like ‘never’ or ‘always’ in the stem as these are usually false statements.  
 
4.4.5.2.6 Gain ratios 
 
Bramley (1991, p.43) states that when looking at the framework for 
analysing  types of knowledge required, it was suggested that training 
could be considered as an attempt to close the gap between present and 
desired levels of knowledge. Bramley ( 1991, p.43) further adds that from
<<<PAGE=251>>>
- 229 -  
this statement it would appear to be logical to measure knowledge before 
as well as after training and thus estimate the gain. However, this is not 
without problems. The most obvious is that it may be a waste of valuable 
training ti me to establish that the trainees know virtually nothing at the 
beginning of the programme. It is also necessary to produce two similar 
but different tests or trainees will be alerted to the questions to be asked at 
the end of the programme  and may concent rate on learning the answers 
to these questions rather than learning the principles which allow them to 
answer a range of similar questions. 
 
There are situations where it is worth- while to pre-test as well as post -test 
knowledge. The gain ratio which can be calculated from this will give an 
estimate of the effectiveness of the programme. Using the formula: 
 
Gain ratio =    Post-test score - Pre-test score 
         ____________________   X 100% 
         Possible score – Pre-test score  
 
A figure which takes  values between 0 and 100 per cent will be obtained 
for each candidate. This represents how effective the programme  was in 
teaching the particular individual what he or she needed to learn. The 
average gain ratio over a group of trainees gives a course’s effectiveness 
measure. 
 
  As a guide one should expect an average gain ratio of about: 
 
 50 per cent with a good instructor and a good bal ance between 
input and practice; 
 70 per cent or better with individual instruction on programme 
packages; and 
 20 per cent with short lectures followed by questions.
<<<PAGE=252>>>
- 230 -  
These figures are empirical, based on studies of actual gains made, and 
can probably be explained by the level of active learning involved in the 
three methods. 
 
Poor level gains may also indicate that the trainees do not comprise a 
homogenous group. It is common that within a group there are those who 
know much about the topic and also there are those who know nothing 
about the topic before training. When this occurs the tutor will pitch the 
learning rate at a level which is too high for some and too low for others. If 
this is serious it will be revealed because the gain ratios will tend to cluster 
into two groups; high for people whose pre- scores were low, and low for 
the others (or vice versa). The implication here is that a pre-test could filter 
the candidates into two streams for more effective learning (Bramley 1991, 
p.44). 
 
Pre-testing also sensitises the trainees to those aspects of the programme 
which the tutors perceive to be important. This is widely use d in 
programmed packages as a way of motivating the learners by indicating 
what the objectives are. According to Bramley (1991, p.44), research on 
motivation has shown that many adults appear to be trying to achieve 
goals which they have set themselves for much of their adult life. This may 
be a source of energy which can assist in the training process. Alerting 
trainees to the important aspects will also remove some of the ambiguity 
and allow them to make more informed estimates of what the programme  
might be able to offer them. 
 
It can be concluded that evaluation can be made an integral part of the 
learning process by utilising the feedback on what is known and what 
needs to be learned. Measuring changes in levels of skills is another 
important aspect of training and development evaluation.
<<<PAGE=253>>>
- 231 -  
4.4.5.3  Measuring changes in skills 
 
This section will cover the following ; levels of skills, testing levels and 
profiling of skills. 
   
4.4.5.3.1 Levels of skills 
 
Bramley (1991, p.46) states that it is important to consider  different levels 
of skills in a similar way to those which were used for knowledge. The 
following are the suggested set of levels: 
 
 The basic level with skills is to be able to communicate, and for this 
it may be necessary to be able to label items, to id entify parts, to 
name the main assemblies of a machine, etc.; 
 This level involves the ability to perform simple procedures, often 
with the use of instructions or notes. Simple procedures refer to 
actions like changing the wheel on a car, where there is a 
sequence to follow but each part of the procedure involves only a 
few very simple skills; 
 This level is one performing physically skilled actions. These 
usually involve hand- eye co-ordination and learning them requires 
practice. For example planing a piece of wood to a required size, or 
typing 70 words per minute; and  
 Another level of skills is one that involves judging whether a piece 
of skilled work is of acceptable quality. For instance, deciding 
whether a piece of finished metalwork is satisfactory or not.  
 
It is important to note that the amount of time spent on training and the 
sophistication of the testing situation will increase with increasing levels.
<<<PAGE=254>>>
- 232 -  
4.4.5.3.2 Testing levels of skills  
 
Bramley (1991, p.46) notes that skills should be tested wit h practical tests 
unless the skill of being able to do something can be assumed from the 
ability to state the correct sequence of actions. Listing the sequence is 
often a different skill. For instance, it can be stated how to strip, clean and 
assemble a carburettor, but after it is assembled, the carburettor does not 
work properly. Tests of skill fall into two main types: 
 
 The trainee is set a task (for example, to repair an item) and the 
work is inspected at the end of the test period; and 
 The trainee is w atched through the test so that the methods used 
can be assessed as well as the final product.  
 
This type of test is more economical in terms of the time spent on the 
tutors and testers. The second is more flexible as the trainee who makes 
an error in the  initial stages can be put back onto the correct path by the 
tester and thus demonstrate the ability to carry out other parts of the task. 
Some tasks will require the second type of test because the results will not 
show how well the work has been carried out. Some kinds of welding for 
instance need to be watched during the process as the quality of weld will 
not be obvious from the surface inspection (Bramley 1991, p.47). 
 
4.4.5.3.3 Profiling skills      
 
Bramley (1991, p.48) states that the use of four levels of skill, and 
estimating at each level what adequate job performance means, allows for 
the identification of individual needs for training and development. 
Effective training will also require some estimate of what trainees are able 
to do before train ing. Often this can be assumed to be very little, but 
sometimes it is worth testing. Profiling is commonly used in education as a
<<<PAGE=255>>>
- 233 -  
method of recording how far students have developed along a particular 
path. It can also be used in a training context for assessing where trainees 
are at present and where they should aim to be at the end of training.     
 
4.4.5.3 Changes in attitude and behaviour 
 
Under this section, the following will be presented;  semantic differentials, 
repertory grid and behavioural scales. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.52) explains that the structure of a training programme is 
dependent on the likelihood of their purpose with emphasis placed on the 
distinction between skills and attitudes. The distinction between the two 
concepts will assist in underst anding how to measure changes in attitude 
and behaviour in the evaluation process. It is important for the trainer to 
distinguish what exactly the programme  address. In this way the 
evaluation process can be designed to look at one aspect separately from 
the other to give the appropriate feedback. Bramley (1991, p.52) defines 
attitude as a tendency or a predisposition to behave in a certain way in a 
particular situation, whereas a skill is the ability to perform a task well.  
 
Attitudes can be measured directly , but are usually inferred from what 
people say or are seen to do. Changing someone’s attitude may be about 
changing what they say and do but this will not necessarily follow. People 
behave in ways where other variables in the situation may be more 
powerful in selecting behaviour than attitudes previously held.
<<<PAGE=256>>>
- 234 -  
The process of attitude training has four main stages: 
 
 Identify desirable attitudes which are expected to lead to some 
improvement, usually of culture, climate, in some part of the 
organisation. The attitudes identified are usually of a fairly general 
nature like: positive management; consideration for subordinates; 
openness and trust in the workplace; being less prescriptive and 
more likely to delegate responsibility; 
 Assess where the part icipants are with respect to the desired 
attitude. This is usually done by self -analysis, often with an 
inventory. The participants’ perceptions of their ‘normal’ work 
behaviour are classified and shown to have some categor ies which 
differ from the ideal; 
 Convince the participants of the value of the desired attitudes by 
giving examples, models or counselling. This is reinforced by 
allowing them to experience some success in experiential learning, 
perhaps by role playing; and 
 If training is done well, the participants accept the new attitude and 
return to work. Here it is expected that they will perform consistently 
with the new attitude (Bramley 1991, p.52).     
 
As attitudes are measured or discussed early in the programme  it is 
possible to reassess them t owards the end and show changes in the 
expected direction. Often this is done in an informal way at the end- of-
course discussion of what were the most important things to the 
employee? It is possible to make assessment more formal by developing 
action plans. What will the employee do more of and what will they do less 
of when they return to work?  
 
There are also inventories which can be used early and late in the 
programme. The inventories will seldom be exactly what is required but
<<<PAGE=257>>>
- 235 -  
the formats can be used to build up something specific for a particular 
programme.   
 
 4.4.5.3.1 Semantic differentials 
 
Bramley (1991, p.53) states that a simple method for checking whether 
there has been a change in attitude, and in what direction, is to use a 
semantic differe ntial of the types shown in Figure 4.3 below. The 
participants are asked to think about a particular concept, for instance, 
‘evaluation of training’ or ‘participative management’, and to mark on each 
seven-point scale where their opinion lies. The opinions  of the group are 
usually summarised by frequencies or averages to give some feel for what 
their overall attitude is to the concept.

The exercise is repeated near the end of the programme and any changes 
in attitude can be identified. The technique is neutral with respect to the 
direction of the changes. The trainers should be able to assess whether a 
change in any particular dimension is positive and this should be related to 
the objectives of the programme.
<<<PAGE=258>>>
- 236 -  
 
4.4.5.3.2 Repertory grid 
 
A more rigorous method of finding out what people’s attitudes are towards 
a particular concept is to use a repertory. This technique asks  the person 
whose attitudes are being investigated to consider a number of examples 
of the concept and to say what criteria he or she would use to distinguish 
between them. This is usually done during interviews with each individual 
separately, but is likely to involve too much time (Bramley 1991, p.54).  
 
It is possible to follow up changes in attitudes back to the workplace to 
discover to what extent they have been maintained, but it is doubtful if this 
will actually produce useful information. One is sti ll left with the 
assumption that changes in attitude imply changes in behaviour at work. 
Bramley (1991, p.57) recommends the use of a behavioural scale to 
measure changes in the ways in which things are done. 
 
4.4.5.3.3 Behavioural scales 
 
The basic ration ale of using behavioural scales is that they can make 
explicit what changes are expected to result from training and give some 
estimate of whether they are actually occurring. Rackham and Morgan 
developed the 13 categories of behaviour which can be used by trainers to 
critically analyse any behavioural change (refer to Figure 4.4). These 
categories of behaviour are intended to provide a vocabulary for 
communicating frequencies of doing things and thus act as an aid for 
providing accurate feedback which the recipient can understand. 
Important categories are selected from critical incident studies of the kind 
of work to be learned.
<<<PAGE=259>>>
- 237 -  
The actual categories of behaviour used by Rackham and Morgan (1977, 
p.45) were developed over a number of attempts and eventual ly settled 
as:  
 
 
Proposing behaviour which puts forward a new concept, suggestion or course of action 
(and is actionable). 
Building behaviour which extends or develops a proposal  which has been made by 
another person (and is actionable). 
Supporting behavi our involves a conscious and direct declaration as support or 
agreement with another person and concepts. 
Disagreeing behaviour involves a conscious, direct and reasoned declaration of 
different opinions, or criticism of another person’s concept.   
Defending/attacking behaviour which attacks another person or defensively 
strengthens an individual’s own position. Defending/attacking behaviours usually involve 
overt value judgements and often contain emotional overtones.     
Blocking/difficult stating behavio ur which places a difficulty or block in the path of a 
proposal or concept without offering an alternative proposal and without offering a 
reasoned statement of disagreement. Blocking /difficult stating behaviour therefore tends 
to be rather bald, e.g. ‘It won’t work’, or ‘We couldn’t possibly accept that’. 
Open behaviour exposes the individual who makes it to risk of ridicule or loss of status. 
This behaviour may be considered as the opposite of defending/attacking behaviour, 
including within the category of admissions of mistakes or inadequacies provided that 
these are made in a non-defensive manner. 
Testing understanding behaviour seeks to establish whether  or not an earlier 
contribution has been understood. That summarises, or otherwise restates in a com pact 
form, the content of previous discussions or considerations. 
Seeking information behaviour seeks facts, opinions or clarification from another 
individual(s). 
Giving information behaviour offers facts, opinions or clarification to others. 
Shutting down behaviour excludes attempts to exclude another group member.  
Bringing in behaviour is a direct and positive attempt to involve another group member.

Through appraisal interviewing, the c ategories thought to be important to 
good performance might include a high rate of: 
 
 Seeking information proposals, solutions to problems etc; 
 Testing understanding; 
 Summarizing; 
 Supporting; 
 Building; 
 Low rate of proposing; and  
 Blocking/difficulty stating. 
 
The frequencies at w hich the candidates show these behaviours in the 
early practice interviews is fed back to them and discussed. Candidates 
then have clear bench- marks against which to measure their progress. 
The best place to do this behaviour tracking is in the actual job situations, 
but it can also be used during off-the-job training (Bramley 1991, p.59). 
 
It can be concluded that change in both attitude and behaviour can be 
measured by the trainer using the relevant methods to determine the 
extent t o which change has occurred. The rationale is that of making 
explicit what changes in behaviour are expected and the format that can 
be used before and after by the candidates themselves and by their 
managers to give estimates of attitude and behaviour changes. 
 
Having explored the assessment of change in attitude and behaviour, the 
next stage is to find out how training and development bring about 
changes in the levels of effectiveness.
<<<PAGE=261>>>
- 239 -  
4.4.5.4    Changes in levels of effectiveness 
 
The following changes will be presented in this section: individual changes 
in effectiveness, changes in effectiveness in teams, changes in the 
organisational effectiveness and cost changes.  
 
Wynne and Clutterbuck (1994, p.242) and Bramley (1991, p.61) state that 
the purpose for evaluating training and development is to ensure 
improvements in the overall effectiveness of the organisation. The authors 
note that in many organisations for a long time training and development 
have been making their way separately from the needs  of the 
organisation. In looking to the future, training will be effective, and seen to 
be effective, only if it responds to the real business needs.  
 
Amongst others, the main reason for evaluating training and development 
is to determine changes in the l evels of effectiveness at individual, team, 
and organisational levels. This is why organisations invest money in 
training and development. Yet many will argue that training and in 
particular development and management training, cannot be evaluated 
against the organisational effectiveness. This is either because the 
changes due to training and development become indistinguishable from 
the effects of other events, or because the effort of an individual has little 
effect upon the performance of the organisation as a whole (Wynne & 
Clutterbuck 1994, p.242).   
 
Bramley (1991, p.61) partly concurs with some of these arguments by 
noting that it is difficult to isolate the effects of training from other factors 
and it may be impossible to do this if criteria by which change is monitored 
have not been established before that training is designed. Bramley 
agrees that the efforts of an individual are unlikely to have any noticeable 
effect on the balance sheet at the end of the year.
<<<PAGE=262>>>
- 240 -  
There is however , no need to use such  general criteria when looking for 
improvements in the organisational effectiveness. It is possible to focus on 
a small part of the organisation and link improvements in its performance 
with training and development initiatives. The next section will cover  
individual changes in effectiveness.  
 
4.4.5.4.1 Changes in individual effectiveness 
 
Most training and development initiatives focus on the individual with the 
intention that learning should enable the trainee to become more effective 
either in the present job or one which is shortly to be attempted. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.61) believes that if a training need which is to be met is 
identified in terms of the improved performance which should result (rather 
than ‘Mr X needs to attend course Y’), then it should be possible after the 
programme to assess whether this improvement has taken place. This 
may be quantifiable as an increase in productivity. It may also be 
expressed in terms of a wider range of skills and offering increased 
flexibility of employment. 
 
In section (4.5.4.3.3) on using the behaviour scales for assessing change, 
the author suggested that these behaviour scales could make explicit what 
changes were likely and that it might be possible to integrate them with the 
annual performance appraisal categ ories. If this can be done, the 
employing managers will be able to provide evidence of whether changes 
have taken place and, if so, whether increased effectiveness is the result.  
 
One method of assessing increased performance is an improvement in 
the perf ormance appraisal ratings. It should also be possible to show 
increased productivity in the section for which the supervisors were 
responsible.
<<<PAGE=263>>>
- 241 -  
Bramley (1991, p.62) suggests that one way of facilitating  the transfer of 
learning back to work is by using ac tion planning during training. At 
intervals during training, for instance, daily on a five- day course, the 
participants are asked to focus on the utility of what was has been 
discussed. This can be done by giving out coloured sheets of paper and 
asking eac h participant to write down two or three useful things which 
have been covered during the day and could be of use back at work.  
 
The participants also have to make short notes on each item on how they 
intend to make use of it. Some sharing and discussing these will give 
useful feedback on what they think is important learning, but the main 
purpose is to focus on the utility and the build up of an action plan for 
when they return to their work. Towards the end of the programme they 
cluster the items from the sheets into areas and then arrange them in their 
order of priority. The action plan for  the next six months is now drafted by 
putting some time frame on each area to be tackled. It will also be 
necessary to write down against each area likely countervailing forces and 
how these are to be overcome. The questions to be addressed include the 
following: 
 
 Will this action have an affect on other people? 
  How will they react? 
 Whose authority will be necessary to implement this action? How 
do I ensure that this will be available? 
 What organisational constraints are likely to prevent this action?  
 What can be done to ease them? 
 
The action plan is a piece of positive management. It forms a set of goals 
to be achieved and it gives a time frame and rationale for each of them. 
The action plan can be lodged with the course tutors and followed up later. 
Whether or not this happens, the plan should be discussed with the
<<<PAGE=264>>>
- 242 -  
employing managers before or after  a return to work. During the follow -up 
six months later, questions like the following can be asked: 
 
 How much of your action plan have you been able to implement? 
 Which actions have been shelved and why? 
 What positive benefits in terms of effectiveness in your part of the 
organisation have resulted from carrying out your action plan? 
 
A specific form of action planning is through the use of an organisational 
project as the focus for learning, with input from tutors at various stages 
throughout the project. This project normally has a focus on the increased 
effectiveness on the part of the company, and can show a good return for 
the investment in training.  
 
From the above discussion, it can be concluded that the participant’s 
evaluation of the training programme they were taken through can assist 
in pointing at critical in structional flows that may have occurred during the 
delivery of training and it is up to the trainers to notice these grey areas 
with a view to improving the training programme  for the future. In the 
modern workplace organisations have adopted a team -work approach 
which is based on the concept of synergy. A team comprises individual 
members and together they function as a single body for the good of the 
organisation. It is therefore necessary to investigate changes in the 
effectiveness of teams as a result of training. 
 
4.4.5.4.2 Changes in teams’ effectiveness  
 
Team development is intended to improve the effectiveness of a group of 
people whose jobs require that they work together. It assumes:
<<<PAGE=265>>>
- 243 -  
 That the group has the same reason for existing, some common 
goals and problems; 
 That interdependent action is required to achieve the goals or solve 
the problems; and 
 That is it valuable to spend time in trying to understand and 
improve the way in which group members work together to achieve 
their tasks (Bramley 1991, p.64). 
 
Team development activities may focus on working relationships or on 
action planning.  
 
Mangori (2001, p.60) identifies three main models: problem solving, 
interpersonal, and role-identification. 
 
The problem -solving model encourages the group t o identify problem 
areas which are affecting the achievement of group goals. Action planning 
is then used as a method of tackling the problems. The problem -solving 
approach is easier to evaluate than the others as the problems to be 
tackled are clearly identified and defined and they often have an obvious 
connection with some measure of the organisational effectiveness. It can 
often be argued that the increase in effectiveness would not have 
occurred without the development of the team. 
 
The interpersonal m odel attempts to improve decision- making and 
problem-solving by increasing communication and cooperation on the 
assumption that improving interpersonal skills increases the effectiveness 
of the team. The interpersonal approach is usually evaluated in terms  of 
perceived effectiveness. This is not convincing if the intervention needs to 
be justified in terms of organisational benefit, since the results are likely to 
be measured as changes of attitude rather than behaviour. There is also 
the problem of internal validity as, without the use of control groups, it may
<<<PAGE=266>>>
- 244 -  
be difficult to rule out factors other than the team development process 
which could have affected the attitudes measured.  
 
The role- identification model attempts to increase effectiveness by 
increasing understanding of the interacting roles within the group. 
However, evaluation is even more difficult with the use of the role-
identification approach in an organisational setting. The composition of 
each group is unique and the assessment of its improv ed effectiveness 
will therefore have the format of a case study. It should be possible to 
analyse a set of these case study to indicate perceived improvements in 
group working which support s the theory. These perceived improvements 
will certainly imply inc reased awareness on the part of the group 
members, but the links with improved effectiveness of the organisation are 
not easily predictable. 
 
The next section will cover changes in organisational effectiveness. 
  
4.4.5.4.3 Changes in the organisational effectiveness 
 
Zara (2005, p.417) states that one of the current trends in organisational 
evaluation is the desire to measure the effectiveness of training and 
development at the organisational level. For many trainers , evaluation of 
training and development has a vague connotation, but generally 
evaluation of training at organisational level is seen as the process of 
attempting to assess the total value of training and development, that is 
the cost benefit, and the general outcomes which benefit the organisat ion 
as well as the value of the improved performance of those who have 
undertaken training and development (Burcley & Caple 2000, p.182).
<<<PAGE=267>>>
- 245 -  
The cost implications of training will be discussed in the next section. 
 
Buckley and Caple (2000, p.202) note that organisational effectiveness is 
not a simple concept with the balance sheet at the end of the year as the 
only criterion to be assessed. Different authors recommend different ways 
in which one can approach organisational effectiveness. Other authors 
believe it involves organisational evaluation in terms of productivity, 
flexibility, and the absence of organisational strain. The majority of them 
agree on the following; that an effective organisation seeks the 
simultaneous achievement of high production- centred and high people-
centred methods of management.   
 
Burckley and Caple (2000, p.202) bring a different viewpoint into the 
equation. They suggest that organisational effectiveness can be 
summarised under the following headings: 
 
4.4.5.4.3.1 Goals/targets achieved 
 
Burckley and Caple (2000, p.202) state that these goals might be 
expressed in terms of the following indices: unit s produced, improvements 
in productivity, documents processed, items sold, turnover, error and 
reject rates, wastage rates, acciden t rates, profit operating or running 
costs, overtime etc. In other words , the focus is on the output of the 
organisation and how close it comes to meeting its goals. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.73) concurs with Burckley and Caple (2000, p.202) and 
goes further to ex plain that a goal -directed approach to effectiveness 
focuses on meeting goals and targets. Directing and sustaining a goal -
directed effort by employees is a continuous task for most managers, but 
assessment will usually be a series of point measures over t ime. Most 
organisations use basic measurement of work output to meet production
<<<PAGE=268>>>
- 246 -  
goals, where the emphasis is on quality or quantity, variety uniqueness or 
innovativeness of whatever is produced. Types of indices which are 
usually available are shown below in Table 4.1. 
 
 
Quantity Quality Variety 
 
Units produced Defects/failure rate Diversity of the product 
Range              _ Rationalization of 
product range

Applications processed Error rates _

Units sold Waste _ 
Money collected Shortage _ 
On-time deliveries Accidents _

4.4.5.4.3.2 Resource acquisition 
 
The ability of the organisation to acquire resources from an external 
environment will be an important determinant of its present and future 
viability. These needed resources could include: new materials, specialists 
and trained manpower, new customers and markets, or finance.  
 
Bramley (1991, p.74) argues that the importance of looking at resources is 
because resources change the emphasis from output and goals, to the 
input designed to achieve an organisational competitive advantage. At the
<<<PAGE=269>>>
- 247 -  
organisational level, evaluation can be a comparison with major 
competitors, or against how the organisation did last year, or against a 
desired ideal state. At lower levels, increased flexibility is often the 
measure used.  
 
For criteria which might be available for assessing increases in 
effectiveness refer to Table 4.2 below.

Source:  Bramley (1991, p.74). 
 
Developing accountability and responsibility of departments is widely seen 
as contributing to the flexibility of the organisati ons faced with an ever -
changing environment. Training is a necessary part of this process and 
can be evaluated on the basis of what effects would have been likely if no 
training had been offered (Bramley 1991, p.74).
<<<PAGE=270>>>
- 248 -  
4.4.5.4.3.3  Constituencies 
 
An organi sational effectiveness can be judged by how well the 
organisation responds to the demands and the expectations of 
stakeholders such as resource providers, and customers’ complaints, 
consumer survey, meeting order deadlines, goods returned, internal 
attitude surveys, and audits.  
 
Burckley & Caple (2000, p.202) explain that this assessment involves 
indicators of the extent to which the expectations of internal and external 
clients and constituents have been satisfied.  Organisational effectiveness 
can be meas ured by the extent to which the organisation meets the 
expectations of groups whose co -operation is important for the success of 
the company. The constituency’s assessment will be against the following 
criteria: customer complaints, returned material, repair orders, repair 
orders on guarantee, company image surveys, customer relations 
surveys, recall costs, receipt of goods, product or service quality, incorrect 
goods received, meeting statutory requirements. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.75) observes that most organis ations monitor criteria of 
this nature but few publish information on the same. One rather useful 
study which attempted to relate this kind of criterion with training was that 
of (Massey1999, p. 42).  Massey (1999, p.42) described a programme  of 
post offic e training and showed that the number of misdeliveries and 
errors (as well as absence without reporting and abuse of sick leave) 
decreased in the trained group when compared with an ‘untrained’ group. 
“How do we know that we are properly dealing with human resources 
functions”? (Massey, 1999, 143) 
 
 In order t o address this question, it  is important that the organisation 
considers its internal processes.
<<<PAGE=271>>>
- 249 -  
 
4.4.5.4.3.4 Internal processes  
 
The manner in which the organisation deals with its human resources 
issues influences its effectiveness. 
 
Burckley and Caple (2000, p.202) state that internal processes indicate 
how well the organisation is dealing with operational matters. This may be 
an important indicator of organisational health, and ultimately the 
effectiveness of other measures. Signs and symptoms of this may come 
from: staff attitudes and morale, levels of conflicts, absenteeism, turnover, 
transfer requests, grievances, disciplinary actions, group working, speed 
of re -organisation and change, quality, level and extent of internal 
communication.  
 
Bramley (1991, p.75) states that the feeling of belonging and commitment 
often predisposes people to put in extra effort to achieve organisational 
goals. At the group level this is referred to as morale. An i nternal 
processes approach may also be assessed by measuring the following: 
 
 Whether the staff believe that effort will be rewarded; 
 The motivating climate; 
 Job involvement; 
 Job satisfaction; and  
 Group cohesiveness.  
 
Bramley (1991, p.76) is of the belief that training can impact on patterns of 
work within certain departments of the organisation, for instance by 
increasing the quality of decision- making, planning, or supervision. 
Training can help improve working within groups and between groups. It 
can also  help people to cope with reduced staff levels and with time
<<<PAGE=272>>>
- 250 -  
management. Many of these activities can affect the attitude of managers 
and staff and these changes may affect the statistics associated with low 
morale.  
 
It can therefore be concluded,  that ch anges due to training and 
development initiatives can be measured and assessed to determine the 
extent to which the initiative has made a difference at individual, group 
and organisational level. Delivery of training and its evaluation involves 
money, ther efore trainers must know the cost effectiveness of a 
programme. 
 
4.4.5.5 Cost of changes 
 
This section on evaluating changes due to training and development 
would not be complete without discussing cost effectiveness and the need 
for cost-benefit analysis. 
 
Although few trainers conduct costing activities, there are those who 
prefer a cost changes approach to determine the impact of training and 
development in monetary terms. The trainer has at his disposal the cost 
changes and the return on investment appr oach to determine the 
worthiness of training and development in an organisation. However, this 
section will only cover a detailed discussion on the former and the latter 
will be covered in chapter five. 
 
According to Bramley (1991, p.80), costing, cost-benefit analysis and cost-
effectiveness analysis are rather complex fields a nd trainers need to be 
well versed in these areas to obtain meaningful results.
<<<PAGE=273>>>
- 251 -  
4.4.5.5.1 Costing 
 
Bramley (1991, p.78) notes that some of words have been used differently 
with di fferent meanings when applied to costs and benefits and it is 
important to give a brief definition of these phrases: 
 
 Improving efficiency means achieving the same result by using less 
costs; 
 Improving effectiveness means achieving better results with the 
same cost; and 
 It is possible to get better results with lower costs and this is 
referred to as improved productivity.  
 
Costing differs from organisation to organisation and liaising with the 
accounting department is important for ensuring that the system  adopted 
for training costs is compatible with other costing systems within the 
organisation.  A simple matrix for costing training events is shown in Table 
4.3.

Table: 4.3 Costing for Training Events 
Source:  Bramley (1991, p.78) 
 
4.4.5.5.2 Design 
 
The cost of design can be spread over the life of the programme  (i.e. 
shared by the proposed number of programmes ) as it will otherwise 
account for 50 per cent of the overall costs. As a rough guideline, 
technical courses will require five hours of preparation for a programme  
that will take one hour to deliver. Programme d or packaged instruction will 
be much more expensiv e for example, a 100- hours design is needed for 
one hour of instruction. With computer -based learning, the ratio can be as 
high as 400:1. 
 
 The cost of designing the learning event will include things like: 
 
 Costs of preliminary analysis of training needs, development of
<<<PAGE=275>>>
- 253 -  
objectives, course development, lesson planning, programme ming, 
audio-visual aids production, consultant advice, and contractors; 
 Office telephone; and 
 Production of workbooks, slides, tapes, tests, programmes , printing 
and reproduction. 
 
4.4.5.5.3 Delivery  
 
Delivery includes the actual costs of running the event. In these are 
included, amongst others, the following: 
   
 Some proportion of annual salaries of trainers, lecturers, trainees,  
clerical/administration staff, cost of consultant s and outside 
lecturers travel costs; 
 Cost of conference centres or upkeep of classrooms, buildings, 
offices, accommodation and food, office supplies and expenses ; 
and 
 Equipment for delivering the training – slides, projectors, videos, 
computers, simulators, workbooks, maintenance and repair of aids, 
expendable training materials or some proportion of costs relative 
to lifetime, handouts, hire of films. 
 
4.4.5.5.4 Evaluation  
 
The cost of evaluation is usually low compared with the other two 
elements. The probable costs include: 
 
 Cost of designing questionnaires, follow -up interviews, travel, 
accommodation, analysis and summary of data collected, delivering 
the evaluation report;  
 Offices, telephones ; and
<<<PAGE=276>>>
- 254 -  
 Test, questionnaires and postages. 
 
It is important to give a general overview of the expenses of maintaining 
the training department. This may be allocated to individual training 
programmes on the basis of hours of participants learning, tutor 
involvement and level of administration required.  
 
4.4.5.5.5 Cost-effectiveness comparisons 
 
Bramley (1991, p.79) is of the view that cost effectiveness analysis allows 
the trainer to cost programmes  and use this as a basis for comparing 
them. There is a common assumption that the level of programme  
effectiveness will be similar and t hus the cheaper, more efficient  form of 
delivery should be chosen. It is also possible to compare the effectiveness 
of programmes and then offer a rationale for deciding whether the 
increased effectiveness of one programme  justifies the ex tra cost. This 
comparison is more convincing when pilot versions of the two 
programmes are run, so that the actual, rather than estimated, levels of 
effectiveness can be used. 
 
4.4.5.5.6 Cost-benefit analysis    
 
In cost -benefit analysis the intention is t o discover whether the benefits 
from training are more valuable to the organisation than the cost of 
training. Whenever possible, benefits are translated into monetary terms. 
Many products of training can be costed: 
 
 Product benefit like increased volume or quality of product; 
 System benefits like increased productivity or efficiency, reduced 
job-induction training time; 
 Hygiene benefit like reduced turnover, absenteeism and strikes;and
<<<PAGE=277>>>
- 255 -  
 Reduction in accidents (perhaps costs which are inherent when not 
training). 
 
4.4.5.5.7 Value-added employees 
 
The logic underlying cost -benefit analysis is not particularly appropriate to 
training and development initiatives because the benefits are diffused and 
take some time to be realised. A more compelling logic is to co nsider the 
process as one adding value to employees. Before training, employees 
are considered to need extra skills, kn owledge, flexibility or whether  they 
are able to work effectively. After training they should be able to perform 
better and thus be of gr eater value to the organisation. It should be 
possible to attribute some of this added value to the investment in training 
and development. 
 
Bramley (1991, p.81) notes that the value- added approach has 
assumptions underlying it which need to be analysed. The first assumption 
is to take a rather simple definition of performance at work. There is 
extensive literature on why some people perform well and others do not. 
The complexity of the literature is increased by the inclusion of the 
concept of motivation. There are many theories about what encourages 
and discourages good performance. Chepkilot (2005, p.85) supports the 
view that training and development is used by many organisations to 
enhance the motivation of their employees. The availability of training and 
development opportunities is a motivating factor for employees in the 
organisation. 
 
For the purpose of value- added accounting a simple performance theory 
is needed. One approach to this theory is to take a simple combination of 
three major elements which appear more often in the theoretical 
approaches. These include the following:
<<<PAGE=278>>>
- 256 -  
 
 There is a need for some abilities or skills in areas  which are 
relevant to the work; 
 There must be some motivation to do the job (this may stem from 
the job content or the individual); and  
 There must be an opportunity to use the skills and actually perform 
the job. 
 
A simple equation can be used to express this theory 
 
Performance = function of (skills X motivation X opportunity). 
The implication of the multiplication signs  is that, if there is no skill or 
motivation or opportunity, the performance will be minimal if not zero. 
 
Value-added accounting begins with a pre- training analysis which 
estimates the position of the individual with respect to the average level of 
skill and motivation of employees who are doing that kind of a job. 
 
The scaling is done against a set of proportions (see Figure 4.5) below: 
 
 The middle 40 per cent are considered to be average; 
 Those who are noticeably above average w ill represent about 25 
per cent; 
 Those noticeably below average will also comprise 25 per cent; 
 Those outstanding will be about 1 in 20, i.e. 5 per cent, and  
 Those who are outstandingly bad will also constitute about 5 per 
cent. 
 
From the above it is clear that employees can add v alue to the training 
and development initiatives and to  the bottom -line of the organisation.
<<<PAGE=279>>>
- 257 -  
Employee development through training and development will not only 
add value, but can improve organisational efficiency and effectiveness. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.3:  Normal Distribution of Ability 
Source:  Bramley (1991, p.82). 
 
 
These proportions have been chosen because they force the distribution 
of skills or motivation into a normal statistical distribution, with the 
midpoints of t he bands close to whole standard deviations, as shown in 
Figure 4. 3. The next and last is the estimated levels of performance 
(assuming opportunity) which are aimed at clarifying the logic of the value-
added approach. 
 
4.4.5.5.8 Estimated levels of performance (assuming opportunity) 
 
Figure 4.6 should clarify the logic of the value- added approach. For an 
example, an employee who is considered to have average motivation (1.0) 
but whose skills are noticeably below average (0.67) is estimated to be 
                                    5% 
                                     -2 
                       25%

    40%

- 258 -  
performing at 0.67 of what is expected in the job. If training can bring this 
person to average levels of skill, his increment in performance is 0.3 and 
the value added to the employee by training is, therefore, 0.3 of the salary 
for the job. 
 
Employees who are noticeably below average in both skills and motivation 
are obviously being estimated as having a very low level of performance. 
It may be that they could be better employed in some other kind of work. 
Employees who are noticeably above average or who are considered to 
be outstanding might also be considered for re- deployment. It may well be 
that the training investment should be on supervisory and management 
training. If employees are thought to have the motivation but lack some 
important skills, then the investment should be in employee skills training.  
Bramley (1991, p.84) provides three assumptions which must be taken 
into consideration: 
 
 Can managers allocate people to these proportions? Some 
managers believe that all their people are above average. The 
majority of managers have great difficulty with trying to measure 
people on the scale of motivation; 
 Is there the opportunity to use skills and the encouragement to 
maintain the motivation when new skills are being used? If the 
opportunity is not available, the whole logic collapses; and 
 Are the skills which are required for successful job performance 
being identified accurately, and are they being learned in training?

estimate can be used for forward planning of training investment. If the 
plan is intended to offer training and group facilitation to introduce group 
and individual target setting which are related to the business plan, the 
intention would be to improve motivation and increase the opportunity to 
use the skills available. If training and development is to move most 
people who were previously considered average o above the norm, either 
on skills or motivation, the benefit to the organisation would be enormous.   
 
In conclusion, cost -benefit accounting, which aims at summarising all the 
outcomes in monetary terms, usually leaves out many things which are 
important because they cannot be converted into hard cash. Value added 
calculations have an advantage of usually being the only part of 
evaluation. The evaluation reports describe the outcomes in their own 
terms and a conclusion is then drawn that these do (or do not) imply a 
significant increase in skills and or motivation. The section of the report 
which deals with costs can then include a value- added calculation which 
indicates that there has been some return on investment, a concept which 
will be discussed in chapter five.  
 
The next section will present a discussion on how training and 
development could be evaluated through the proper implementation of 
performance management. 
 
 
4.4.6 Evaluating training and development through the 
implementation of a performance management system    
 
This section will cover a discussion on yet another training evaluation 
strategy which is an important link between training and development and 
performance. It is critical to investigate how the evaluation of training and
<<<PAGE=283>>>
- 261 -  
development in an organisation improves individual, group and 
organisational performance.  
 
In order to ensure that training and development priorities are met, it is 
imperative that the training courses be evaluated in terms of their 
effectiveness and efficiency as previously discussed in (section 4.5.4.4). 
The concept of evaluation has been covered in (section 4.2) while 
performance management has been discussed in detail in (section 3.4.3) 
of chapter three. Performance management in the Botswana public 
service has, since 1998 been transformed and the process is currently 
more developed in nature and is based on collaborative decision- making 
between the employee and his or her supervisor. 
 
Different evaluation models and schools of thought will be discussed 
within the context of  training and performance management. The more 
traditional schools of thought are highlighted , but attention is focused on 
implementing a model of evaluation that will benefit the Botswana public 
service goals and objectives as well as individual employee development 
needs. The section will conclude with a discussion on the strengths and 
weaknesses of the current training and development system in the public, 
parastatal and private organisations. 
 
4.4.6.1 Fundamentals of training evaluation 
 
Critten (1995, p.157) states that defining evaluation can be equated with 
trying to define quality where you can recognise the outcome, but defining 
it is not an easy task. Evaluation deals with determining the total value of a 
training course. It does not validate the i mplementation of a training 
course in terms of its deliverables. Evaluation draws attention to the 
judgement about the effect of putting the objectives into practice.
<<<PAGE=284>>>
- 262 -  
Validation becomes part of evaluation in terms of determining the 
appropriateness and practical applicability of a chosen course. 
 
The purpose of evaluation is threefold. Firstly, to gather information that 
would provide a framework for the improvement of future courses 
regarding the same training needs (formative role). Secondly, judgements 
will be made based on the training course’s value in terms of its total 
effects (summative role) and thirdly, in order to ensure that challenges 
identified during the implementation of a training course are not duplicated 
(Critten 1995, p.158).  
 
Critten (1995, p.158) stipulates that a central principle of evaluation is “to 
extract the value”. However, determining the value of training courses has 
not been a central concern with either trainers or trainees. Evaluation is 
described as the fourth step in the t raining cycle. Without evaluation, 
determining appropriate performance standards would not be possible and 
the reciprocal relationship between performance management and 
appropriate training and development initiatives could not be applied. 
 
Critten (1995, p.158) states that evaluation has become synonymous with 
collecting information about training programmes  that have been 
implemented. The gathering of information will however , not provide the 
organisation with an evaluation of the training programmes . Th e 
information has to be articulated in order to add value to decisions 
regarding future training and development initiatives. 
 
The problem statement in chapter one highlighted that training and 
development in the Botswana public service might not be addres sing 
public service and individual needs simultaneously. Due to a lack of 
evaluation of training programmes, employees might be sent for training 
that does not satisfy their training needs due to an ad- hoc needs analysis

at the beginning of the training process. There should be a clear link in the 
public service between training and development, evaluation and 
performance management. The process of strategic implementation of 
performance management within the context of training and development 
will now be discussed. 
 
4.4.6.2 Implementing performance management to enhance 
evaluation 
 
Since 1998, the Botswana public service has been extensively involved in 
formulating policies for the implementation of a performance management 
system. The Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President was 
responsible for formulating the performance management framework 
pertaining to senior management in the public service sector. The Director 
for the Department of Public Service Management also formulated the 
performance m anagement framework for the rest of the public service 
(DPSM 2003, p.18). 
 
In c hapter three, section 3.4.3.5 of this research, it is stated that 
performance management needs to be integrated with all levels in the 
organisation for it to be effective. It is  therefore appropriate, to adopt an 
effective performance management approach. The approach should focus 
on continuous improvement of performance, be driven by senior 
management and should be strategically aligned with departmental and 
organisational goals and priorities. 
 
Kgarebe (2004, p.78) states that the introduction of performance-
management system guidelines formulated for operators and 
performance-improvement co -ordinators was a milestone in providing 
policy measures and guidelines for the effective and efficient 
implementation of the performance management process in the public
<<<PAGE=286>>>
- 264 -  
service. Performance management is aimed at optimising the potential 
and current employee output in terms of quality and quantity, increasing 
the public service overall performance (DPSM 2003, p.19). The policy 
document on performance does not only link the importance of human 
resources training and development with individual development, but also 
with departmental and organisational performance increases. 
 
Kgarebe (2004, p.7 8) further emphasises that the objectives of the policy 
document are to establish a performance culture that would reward and 
recognise good performance in the public service, be used as a vehicle for 
implementing the public service goals and priorities, f acilitate continuous 
performance improvement and organisational development. The policy 
document aims to continuously enhance individual employee competence 
through identifying outputs relating to training and development needs.  
 
The main principle of performance management that relates directly to the 
problem statement of this thesis is that performance in the public service 
has been unsatisfactory regardless of vigorous training and development 
initiatives undertaken by the Botswana government to improve the same. 
It is apparent that training and development initiatives undertaken without 
proper implementation and evaluation will not produce the anticipated 
results as far as performance improvement is concerned.  
 
It should however , also be mentioned that  the new performance 
management system had not been implemented during 1999. It was only 
implemented during 2000 and thus fell outside the timeframe of its roll-out.  
 
The impact of PMS was evaluated by a consultancy firm Ernst and Young 
in 2003. According to the report there were major areas of concern which 
include:
<<<PAGE=287>>>
- 265 -  
 People struggle with the PMS and find it to be technical; 
 Slow implementation, e.g. resources, a long time is needed to 
prepare objectives and PMS training is slow; 
 System not yet cascaded down to lower levels or to individuals; 
 People want more guidance on how to do things; 
 Vacuum created as a result of loss or transfer of performance 
improvement co-ordinators;  
 People do not understand the role of the Department of Public 
Service Management (DPSM) and expect more from it; 
 New performance improvement co-ordinators are untested; 
 Appraisal system being re-designed in isolation; 
 Current PMS is not linked to training and development; 
 Supervision and appraisal are difficult in outlying areas, and 
 There is minimal link age to good or poor performance  (DPSM 
2003, p.28).   
 
It is clear from the above PMS shortcomings that training even in this 
instance is still a challenge to managers responsible for reform 
programmes in the Botswana public service. It is also evident that from its 
last evaluation report the PMS has not been impressive, looking at the 
amount of money spent on this initiative. 
 
The link between performance management and training and 
development is crucial. It can almost be seen as parts of an unbroken 
cycle. If performance management is not implemented correctly, as is the 
case with the Botswana public service PMS, it will not influence  the 
management of the skills and competence gap. Training priorities will not 
be determined according t o the detrimental needs, but will be based on 
individual perceptions of what is lacking and what is appropriate. Without 
the strategic link between performance management and training, neither 
individual nor departmental training goals nor objectives will be achieved.
<<<PAGE=288>>>
- 266 -  
4.4.6.2.1 Performance management cycle   
 
As discussed in section (3.4.3.4), the performance management cycle 
begins with establishing standards of performance. Because of the 
interrelationship between planning and control, control should start early in 
the planning stage. A performance standard is a projection of an expected 
or planned performance outcome, taking into account a specific time 
frame. During the setting of performance standards , the objectives and 
goals should be specified in order to facilitate the assessment of actual 
performance (Smit & Cronje 1997, p.401). 
 
The PMS policy guideline is formulated in such a way that the 
performance agreements of individual employees will be based on the 
departmental strategic plan, in order to ensure strategic alignment 
between departmental training priorities and individual tr aining goals and 
objectives and the functional plans of the individual components. 
Performance management systems were rolled out to ministries as 
effective in April 1999, and the performance assessment takes place on a 
quarterly basis. The formal annual assessment concides with the fourth 
quarterly assessment (DPSM 2003, p.28).  
 
Mogalakwe (2004, p.67) states that a process involving performance 
management will ensure that employees are properly supervised, are 
correctly placed, promotions and transfers will be the best advantage of 
both the department and the individual employee and, most importantly, 
careers will be systematically  and purposefully developed. 
 
The performa nce assessment report is the main source of training 
information for the organisation. Employees are able to identify 
shortcomings in knowledge and experience. The performance contract 
should stipulate an individual development plan. Section 18, chapter eight
<<<PAGE=289>>>
- 267 -  
of the PMS Policy Guideline (DPSM 2003, p.32), stipulates that in order to 
address the gap that may exist between the required competency profile 
and the actual competencies, a training and development plan should be 
designed by means of a collaborative   process between the manager and 
subordinate(s). The principle of including a personal development plan as 
part of the performance contract of all employees, is in the process of 
being implemented (DPSM 2003, p.34). 
 
The Department of Public Service Management (2003, p.34) stipulates 
that all performance agreements should contribute to the achievement of 
departmental objectives highlighted in the strategic plan of the 
department. In order to address the gap between current capacity and 
required competencies, a personal development plan should be part of the 
performance management system. The personal development plan will 
consist of a training and development plan specifically designed for the 
individual employee. The training and development needs will not only be 
identified through performance assessments , but also upon appointment 
when a work plan is developed (Mogalakwe 2004, p.69). 
 
There is evidence that the Botswana public service is perceived to be 
unable to transform itself or its individual performance targets according to 
the training received.  
 
The outcome of t he Ernst and Young report (DPSM  2003, p.36) suggests 
that currently the performance management system does not inform 
training and development and that when training has been received, the 
programme is not evaluated against pre- determined training objectives. 
Thus, training takes place for the sake of being able to show that 
employees have had access to training and development opportunities, 
but it could be argued that the provisioning and implementation of training
<<<PAGE=290>>>
- 268 -  
programmes are not evaluated or strategically linked to enhancing 
individual or departmental capacity. 
 
Mangori (2001, p.12) states that the reasoning behind training and 
development initiatives is to enhance the capacity, not only of the 
individual, but more importantly of the department and the organisation at 
large. Performance indicators identified in the PMS policy guidelines are 
core management criteria consisting of three competencies. These 
competencies include: people m anagement and empowerment, financial 
management and client service and customer care, which  have been 
identified as compulsory competencies for all senior managers. In most 
cases, the identified competencies for senior managers have also trickled 
down to t he lower management levels, where aspects such as people 
management are crucial.  Training courses can be used as ways in which 
performance can be improved. 
 
Van Dijk (2003, p.162) is of the view that once a training opportunity has 
been identified, employees are placed in a position to determine how their 
performance will improve if they receive that training. However, if some 
sort of control mechanism (in this case a performance agreement) is not 
attached to the implementation of the newly acquired skills , the chances 
are that due to the fact that re-inforcement does not occur, new knowledge 
will not be transformed into wisdom.  
 
Performance assessment implies that progress should be determined in 
terms of attaining goals and objectives that were set during the last 
assessment period. Lack of information filtering from management, 
indicates that employees do not realise the strategic importance of training 
and development in terms of realising departmental effectiveness and 
efficiency. Because of a lack of information provided by senior
<<<PAGE=291>>>
- 269 -  
management, employees decide which training would satisfy their own 
perceptions regarding personal career development. 
 
Van Dijk (2003, p.163) adds that in most cases , training takes place for 
the sake of individual fulfilment and that does not necessarily concide with 
departmental training priorities. For instance, senior managers could 
decide that they need to further their educational qualifications, something 
that might take three to five years. However, according to their  
performance contracts, they have only been appointed for a period of 
three years. Thus, the training does satisfy individual development needs 
and if they finish their qualifications, it would also benefit the department, 
but finishing their qualification might not happen during the period of their 
employment. Their department can therefore, not justify spending 
resources on individual development if the development is not aligned with 
the departmental goals and objectives. 
 
Mpabanga (2003, p.39) points ou t that part of the performance 
management system is offering incentives to employees to better their 
performance. Both the PMS Policy Guideline and the Performance Based-
Reward System emphasise the importance of offering rewards and 
recognition of performance, not only in terms of departmental goals and 
objectives but also, for individual performance.  
 
4.4.6.2.2   Recognition and reward 
 
Part of the performance management system policy guidelines is the use 
of rewards and recognition as incentives for improved indiv idual or group 
performance. The departmental policy regarding rewards is prescribed in 
terms of the Performance -Based Reward System (DPSM 2004, p.134) 
and dictates decisions regarding promotion, pay progression, performance
<<<PAGE=292>>>
- 270 -  
bonus allocation, non- financial rewards or the initiation of the incapacity 
process. 
 
The PBRS (c hapter 4, section 2. 3) describes an example of non- financial 
rewards that may be allocated to senior managers, including increased 
autonomy to organise their work, explicit acknowledgement and 
recognition in publications or public awards in recognition of specific 
achievement or innovation. The executing authority, in this case, the 
Permanent Secretary to the President has in him the discretionary powers 
to allocate performance rewards (cash bonuses) to senior managers. 
There is a provision that only employees who have signed the 
performance agreement are eligible for performance rewards.      
 
Mogalakwe (2004, p.71) describes factors that could influence 
performance decisions made by superviso rs. The attitude of employees 
regarding the implementation of a new system, as would be the case in 
the public service, the supervisor’s own subjective norms and the tone of 
the appraisal meeting are some of the factors contributing to decisions 
made during performance assessment. 
 
Kgarebe (2004, p.79) defines that performance management is the 
process that measures individual employee performance against set 
performance standards and therefore,  evaluation becomes part of the 
process, especially where training and development initiatives have been 
identified that would address poor performance.  
 
With regard to a learning organisation, evaluation is an integral part of the 
extent to which the Botswana public service will be able to adapt to 
changes suggested  through evaluating training and development 
initiatives, and such training should enhance departmental capacity which 
will lead to improved public service delivery.

4.5 A MODEL FOR EVALUATING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
INITIATIVES 
 
This section will comme nce with a discussion of a theoretical model for 
evaluating training and development initiatives. This model will be based 
on the implementation of effective training and development and 
strategies for evaluating training and development covered in c hapter 3. 
The various aspects of evaluation discussed in this chapter are also 
incorporated into the model. 
 
The nine training and development models which have been examined 
(see section 3 .6) and the theoretical discussions in this chapter have 
provided the major elements for a model for evaluating training and 
development initiatives.  
 
The model is designed to collect data from government 
ministries/departments and parastatal organisation’s evaluation of training 
and development in order to determine the effectiveness of their training 
endevours. More importantly to establish how much training and 
development improves service delivery in the Botswna public service. 
 
A model for evaluating training and development initiatives is shown 
diagrammatically in Figure 4.7 and each of the steps is discussed below.

- 273 -  
PHASE 1:  IDENTIFY TRAINING NEEDS 
 
The first strategy in evaluating trai ning and development deals with identifying 
training needs and priorities. The identification of training needs and priorities is  a 
critical step in the evelaution process , as this will provide information necessary to 
design the entire training  and development programme . Many programmes are 
doomed to failure because the trainers are more interested in conducting the 
training programme than first identifying training needs.  Training needs should be 
indentified both at individual and organisational level. 
 
If training and development are to be the rem edy of poor performance, there is a 
need that the organisation determines its training needs before anything else in the 
training ev aluation process. The first step involves training managers coming up 
with proper organisational needs. Identification of or ganisational needs will assist 
the trainer in designing and developing a relevant effective training and 
development initiative that will go a long way in addressing organisational 
performance problems. 
 
The second step in identifying training needs is for  the training manager to specify 
employee performance. Employees have to understand what their jobs entail and 
link between training and their individual performance. The involvement of 
employees in the identifying  of training needs is of paramount importance. The 
training department in conjuction with line managers should address individual 
employees’ training needs through a formal performance appraisal of each 
employee, but if appraisal or performance management is conducted annually, then 
the appraisal information will be o utdated come the time when empl oyees training 
needs are determined or identified. It was stated in section 3.3.4 that empl oyees’ 
training and development is meant to improve individual employees’ performance, 
therefore the training manager identify employees training needs taking their 
performance management seriously.
<<<PAGE=296>>>
- 274 -  
It is important for line managers and supervisors to appraise employee performance 
at least twice a year for it to have a realistic impact on training and development 
particularly to assist the trainer identify employee training needs. It is during the 
appraisal that the trainer and line manager will be able to identify performance 
deficiencies that can be addressed through training and development.  
 
Most importantly the trainers should: 
 
 Specify employee’s critical performance areas; 
 Examine both short-term and strategic organisational goals;   
 Examine the current trends whether they are likely to affect the strategic 
organisational goals;  
 Identify any deficiency in kn owledge and skill s of the trainees measured 
against individual employee’s job requirements; and 
 Prioritise trai ning needs according to their aligment to the strategic 
organisational goals. 
 
PHASE 2:   PLAN STRATEGICALLY FOR TRAINING  
 
The second strategy deals with strategic planning for training and development in 
order have an effective evaluation process. If strategic planning is not carried out, 
there is  the likelihood that training will be ad hoc and unco- ordinated. Therefore , 
training and development should be accorded the seriousness they deserve if 
strategic organisational goals and objectives are to be reali sed. Training as part of 
strategic business plan has to be well -planned from the onset for it to bring the 
desired changes. 
 
Planning for a training programme is one of the critical step in the training process 
and it requires training managers and trainers be fully aware of the function of 
training in achieving strategic organisational goals.
<<<PAGE=297>>>
- 275 -  
The training manager and trainer must ensure that all training department members 
are: 
 
 Aware of the strategic direction of the organisation; 
 Understand the overall business strategic goals and those of their 
department when planning for training and development; and 
 Ensure that all stakeholders are participates in the planning stage.  
 
PHASE 3:   ESTABLISH TRAINING OBJECTIVES 
 
Once planning has taken place, the next phase is for the trainer to establish training 
and development objectives. Training and development objectives guide the 
training to be relevant and these objectives are directly linked to the individual 
trainee’s and the overall strategic goals of the organisation. This link is important in 
the sense that training should be aimed at a particular achievement, and therefore,  
there is a need for the establishment of training objectives. 
 
Training objectives should spell out what the organisation or the trainer wants to 
achieve. As these training objectives form the basis of training standards and 
evaluation of training and development, it is necessary  that these objectives should 
be set out in measurable terms.  
 
Trainers must ensure that these training objectives are spefic in terms of  the 
terminal behaviours trainees should display at the end of the programme . Trainers 
must also ensure that each objective describes a specific behavioural action. The 
objective must indicate the standard of performance required, expressed in terms of 
number, degree and accuracy. 
 
Having indicated the required performance standard, it important for the trainer to 
make sure that the individual trainee is made aware from the onset o f these
<<<PAGE=298>>>
- 276 -  
standards and how their individual capalities can be developed to achieve the 
required performance standards.  
 
PHASE 4:    DESIGN TRAINING PROGRAMME 
 
The amount of learning which must be absorbed to produce new behaviours is used 
to develop the training programme . An effective training programme can 
fundamentally change an employee’s effectiveness at work. Training managers and 
trainers must involve all the stakeholders when designing a t raining programme. 
Achieving this collaborative training des ign involves interrogation of st akeholders. 
By connecting with those people that are most likely to be affected by the 
outcomes, trainers are more likely to be able to achieve their aim. There is  a need 
for the trainer to engage others in a dialoque process and decide on the training 
methods suitable for the proposed training programme.  
 
Training methods can be categoris ed as on- the-job or off -the-job and include 
decisions on the type of techniques required. The selection of training techniques 
must be taken into consideration as well as the application of learning principles 
which ensure effective evaluation. These techniques may be experientially oriented 
such as role plays, case studies and group discussions, or didactic such as lectures 
and presentations.  
 
The trainer needs to consider the following when designing a training programme: 
 
 The trainer needs to ask himself/herself who the trainees are. 
 The trainer must be clear on the purpose of training,  
 Who is the training for? 
 Who is undertaking the training? 
 Who is the learner, or who are the leaners?
<<<PAGE=299>>>
- 277 -  
In addition, to the above questions,  the trainer needs to be able to identify learner 
entry behaviour and this will include a wide variety of different issues including their 
previous experience, their experience on the job, and their experience in the 
organisation.  
 
Having thought about the learner, the trainer now determines the learning 
objectives. A good learning approach must be behavioural  in approach. Now that 
the trainer is focusing on performance improvement, that statement of an objective 
has its core verb. It is something the that the employee will do as a result of training, 
better still it is something they can demonstrate, and which  can be observed and 
measured.  
 
PHASE 5: SCHEDULE THE PROGRAMME 
 
Besides identifying training needs, establishing the training and development 
objectives and planning and designing the programme , the trainer needs to 
schedule the training programme.  
 
In scheduling the programme the trainer must consider the following questions: 
 
 Are there possible seasonal fluctuations or peak production periods which 
would make it difficult for the trainees to be relased to attend the 
programme? 
 Is it better to run the c ourse for a period of one week over five continous 
days or should it be run one day a week over a period of five weeks? 
 Should the programme  be run during working hours or outside working 
hours?  
 
It is important that training is not schedule d during peak production periods when 
the demands are high on potential trainees. Ideally, from the standpoint of learning 
and attitude change, the programme  should be conducted during non- peak
<<<PAGE=300>>>
- 278 -  
production periods and over a number of of consecutive days. It would be 
necessary for the potential traine to be released from their normal duties so the can 
devote their time and attention to the programme.  
 
PHASE 6:    PRESENT THE PROGRAMME 
 
Presenting a training programme is the cuilmination of all activities of the training 
design process. In order to ensure an efficient presentation of the programme, the 
trainer must make provision for a wide variety of le arning experiences and app ly 
specific guidelines and principles. 
  
Sound planning is a pre- requisite for good presentation. During the planning , the 
trainer must ensure that the content of the training programme corresponds with the 
expected learnining outcomes and that the  content satisfies the needs of t he target 
group.  
 
When the programme has been planned and designed the trainer is in a position to 
present the programme. 
 
The trainer needs to ensure that the right learning climate is created at the 
commencement of the programme . The trainer may consider using the pre- tests 
and post-tests to assist in the evaluation of tr ainees.The trainer must also make the 
trainees aware of the results he expects , as communicating these expectations can 
influence the results to be achieved. 
 
The trainer must be clear on what type of behaviour is required for the learners in 
terms of the learning outcomes. Other aspects to be considered include learners’ 
attitude, previous experience and knowledge levels, and the expected outcomes in 
this regard. Onl y the learning material needed to realise the outcomes should be 
dealt with. Unnecessary details must be left out.
<<<PAGE=301>>>
- 279 -  
PHASE 7:  ENSURE TRANSFER AND IMPLEMENTION OF     
  PROGRAMME  
 
A training programme cannot be considered complete and successful if the trainee 
does not transfer and implement the appropriate knowledge, skills and attitudes 
which are required in the training course, in their work situation. 
 
There is a need for the trainer to facilitate  the outcomes of training through the 
training process. It is clear that there is no value in waiting until af ter the 
performance of the training programme before planning and facilitating the transfer 
of training.  
 
Even though it is not easy to ensure the transfer and implementation of training, it is 
important that the trainer ensures that the transfer of learning takes place. 
 
PHASE 8: MAINTAIN TRAINING 
 
The immediate transfer and implementation of the appropriate knowledge, skills and 
attitudes is no gurantee that the trainee will continue to us e them in the long term. 
The trainer therefore,  plays a critical role in the maintenance of the training . The 
supervisor should continuously support the trainee through re- inforcement and 
reward. Any forces in the work situation that work  against the transfer and 
maintenance of training should be eliminated. 
 
PHASE 9:  EVALUATE TRAINING 
 
The evaluation of tr aining and developmenet entails reviewing how training has 
been concducted,  in order to determine whether proper guidelines for the 
implementation of an effective training programme were used. In order for the 
trainer to establish the extent to which these  guidelines are adhered to, the trainer 
must be able to answer the following questions:
<<<PAGE=302>>>
- 280 -  
 
 Were needs diagnosed? 
 Was there a knowledge or skill deficiency? 
 Were the needs organisationally important? 
 Were the needs transferred to objectives? 
 Were the organisa tional needs transferred to strategic organisational 
objectives? 
 Were the prerequisite learning objectives derived f rom the overall training 
objectives? 
 Were trainees assessed to determine the number of prerequisite learning 
objectives they were deficient in? 
 Was the evaluation system des igned to measure the achievement of the 
objectives? 
 Was the training programme  designed to meet the specific learning, training 
and organisational objectives? 
 
PHASE 10: EVALUATE CHANGE DUE TO TRAINING AND    
  DEVELOPMENT 
 
The trainer uses summative evaluation to evaluate the final product with more 
emphasis being on programme appraisal using the outcome criteria. The trainer 
must take stock o f the impact training had on the trainees’ attitude, behaviour, skill 
and knowledge. 
 
The outcome evaluation focuses on the four -level evaluation. In this evaluation,  the 
following should be considered: 
 
 Firstly the trainer must define how well the trainees have liked the training 
programme; 
 Secondly, the trainer must deal  with learning, and must therefore determine 
what knowledge, attitudes and skills were learned in the training; and
<<<PAGE=303>>>
- 281 -  
 The third level of this approach is concern ed with behaviour. This outlines 
the relationship of learning (the previous measurement levels) to the 
actualisation of doing the job.    
 
It is important for the trainer to be able to understand the difference between 
knowing principles and techniques and using those principles and techniques on-  
the- job. 
 
 
4.6 CRITICAL ORGANISATIONAL SUCCESS FACTORS 
 
Evaluation of training and development does not take place in a vacuum, but is 
influenced by various critical suc cess factors. These factors include creating a 
culture, developing leadership, performance managament and creating a learning 
organisation.   
 
Various organsiational factors are critical to the effective evaluation of training and 
development initiatives. Evaluation of training and development cannot be 
separated from organisational culture as culture directs the behaviour of 
employees. As a result, careful attention should be given to establishing a culture 
that is supportive for the attainment of training and development.   
 
SUCCESS FACTOR 1:     Create a training culture 
 
The main aim of training and development is to improve the performance of 
individuals, teams and the organisation as a whole. This goal can only be achieved 
if the organisation has a culture that emphasis es excellence, achievement and 
training goal attainment. To establish a training culture, organisations should: 
 
 Have a shared vision; 
 Encourage employee’s development;
<<<PAGE=304>>>
- 282 -  
 Encourage employees to develop themselves; 
 Encourage trainees, trainers  and training managers to communicate with 
each other to find ways of improve training and development; 
 Give trainees responsibility and accountability for their learning; and 
 Value the opinion of trainees.   
 
Training and development is a tool through which the organisational culture is 
maintained and re-inforced. 
 
SUCCESS FACTOR 2:  Develop leadership 
 
Leadership can be defined as the ability to exert influence on others, so that they 
will willingly and enthusiastically work towards the attainment of  the group’s goals. 
There is a notion that the behaviour of trainers and traini ng managers contribute to 
the establishment of effective training and develop ment. Trainers and training 
managers also influence the attainment of an effective training culture in the 
organisation. Leadership ensures effective training through: 
 
 Encouraging trainees to take initiatives to solve problems themselves; 
 Encouraging team work; and  
 Serving as good role models to employees. 
 
SUCCESS FACTR 3: Create a learning organisation 
 
Learnining is essential for future performance as it creates the ability in employees 
to solve problems in a creative and innovative manner. Learning sh ould therefore, 
be incorporated into the strategic organisational goal through: 
 
 Encouraging employees to develop and educate themselves; 
 Providing technology and opportunity for employees;
<<<PAGE=305>>>
- 283 -  
 Providing trai ning opportunit ies for all employees to improve thei r various 
skills, knowledge and competencies; and  
 Facilitating learning for all its members and the evaluation of such training 
and development initiatives.  
 
Training should take place in an environment where learning is encouraged, and at 
the same time, performance is effectively managed.  
 
SUCCESS FACTOR 4: Develop an effective performance management 
system 
 
Various guidelines are provided for an effective performance management system. 
The key to an effective performance management system is to align both team and 
individual performance to the current strategic organisational goals. Training 
managers, line managers and senior management play a crucial role in 
performance management by promoting employee commitment, motivation, 
retention and development.  Effective performance management strategies are 
necessary during the performance review. These strategies include: 
 
 Setting meaningful, attainable expectations aligned with the vision, and 
mission and the broad objectives of the training programme; 
 Approaching this process as a collaborative effort, engaging trainees in the 
process; 
 Providing employees acess to the necessary tools, resources and provide a 
supportive environment that enhances performance; 
 Continually assessing and communicating performance progress; 
 Providing for on- going coaching, mentoring and active pursuit of new 
knowledge and learning; 
 Providing trainees with mid- year progress review s and final evaluation 
feedback; and

 Appreciating employee performance through the use of many available forms 
of recognition and reward.   
 
4.7    CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
This chapter focused on evaluating training and development.  It can be concluded 
that evaluation is an important and integral part of successful training and 
development. Evaluation can be facilitated through the use of effective strategies, 
techniques, appropriate approaches, and through the implementation of a 
performance-management system as has been suggested earlier in the chapter. 
Also, the fundamentals of evaluation need to be understood in order to 
communicate the importance of evaluation to trainers and training managers alike.  
 
Evaluation of training and development assist s managers realise change that 
occurs due to training. Therefore one of the reasons for evaluating training is to  
determine effectiveness at individual, team and organisational levels.   
 
Performance management is based on a participative decision- making process 
where individual employees are able to explain their training needs whilst allowing 
managers to incorporat e individual needs into departmental training priorities and 
thus aligning individual development with departmental effectiveness and efficiency. 
The whole principle of the evaluation of training and development initiatives is 
important to the implementation of and management of the learning organisation.

CHAPTER 5 
 
EMPIRICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND ANALYSIS OF THE 
BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS OF RESPONDENTS 
 
 
5.1       INTRODUCTION 
 
In chapter four, a model for evaluating training and development initiatives was 
presented. This model was developed from various theoretical guidelines for 
evaluating training and development and from theoretical evaluation models. 
Chapter two focused on the historical development of the Botswana public service 
and reform programmes, chapter three on the conceptual framework of training and 
development and chapter four on evaluating training and development. 
 
The objective of this chapter is to describe the research methodology that was used 
during this study. The chapter focuses on professional research and design, the 
population, questionnaire, pilot study, survey and survey response rate. The 
bibliographical information gathered during the survey is also presented here and 
discussed.  
 
5.2 PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN 
 
De Vos, St rydom, Fouche and Delport (2002, p.50) perceive professional research 
as aimed not only at problem -solving, but also the development of  scientific 
knowledge. Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2000, p.92) define a research project as 
the overall approach that is followed to answer research questions. For this reason, 
it is important that the researcher should give enough thought to the research 
questions he/she wants answered. The research design utilised for this study 
emerged from identifying the main problem  and related sub- problems. The main 
problem was:
<<<PAGE=308>>>
- 286 -  
What strategies can be used by the Botswana public service to evaluate the 
effectiveness of training and development initiatives? 
 
An analysis of the main problem resulted in the identification of four sub-problems: 
 
SUB-PROBLEM ONE: 
What outcomes are expected from training and development initiatives? 
 
SUB-PROBLEM TWO: 
What evaluation strategies can be used to determine whether training and 
development initiatives are effective? 
 
SUB-PROBLEM THREE: 
What strategies, as in sub-problem two, are used by the Botswana public service to 
evaluate training and development initiatives? 
 
SUB-PROBLEM FOUR: 
What strategies can be used by the Botswana public service to evaluate training 
and development initiatives?  
  
The following broad procedures were adopted to solve the main and sub-problems:  
 
In chapter two, the historical background of the Botswana public service and its 
reform programmes were presented. Attention was given to whether the Botswana 
public service reform programmes have improved service delivery. In chapter three, 
a conceptual framework for training and development was presented and in chapter 
four, a review of the literature on the evaluation of training and development was 
presented with the aim of co ming up with strategies for evaluating training and 
development initiatives.
<<<PAGE=309>>>
- 287 -  
In order to resolve sub-problems three and four, a model for evaluating training and 
development initiatives, which was presented in chapter five, was used as a basis 
to develop the survey questionnaire. The survey questionnaire was administered to 
ministries and departments in the Botswana public service located in Gab orone, 
Botswana. The results collected from the statistical analysis of  the responses 
collected through the survey, form the basis for recommendations made with regard 
to evaluating training and development.  
 
5.3       THE EMPIRICAL STUDY 
 
The empirical study was conducted by means of a survey, which allow ed for  the 
collection of a large amount of information. A survey gives the researcher more 
control over the research process, but he/she should then spend adequate time on 
developing and piloting the questionnaire (De Vos, et al, 2002, p.94). In this section, 
the population, the questionnaire, the pilot study, the survey and the research 
response rate are discussed in detail. The bibliographical information collected 
during the survey is also presented and discussed. 
 
5.3.1 Population and sampling  
 
While planning a study, a researcher has to decide whether to include the whol e 
population or only  a sub-set of the population in the empirical study. According to 
De Vos , et a .l (2002, p.199) and Saunders , et al . (2000, p.150), a population (a 
universum) can be considered as a full set of cases that reflect the characteristics 
that the researcher is interested in. A population does not necessarily consist of 
people. A population is too big to include in a study  and therefore, a representative 
sample from the population is selected. A range of sampling can be used to select a 
representative sub-set of the population. Saunders, et al. (2000, p.151) indicate that 
sampling is justified when it is impractical, expensive and too time- consuming to 
include the entire population. Sampling techniques are divided into probability and 
non-probability sampling. In the case of probability sampling, the sample is
<<<PAGE=310>>>
- 288 -  
statistically chosen at random, which gives every unit of the population the same 
chance to be selected for participation in the study. Non- probability sampling is 
more subjective in nature as the researcher exercises more control over the 
selection of units (De Vos, et al, 2002, p.200). Non-probability sampling was used in 
this study as the population was small.   
 
The target population for this study consisted of all ministries and departm ents in 
the Gaborone area that employed more than fifty employees. The administration of 
the questionnaire is discussed in paragraph 5.3.4. 
 
 
5.3.2 The questionnaire 
 
Saunders, et al . (2000, p.279) indicate that the questionnaire is a suitable data 
collecting method for the identification and description of different variables, such as 
those found in organisational practices or in the opinions or attitudes of people. The 
careful design of the individual questions, sensible lay -out of the questionnaire, 
coherent explanation of the purpose of the questionnaire and pilot testing all 
contribute to better response rates, and maximise the validity and reliability of the 
questionnaire. The development of the questionnaire used in this study is discussed 
below. 
 
5.3.2.1 Development of the questionnaire 
 
The development of the questionnaire used in this study was based on the 
theoretical model for evaluating training and dev elopment that was presented in 
chapter five.  
 
Struwig and Stead (2001, p.89) provide the following guidelines for the development 
of a questionnaire:
<<<PAGE=311>>>
- 289 -  
 Provide clear and precise instructions; 
 Divide the questionnaire into logical sections according to subject; 
 Start with easier questions; 
 Proceed from general to specific questions; 
 Avoid technological terms; 
 Employ the respondent’s vocabulary; and  
 Minimise the number of questions. 
 
Struwig and Stead (2001, p.90) also provide guidelines for the content and phrasing 
of the questions. The aim is to phrase questions in such a manner that respondents 
will accurately i nterpret each question and not be influenced to give specific 
answers.  
 
In addition, the researcher has to carefully consider the format or structure of the 
questions. Types of questions that could be included in a questionnaire are open-
ended questions, multiple-choice questions, check-lists, dichotomous questions that 
require a yes or no answer, ranking questions and scaled- response questions. 
According to Struwig and Stead (2001, p.95), scaled response questions such as 
the Likert -type scale, are prefer able to other forms of question as they provide 
ordinal data.     
 
The questionnaire used for the purposes of this study was constructed to meet the 
criteria suggested by Struwig and Stead (2001, p.95). The questionnaire was 
divided into three sections: 
 
 Section A required biographical data that  consisted of open- ended, multiple 
choice and dichotomous questions; 
 Sections B and C were formatted according to the Likert -type scale. Section 
B contained questions related to the 12 training evaluation strategies;and
<<<PAGE=312>>>
- 290 -  
 Section C contained questions related to ethical issues that have to be taken 
into consideration when evaluating training and development in an 
organisation.  
 
The careful design of a questionnaire contributes to its reliability and validity as a 
measuring instrument. 
 
5.3.2.2 Reliability and validity of the measuring instrument   
 
Reliability and validity are important concepts in the context of measurement as 
they contribute to the objective and scientific nature of research (De Vos , et al . 
2002, p.166).  
 
5.3.2.2.1 Reliability  
 
Leedy (1997, p.35) defines reliability as the consistency with which a measuring 
instrument performs. Reliability can be determined by means of test -retest, internal 
consistency and alternative forms of approach (Saunders, et al. 2000, p.307)  
 
The test -retest method implies that a questionnaire is administered twice to the 
same group of people. The disadvantage of this method is that people may be 
reluctant to complete the same questionnaire twice, and if the researcher allows  a 
lengthy interval between testing, the likelihood of eliciting the exact same responses 
will be reduced. In this study, these problems were overcome by making use of the 
pilot study, which served as a type of test -retest method. The responses received 
from the pilot study could be compared with those received from the survey in order 
to make a judgement about the reliability of the questionnaire. 
 
Internal consistency involves correlating responses to each question with those 
received to other questions, or to questions within the same sub- section of the 
questionnaire. After administering the questionnaire used in this study, the
<<<PAGE=313>>>
- 291 -  
responses to sections B and C were statistically tested for internal consistency. The 
Cronbach alphas for each sub-scale were acceptable.     
 
Alternative form implies checking the responses given to similar questions to verify 
the similarity of the responses. This method is subjective in nature, as the 
researcher has to judge the similarity of  the questions. It is also possible that 
respondents might give dissimilar responses due to fatigue experienced while 
answering a long questionnaire. Though alternative form gives an indication of 
reliability, consistency is not proven without any doubt. Alternative form reliability 
testing was not applied in this study. 
 
5.3.2.2.2 Validity   
 
Validity refers to the extent that a measuring instrument measures what it is 
supposed to measure (Leedy 1997, p. 32). De Vos, et al. (2002, p.167) identify four 
types of validity, namely content validity,  face validity, criterion validity and 
constructive validity.  
 
Content validity refers to the extent to which the measuring instrument measures 
the actual concepts related to the topic.  
 
Face validity is closely related but differs in the sense that it m easures ‘apparent’ 
validity rather than ‘actual’ validity. Inadequate face validity might cause resistance 
in respondents and therefore contaminate the results.  
 
Criterion validity relates to how the performance on one measure relates to the 
performance on another measure, called a criterion. It is essential that the criterion 
selected be reliable and valid so that it can be used as a standard against which to 
measure the results of the measuring instrument (Leedy 1997, p.33).
<<<PAGE=314>>>
- 292 -  
Construct validity indicates the degree to which a measuring instrument 
successfully measures a theoretical construct. In th e case of this study, construct 
validity implies the extent to which the measuring instrument measures the 
evaluation of training and development strategies ai med at improving performance 
in the Botswana public service.  
The following actions were taken to improve the content, face and construct validity 
of the questionnaire: 
 
 The development of the questionnaire was based on the model of evaluating 
training and development initiatives, which is presented in chapter five. This 
model is based on the  literature study presented in c hapters two, three and 
four; and  
 The questionnaire was subjected to the scrutiny of academics and 
professionals in the field of human r esources management as part of a pilot 
study.  
 
5.3.2.3 Questionnaire covering letter 
 
The purpose of a covering letter is to explain the reasons for the survey. Saunders , 
et al . (2000, p.303) suggest  the following guidelines for the design of a covering 
letter: 
 
 Use good quality paper, include an official letterhead and telephone number; 
 Use a 12-point font size and one sheet only; 
 Use the recipient’s title and name if possible; 
 Explain the purpose of the questionnaire;   
 Indicate confidentiality or anonymity; 
 Explain how the results will be used; 
 Provide a contact number or address; 
 Thank the respondent for his/her participation in the study; and  
 Provide a signature, name and surname.
<<<PAGE=315>>>
- 293 -  
 
The above suggestions were considered in the design of the covering letter (Re fer 
to Appendix 1).  
 
5.3.3  Pilot study 
 
De Vos, et al. (2002, p.211) perceive a pilot study as a dress rehearsal of the main 
study. The purpose of a pilot study is to administer the questionnaire to a small 
number of people who possess similar characteristics to the target group in order to 
ensure that the respondents will not encounter problems with completing the 
questionnaire and that the researcher will not have problems with the analysis of 
the responses. A pilot study also allows an assessment of the validity and reliability 
of the questionnaire (Saunders , et al . 2000, p.304). A pilot study can elicit 
information about the time it took to complete the questionnaire, the clarity of 
instructions and questions, whether respondents felt uneasy about answ ering 
certain questions, whether major topic s were omitted and whether the lay -out was 
clear and attractive. In addition, respondents must be encouraged to suggest any 
other improvements to the questionnaire.   
 
The approach used for the pilot study in this project was as follows: 
 
 The questionnaire was given to two senior academics, who also occupied 
managerial positions. Both these academics had experience in human 
resources management and training and development; 
 The questionnaire was given two to statisticians who assisted with the 
statistical analysis. These individuals provided feedback on the content, 
wording and layout of the questionnaire.  This was then considered and used 
to improve the questionnaire; 
 The questionnaire was given to four senior human resources practitioner s 
who were requested to complete and evaluate the questionnaire in terms of 
the following;
<<<PAGE=316>>>
- 294 -  
 length of time to complete the questionnaire; 
 clarity of the instructions, questions and words; 
 layout; and  
 any other topic that should be added. 
 
The comments received from the pilot study were used to refine the questionnaire 
so that it could be distributed to the target group of trainers and training managers. 
 
5.3.4     Administration of the questionnaire 
 
The population for the study consisted of trainers, training co-ordinators and training 
managers in ministries and the department in the Botswana public service in 
Gaborone, Botswana, which employed more than 50 employees, who were 
compiled from various databases. In the absence of training managers, the name of 
the most senior person in the training department was obtained. It was  therefore 
ascertained that the potential respondents could be considered as specialists in the 
field of training and development and that they could, due to their k nowledge and 
experience, make a constructive contribution to identifying the best and most 
effective strategies for evaluating training and development initiatives. Saunders , et 
al. (2000, p.308) state that the objective of administering a questionnaire is  to gain 
access to the sample (in this case the population) and to maximise the response 
rate. 
 
The following procedure was followed in administering the questionnaire: 
 
 Each potential respondent was contact ed by telephone to advise him/her to 
expect the q uestionnaire. According to Saunders , et al. (2000, p.308), prior 
notification establishes personal contacts with respondents and subsequently 
raises the perceived importance of the study. Each respondent was 
questioned about the preferred method of deliver y. Eighty-seven per cent of 
the target group preferred to receive and return the questionnaire by e- mail,
<<<PAGE=317>>>
- 295 -  
while thirteen per cent of the target group preferred a facsimile. According to 
Struwig and Stead (2001, p.103), e- mails can be used in the same manne r 
as traditional mail surveys. The advantage of an e- mail is that it is easy, 
cheap and fast to conduct. The researcher, however, needs to use a good 
administrative system to manage the process well.  
 The covering letter and the questionnaire were e- mailed to each potential 
respondent and faxed to those who preferred a facsimile; 
 Each person who returned the questionnaire was thanked, either by means 
of email or telephonically, for his/her contribution to the study; 
 A follow -up email was sent or a telephone call ma de to each potential 
respondent after one week to remind non-respondents to answer; and   
 The second follow -up was conducted after three weeks to potential 
respondents who had not yet responded. A copy of the covering letter and 
the questionnaire were included. 
 
According to Saunders , et al . (2000, p.310), a third follow -up may become 
necessary if the response rate is low. Recorded delivery by post, telephone calls 
and even calling a person can be used.   
 
5.3.5       Response rate 
 
The covering let ter and the questionnaire were sent to 100 respondents in various 
ministries and department s in the Botswana public service sector. Eighty -four per 
cent of the respondents completed the questionnare while 16 per cent either  did not 
answer all the questions  or were not available when the researcher was collecting 
the questionnaires.
<<<PAGE=318>>>

5.4 PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION 
 
Section A of the questionnaire required the respondents to provide information 
about themselves, such as age, posi tion held, length of service, qualifications and 
others. These questions were included in the questionnaire due to their potential 
value as independent variables to probe similarities or differences in the reponses 
to various sections of the questionnaire.  The information obtained from the 
questions contained in Section A is presented and discussed below.

There is a link between training and employee performance appraisal. Therefore 
question A9, required respondents to indicate how regularly their performance w as 
appraised by their superior as a way of inform ing training decisions. Table 5.9 and 
Chart 5.9 indicate that the majority of respondents represented by 63 per cent of 
respondents indicated that their performance is never appraised by their superiors, 
while the minorities, 33 per cent, indicated that their performance was appraised at 
least once a year.

It is evident that almost all the ministries and departments (95%) had no formal 
training evaluation in place . R egardless of the number of respondents who 
indicated that they had attended a course or workshop, it is clear that these training 
programmes or initiatives were not evaluated. It is also evident that the majority of 
respondents (95%) indicate d that there was  no training policy in their ministries or 
departments to provide guidelines on how effective training should be conducted 
and for its evaluation. It has been discussed under section 4.4.6.2 that training is 
directly linked to performance management and more specifically to an employee’s 
performance appraisal.  
 
Various authors have emphasise d how important performance appraisal is during 
the training needs analysis. In the absence of a systematic performance appraisal , 
training needs will be unclear and not aligned to organisational strategic training 
and development objectives. According to the results, 95 per cent of  the 
respondents indicated that their performance was never appraised while only 5 per 
cent agreed that their performance was being appraised. Furthermore, 94 per cent 
of line managers, trainers and supervisors indicate d they did  not apprai se their 
subordinates’ performance. This is a clear indication that indeed the performance 
management system used by the Botswana public service does not influence 
training and development decisions, a senario whi ch negatively impacts on training 
and development relevance and effectiveness. It is also evident that the majority of 
respondents, 55 per cent , and 35 per cent , rate training as ineffective and very 
ineffective as a tool to improve organisational performance. Only 10 per cent of 
respondents believed  that training is an effective tool  to improve organisational 
performance.

5.5 CONCLUSION 
 
This chapter presented the research methodology used during this study and 
focused on professional research and design, the population, the questionnaire, the 
pilot study, the survey and the survey response rate. The biographical information 
gathered during the survey (Section A of the questionnaire) was also presented and 
discussed. 
 
In the next chapter, the results obtained from the r est of the questionnaire are 
presented and discussed to determine the extent to which respondents agreed  with 
the s trategies for evaluating training and development initiatives which were 
identified in the theoretical study.

CHAPTER 6 
 
ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 
 
 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
In chapter five, the research methodology used in the  study was presented and 
discussed. The data collected from Section A of the questionnaire w ere presented 
and analysed. 
 
The aim of this chapter is to assist in the resolution of sub- problems two, three and 
four. 
 
SUB-PROBLEM TWO:  
What evaluation strategies can be used to determine whether training and 
development initiatives are effective? 
 
SUB-PROBLEM THREE: 
What strategies, as in sub-problem, two are used by the Botswana public service to 
evaluate training and development initiatives? 
 
SUB-PROBLEM FOUR: 
What strategies can be utilised by the Botswana public service to evaluate training 
and development initiatives? 
 
The results from Sections B to C of the survey questionnaire are presented in the 
same order as they appeared in the questionnaire. The question naire consists of 
three main sections, namely:
<<<PAGE=337>>>
- 315 -  
 Effective training and development initiatives (S ection B) aimed at providing 
guidelines on the various training steps to be taken to achieve the desired 
training objective;  
 Evaluation of training and develop ment (section B) aimed at determining the 
need for training and development and how t raining and development 
improve both individual, team and organisational performance; and  
 Critical success factors (Section C) aimed at creating an environment where 
training and development initiatives may  be conduct ed and evaluated to 
improve both individual and organisational performance.  
 
The findings are presented in tabular form. These tables were compiled with the aid 
of computer print-outs generated by means of the SPSS version 11.0 programme. 
 
6.2  QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 
 
Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the raw data obtained from the survey. 
The descriptive data included measures of cent ral tendency and the dispersion of 
variables. Sections B and C of the questionnaire were developed according to a 
Likert-type scale and for each item,  the respondents had to indicate whether they 
strongly agreed, agreed, were uncertain, disagreed or strongly disagreed with each 
statement. Numerical values, rang ing from one (strongly agree) to five (strongly 
disagree) were used to evaluate the quantitative analysis of the results. The 
quantitative analysis of the results from Sections B to C is presented below.

theoretical findings which indicated that establishing training objectives is an 
important strategy in the effective training and development process (3.5). It was 
highlighted in the theoretical study that training objectives identify what training and 
development initiatives must deliver to address a performance deficiency. It is  
therefore important that for the training objectives to be clear, both the trainer and 
trainee need had to know what is expected of them.

In summary of th e above analysis, it is evident that the majority of respondents 
disagreed or strongly disagreed that ministry/departments’ training and 
development initiatives are not conducted systematically according to the eight 
strategies. Most importantly , it can th erefore be concluded,  that training and 
development initiatives are not evaluated according to strategies nine and ten, as 
indicated in the model. 
 
From the above analysis, the following conclusion could be drawn: strategies one to 
eight were not adequatel y followed in the ministry/department where the study was 
conducted. In other words , the training process is not organised according to 
theoretical guidelines and the majority of respondents are of the view that the 
following strategies are not followed at  all: Strategy 1 (Identif y training needs and 
priorities), Strategy 2 Plan s trategically for  training, Strategy 3 (Establish training 
objectives), Strategy 4 (Design the training plan), Strategy 5 Schedule of training, 
Strategy 6 P resent training , Strategy  7 Transf er and implement of training and 
Strategy 8 Monitor training.  
 
The main problem the research study has come up with is that strategies can be 
used by the Botswana public service to evaluate the effectiveness of training and 
development initiatives. 
 
From the above analysis it is evident that training and development initiatives are 
not evaluated in the ministry/departments where the study was conducted and 
therefore, it can be concluded that the Botswana public service does not evaluate 
its training and development endeavours. This is indicated by an overwhelming
<<<PAGE=349>>>
- 327 -  
majority of respondents who disagreed (19 per cent) and (75 per cent) who strongly 
disagreed that training and development initiatives are evaluated in their 
organisations. This accounts f or the highest percentage of disagreed and strongly 
disagreed by respondents in the ten strategies presented in the above analysis. 
 
In the next section, responses to the critical organisational success factors 
necessary for the effective training and development evaluation are presented and 
analysed.

Analysis of the means s cores and standard deviations for the fourth critical 
organisational success factor revealed an aggregate mean of 3.7. This suggests a 
tendency towards disagreement on all the statements. The standard deviation 
indicated that the spread was relatively narrow, ranging between (0.459) and
<<<PAGE=354>>>
- 332 -  
(0.557), indicating that the respondents were relatively consistent in the way they 
responded to the items in this section.   
 
 
It is evident from the above analysis (Section C of the questionnaire) that a training 
culture, leadership, creation of a learning organisation and the establishment of a 
performance management system in t he Botswana public service are not in place 
as per the theoretical study and most importantly , according to the theoretical 
models. The responses obtained from these critical organisational success factors 
were not positive. It could be concluded that the internal organisational environment 
strongly discourages effective evaluation of training and development initiatives. 
The re sponses overwhelmingly indicate that the majority of respondents do not 
believe that their ministries and departments have done enough to create a 
conducive environment for the evaluation of training and development. 
 
 
6.3 CONCLUSION 
 
The purpose of this c hapter was to analyse and interpret the data obtained through 
the research questionnaire. The analysis and interpretation of the data were 
undertaken in terms of the objectives of the research stated in chapter one. An 
evaluation of the results of the research questionnaire indicated that all the ten 
training and development evaluation strategies were not adhered to. Particularly , 
strategies nine and ten are those that specifically deal with the evaluation of training 
and development.  
 
Chapter s even covers  various recommendations, based on the above- mentioned 
findings. The problems and limitations encountered during the research study as 
well as the opportunities for future research are highlighted.

CHAPTER 7 
 
SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
In Chapter Six the results of the empirical study were presented and analysed and 
recommendations based on the findings of each section of the study were 
reviewed. In this chapter, the problems experienced during the study are discussed 
and recommendations for further research are presented. 
 
 
7.2    MAIN FINDINGS 
 
The main problem identified in this study was: 
 
What training and development evaluation strategies are used by the Botswana 
public service?  
 
The rationale behind the study was t o address the continued decline in service 
delivery in the Botswana public service sector regardless of the huge budget on 
training and development across the board (in all government ministries and 
departments). It is evident from the theoretical review t hat for training and 
development to be effective, they must be systematic, and proper evaluation 
techniques must be used to in order to improve individual, team and organisational 
performance.  While the major part of this research was about the evaluation  of 
training and development, it is important to note that evaluation is a final stage in a 
systematic training process. Due to this scenario, more emphasis was placed on 
systematic training and development as illustrated by the comprehensive training 
model in Figure 3.9. Without systematic training and development, it would be 
difficult to evaluate the training and development initiative. While previous research
<<<PAGE=356>>>
- 334 -  
focused on the evaluation of training and development, a need exists to investigate 
and formulate strategies for the evaluation of training and development in order to 
address poor quality service delivery and the continued decline in productivity levels 
in the Botswanna public service sector.  Like any organisation, the Botswana public 
service should demand return on investment, because of the significant  amount of 
money and time spent on training and development initiatives.  
 
Sub-problems were identified to resolve the main problem. The sub -problems are 
listed below. 
 
SUB-PROBLEM ONE: 
 
What outcomes are expected from training and development initiatives? 
 
A literature study was conducted to identify outcomes of training and development 
initiatives in the Botswana public service sector. It was revealed in the literature 
study that the main outcomes of training and development include, amongst others, 
changes in attitude and behaviour, skill levels, knowledge, and change in levels of 
organisational efficiency and effectiveness (refer to c hapter four). Results from the 
empirical study suggest that an overwhelming majority of respondents disagreed or 
strongly disagreed that their individual performance is appraised, that none of the 
ten training evaluation strategies are applied in their ministries or department. Also 
according to the empirical study, indications are that the environments in which 
training and development initiatives are conducted are not befitting. The 
organisational training culture, leadership, learning organisation and an effective 
performance management system are non- existent creati ng unfavourable 
conditions for effective training and development.
<<<PAGE=357>>>
- 335 -  
SUB-PROBLEM TWO: 
 
What evaluation strategies can be used to determine whether training and 
development initiatives are effective? 
 
Chapter three of the study c onsidered the conceptual f ramework for effective 
training and development, how effective training and development should be 
conducted and most importantly, the systematic approach to an effective training 
and development process. The logical steps to be undertaken in order to ensur e 
that training and development impact on the overall organisational performance 
were presented in the form of a theoretical comprehensive training and 
development model (refer to Figure 3.9).   
  
SUB-PROBLEM THREE: 
 
What strategies in sub -problem two are used by the Botswana public service 
to evaluate training and development initiatives? 
 
In order to resolve sub- problem three, the questionnaire that was developed from 
the theoretical model in chapter four, was administered to trainers, supervisors and 
training managers who were responsible for the management of training and 
development in the Botswana public service. Employees’ views on training and 
development initiatives were also sought as employees are normally trainees in 
most of the training programmes. The results from the survey were statistically 
analysed and interpreted. 
 
The results strongly suggest that respondents are in agreement with the training 
and development evaluation strategies aimed at improving individual, team and 
organisational performance.
<<<PAGE=358>>>

SUB-PROBLEM FOUR: 
 
What strategies can be utilised by the Botswana public service to evaluate 
training and development initiatives? 
 
Chapter f our provided a theoretical overview  of the training evaluation strategies 
that organisations could uti lise to effectively evaluate training and development 
initiatives. These strategies entail a systematic approach towards training and 
development and the evaluation thereof: identifying training needs and priorities, 
strategic planning for training, establ ishing training objectives, designing, 
scheduling, presenting, transferring and implementation, maintaining and evaluating 
training and development programmes. In addition to the ten strategies, four critical 
success organisational factors were revealed in the literature. These factors have 
been idenfied as key organisational factors, in the absence of which, training and 
development would not bring forth the desired outcome and the evaluation of which 
would not be effective.  
 
Based on the research finding s, recommendations are made and areas for future 
research highlighted.  
 
 
7.3  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
It was indicated in chapter five that the goal of research is to solve problems and 
develop scientific knowledge (Vos, Strydom, Fouche and Delport 2002, p.50). The 
purpose of this study was to develop training and development evaluation 
strategies. To achieve this, theoretical and empirical studies were conducted. 
 
The model for the evaluation of training and development initiatives can serve as a 
guideline for organisations that want to pro- actively manage training and
<<<PAGE=359>>>
- 337 -  
development and constructively evaluate training and development initiatives in the 
Botswana public service sector. 
The following recommendations emerged from the research conducted: 
 
 Training and development in the organisations should be addressed in an 
integrated manner. To achieve this goal, organisations need to draw up a 
training policy that guides the training department and the rest of the 
organisation on how to conduct training and its evaluation; 
 
 The organisation needs consistently to apply strategies for the evaluation of 
training and development initiatives. Also , these strategies must be reflected 
in the organisation’s training policy. In view of these strategies, it is important 
that t he organisation becomes a learning one in which training and 
development become critical components of efficiency and effectiveness and 
that a performance management system be incorporated into the training 
strategy; 
 
 A comprehensive and supportive culture, leadership, creation of a learning 
organisation and effective performance management system should be 
established and maintained for the effective evaluation of training and 
development inititiatives aimed at improving individual, team and 
organisational performance; and 
 
 The literature study and the empirical study suggested that the Botswana 
public service did not give much attention to the continuity of quality 
production and quality service and increasing productivity levels as an 
integral part of org anisational strategic approach towards competetiveness. 
This issue needs to be addressed.

7.4  PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS  
 
No major problems were experienced during the duration of the study. Minor 
problems related to the administration of the questionnaire and specificially to 
obtaining an adequate number of responses  were experienced. This problem was 
overcomed by a follow -up survey. The eventual high response rate that was 
obtained and the number of respondents who indicated that they would like to 
receive a synopsis of the results demonstrated that the survey was positively 
received by the public servants. 
 
 
7.5 CONCLUSION 
 
Poor service delivery in the Botswana public service has b een a major concern to 
the government, civil society, and other key players  in the economy of the country.  
Many commentators have urged the government to consider the introduction of 
stringent public reform programmes  to address the productivity decline levels with  
the view to improve quality service delivery in the public servic e. Effective training 
and development evaluation strategies are required to measure change in 
individual, team and organisational efficiency and effectiveness. This is against the 
backdrop that two thirds of the public service annual budget goes towards tr aining 
and development and it is important that training evaluation be conducted to rectify 
the performance deficiency in the public service sector. It is important for training 
stakeholders to ensure that an environment conducive for learning to take plac e 
through the creation of a training culture, effective leadership, creation of a learning 
organisation and through the integration of a performance management system into 
the organisational training and development strategy.
