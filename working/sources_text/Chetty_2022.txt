Building a Capable State: Unpacking Critical Skills Development Challenges 
in the   Public Sector

Abstract 
Whilst the active repositioning of the role of South Africa’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has been a key 
thrust of governments response to slow economic growth, not enough attention has been given to exploring 
the challenges of building the capability of public service s. More specifically, there  has been insufficient 
scholarly focus that critically unpacks the nature and extent of skills  development and human resource 
challenges facing management in SOEs. In order to fill this gap, this paper reports on the findings of a study 
undertaken at Transnet Capital Projects (TCP), a former project execution wing of Transnet SOE. Data 
collected from 191 respondents , in a survey of TCP  project management teams, revealed that whilst the 
technical service providers contracted to deliver on mega-projects possessed the requisite skills, experience, 
and expertise, Transnet project’s personnel had limited experience and exposure to execute high value 
mega-projects. Moreover, the study  highlighted low levels of management retention, with the high turn -
over rates alluding to systemic  internal challenges. These findings, nearly ten years since the 
implementation of the National  Development Plan (NDP) intent on professionalising the public service, is 
worrisome and points to a need for an urgent intervention if the vision of building a developmental state is 
to be realised.

Introduction 
There is consensus in the governance literature that one of the defining characteristics of a 
developmental state is state capacity (Thompson and Wissink, 2018). More specifically, it is  suggested 
that strong state capacity and autonomy are necessary to implement and sustain what are termed “big 
push” programmes (Kim, 2009). Citing the cases of China, South Korea, Singapore, and the United Arab 
Emirates, Chang (2002), Kim (2009), and Thompson (2013) make a compelling case for the successful 
contribution of highly capacitated states towards building development  economies. Against this 
background, and in a context of massive unemployment, poverty, and inequality, it is worrisome that in 
a recent global study, South Africa has been characterised as a country with rapid deterioration in state 
capability (Andrews et al., 2017). From both the literature and  experience of developmental states, an 
essential component of state capability is individual  capacity, understood simply as the competency of 
civil servants to deliver services (Koma, 2010). However, as Mulaudzi (2015) points out, this ability to 
deliver is highly dependent on having  personnel with the necessary skills, knowledge, attitude, and 
behaviour that have been acquired not only through training but experience, networks, and values. 
This  paper brings attention to the importance of acknowledging the critical role of highly skilled, 
competent, and experienced human resources within the public service. It focuses on the arena of mega 
infrastructure projects, which have, in the last few decades, grown exponentially in both developed and 
developing nations. Despite this growth and technological advancements, executors of projects appear 
to continuously fall short of promised targets and face the onslaught of scathing criticism for not meeting 
schedules, overruns in cost, and quality concerns (APM, 2016). Parkin and King (1995) notes that in 
production endeavours, which includes infrastructure development, the three essential components are 
capital, equipment , and labour. The capital component consists of business case requirements and 
investor funding whilst the second component of equipment involves plant, technology , and energy. It 
is the third  component of team resourcing, skills, competency, and attitudes, however, are often

underemphasised. In the last two decades however, increased focus has been drawn to the issue of skills 
shortages across a range of market sectors (Anderson, 2008; Mulder, 2007 ; Rasool and Botha, 2011), 
with renewed attention on engineering and construction that has endured constraints on growth and 
effectiveness (Oke et al., 2017). 
In recognising that the human resource and skills development challenge facing the public state is a 
complex one that requires a nuanced understanding that goes beyond anecdotal evidence,  this paper 
reports on findings of empirical research in the field of megaprojects conducted by the lead author at 
Transnet Capital Projects (TCP), a former project execution wing of a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) in 
the Republic of South Africa.  The aim of the paper is to critically assess the  human resource and skills 
challenges that impact TCP when achieving mega-project success. Based on an extensive quantitative 
survey of 191 respon dents, the perceptions of employees were gathered to gain an in-depth analysis 
from insiders into the complex nature of the challenge. It is through these unique insights from public 
service employees themselves, complemented by the lead author’s own experience working within the 
SOE, and the second author’s knowledge  management experience for more than 20 years within 
government, that a more complex picture of the nature of the skills and human resource challenge is 
painted. The paper begins with a brief overview of the key themes from contemporary literature that 
helps frame the capable state, probing into softer skills that are critical in ensuring success in 
megaproject execution. Having set the theoretical stage, more information is provided on the research 
methodology, before the  findings from the study is presented together with a detailed analysis. The 
paper concludes by synthesising the main arguments and offering some thoughts on new directions for 
the rebuilding of the developmental state. 
Key components for effective project execution within a capable state: Contemporary 
scholarly debates 
Given the  transdisciplinary nature of the research project in providing an overview of  the relevant 
literature to help frame the paper, the authors draw on prevailing thinking in the field of project  
management around what constitutes as the critical ingredients for megaproject ’s success within the 
ambit of building a capable and developmental state. We begin by outlining the traditional factors for 
project success from management literature. Special attention is then paid to the often - neglected 
human aspects of managing projects. We consider the role of project teams and then the individual role 
of skilled and experienced personnel. We consciously have foregone a comprehensive literature survey 
on the nuances of a developmental state and the detailed analysis of project management literature. The 
authors justify this in terms of focussing the literature to help frame the key argument of the paper and 
interpret the results in the survey. 
The multivariate factors determining project success 
The vast literature on project management suggests numerous factors that contribute towards  a 
project’s success. Joslin and Muller (2016) , for example, suggest that project success is determined  by 
criteria and standards that must be achieved by the project manager for a clearly defined set of desirable 
outcomes. While Nguyen, Ogunlana, and Lan (2004: 408) support this notion, they add that “stakeholder 
satisfaction” must also be achieved. According to Saqib, Farooqui,  and Lodi  (2008), project success 
varies from one project to another, with the definition of success depending on a variety of factors 
including project size, scope, design complexity, technology, and the participants. Al- Tmeemy, Abdul-
Rahman, and Harun (2011: 343) on the other hand, posits that overall project success is achieved when 
the “technical performance criteria” is achieved. Whilst there are numerous factors attributed towards 
project failure in project management  literature, Merrow (2011:  2) distils seven reasons for project 
failure as “investment imbalances, compressed schedules, insufficie nt upfront detailed planning, 
insufficient funding for upfront planning, cost-cutting, passing risks onto contractors and dismissal or 
loss of key project personnel.” Based on their study on international project development, Ika and 
Hodgeson (2014) concur with Merrow (2011), emphasising that project failure occurs when planned 
schedules, costs, scope, and quality required are not met. In narrowing this down further, Han, Yusof, 
Ismail, and Aun (2012: 94) assert that whilst the  description of project success is difficult to frame, in 
the final analysis they note that project success is dependent on budget, schedule, and quality – or what 
is commonly known as the “iron triangle” of project management. This  notion has become the

cornerstone in project management. At the same time, Dalcher (2012) maintains that success needs to be 
expanded from a view of planning and controlling to include views of clients, contractors, and 
stakeholders which are generally neglected. Pakseresht and Asgari (2012) also support the view of 
stakeholder importance and add that that the idea of project success is indeed an elusive area that is 
complicated and highly dependent on the views of internal and external stakeholders. 
The underplayed role of the human element 
Whilst the iron triangle of project management has held sway in project management literature, there 
is clearly a new shift in thinking towards the role of personal attributes, including skills, experience, and 
behaviour and its impacts on project success (Wells, 2012). We emphasise this acknowledgment as it is 
critical in interpreting the results of this study. This move to appreciate the role of the project team in 
achieving success has been in the spotlight in the last two decades. Graham and Englund (2004) explain 
that the project team - as a core team - consists of experienced dedicated specialist discipline-leads who 
are supported by various other team members for the execution of the various tasks. They further note 
that the main roles of these leads are to guide and supervise the team members whilst providing expert 
advice as and when required. In recognising the importance of the core team, Merrow (2011)  advises 
that the core team must remain intact for project continuity and positive  outcomes. The challenges in 
nurturing and preserving project teams, as Berg and Karlsen (2014) allude to, cannot be ignored, with 
high levels of work pressure, grey areas of responsibility, and conflict leading to burnout as well as high 
turnover in members of the team. This, we contend , is a critical assertion , which is highly relevant for 
the TCP study. 
From project teams to individual personnel attributes 
Whilst fully functioning project teams have been identified as a key factor for effective project execution, 
the issue of ensuring high levels of competent staff comes through strongly in the literature on building 
a capable s tate. To a large extent the economic success of Japan and other  East Asian developmental 
states has been traced to technical competence of state personnel, many of whom had received advanced 
training abroad (Hughes, 1998). In unpacking the concept of competence, it is useful to note that IPMA 
(2006: 9) clarifies skills as an important subset of competency in which competency is a “collection of 
knowledge, personnel attitudes, skills and relevant experience” that required to “successfully carry out 
a function.” IPMA expands this notion, suggesting that competencies operate at three  distinctive levels 
namely contextual, technical, and behavioural. Arising from their investigations Langer, Slaughter, and 
Mukhopadhay (2008: 24) elaborate that ‘hard skills’ consisting of general and technical skills, and ‘soft 
skills’ consisting of non-technical and tacit skills are essential attributes for high performing project 
leaders and members. Langer et al., (2008) revealed through their study of the IT industry that technical 
skills improved cost management whilst soft skills had marked improvements in  client management 
and deliverables acceptance. 
In further exploring these ‘soft skills’, in a study of construction projects, Zhang and Fan  (2013) found 
that there is a strong correlation between a project manager’s emotional intelligence (EI) and project 
performance, where EI consists of organisational awareness, cultural awareness, empathy , and self -
control. Issuing a cautionary note however, Shahtaheri, Haas and Salimi (2017) argue that organisations 
undertaking large complex projects require not only  skilled and competent staff, but experienced 
personnel to achieve successful project outcomes. As a worrying corollary, Wallace, Keil and Rai (2004) 
point out the real dangers of not assembling and maintaining suitable team size consisting of the required 
skill sets, arguing that this can result in an imbalance of workload, inadequate time for training and  
professional development and generally poor team motivation, which ultimately leads to poor project 
team performance. Scholars have documented the factors associated with personnel risks well, ranging 
from “insufficient skilled personnel on the project team” (Keil, Matthiassen and Zeng, 2006: 156), 
“extended overtime due to high staff turnover and loss of intellectual knowledge” (Kim and Park, 2006: 
412) and “job stress and burnout” (Enshassi, El-Rayyes and Alkilani, 2015: 170). 
In closing, this brief review of the contemporary literature around building a capable state that is able to 
deliver on complex projects required for catalysing development economies, it becomes clear that many 
factors pay a decisive role. As Abtahi et al. (2014: 1830) succinctly put it, what is needed is intellectual

capital consisting of knowledge, information , and experience in the public  sector where there is a 
constant battle to find a balance between “ acquiring, measuring, and managing intellectual capital.” As 
will be shown in the TCP study, this ability to find that fine balance can be the final arbiter in determining 
the sustainability of its operations. 
 
Methodology 
As indicated earlier, this paper reports on findings drawn from a larger doctoral research project that 
examined the multi-faceted set of challenges facing the delivery of megaprojects in TCP (Chetty, 2018). 
In order to understand the complex nature of megaprojects skills and human  resourcing in TCP, this 
study adopted quantitative research methods utilising a survey -based research design (Sekaran and 
Bougie, 2013). Concentrating on a cross-sectional survey sample, the study applied a descriptive 
paradigm using scientific methods for diligence, accuracy, and replicability (Sekaran and Bougie, 2013; 
Zhang and Fan, 2013). The target population for this study consisted of 324 personnel responsible for 
the execution of  mega projects. All personnel including project directors, senior project managers, 
project managers, project control managers, engineers, quantity surveyors, environmental managers,  
quality managers, and procurement and contract managers employed for mega project execution were 
invited to participate in the survey. A five Point Likert-scale type questionnaire, using an ordinal scale, 
was utilised to collect primary data from TCP project personnel. There were two  parts to the 
questionnaire with the first part seeking information on the respondents and the  second part posing 
statements related to human resources and skills in TCP. 
The questionnaire was securely uploaded onto the Survey Monkey platform and disseminated  to 
participants in geographically  remote offices. Completed questionnaires were received from  191 
respondents thus meeting the requirements for achieving a confidence level of 95  per cent and 5 per 
cent according to scholastic guidelines (Krejcie and Morgan, 1970). Field data was analysed using t he 
Statistical Package for Social Scientists for all multiple-choice questions. A pilot test was applied to test 
the validity of the questionnaire before its distribution  to participants. The internal consistency of the 
main questionnaire produced a Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0,895 which was within the accepted range 
of 0,7 and 1,0 recommended by scholars. The Cronbach’s alpha test demonstrated that the data collected 
was reliable for further analysis. In order to ascertain whether the data followed a normal distribution, 
a Normality Test was undertaken for the schedule management dimension before proceeding with any 
further analysis. Since the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that the overall scores for the dimension 
was not normally distri buted, inferential testing using non -parametric tests was undertaken. Non-
parametric testing, namely the Mann Whitney Test, was performed on the data whereby the medians of 
the two groups were compared to determine any significant relationships amongst  the selected 
constructs. 
Findings and Discussion 
In eliciting the perceptions around the impact of human resources and skills on megaproject success in 
TCP, 191 participants perceptions on a set of 17 statements revealed interesting results. As indicated in 
Table 1 below, which presents the statements and shows their distribution, most statements had a mean 
score of 3 or more.

What is significant to note is that the study found that the five variables indicated in Table 3 below could 
account for nearly 60 per cent of the variability of all 17 dimensions.

Using Varimax with Kaiser Normalization (see Table 4 below), five variables are isolated which relate to 
the set of following key issues, each of which is unpacked in the analysis that follows: 
i. The extent to which the correct skill set exists in the TCP 
ii. The apparent lack of Transnet resources versus staff exposure and experience 
iii. The impact of staff continuity and turnover in megaproject delivery 
iv. The level of skill possessed by TCP contractors responsible for megaproject delivery 
v. The need for a blend of local and expatriate skills to augment TCP capacity. 
 
It is contended that these five factors provide important insight into understanding the  nature of the 
human resource and skills challenges in TCP and may be relevant to other SOEs in South Africa.

Transnet TCP lacks the appropriate skills sets for mega-projects 
Given the highly specialised nature of the sector and the strategic importance of Transnet, it  would be 
reasonable to assume that the parastatal staff would have possessed the requisite skills and competence 
to execute mega projects timeously and successfully. The first important finding from the study that 
investigated this assumption revealed concerning results. The survey showed that nearly half (47%) of 
all respondents believed that TCP did not have the correct skill sets to  manage mega projects. It was 
found that deficiencies in the skill sets related to scheduling, cost control, and quality. With cost, quality, 
and time commonly referred to as the ‘iron triangle’ of project management, as outlined in the literature 
review earlier, the finding clearly shows inadequacies  in project management skills. This result is 
significant and confirms a government study raising  the alarm on skill challenges in engineering and 
construction in South Africa with reference  to professionals such as  engineers, architects,  and 
geotechnical specialists (JIPSA, 2016). The issue of a lack of appropriate skills sets has admittedly been 
on the radar for Transnet  management. The annual stakeholder report (Transnet, 2015) for example , 
acknowledges the deficiencies in skills at both operational and technical levels. Importantly too, in its 
Integrated Report 2019, the parastatal flags the issue of skills, noting that ‘people management’ lies in 
the top ten risks, moving three places from number  eight in 2018 to number five in 2019 (Transnet, 
2019). 
The shortage and lack of appropriate skilling of professionals within the construction  sector, however, 
is not unique to South Africa, with a similar picture emerging in the southern Africa n region, as 
reinforced by Kikwasi’s (2011) assessment of skills shortages in Tanzania. The  African trend itself 
mirrors a similar picture globally, as reaffirmed  by the ILO Report (2015)  which emphasised skilled 
labour deficiencies in both  the developed and developing  nations, suggesting that unless multiple 
concerted efforts are undertaken, the skills mismatch will continue. More specifically, the IPMA ICB 3.0 
(2006) makes it very clear that performance on project  execution will be impacted until competency 
(knowledge, skills, and attitude) levels are improved. The findings in TCP , whilst reflective of a global 
and African distress around skills mobilised on megaprojects, has major implications in terms of placing 
Transnet at risk of not meeting its objectives of delivering infrastructure at lower costs in time to meet 
market demand. This not  only jeopardi ses the intent of building a capable state but has severe 
implications for South Africa’s economic revival. 
Having established the first important contributory factor of an inadequate skill set, it was important to 
unpack whether this was as a  result of TCP having high vacancy rates and generally insufficient 
resources, or whether human resources were in fact in place but not adequately experienced. This issue 
is considered next. 
Transnet has sufficient resources, but experience and exposure is limited 
More than three quarters of all survey participants (77%) agreed that whilst Transnet has an adequate 
number of human resources, they are severely limited by experience as well as exposure to mega 
projects. This means that it is not about the number of personnel recruited, or  even about the lev el of 
education and training of personnel within the parastatal, but about  ensuring that current staff are 
appropriately experienced and have exposure that will equip them to manage the challenges of 
implementing mega-projects. The findings at TCP reinforce Roe’s (2014) argument that as an 
organisation’s commitment to  deliver successful large projects, both competent and experienced 
personnel must be appointed  to ensure desirable outcomes. It is interesting to note how this survey’s 
results compares with international best practices. Mckinsey (2010) suggests that based on industry 
best practices, almost 15 per cent of workers can be considered to lack the desired job competency 
requirements to achieve outcomes. The perceptions of personnel in TCP are therefore most worrying 
as this is more than five times the Mckinsey international benchmark. 
In making sense of this result, we suggest that the perception of limited exposure and experience of 
personnel in TCP could be explained by the age analysis of respondents: 24 per cent of respondent were 
under the age of 30 whilst 58 per cent  of respondents were under the age of 40. Given this age 
demographic, and the lived work experiences of these survey participants who may not  yet have 
accumulated the relevant experience nor mentoring by more senior personnel, the results  are 
understandable. The issue of training and exposure acquired through on the job practice and  learning

from more experienced fellow workers are again reinforced by Kikwasi (2015). Furthermore, in his 
commentary around the shortage of experienced personnel in South Africa, Rasool (2011:4) notes that 
several socio-economic factors, such as the implementation of affirmative action and the emigration of 
skilled and experiences personal resulting in a ‘brain  drain’, must be also considered as important 
contributory factors. The researchers  acknowledge that the factors at play here are complex and 
challenging, given the urgent need to simultaneously achieve important transformation and 
developmental objectives. Reflecting critically on  what this finding means for university  graduate 
throughputs and industry take-up rates, the study reveals the inadequacy of a simple conceptualisation 
of SA’s skills challenge as the inability to produce and place graduates. Rather the analysis suggests that 
the more critical issue is the unavailability of experienced personnel, in this instance within parastatals 
to manage complex megaprojects. This phenomenon is further unpacked in the next challenge. 
 High levels of staff turnover in the lifecycle of mega-projects 
There is consensus in the literature that personnel change is a reality of project execution (Berg and 
Karlsen, 2014; Graham and  Englund, 2019). Whilst this is accepted, it has  also been recognised that 
organisations are beginning to face a crisis of knowledge management as they  grapple to ensure that 
employees do not leave the organisation before transferring their experience (Stam, 2009). Urbancová 
and Linhartová (2011:  85) refer to this as a “knowledge preservation crisis” as the  continuity of 
organisational knowledge is threatened. The results of the survey show that most respondents (73%) 
indicated that there were too many team-member changes in the life of mega-projects. What is of concern 
is that such a change occurs  more often than not with subsequent negative impacts on the mega-
project’s execution profile. It is not clear where these changes occur in the mega-project organogram 
and the exact reasons  for higher number of changes are also not evident. There is also no clarity as to 
whether TCP was  aware of the frequency of changes and if TCP had resource contingency plans in place 
to effectively deal with this situation of resource changes that appear to have had an adverse effect  on 
project delivery efforts. 
In offering plausible explanations for this prevalent perception of survey participants, noting that nearly 
one quarter of the personnel are less than 30 years of age, one contributory factor could be the pursuit 
of better work opportunities. The detrimental effects of employee turnover from  one company to 
another is well -documented in the international literature in terms of its impact  on efficiency, 
productivity, profitability, and innovation. Public service departments within South Africa, however, 
have been grappling with the challenge of retaining skilled employees who are enticed to better paying 
corporate organisations in the private sector (Majola and Ogony, 2018). This trend has emerged as a key 
determinant in the local state, with young employees not remaining within adequate service to develop 
sufficient institutional knowledge and experience (LGSETA, 2016). The implications of this exit include 
the possibility of dismantling of the core project team, leading not only to serious challenges around loss 
of institutional knowledge, but change management effects on the team, and productivity performance 
issues (Graham and Englund, 2004). 
At a more critical level it is important to note that given the vulnerability of SOEs in South Africa to weak 
corporate governance and systems that have been characterised by corruption, recent studies have put 
the spotlight on the role of party and state politics and its negative influence in  SOE environments 
(Mafukata and Musitha, 2018). Team personnel changes could therefore be a result of poor morale and 
high levels of stress (Sharma and Lutchman, 2006). Research done at  the level of the local st ate in 
Durban for example, highlighted the negative influence of politics  that affected technical decision -
making, a compliance-driven legal framework, and a generally unsupportive institutional environment 
that disillusioned and marginalised planning professionals to the extent that two thirds of all the staff 
surveyed responded that given the opportunity, they would resign from the municipality (Moodley, 
2019). The researchers therefore contend that this is an issue that deserves more attention and further 
research, as it could also be a key determinant in contributing to high staff turnover. 
Skills challenge unique to the parastatal and not its contracted service providers 
In making sense of the complex nature of the skills challenge, it is useful to disaggregate whether the 
capability challenges are unique to the state and the extent in which this has dogged the private sector. 
In order to test this, the responses from survey participants determining their  perception of the skills

challenge as they relate to the external service providers (referred to as  EPCMs) contracted-in by TCP 
for selected mega -projects is a useful proxy indicator. It should be  noted that these contractors are 
responsible for the execution of detailed engineering designs, procurement, construction, as well as the 
management of mega- projects. The results from the  survey are very interesting. Forty per cent of the 
respondents agree with the statement that EPCMs have the correct skill sets for delivering mega-projects 
while thirty-six per cent  of the respondents were unsure of the EPCMs’ skill sets  for mega-projects. 
Twenty-three per cent  of respondents disagreed that the EPCMs have the correct skill sets for  mega-
projects. The results do therefore appear to suggest that the EPCMs have stronger competencies in their 
teams than TCP to successfully execute mega-projects. 
EPCMs have access to both local and international resources in assembling project teams that are best 
suited in executing mega -projects. In the bidding for EPCM services, Transnet  requires that CVs and 
experience levels of personnel,  which must be included in bid documents , be submitted to TCP for 
evaluation purposes. At the same time though, the fact that  nearly one in four respondents were not 
convinced that their contractors were suitably skilled is also worrisome and again raises the issue of the 
international skills challenges. 
 The need for a blend of local and expatriate skills to augment TCP capacity 
The survey was able to investigate the prevalent perception amongst parastatal personnel where the 
requisite skills gap in TCP could be appropriately responded to. A statement testing  the option of 
matching local skills with the possibility of expatriates was included amongst the  list of seventeen 
statements. It may be useful for clarification purposes to note that the term  “expatriates” refers to 
individuals who are transferred outside their native country to another country that is described as the 
“host” country, specifically for employment purposes (Edström and Galbraith, 1977 in Hocking, Brown 
and Harzing, 2004:570). It is interesting that two-thirds (67%) of all respondents agreed that local and 
expatriates are required for its teams to execute mega-projects. It is difficult to postulate with certainty, 
the reasons for the majority of respondents to favour this option as this area is not well researched. In 
fact, while very little research has been done conducted on knowledge transfer within the public sector 
(Syed and Rowland, 2004b), empirical studies investigating the role of expatriates in public sector 
knowledge transfer are almost non -existent (Ravu, 2014). The researchers suggest that this  thinking 
could be based on the publication of reports by Transnet (2015) and JIPSA (2016) that  acknowledge 
that several critical skills such as architects, engineers , and geotechnical specialists  are in critical 
demand by organisations in South Africa. The ILO (2015) itself suggests that skills shortages in the short 
term can be compensated by the use of both local and foreign labour. However, Nersheim and Smith 
(2015) sound important cautionary notes,  pointing out that the difference in education and training 
systems could prove problematic, and that high levels of maturity are needed, with respect and 
acceptance of differences and common project goals. 
Conclusion 
In concluding this paper, it must be noted that between the time that the research was conducted and the 
submission of this paper, Transnet TCP  - as a specialist project execution unit  - became a business 
casualty, was restructure d, and then dissolved. The division was split , and all its project  staff was 
absorbed into other major business units of Transnet such as Transnet National Ports Authority, 
Transnet Freight Rail , and Transnet Port Operations. At the time of writing therefore, TCP is non -
existent with operating divisions now undertaking project execution using internal resources as well as 
external service providers. This decision is  a stark and telling  commentary on the state of project 
management expertise in South African parastatals. In this paper, by drawing attention to the 
perceptions of 191 personnel, the researchers have shown that the challenge in TCP was not a shortage 
of personnel due to inadequate funding or lack of professional posts within the public service; rather 
the researchers  have framed the challenge of an inadequately experienced team, lacking significant 
exposure to deal with the complexity of  managing megaproject execution. This is an extremely 
important distinction that we make between having qualified and trained personnel and those that are 
suitably experienced for  complex execution. The researchers note here that the parastatal has made 
substantial investment of its budget on traini ng (Transnet, 2019). Transnet also has a long and proud 
tradition of running its own training centres (e.g., Transnet School of Rail, Transnet School of Ports, etc.)

that focus on tailor-made specialist training requirements related to the maritime and railway trades 
(Transnet, 2015). Hence, the researchers argue that having trained staff in place, is a necessary but  is 
certainly not a sufficient condition to ensure successful mega-project execution. The value of years of 
experience and tacit knowledge on how to execute mega-projects is inestimable. 
Moreover, the researchers have uncovered the perception of extremely high personnel turnover and 
drawing on both authors’ experience from working within public service and from contemporary 
literature, pointed to the complicated political -institutional factors that often contribute to high  
professional staff turnover. Interestingly, the researchers  have also shown how staff viewed that 
challenge of project execution as more of an  internal crisis of inexperienced full -time staff than one 
endemic to its contractors. Finally, the researchers have shown how the majority of those surveyed saw 
value in enhancing capability of the parastatal by matching much -needed local expertise with those of 
sought-off expatriate experience in the short term, whilst more longer-term solutions were being crafted. 
The researchers acknowledged that Transnet has recogni sed the human resource issue as a serious  
challenge and as an urgent mitigation measure intends to develop a ‘strategic workforce plan’ to 
determine temporary, intermediate , and long -term skills requirements (Transnet, 2015:16). The 
researchers also note  the progress made by the Transnet divisions and businesses in implementing 
cooperation agreements with tertiary institutions to support tailor-made programs for its specialised 
requirements (Transnet, 2015). From the researchers experience within the public service, there are no 
quick fix solutions and that building sustainable capacity will take time. Whilst the researchers note that 
importing capability is not ideal, they suggest that as an urgent short-term measure, sourcing such 
experienced resources from local and international pools may have to be considered. 
In the medium term, the expansion of Transnet’s School of Excellence to cater for project management 
skills development would be required. More importantly however, given that the issue is less about skills 
and more about experience, exchange programmes for ‘on-job training and exposure’ both locally and 
internationally must be included in EPCMs’ contracts. Other simple  mechanisms such as contracting 
retired personnel with the relevant discipline experience for coaching and mentorship programmes also 
must be explored. Whilst these suggestions are important, the researchers contend that much more 
fundamental interventions are required, not just by Transnet, but by all SOEs. The insights offered by 
Turok (2010), more than a decade ago, on what it means to be a developmental state are more relevant 
than ever before now, as the researchers reflect on what it means to build the capability of the state. He 
suggested three important features that set apart truly developmental states. First, he argued that they 
are capable of planning ahead and making long-term strategic decisions beyond pragmatic responses to 
political pressures and problems as they emerge; second, he posited that to affect change boldness and 
concerted effort on the part of government  was required; and third, he suggested that  developmental 
states are democratic, in that the various actors and interests are brought together to craft a  common 
purpose and direction. 
In drawing from Turok’s (2010) insights, the researchers suggest that what is required from Transnet 
senior management is urgent and bold decision -making. It requires crafting long -term plans that will 
ensure building pathways for staff development that pr event them from leaving the organisation. This 
is difficult and requires fundamental shifts in the organisational culture and creating the institutional 
and political environment that will ensure that skilled professional chose to remain within SOEs. It also 
means mobilising the energies from stakeholders from the academic sector, business, labour, and even 
civil society to partner for  developing sustainable human resource development solutions. The 
researchers believe that the tide can be turned and realising the goals of National Development Plan is 
possible, but it will require visionary leadership and political will. The stake of building a capable South 
African state is too high for it to fail.
