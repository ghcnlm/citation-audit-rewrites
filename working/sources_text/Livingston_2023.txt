ABSTRACT  
Community -college professors possess knowledge in distinct 
disciplines and have varied experiences that they encompass in their 
college classrooms. Additionally, creating effective environments for 
teaching and learning require these assets from instructor s to fulfill their 
curriculum needs. Teaching is a multidimensional and complex activity 
that requires the instructor to utilize various tools to effectively engage 
college learners. Often, instructors rely on their past educational 
experiences that were b ased on pedagogy (child -focused teaching) to 
deliver intricate material to adult learners. In this case, a dichotomy of 
subject delivery may arbitrarily be sustained in the classroom where the 
effectiveness of pedagogy limits the development of critical -th inking skill 
sets. Andragogy is an adult learning theory that informs teaching 
methodology developed to focus more on learner -based practices that 
grow from the content of lessons. It has been effective in engaging the 
characteristics of community college learners (Knowles, 1980b) in 
developing skill sets vital to various disciplines. The aim of this article is 
to encourage discussions on college campuses of how using andragogy 
advances adult learning by exploring andragogy usage in Radiologic

Technology (R T) and Early -Childhood Education (ECE) classrooms at an 
urban community college. Moreover, it is hoped that this article will 
provide undergraduate educators with instructional approaches that 
advance adult learning outcomes.  
 
Key words:   Andragogy, field  experience, problem -based learning, 
simulated -based learning, team -based learning  
 
 
 
Professors must seek ways to motivate and challenge students to be 
critical thinkers and reflective (Sanchez & Lewis, 2014). For doctors to 
make informed decisions regard ing a person’s health, it is customary for 
them to send a patient to get various diagnostic exams including an X -ray. 
The technologists who perform these services must be proficient in 
administering these health exams. Early -childhood educators must also b e 
pivotal in using analytical skills and thoughtful academic exercises with 
developmental experiences to produce successful learning outcomes for 
their students. These professionals rely on critical — thinking skills to 
adjust parameters relevant to their ca reer. Employers seek to hire qualified 
candidates with the expectation that these individuals will have the 
knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary to work efficiently in 
various fields of work. Thus, it is crucial that those teaching learners 
aspiri ng to become radiologic technologists or early -childhood education 
(ECE) practitioners be effective at facilitating learning.   
For the past several years, one author of this article has observed 
and received feedback from clinical health — care professional s regarding 
deficits in radiography students’ critical thinking and communication 
skills. In addition, the second author of this article has made the same 
observation of ECE program students. Current research reveals some 
possible explanations for these ob servations, including students’ social 
and environmental barriers, cultural influences, and personal experiences 
(Marr & Nicoll, 2013). These factors influence student  progress in 
academic, career, and clinical goals (Marr & Nicoll, 2013). While many 
acade mic institutions in various disciplines have successfully graduated 
competent candidates in foundational subjects, the aspect of ensuring 
entry -level candidates’ comprehensive preparation and equipping them 
with skills to confront real -life challenges in t heir disciplines has its 
deficiencies regarding communication and teamwork (Hart Research,
<<<PAGE=3>>>
31  
2015). Moreover, the goal of our teacher -education unit with respect to 
ECE program graduates is to not only engage students in the foundation of 
education principle s and ECE academic content, but to help them develop 
the critical — thinking skills and communication skills necessary to become 
effective, multicultural educators. Radiologic science and early —
childhood educators can modify their teaching styles by incorpor ating 
andragogy in their instructional practice in the classroom to motivate and 
engage learners in becoming better critical thinkers and communicators.  
The aim of this article is to encourage discussions on college 
campuses of how using andragogy advances  adult learning by exploring 
andragogy usage in Radiologic Technology (RT) and Early -Childhood 
Education (ECE) classrooms at an urban community college. Approaches 
of teaching adults will be explored with the goal of advancing radiologic 
technology and ECE  students’ competence in critical thinking, 
communication, and effective teamwork. Moreover, descriptions of how 
andragogy appears in both the radiologic technology and ECE classrooms 
will be discussed to improve the technical and patient interaction skill s of 
the radiologic technology (RT) student and to improve the teaching skills 
of ECE students. Additionally, it is hoped that this article will provide 
undergraduate educators with instructional approaches that advance adult 
learning outcomes.  
 
Literatur e Review  
Instructional Approaches  
 The Instructor’s Role  – The instructor’s role in the adult learning 
context is that of facilitator of learning or even a proactive mediator 
(Currie, 2000). The learner gained the most in the learning process when 
an instr uctor collaborated with the learner by recognizing and supporting 
the learner’s knowledge and encouraging the learner in their growth 
process (Currie, 2000).  
 Diversity of Learners  – It is important to be thoughtful or 
perceptive of learner differences wh ile not generalizing with respect to 
stereotypes of race, age, or culture (Imel, 2001; Lange et al., 2011). Thus, 
respecting diversity among adult learners in the classroom or learning 
environment is crucial (Freedman et al., 2012; Knowles et al., 2012). 
Specifically, valuing adult learner diversity and creating a learning 
environment in which learners are free to explore, share, and continue to 
grow is key (Knowles et al., 2012).

 Constructivist Methods  – Applying constructivist theories to the 
practice of  adult learning is recommended strongly in the education 
literature (McCall et al., 2018). A constructivist approach as described by 
many articles, is to emphasize teaching critical thinking skills using 
discovery methods, questions, probing, and problem -based learning 
strategies (Allen, 2008; Elmborg, 2010; Stern & Kaur, 2010). The aim of 
this approach is to empower learners to be self -governing, autonomous, 
lifetime learners (McCall et al., 2018).  
 Scaffolding in instruction is another constructivist prac tice 
(McCall et al., 2018). Scaffolding involves breaking down complex tasks 
or skills into small parts that can be completed alone (McCall et al., 2018). 
“This makes the task less stressful and more manageable, and helps adult 
learners see their progress”  (McCall et al., 2018, p. 38; Gust, 2006; 
Kenner & Weinerman, 2011; Rapchak & Behary, 2013; Rapchak et al., 
2015). Moreover, scaffolding offers multiple chances for learning for adult 
learners (McCall et al., 2018).  
 The Nature of Learning Experiences  – A review of the literature 
with respect to adult learning advocates for learning experiences that are 
well -structured, practical, and collaborative for the learners to achieve the 
best learning outcomes (McCall et al., 2018). Sharing with learners the 
steps that will be covered during a class session or creating supplementary 
instructional resources like handouts, videos, etc., are examples of 
structure (McCall et al., 2018). These resources can help learners connect 
the topics discussed in class to tasks or specific assignments (Lange et al., 
2011).  
 Identifying students’ prior experiences and connecting them with 
new instructional topics can make learning practical (McCall et al., 2018). 
Using pre -assessments to determine learner information literacy streng ths 
and needs, perceived confidence levels, and previous uses of information 
sources is a useful method (Dahlen, 2012).  
 Furthermore, collaborative learning activities are key (Mc Call et 
al., 2018). Adult learners can profit from exchanging their experien ces 
with each other while connecting them to new learning (McCall et al., 
2018). Opportunities for peer -to -peer learning, in -depth learner 
discussions, and other types of experiences where adult learners can share 
their knowledge with their peers and the i nstructor enable the learning 
process (McCall et al., 2018).  
 
Andragogy – Adult Learning Theory
<<<PAGE=5>>>
33  
Andragogy is the ability to facilitate adult learning (Davenport, 
1987). Alexander Kapp, a German educator, first used the term 
(andragogy) in 1833 to classify learning strategies that focus on adults  
(Knowles, 1975a). Malcolm Knowles is widely known for his work on 
andragogy, popularizing the term that more concisely describes the art and 
science of adult learning. Now, andragogy is classified as an alt ernative to 
pedagogy and “refers to learner -focused education for people of all ages” 
(Usman, 2015). Knowles (1980b) proposed that self -actualization should 
be the goal of adult education and the learning process should constitute 
the emotional, psychologi cal, and intellectual aspects of a person. Thus, 
the educator’s role can be viewed as assisting adults to develop to their 
full potential.  
Knowles (1973) stated that there are five assumptions that define 
the characteristics of adult learning that are dif ferent from the assumptions 
regarding child learners. They are:  
1.  Self -Concept — As an individual matures, their self -concept moves 
from one of being a dependent personality toward one of being a 
self -directed human being.  
2.  Adult Learner Experience — Adults accum ulate a growing pool 
of experience that becomes an increasing resource for learning.  
3.  Readiness to Learn — Adults’ readiness to learn becomes 
increasingly oriented to the developmental tasks of their social 
roles.  
4.  Orientation to Learning — As a person matures, their time 
perspective changes from one of postponed application of 
knowledge to an immediacy of application. As a result, their 
orientation towards learning shifts from one of subject -
centeredness to one of problem -centeredness.  
5.  Motivation to Learn — As a p erson matures, the motivation to 
learn is internal. This is from their self -driven goal of achieving a 
higher social, economic, and/or academic platform.  
To be effective, educators must consider the major supposition that 
underpins andragogy — that  adult le arners, through their own backgrounds 
and rich life experiences, are driven by a desire to become self -directed, 
independent, and autonomous in their learning goals. The college educator 
may tailor distinct lesson plans and activities based in these concep ts. 
Knowles (1980b) suggests that adult educators do the following:  
● Set a cooperative climate for learning in the classroom (improves 
communication).
<<<PAGE=6>>>
34  
● Assess the learner’s specific needs and interests (motivation).  
● Develop learning goals based on the learn ers’ needs, interests, and 
skill levels.  
● Design sequential activities to achieve the learning objectives 
(scaffolding) (Vygotsky, 1994).  
● Work collaboratively with the learner to select methods, materials, 
and resources for instruction (learning orientation ).  
● Evaluate the quality of the learning experience and adjust as 
needed, while evaluating the need for further learning (assessment, 
learning outcomes).  
Andragogy is anchored in the characteristics of adult learning, a 
process that is based on the learne r’s familiarity with the material being 
taught. It builds upon pedagogic methods described in Bloom’s taxonomy 
(1974). However, it pivots more on student -centered learning rather than a 
teacher -centered approach. Lessons are geared more to students’ own 
ex periences and correlation to subject matter rather than by ideas and 
examples from an author or instructor. Furthermore, adult learners link 
new knowledge to a wide range of personal experiences, which serve as 
valuable resources in the classroom. “The lea rners in andragogy exhibit 
eagerness to learn and further develop in all respects with innate 
motivation” (Usman, 2015: p. 3).  
Reflecting upon the concept of pedagogy, which developed 
between the 7 th  and 12 th  centuries in the elementary schools of Europe, the 
term stems from two Greek words: “ paid ,” which means “ child ” and 
“agogu s” that means “ leader of ” (Usman, 2015). Knowles (1973) defined 
it as the art and science of teaching children. Pedagogy has been used 
since the Ancient Greek times and has been applied as the standard 
method and practice of education ever since. When referring to teaching, 
pedag ogy  is used often as a synonym (Usman, 2015). Pedagogy 
“embodies teacher -focused education. In the pedagogic model, teachers 
assume responsibility for making decisions about what will be learned, 
how it will be learned, and when it will be learned” (Usman,  2015: p. 2).  
Knowles (1980b) suggested that andragogy and pedagogy should 
not be viewed as dichotomous models, but rather two ends of an 
educational spectrum. The learning theories are compared in the chart 
(below) to illustrate the differences among peda gogy and andragogy 
(Knowles, 1980b):

Andragogy builds upon pedagogy and has been utilized in professional 
education for several years (Fink, 2013). It has been established as 
improving communication in pharmacological students (McDonough, 
2006) and teamwork with nursing students (Crook, 1985).  
 
Adult Learning Applications Linking RT and ECE Classrooms  
Simulated -based learning (Kong, 2015) promo tes learning as an 
active process in which students reflect on their prior knowledge and 
construct their own views of the world through the physical and social 
interactions experienced (Kolb, 2005). Assessing key concepts in 
situation -based activities, hel ps the instructor navigate the dynamics of 
their students’ cognitive skills and acquisition of integrated learning 
(Kong, 2015).  
Dee Fink (1998) formulated a taxonomy addressing this paradigm 
in adult education that forms a coherent design, which supports  significant 
learning. It can support competence in communication and effective 
teamwork in healthcare education and early — childhood education. His 
taxonomy builds on the premise of using learning goals to connect 
learning activities and assessment. His th eory uses factors that consider 
the number of students, their level of education, the frequency of class
<<<PAGE=8>>>
36  
meetings, and the physical elements of the learning environment. Fink 
posits that these factors impact motivation and the dynamics of class 
activities.  He created a pie chart that illustrates the flow of significant 
learning for adults, which builds upon the theories of Bloom’s taxonomy.

37  
learning. Fink (2013b) formulated a backward — design process, for the 
facilitator to follow that focuses on situational factors that instructors face 
in challenging course material and learning goals. The characteristic of the 
learner is also considered as well as the characteristic of the teacher. The 
facil itator is instructed to design a course prioritizing learning goals and 
important situational factors faced by the instructor such as number of 
students, type of students, equipment availability, and classroom 
environment. From this assessment, Fink sugges ts that a course designer 
should analyze these situational factors, and then formulate learning goals, 
feedback, and assessment procedures that assists in selecting the best 
teaching/learning activities for their audience. We can apply the 
andragogy princi ples of Fink’s taxonomy in a variety of ways if aligned 
within the scope of course outcomes. The chart (below) is an example of 
the applying Fink’s taxonomy in an RT or ECE classroom.

Effective teaching requires adaptive clinical skills, especially in 
communication by applying them to real -life appl ications. Using problem -
based models focused on tasks that adults can perform, rather than on 
memorization of content, can be applied as a team -oriented or individual 
project. Adults are problem -solvers by nature and learn best when the 
subject is of immed iate use and effective instruction involves the learner 
in solving real -life problems (Abela, 2009). Barkley (2009) suggested 
using an engagement technique, such as situation -based problems, that 
help learners make inferences on the learned principles that  nurture a 
deeper level of understanding. These concepts are believed to nurture 
independent thinking in active learning (Barkley, 2009).  
With this technique, students will not only identify theories, but 
make connections in how they relate to the main top ics associated with 
theory (radiologic sciences) that are essential in developing analytical 
thinking skills (Barkley, 2009). A reflective clinical journal, where 
students document challenging cases observed or completed is an ideal 
learning exercise to di scuss early in a lecture. Asking students reflective 
questions develops independent analysis of the student’s cognition and 
participation of the presented material in the module (Barkley, 2009). The 
instructor may analyze these reflective assignments, asse ss the entry, and 
give feedback to each student’s response to the clinical situation asking a
<<<PAGE=14>>>
42  
variety of questions from patient care, anatomy, exposure factors, 
positioning, pathology and communication.  
 
Radiologic Technology (RT) Programs  
  Pedagogical in struction has been the main tenet of teaching in 
many radiologic technology programs. The educator’s role of designing 
course material connecting to the learners’ interests, experiences and skill 
levels is an important aspect for clarifying both fundamenta l and vague 
material. As an individual becomes more familiar with course content, 
they seek increasing autonomy and inspiration to grow in their adaptation 
to learning. As commonly practiced, students are given instructions and 
directed to recall and apply  distinct information from a reservoir of 
relevant subject matter. While this is the primary objective of learning 
goals in a subject -centered framework, developing critical perception in 
learners should additionally be an essential part of the instructor’ s role. 
This is where RT faculty and clinical staff technologists can form a more 
symbiotic relationship in adapting teaching methods that center towards a 
learner’s progress based on their personal experience in the clinical 
setting. Adapting self -reflect ive content into lesson activities where both 
theoretical and clinical aspects converge into a learning platform may 
foster students’ critical — thinking skills.  
 
Andragogy in the Radiologic Technology Classroom  
In andragogy, Knowles describes the chief assumption of self -
directedness where the individual takes the initiative of determining their 
needs. Addressing interpersonal as well as intrapersonal aspects of an 
individual’s level of understanding requires the  educator’s awareness of 
how adults learn as individuals. Applying relationships that are familiar 
with the student will let the learner know why they are learning specific 
data relevant to their discipline.  Peyton (1998) points out that most adult 
learne rs also require the motivation provided by teachers for effective 
learning to take place. This is paramount in the clinic where real -life 
situations join a learner’s connection to theoretical principles (Abela, 
2009).  
For example, one author of this artic le has developed scenario -
based activities that are incorporated in the RT students’ capstone course. 
Students are given patient -centered and technical dilemmas to resolve as 
individuals, in collaborative projects, and classroom activities. For second -
year  radiologic technology students, lesson plans are designed to coincide
<<<PAGE=15>>>
43  
with the American Registry of Radiologic Technology’s certification 
content that qualified students need to pass to gain employment as 
certified radiologic technologists. Categories are  divided with respect to 
imaging parameters, applied sciences and patient care. Relevant material 
is scaffolded by starting off with foundational material, which then 
progresses into application of theory on challenging issues involved in the 
discipline. T he following practices can benefit students in the classroom.  
● Situation or problem -based modules:  The instructor will create 
learning modules (case studies) that make specific references to the 
material covered in a lecture (Barkley, 2009). Analytical que stioning 
in this module is based on real -life situations in the clinical field. An 
individual or a group of students must first identify the correct 
principles and then discuss the modifications that need to be applied in 
order to resolve the problem.  
● Ref lective Statements:  The students will document reflective 
observations made in laboratory activities or clinical experiences with 
relevant topics ranging from pathology, equipment utilized, patient 
assessment, technical factor considerations or alternate applications 
that may be required (Brookfield, 1986). Documentation is based on 
the background of the selected field study and the learner’s personal 
conclusions.  
● Argumentative Statement:  The instructor makes a statement about a 
specific issue (Barkley, 2 009). It can be a topic on patient care, 
cultural issue, adaptive clinical protocols or a communicable disease, 
etc. Students are selected to agree or disagree with the statement and 
discuss their point of view on the topic based on their knowledge of 
the material. The instructor can pose a variety of statements with 
different variables to monitor active learning in the college classroom.  
● Mind Mapping:  An exercise where the learners actively engage in 
processing specific information into a schematic map of  ideas 
associated with a topic (Barkley, 2009). A central theme is given based 
on the learning agenda. Learners draw diagrams representing words, 
ideas, issues, tasks, etc., around the central idea and the scenarios that 
branch from the topic. For example,  the topic may be a young trauma 
patient with a host of medical issues. The trauma physician has 
ordered several exams to be completed on this patient. Students will 
start with the patient placed in the center of a board and then draw 
branches that are ass ociated with standards ranging from patient care 
theory, therapeutic applications, diagnostic exam parameters, and

technical factors. This module helps students and groups think globally 
and creatively in analyzing, classifying, evaluating and listing, as well 
as structuring and visualizing important ideas.  
An example of a worksheet utilized in a patient care classroom follows:  
 
Patient Assessment Activity Worksheet  
  Case:   
A 32 -year -old female from South America arrives with a suspected 
fracture of her left humerus. The emergency department physician 
orders exams of the left humerus, left shoulder, and right elbow. 
Her primary language is Brazilian Portuguese and she speaks very 
little English. Her nurse states also that this patient has vertigo and 
has severe pain in her left arm.  
Instructions:   Use the grid below to make your assessment of the 
situation and the manner that you as a technologist would proceed 
with the exams ordered.

Foundations of the Early -Childhood Education Program
<<<PAGE=17>>>
45  
 A primary goal for our college’s ECE Program is to actively 
engage students in the learning process. To meet this goal, most of our 
ECE fa culty incorporate instructional strategies that enhance student -
centered methods and promote critical thinking (CT) as a theoretical 
foundation for class activities as “(CT) -based instruction, i.e., structuring a 
course by means of activities and strategie s fostering CT, has been lauded 
for improving both CT skills and effective learning” (Toy and Ok, 2012: 
p. 39). The process of thinking critically requires that adult learners 
recognize and research the assumptions that serve as a basis for their 
views, be liefs, and actions (Brookfield, 1987a). “The purpose of CT tends 
to be to scrutinize two particular and interrelated sets of assumptions” 
(Brookfield, 1997b: p. 18). Writing assignments in courses have been 
improved to reflect the CT process in the pre -wri ting stages of essays.  
Additionally, the progressivist and social reconstructionist 
philosophies of education have served as underpinnings to engage students 
in the teaching and learning process. The tenets of the progressivist 
philosophy are rooted in the  philosophies of two major advocates, John 
Dewey and Eduard C. Lindeman. Dewey (1938) postulated, “All genuine 
education comes about through experience” (p. 13).  Lindeman (1961), 
author of The Meaning of Adult Education  who attempted to provide a 
framewor k for adult education in his book, argued that adult education 
aimed to train people to participate and to expose intelligent influence in 
small collective units like the home, the neighborhood, community, trade 
union, society, etc.  The progressivist phil osophy of education supports 
students’ responsible participation in society as well as enables them to 
gain practical knowledge and develop problem -solving skills. In tandem, 
the social reconstructionist philosophy of education, which is also student -
cente red, helps students prepare for a society that is constantly changing. 
Through the lens of this philosophy, the purpose of education is to urge 
“schools, teachers, and students to focus their studies and energies on 
alleviating pervasive social inequities and, as the name implies, 
reconstruct society into a new and more just social order” (Sadker and 
Zittleman, 2010: p. 284). These two educational philosophies more 
accurately reflect the educational practice in our ECE classrooms.  
 
Andragogy in the Early — Ch ildhood Education Classroom  
 At least four instructional strategies have been employed in our 
ECE classrooms that reflect these two educational philosophies including 
small group work, team -based learning, role play, and service -learning.
<<<PAGE=18>>>
46  
The strategies ha ve required use of a flipped classroom concept. Students 
use open educational resources (OER) to engage in academic content from 
the first day of class. Other content is provided, using technology 
resources, like videos, PowerPoints, pre -recorded video lec tures, etc. 
Students are urged to review and analyze this content prior to coming to 
class so that the classroom can be devoted to application of the course 
content/knowledge to the work setting for which they are being prepared. 
It is customary for instru ctors to offer students vodcasts, pre -recorded 
video lectures, and/or podcasts to share the course content for usage 
external to the classroom in a flipped classroom approach (Jacobsen and 
Knetemann, 2017). Time in class can focus on other innovative mater ial 
using group activities (Jacobsen and Knetemann, 2017). The benefits of 
flipped classrooms include the formation of firm social bonds between 
students and with their teachers, increased levels of student appreciation of 
the learning environment, enhance d willingness to work collectively in 
class to gain deeper insight of the course content, and increased class 
attendance, student cooperation, and involvement in classroom activities 
(Jacobsen and Knetemann, 2017).  
 An effective instructional strategy used  in ECE classrooms is 
small — group learning (SGL). “SGL is a common technique in collegiate 
instruction and allows for several specific non -traditional learning contexts 
to develop within it, including problem -based, project -based, cooperative, 
collaborativ e, or inquiry -based learning” (Peltola, 2018: p. 323). A review 
of the literature reveals that students who learn jointly in small groups 
display greater academic achievement, motivation, and fulfillment than 
those who do not (Peltola, 2018). Vygotsky’s “z one of proximal 
development” illuminates the positive effect of group learning (Peltola, 
2018). Participating in small groups helps students learn more through the 
group interaction permitting them to reach a higher stage of knowledge 
than they could learn ing alone (Peltola, 2018). In many ECE classrooms, 
SGL is prevalent when activities are used that involve real -world problems 
that students analyze to help determine how they might confront the 
problem when they start teaching. SGL is also common in the st udents’ 
self -directed learning in their SGL community, and when the small group 
researches a topic and presents its findings to their class colleagues and/or 
present findings outside the ECE learning community.  
 In tandem with SGL, the team -based learning (TBL) approach has 
been effective in ECE classrooms. The flipped -classroom model and 
active -learning philosophy are used to foster learning through recurring
<<<PAGE=19>>>
47  
exchanges (Huggins and Stamatel, 2015). In TBL, “students learn basic 
course content on their own through readings and/or videos or other 
media; then most of the class time is spent working on activities in stable, 
small groups” (Huggins and Stamatel, 2015: p. 228). Using this model, 
ECE classroom instructors can focus on designing effective team activ ities 
and facilitate discussions “within teams, between teams, and with the class 
as a whole,” reducing the emphasis on conveying course content (Huggins 
and Stamatel, 2015: p. 228). The strength of TBL features are supported in 
diverse theoretical foundat ions (Hosseini, 2010). A few that the authors of 
this article believe support TBL in ECE classrooms are andragogy theory 
espoused by Knowles, cognitive theories espoused by Dewey, Piaget, and 
Vygotsky, and behavior — leaning theories like those of Skinner an d 
Bandura (Hosseini, 2010).  
 The TBL approach has been effective in ECE classrooms because 
of its benefits to students including (1) fostering independent learning and 
personal accountability; (2) increased, and more robust, interactions 
between students and teachers; (3) critical and creative thinking skills are 
practiced; and (4) advancing affective skills like communication, 
discussion, and decision making (Huggins and Stamatel, 2015). In the 
ECE classrooms at our community college, OER and/or other cou rse 
content is made available to students in advance of class, instruction is 
differentiated, specific team roles are given to students, research is 
conducted on topics, and presentations are developed in teams and 
presented in teams to class colleagues.  
 Adding to TBL, role -play in the classroom has been used as a 
means of helping visual learners to gain a better grasp of course content. 
Role play is used in multiple disciplines like law, business, history, 
engineering, and education (Pettinger et al., 201 4). “As Fink (2003a) 
noted, role play simulations are rich learning experiences in which 
students are able to simultaneously achieve multiple kinds of significant 
learning,” (Pettenger et al., 2014: p. 504). Students who participate in role 
play simulation s get the chance to interact, reflect, and analyze 
information, problems, and situations (Pettenger et al., 2014). Role play in 
our ECE classrooms has included designing skits that illustrated academic 
content and identification of authentic problems in th e ECE classroom that 
students might encounter when they begin teaching. This strategy has 
helped to clarify content and has engaged students more because they 
enjoyed participating.
<<<PAGE=20>>>
48  
The fourth instructional strategy used in many ECE classrooms is a 
service -learning component. An example reflected in the ECE classroom 
practice is in the Language Arts for Young Children course sections where 
students participate with the Reading Partners Project, which is nationally 
recognized for building children’s literacy . Students tutor children a 
minimum of 10 hours during the semester to develop their reading and 
literacy development skills, and, in the process, gain experience working 
with children who have some of the greatest need in developing their 
foundational ski lls in literacy.  
 
Conclusion  
As professors who facilitate adult learning, one must recognize that 
pedagogy steers students’ mastery of a specific subject content and might 
not build skills, abilities, and positive attitudes. It holds no measure of a 
learner’s sequential practice in co gnition, affective and psychomotor 
skills. In contrast, andragogy — an adult learning theory — informs teaching 
methodology developed to focus more on learner -based practices that 
grow from the content of lessons. It has been effective in engaging the 
characte ristics of community college learners (Knowles, 1980b) in 
developing skill sets vital to various disciplines including RT and ECE.  
Applying andragogical approaches can assist the facilitator in 
developing metacognition (awareness and understanding of one' s own 
thought processes) in RT and ECE learners. This is a key component in 
developing the learner’s effectivity in their academic and clinical 
progression. While there are various methods involved in andragogy that 
can be applied in the classroom, the ver y inherent nature of the adult 
students’ self -reliance and motivation is the main issue that RT and ECE 
educators face as an obstacle. Dissuading students from guided -based 
practices and moving them towards an environment that provides field 
experience, su pports self -directedness and contributes profoundly to the 
learner’s success. Thus, adapting current adult educational methods in the 
classroom has multiple benefits in which RT and ECE classrooms share. It 
is up to the professor to understand the concepts  of andragogy, consider 
their students’ learning styles and academic background, and build 
effective courses that address these parameters.  
This article explored how andragogy was used in RT and ECE 
classrooms at an urban community college. In RT classroom s, simulated -
based learning, problem -based learning, reflective exercises, and mind 
mapping approaches were used. In ECE classrooms, small -group work,
<<<PAGE=21>>>
49  
team -based learning, role playing, and service -learning approaches were 
identified as approaches that opt imize adult learning outcomes. For both 
RT and ECE classrooms, the goal was to advance the critical thinking and 
communication among adult learners.  
The authors of this article encourage discussions on college 
campuses of how using andragogy advances adult  learning. Moreover, it is 
hoped that the andragogical approaches identified in the article will serve 
as examples that can be used to expand the learning outcomes of adult 
learners.
