strategies, outcomes, facilitators and
barriers in African health systems

Abstract
Background: The need for research-based knowledge to inform health policy formulation and implementation is a
chronic global concern impacting health systems functioning and impeding the provision of quality healthcare for
all. This paper provides a systematic overview of the literature on knowledge translation (KT) strategies employed
by health system researchers and policy-makers in African countries.
Methods: Evidence mapping methodology was adapted from the social and health sciences literature and used to
generate a schema of KT strategies, outcomes, facilitators and barriers. Four reference databases were searched using
defined criteria. Studies were screened and a searchable database containing 62 eligible studies was compiled using
Microsoft Access. Frequency and thematic analysis were used to report study characteristics and to establish the final
evidence map. Focus was placed on KT in policy formulation processes in order to better manage the diversity of
available literature.
Results: The KT literature in African countries is widely distributed, problematically diverse and growing. Significant
disparities exist between reports on KT in different countries, and there are many settings without published evidence
of local KT characteristics. Commonly reported KT strategies i nclude policy briefs, capacity-building workshops and policy
dialogues. Barriers affecting researchers and policy-makers in clude insufficient skills and capacity to conduct KT activities,
time constraints and a lack of resources. Availability of qualit y locally relevant research was the most reported facilitator.
Limited KT outcomes reflect persisting difficulties in outcome identification and reporting.
Conclusion:This study has identified substantial geographical gaps in knowledge and evidenc ed the need to boost local
research capacities on KT practices in low- and middle-inco me countries. Evidence mapping is also shown to be a useful
approach that can assist local decision-making to enhance KT in policy and practice.

Background
The need for research-based knowledge to inform health
policy and practice is a chronic global public health con-
cern [ 1– 3]. Knowledge generated through health research
has the potential to improve health outcomes, promote
service delivery and strengthen health systems functioning
[4– 6]. However, a consistent finding from the health
services literature has been the failure to translate research
findings into health policy and practice [ 7]. Despite bur-
geoning interest in this know – do gap, the translation
process remains slow, haphazard and unpredictable,
resulting in reduced health gains vis-á-vis societies ’ invest-
ment in research [ 8, 9]. In low-resource, high-disease
settings, such as those found in many African countries,
the consequences of ineffective knowledge translation
(KT) are amplified, emphasising the need for health sys-
tem decision-makers to justify their decisions based on
high-quality evidence [ 3, 10, 11].
KT is a term commonly used to describe the complex
process of moving research-based evidence into policy

and practice, although the term (and its related field) is
diverse and diffused [ 12– 14]. In this review, our under-
standing of KT aligns with the Canadian Institute of
Health Research, which defines KT as “a dynamic and
iterative process that includes the synthesis, dissemin-
ation, exchange and ethically sound application of know-
ledge to improve health, provide more effective health
services and products, and strengthen the health care
system” ([15], p. 1). Within this conceptualisation,
‘knowledge exchange ’, ‘knowledge interaction ’ and, more
recently,‘integrated knowledge translation’ have also gained
traction as these terms emphasise the central role of
knowledge users and their influence on the KT process
[16– 20]. For the purposes of this article, KT is used as the
overarching term and these related concepts viewed as
implicit in the broader definition.
In recent years, efforts to increase the uptake of health
research into policy have intensified globally, resulting in
a growing body of literature on KT [ 16, 21– 27]. From
this literature, several factors have been found to influ-
ence the use of research in policy-making. In an updated
systematic review, Oliver et al. [ 28] identified several
barriers and facilitators to evidence uptake by policy-
makers. The most frequently reported barriers indicate
that poor access to good quality, relevant research and a
lack of timely research output greatly decrease the
potential for research to influence policy, while collabo-
rations between researchers and policy-makers, skills-
building with policy-makers and improved relationships
tend to enhance research use. A review by Oliver et al.
[28] focused on policy-making across different areas,
including criminal justice, education and food policy;
however, 126 of 145 included studies related specifically
to health policy-making. Focusing on health policy alone,
Lavis et al. [ 29] further emphasised the importance of
engaging with research users to enhance the uptake of
evidence in health policy decision-making. Oliver et al.
[28] go on to describe the importance of informal know-
ledge in decision-making, such as personal experience,
clinical expertise and other tacit-based knowledge. These
authors conclude that formal research-based knowledge
is just one source of information for policy-makers and
that identifying different types of knowledge is a crucial
step in getting research to influence policy, a finding
increasingly supported by others [ 5, 17, 30, 31]. Ad-
ditionally, research institutions that demonstrate ca-
pacity for generating high quality, reputable research
and close connections with policy-makers have been
shown to have greater embeddedness in the policy-mak-
ing process and therefore a greater influence in translating
their research into policy [ 26, 27, 32].
While various strategies such as policy briefs, colla-
borative workshops and KT platforms have been pro-
posed to enhance KT [ 1, 16, 29, 33– 36], evidence of their
comparative effectiveness remains limited [ 5, 7, 37].
Possible reasons for this include difficulties identifying
what outcomes should be measured, the need to
strengthen the validity of measurement instruments
and the inherently complex ways in which KT can
occur [ 14, 30, 38]. A key criticism from the literature has
been the failure of current KT strategies to account for
this complexity, including the specificity of the policy-
making process, its power dynamics, differing timelines
and unique contextual considerations, especially in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs) [ 17, 39– 41]. These
issues make the selection of appropriate, contextually rele-
vant KT strategies difficult for researchers and policy-
makers [ 42]. Moreover, researchers have highlighted the
weak relationship between health systems and research
systems, recognising the need to consider complex
systems issues and their influence on the adoption of
new knowledge [ 43, 44]. Box 1 summarises the central
challenges to KT in LMIC settings identified by the
current literature.
In Africa, where more than 50% of the world ’s LMICs
are located, there remains a paucity of research on KT
strategy selection and activities that promote the use of
research by health policy-makers, particularly in policy
formulation processes [ 42, 45]. Exacerbated by limited
funding availability and institutional research capacity to
generate locally relevant research [ 11, 44], there is an ur-
gent need to seek out cross-country learning opportunities
that boost understanding of KT strategies in this context.
This paper provides a mapping review of the literature
on KT strategies (particularly in the policy formulation
process) and their reported outcomes, barriers and facili-
tators in African health systems, with an emphasis on
southern African countries. This paper has four main
aims. Firstly, to position the current available research
on KT in African health policy-making within the
broader field of KT. Secondly, to provide a summarised

and synthesised understanding of the current status and
key issues within a massive and diverse body of literature
for African health system researchers and policy-makers.
Thirdly, to identify gaps in current knowledge and areas
for potential future research on local KT systems in
Africa. Finally, to generate a user-friendly evidence map,
testing the usefulness of the evidence-mapping approach
for this type of diverse and dispersed topic and for the
field of health policy and systems research more broadly.
Methods: systematic evidence mapping
Evidence mapping is an emerging method of synthesis
that provides a systematic overview of the literature on a
specific topic [ 46]. Like full systematic reviews, evidence
mapping employs methods that are reproducible and
transparent, applying explicit search procedures and ro-
bust inclusion/exclusion criteria [ 47, 48]. However, while
systematic reviews target specific research questions, evi-
dence mapping focuses on the nature, volume and charac-
teristics of the literature in order to identify, describe and
categorise what is known [ 49]. Despite methodological
similarities, evidence mapping has been distinguished
from the scoping review methodology by engaging with
stakeholders early in the research process, through the
increased rigor of systematic online database searches and
by the final production of a visual or searchable database
and/or user-friendly ‘map’ [50]. Evidence mapping is par-
ticularly useful for synthesising and increasing coherence,
giving shape within a broad or diverse field of interest,
where information is found in different sectors, and defi-
nitions are not concretised (as KT is known to be).
For the purposes of this paper, a systematic evidence
mapping process was adapted from the Global Evidence
Mapping Initiative [ 49]. Figure 1 outlines this process and
the three core tasks involved, including (1) setting the
boundaries and contexts of the map; (2) searching and
selecting relevant studies; and (3) reporting on yield and
study characteristics. What is presented here forms the
evidence map of research on KT strategies across African
health systems (with a focus on policy formulation).
The three-step mapping process was conducted between
July and October 2017. An overarching research question
seeking to elucidate what KT strategies are employed by
health researchers and policy-makers in African countries
and what barriers, facilitators and outcomes exist for these
strategies during policy formulation informed the initial
selection of key terms. The need to capture KT literature
relevant to health research and policy-making was ba-
lanced against the field ’s large and overlapping nomencla-
ture [ 14, 51]. Initial key terms included ‘knowledge
translation’, ‘health researchers’ and ‘health policy-makers’.
Final search terms were limited to those described by
Graham et al. [ 12] and identified by McKibbon et al. [ 13]
as highly sensitive for discriminating between KT and non-
KT literature. These include ‘knowledge translation ’,
‘knowledge transfer ’, ‘knowledge exchange ’, ‘research
utilisation ’, ‘implementation ’, ‘dissemination ’ and ‘dif-
fusion’. These terms were supplemented with Medical
Index Subject Headings and search filters for African
countries [ 52]. Groups of terms were linked using the
Boolean operator ‘AND’ then trialled in PubMed with
the assistance of an experienced librarian. Following a
preliminary search, evidence-based decision-making
was added to this list to compliment search results. An
additional file shows the final search strategy and list of
key terms (Additional file 1).
Eligibility criteria were generated using the PICO (Popu-
lation, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) framework.

Eligible populations included health researchers and pub-
lic health policy-makers involved in management or in
executive or policy-level decision-making about health
programmes or services. Other knowledge users, such as
non-government organisations, healthcare providers and
patients, were excluded in line with the scope of the evi-
dence map (focusing on policy formulation). Interventions
included any activity designed to facilitate the use of
research-based knowledge in public health policy-making.
Both active KT strategies (for example, KT platforms, col-
laborative workshops) and passive KT strategies (including
dissemination of reports or journal publications) were in-
cluded. To increase the specificity of the map within a
complex policy terrain, studies that focused on whole
policy analysis and policy implementation processes were
excluded, refining included studies to KT strategies
employed before or during the policy formulation stage of
the policy process. Any or no comparator between KT
strategies were eligible for inclusion. Studies that identified
KT strategies, barriers or facilitators, outcomes and con-
textual considerations were included. Outcomes of KT
strategies included, but were not limited to, changes in
knowledge, attitude, beliefs, behaviour, networks and part-
nerships. Papers were excluded if they focused mainly on
theoretical and conceptual developments of KT, termin-
ology debates and KT strategies employed in non-health
related fields (for example, in economic, agricultural or
criminal justice fields). Eligible study designs included ran-
domised controlled trials, observational studies, surveys,
qualitative research, case studies and mixed-methods
research. Only primary empirical research was included.
This excluded all analytical studies and research syntheses,
such as systematic reviews. Since no synthesis studies were
found that focused only on African countries, this was
deemed an appropriate exclusion criterion. Multinational
studies that involved African and non-African countries
and met all other criteria were included if results could be
traced to specific countries.
Four reference databases were searched using the
advanced search tools in each database and the guidance
of a second medical librarian. Databases included PubMed,
CINAHL (via EbscoHost), Web of Science and Scopus.
The search was limited to studies published in English
between the years 2000 and 2017, inclusive, to capture
modern KT strategies at work in African countries. Due
to the large number of results obtained in PubMed, the
‘best match ’ function was used to further limit search
results for this database. The ‘best match ’ function is
based on a weighted frequency algorithm that enables
o n l yt h o s es t u d i e sw i t ht h eh i g h e s tf r e q u e n c yo ft a r -
geted search terms to be included in search results.
This strategy is based on the rationale that the risk of
missing relevant articles is balanced against the logistical
constraints of screening an overly burdensome number of
irrelevant studies – which is a particular issue in large di-
verse topics such as this. Final search results were collated
in EndNoteX8™ and supplemented via searches of Google
Scholar and the Cochrane Library. A Dropbox database
established opportunistically by the research team in
September 2016 for the purposes of a broader research
project was also included. This database contains a com-
bination of relevant empirical studies and grey literature.
Following the removal of duplicates and preliminary
screening of study titles and abstracts, full texts of
remaining studies were procured, and a final screening
was conducted using the established inclusion/exclusion
criteria. In an iterative search process that promoted
saturation, reference lists of final key texts were mined
for additional relevant studies. Data was extracted on
study author(s), title, year of publication, publication
type, study design, location, underlying theory, funding
source, sample size, participant populations, KT strategies
employed, content focus and type of these strategies,
reported barriers, facilitators, outcomes and contextual
considerations. A searchable database containing this data
was compiled using Microsoft Access. Frequency and the-
matic analysis were used to report study characteristics
and to establish the final evidence map of KT strategies,
barriers, facilitators and outcomes.
Initial themes and findings were verified during inter-
views with nine South African policy-makers and re-
search managers during a subsequent companion study
(reported elsewhere [ 53]), which provided substantiation
of the evidence map, its main findings and tested the
application of the evidence mapping approach in local
health systems contexts.
Results
Search results
Initial search results identified a total of 1665 potential
studies. Following removal of duplicates ( n= 231) and
screening of titles/abstract ( n= 1182), the total number
of studies was reduced to 252. Screening of full text items
excluded an additional 196 studies. Reference mining of
the final 56 studies presented an additional six studies for
inclusion, which resulted in a total of 62 studies eligible
for evidence mapping. Figure 2 provides the complete
study flow diagram for this process.
Study characteristics
Included studies were published between 2005 and 2017,
with a general increase in publications over time (Fig. 3).
Studies were widely distributed across the African
region, with most studies published in South Africa and
Uganda (n = 15 studies each), followed by Nigeria ( n =11)
and Malawi ( n = 10). Just over half (32/62) of the included
studies were multinational, involving more than one
African country, other LMICs, or a combination of

<<<PAGE=5>>>
upper-, lower- and middle-income countries. Figure 4
displays the geographical spread of included studies, as
well as the large number of countries for which no
research was found.
Overall, multiple case studies (of KT strategies) were
the most popular study design, with 31 studies reporting
its use. This was followed by qualitative designs ( n = 12),
mixed methods ( n = 6), descriptive studies ( n =5 ) ,s u r -
veys ( n =3 ) ,m o d i f i e d ‘before and after ’ study designs
(n = 2), retrospective cohort designs ( n = 1), social net-
work analysis ( n = 1) and structured reflection ( n =1 ) .
Funding for studies originated predominantly from
international multilateral funders and foreign donor
agencies (81%), with only six studies reporting local
funding support as their primary source. Although a
variety of content areas provided the backdrop for the
focus on KT strategies, four broad areas accounted for
over half of the included studies, namely maternal and
child health (21%), governance, health information and
systems issues (18%), malaria (10%), and HIV/AIDS (8%).
KT strategies employed in African health systems
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of KT strategies
from an extract of four eligible studies. An additional
file provides the same information for all 62 studies
(Additional file 2). The commentary here reflects all
included studies. Figure 5 maps the KT strategies, dif-
ferent influencing factors and outcomes found across
all studies. The use of theory was reported in over half
the studies (33/62) and varied widely from research
utilisation models such as Weiss ’ model of research use
[54] to theories of planned behaviour (used to predict
policy-makers ’ intention to act on research evidence)
[55]. Many studies reported the use of more than one
theory, while no studies reported use of the same
theory, reflecting the inherent heterogeneity in perspec-
tives within the field [ 16].
Using Lavis et al. ’s[ 56] framework for linking research
to action, studies were categorised as employing ‘push’,
‘pull,’‘ integrated’ or ‘exchange’ type strategies for KT
(see Box 2 for definitions of these strategies). Integrated

and exchange strategies appeared most frequently, with
21 and 18 studies employing these, respectively, followed
by push ( n = 16) and pull strategies ( n = 3).
Four studies did not report specific KT strategies,
their focus on clarifying barriers and facilitators to the
KT process.
Policy briefs ( n = 15), capacity-building workshops
(n = 13), policy dialogues ( n = 11), and meetings
between and within communities of practice ( n = 11) were
reported most frequently. Traditional strategies, such as
conference presentations and journal publications, remain
popular ( n = 10 each), while the use of novel strategies,
such as online clearinghouses/sharing platforms for
research, media campaigns, knowledge translation plat-
forms and knowledge brokers, also appear to be gaining
ground. Knowledge translation platforms, specifically,
demonstrate opportunities for the integrated use of KT
strategies to foster collaboration and build capacity for re-
search use. For example, with the assistance of the WHO ’s
Evidence-Informed Policy N etwork (EVIPNet), a know-
ledge translation platform in Malawi has been attrib-
uted with hosting stakeholder mapping exercises,
capacity-building workshops a n ds t r u c t u r e dd i a l o g u e s
between national-level policy-makers, researchers and
policy implementers as well as producing evidence
briefs, facilitating the formation of a multidisciplinary
steering committee and holding meetings between
different communities of practice [ 57].
Despite clear information about who was targeted by
KT strategies, few studies provided specific details about
the duration, frequency or timing of events (27/62 re-
ported this) or the personnel required to conduct activities
(14/62 reported). In studies that did report this infor-
mation, details varied significantly. In one study invol-
ving seven southern African co untries, authors describe
three week-long residential workshops facilitated by four
researchers and include details on workshop duration and
content [58]. While in another multinational study, a 3-year
grant period is described in which activities occurred [ 11].

‘ Push’ strategies are led by researchers, intermediary groups or

information and/or research evidence based on their needs.
‘ Exchange’ efforts rely on partnerships between researchers
and research users who collaborate over short- or long-term
processes for mutual benefit.
‘ Integrated’ strategies include elements of push, pull and
exchange approaches in large-scale knowledge translation plat-
forms that work to connect policy needs with research tools.

Similarly, reports of contextual factors were diverse,
ranging from discussions of health system organisation,
policy environment and epidemiological profile [ 59]t o
socio-political and economic contexts, including levels
of decentralisation [ 60], legislative processes [ 61]a n d
the influence of donor aid [ 62]. Only three studies
reported cultural factors, all of which referred to issues of
language [ 63– 65]. Fourteen studies made no reference to
contextual factors, while six noted these factors as impor-
tant, but did not provide further details. Interestingly, des-
pite the importance of contextual factors on the success of
KT strategies, none of the reviewed studies established
clear causal links between reported contextual factors and
specific KT strategies or interventions, suggesting an
urgent need for realist-type approaches to assessing KT
strategies in complex local health systems.
Barriers and facilitators of KT
A list of the ‘top 10 ’ barriers and facilitators reported
across studies is provided in Fig. 5. Most studies re-
ported both facilitators and barriers ( n = 52), while a few
reported only facilitators ( n = 4) or only barriers ( n = 5).
One study did not report barriers or facilitators, but fo-
cused on the outcomes of implementing a health policy
advisory committee as a KT platform in Nigeria [ 66]. A
total of 46 different barriers and 46 facilitators were identi-
fied, and we further categorised these into those affecting
policy-makers, researchers or both. Based on our analysis
and ranking across the included studies, the main
barriers affecting policy-makers include access to rele-
vant, reliable research ( n = 12) and a lack of locally
applicable research ( n = 10). For researchers, poor com-
munication with policy decision-makers and
policy-maker attitudes towards using research were re-
ported as the most common barriers ( n = 13 each),
with limited awareness of the need for KT ( n =7 )a n da
high turnover of government staff ( n =6 )a l s ob e i n g
significant. There were several barriers that mutually af-
fected researchers and policy-makers, such as insufficient
skills and capacity to conduct KT activities ( n =2 1 ) ,t i m e
constraints ( n = 16) and insufficient resources ( n =1 5 ) .
The most common resource constraint reported across
the included studies was funding.
Regarding facilitators, the availability of quality research
relevant to local contexts was reported by policy-makers
as the greatest support to using research ( n = 21). This
was followed by consistent leadership and political will for
KT ( n = 9) and the presence of technical support and
expertise ( n = 5). Contrastingly, researchers were sup-
ported when they engaged with stakeholders early and
sustained this engagement over time ( n = 14). Credible
research results, researchers and research organisations or
networks were further noted to facilitate researcher efforts
at KT ( n = 13). Credibility is closely linked to trust
between researchers and policy-makers and can serve as
either a facilitator ( n = 10) or a barrier ( n = 2). Mutual
facilitators once again highlight the importance of capacity
to generate, understand and use research results ( n =1 7 ) ,
demonstrating that the presence of KT skills is potentially
as important as its absence. Furthermore, strong institu-
tional links and networks ( n =1 5 ) ,p a r t n e r s h i p sa n d
collaborations (n = 12), and the use of knowledge brokers
or local champions ( n = 12) highlight the significance of
interactions between researchers and policy-makers in
getting research to influence policy.
Outcomes of KT
Figure 5 lists the main outcomes of KT strategies re-
ported across studies. Twenty-seven studies (45%) did
not report any outcomes for the KT strategies used. In
the remaining 35 studies, there was little overlap and
most outcomes appeared to be study specific. For ex-
ample, one study focused on the activity output of a
knowledge broker specifically employed for KT [ 65], while
others reported the creation of a research repository [ 45]
and a database of researchers and policy-makers [ 67]a s
direct outcomes of KT processes. The most frequently
reported outcomes were changes in knowledge, attitudes
and practices ( n = 15) such as improved understanding
of the health policy-making process [ 68]. Studies that
attempted to categorise outcomes employed three types
of knowledge use, namely symbolic use, conceptual use
and instrumental use. These types were reported in

nine studies, in which instrumental and conceptual use
was most commonly reported. For example, in one
South African case study [ 69], researchers found that the
instrumental use of research directly contributed to the
development of a model on primary healthcare service
delivery while conceptual use helped place mental health
issues on the policy agenda. A study in Burkina Faso
described the practical changes in behaviour (instrumental
use) and the new knowledge acquired (conceptual use) by
participants in a 2-day workshop on malaria [ 70]. Only
one study compared the extent to which different uses of
research were employed, noting that instrumental use
occurred the least across six LMIC countries ’ analysed
policies and programmes [ 71]. The large number of stu-
dies neglecting to report study outcomes (including know-
ledge use), and the heterogeneous outcomes in those that
did, reflect persisting difficulties in the identification and
reporting of KT outcomes, an issue that has been noted
previously [ 14, 36, 37]. Three studies noted this difficulty
specifically, recognising the often unclear and long-term
impacts of KT strategies on research use [ 71– 73].
Discussion
This evidence mapping exercise has sought to impose
some framing on what is known to be a large, diverse
and dispersed body of research and literature. The litera-
ture on KT in African countries (as defined in this map-
ping exercise) is widely distributed and growing steadily.
However, significant disparities exist between countries,
and many remain without any significant published
evidence of research related to KT (Fig. 4). This high-
lights an ongoing need to boost local research capacities
on KT practices in many African countries [ 1, 74]. High
levels of foreign donor funding (80% of studies in this
case) create opportunities for conducting local research,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. However,
the extent to which this is sustainable and allows local
researchers and policy-makers to direct the research
agenda is debatable [ 75].
Together with Uganda, South Africa demonstrates a
relatively established research base compared to other
African nations, ranking the highest generators of KT
research on the continent. In South Africa, the presence

of historically strong research institutions that house
platforms for KT is a likely contributor to this base. For
example, the Centre for Evidence-based Healthcare at
Stellenbosch University and the Knowledge Translation
Unit at the University of Cape Town ’s Lung Institute
both actively target the production, synthesis and use of
health research in policy and practice [ 76, 77]. The
Cochrane African Network is another KT platform
housed in the South African Medical Research Council,
a nationally funded research organisation [ 78]. These in-
stitutions provide a rich support system for KT in the
country. However, despite local and international efforts,
even in countries such as South Africa or Uganda, the
research conducted to date is by no means sufficient to
meet the demands of diverse African contexts, and there
remains an “inadequate evidence base for doing
evidence-based KT ” in health policy ([ 79], p. 729).
Filling this research gap requires consideration of
factors beyond increasing research quantity across geo-
graphical areas. A central barrier identified by this
mapping process was the lack of high-quality evidence
relevant to local health systems contexts. Although
context specificity is a key challenge to KT research
production and use, research that meets local demands
and aligns with local priorities is more likely to be
translated into policy [ 3, 26, 80]. Capacity-building ini-
tiatives that target the development of KT skills for
local researchers and health policy-makers will be an
essential component to improving the availability and
applicability of research going forward.
Furthermore, to develop KT research quality, study
designs that extend beyond case studies and descriptive
work should be encouraged. Realist approaches, pragmatic
trials, impact evaluations (of KT strategies), implementa-
tion research and participatory action research are thought
to hold particular promise for developing, assessing and
implementing the social and contextually sensitive inter-
ventions inherently associated with KT [ 20, 81– 84]. These
designs offer opportunities for increased scientific rigour
and better consideration of contextual differences, inclu-
ding knowledge and power imbalances, to understand
what works, for whom and under what circumstances.
The diverse pool of KT strategies identified in this
mapping review demonstrate a variety of options avai-
lable to researchers and policy-makers when attempting
to ‘do’ KT in African settings. The combined use of
policy briefs, workshops, policy dialogues and meetings
with communities of practice hold particular promise,
as these are widely used and likely familiar to both re-
searchers and policy-makers. However, the time, effort
and resources involved in these activities should not be
underestimated. Conducting KT requires investment if
research-based knowledge is to be communicated appro-
priately and with the best chance of influencing its
intended audience [ 85]. The low level of locally generated
funding for KT research found in this review highlights
the need to advocate for stronger national funding mecha-
nisms to support a more sustainable model of knowledge
production and use.
Furthermore, this review highlights the increasing
preference for and value of integrated and exchange type
strategies. An integrated KT approach recognises that, to
influence policy, audiences need to be targeted early and
in multiple ways, leveraging personal and professional
networks that facilitate the bidirectional flow of know-
ledge [ 2, 30, 86]. Co-produced knowledge based on the
collaborative efforts of both researchers and policy-
makers at all stages of the research process, including
research generation, is a core tenet in this approach and
has the added benefit of addressing policy-makers ’ need
for more locally relevant, reliable research. This is in
line with findings from upper-income countries that
emphasise the need for integrated KT efforts that pro-
mote early and sustained engagements between stake-
holders [ 2, 86– 90].
The diversity in strategies found may be appealing as
it reflects options that can be shaped to different con-
texts. However, this diversity has been criticised for
demonstrating uncoordinated, haphazard and fragmen-
ted efforts to narrow the knowledge gap in Africa [ 91].
The wide variations in theories and outcomes identified
here support this conclusion and contribute to a persis-
tently unclear change pathway between research, KT
strategies and policy formulation. Furthermore, the lack
of uniformity and clarity on KT outcomes makes it
almost impossible to compare different interventions or
to measure progress (locally or regionally). There is an
urgent need to improve theories and methods that
rigoously assess KT interventions in real time and identify
relevant outcomes that are sensitive to the short- and
long-term effects of KT activities. This issue is not unique
to African contexts and reflects concerns expressed in the
global literature [ 7, 14, 20, 36– 38, 92– 95].
A final point arising from this mapping process con-
cerns issues of capacity. Knowledge and skills in prio-
ritising, generating, synthesising and applying research
were identified as the most common KT barriers and
facilitators for both researchers and policy-makers.
Capacity constraints have also been identified as one
cause of the know – do gap and a key priority for
addressing health in LMICs [ 1]. To date, individual
capacity has largely been the focus of efforts to im-
prove research production and use in policy. However,
recognising the need for broader system strengthe-
ning, tools that focus on i mproving institutional
capacity for research use are on the rise [ 27, 34, 96].
Additionally, regional and international partnerships
are supporting many countries to develop capacity to
Edwards et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:16 Page 10 of 14
<<<PAGE=11>>>
analyse their own health systems and develop locally
appropriate KT strategies such as, for example, EVIP-
Net in Malawi and Uganda [ 57, 97], the West African
Health Organization in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal and
Sierra Leone [ 98], and the Consortium for Health Policy
and Systems Analysis in Africa in South Africa, Tanzania,
Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria [ 99]. These capacity-building
efforts serve as useful learning opportunities for other
settings, including how to strengthen local research and
policy communities, promote collaboration, encourage the
formation of KT support networks and the more equitable
distribution of knowledge.
Limitations and implications for evidence map use
The broad search criteria and diverse search terms
employed in constructing this evidence map reflect
the complexity of KT. While the final set of in-
cluded studies indicate the breadth of research on
the African continent, there is a need to refine
these criteria and appraise the quality of resulting
studies in a more detailed systematic review. A po-
tential focus for further research may be to trace
KT strategies, outcomes, barriers and facilitators
through specific countries to provide more contex-
tualised theories of change [ 100].
Furthermore, time and resource constraints precluded a
comprehensive search of the literature. Few databases and
online searches of key sites mean important studies may
have been omitted from the final list of studies. Expanded
searches of the grey literature and inclusion of additional
databases should complement and enhance the current
map. However, given the scoping nature of the evidence
map, this was deemed appropriate for this study.
Finally, an evidence map is a cross-section of studies
conducted within a specific timeframe. The result is a
snapshot of KT strategies and their outcomes, barriers and
facilitators. The dynamic influence of contexts on KT
interventions, especially in Africa, mean this map should
serve only as a starting point. A detailed contextual ana-
lysis prior to its application and use is recommended.
Conclusion
This review presents an overview of the literature
on KT in African health systems by mapping the
strategies, outcomes, barriers and facilitators at
work across different countries. In doing so, it pro-
vides a useful summary for health policy-makers
and researchers seeking to conduct KT activities in
local contexts. Additionall y, it highlights important
evidence gaps, including the need for (1) increased
research on KT strategies, barriers, facilitators and out-
comes that includes a greater geographical scope, both
within and across national borders; (2) greater variety
in research approaches to KT, including more
realist-type and evaluative designs and increased em-
phasis on contextual descriptions and outcomes of KT in-
terventions; (3) exploration into the impact of donor
funding on KT and its outcomes; (4) further testing, deve-
lopment and application of theoretical frameworks that
enhance understanding of KT in African settings; (5) ex-
ploration into the impact of an integrated KT approach
that fosters engagement and collaboration between re-
searchers and policy-makers throughout (and beyond) the
research process; and (6) initiatives that build individual
and organisational capacity to generate, understand and
use research.
This evidence mapping study also confirms the useful-
ness of this type of systematised review approach for
navigation of dispersed and diverse research terrains,
where there is little consensus or definitional clarity.
Further evidence mapping activities would be useful on
more specific KT issues, and in more context-specific
settings, so that researching policy-makers and policy-in-
fluencing researchers have more readily available and
suitable evidence to better inform their practice. Under-
standing and developing learning health systems is be-
coming a major focus of the global health policy and
systems community [ 101], and localised and focused evi-
dence maps would be a useful tool towards this practice.
