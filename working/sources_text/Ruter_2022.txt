How Do the Timing and 
Duration of Courses Affect 
Participation in Adult 
Learning and Education?  
A Panel Analysis
Fabian Rüter1  and Andreas Martin1
Abstract
Participation in adult learning and education requires the availability of, and accessibility 
to, learning opportunities provided by educational institutions. One fundamental 
element is time. Adult learning and education participation can only be realized by 
successfully matching individual time-availabilities with the temporal organization of 
provided courses. To address this required matching process, this study contributes 
to research literature as one of the first studies that investigates the impact of 
timing and course duration on participation counts (longitudinally). For this, we use 
organizational data from public adult education centers (Volkshochschulen—VHS; the 
main adult education providers in Germany) from 2007 to 2017. Methodologically, 
random- and fixed-effects models are applied. We find significant positive effects 
on participation counts between increasing program breadth in terms of temporal 
formats and increasing average course duration.

Current research on participation in adult learning and education (ALE) points to com-
plex interactions between individual learners, learning opportunities and the broader 
societal and policy contexts framing both individuals and educational institutions 
(Boeren, 2017; Rubenson & Desjardins, 2009). Sociostatistical research explains ALE 
participation with individual sociodemographic, economic and cultural characteristics

(e.g., Kalenda et al., 2019). These characteristics include, for example, the individuals’ 
age, gender, family background, migration background, employment and occupational 
status, or level of educational attainment. Although such characteristics can, to some 
extent, explain societal inequalities and selectivity in ALE participation (Walter & 
Müller, 2014), literature still lacks a reflection of factors at the institutional level and 
the broader societal and policy context influencing participation (Boeren et al., 2010). 
In addition, explaining ALE participation is a central subject in international compara-
tive research on participation patterns (e.g., Støren & Børing, 2018). While academia 
is currently discussing the importance of individual characteristics and the national 
state for ALE participation, Boeren (2017) points out that there is still little evidence 
on the interactions between (potential) participants and the learning opportunities pro-
vided by educational institutions. That work follows on from an earlier call for further 
study, where Boeren et al. (2010) argued that achieving ALE participation requires a 
successful match between the demand of (potential) participants and the supply pro -
vided by educational institutions. However, the research base investigating this match-
ing process is sparse, raising questions on the contexts and conditions of successful 
matching.
A fundamental prerequisite for the matching process as characterized by Boeren 
et al. (2010) is the availability of, and accessibility to, a supply of course offerings. 
Thus, course offerings represent the necessary condition for the possibility of ALE 
participation. One structural element of this necessary condition is time, in terms of 
the temporal organization of course offerings. Whereas ALE participation requires the 
availability (and subsequently the investment) of temporal resources at the individual 
level, it fundamentally also requires the temporal availability of, and accessibility to, 
course offerings on the supply-side. Accordingly, Schmidt-Lauff (2008) argued that 
ALE participation can only be realized by successfully matching individual time-
availabilities with temporal factors on the institutional level. Thus, the temporal orga-
nization of course offerings is the deciding factor for matching supply and demand, 
and whether individuals participate. However, despite the universally accepted impor-
tance of time for ALE (e.g., Schmidt-Lauff & Bergamini, 2017), an operationalization 
of the matching process remains a research gap (Boeren, 2017).
Hence, our study addresses this research gap by operationalizing time as a struc -
tural element of the necessary condition for the possibility of ALE participation. In 
a longitudinal design, we investigate the effects of temporal factors of course offer -
ings such as timing and duration on participation counts. Thus, we focus on organi -
zational level changes in the temporal organization of course offerings, distinguishing 
temporal formats, and course durations within educational programs. For this, we 
use data from German VHS statistics that addresses public adult education centers 
(Volkshochschulen—VHS) between 2007 and 2017. Methodologically, we employ 
random- and fixed-effects models, aiming at causal inferences.
Educational Mandate of VHS in Germany
VHS are the main public providers of adult education in Germany. Their objective is 
the promotion of lifelong learning that supports active participation in society, culture, 
43Rüter and Martin
<<<PAGE=3>>>
and employment and that fosters social integration and social cohesion (DVV , 2019). 
The educational programs offered are based on courses covering topics from politics, 
culture, art, health-related, and environmental subjects to languages and basic educa -
tion. VHS define education as a public and societal good, and aim for their services to 
answer public and societal interests in education. Thus, VHS operate in a norm-ratio-
nal way (Schrader, 2011), providing universally accessible and attractive education for 
all citizens. In contrast, organizations in the open market context act in a profit-orien-
tated way providing services for economic purposes. VHS can receive mixed funding 
from the local municipality, the individual federal state, job centers, the nation state, 
the European Union and from public and private enterprises for course fees and spe -
cial contracts for inhouse courses. In 2018, VHS offered 552,000 courses with a total 
of 17.0 million teaching hours and 6.1 million participations (Reichart et al., 2019).
Conceptual Framework—ALE Participation as an 
Interaction Between Participants and Educational 
Institutions
Academia currently argues for approaching ALE participation as the result of interac-
tions between an individual decision and “a broader context that limits possible choices 
and makes participation less or more attractive, accessible and advantageous” 
(Lavrijsen & Nicaise, 2017, p. 178). To describe these interactions, Boeren et  al. 
(2010) introduced a comprehensive lifelong-learning participation model. The model 
distinguishes between a demand-side (micro-level), a supply-side (meso-level) and a 
broader social and policy context (macro-level). On the demand-side is the individual 
and their perception of learning opportunities and subsequent decision to participate. 
The individual is influenced by socioeconomic, cultural, and psychological factors, as 
well as by relevant others such as family, friends, or employer. The supply-side consti-
tutes educational institutions, characterized by organizational factors such as the edu-
cational program, accessibility or staffing. Both sides are embedded in a broader social 
context based on rules, laws, rights, and duties.
For the theorized interactions between supply and demand, the educational pro -
gram on the supply-side is the central medium of the matching process. On one hand, 
educational programs include general information and access preconditions (e.g., con-
tent, qualification, location, duration, and fees). On the other, educational programs 
operationalize concepts resulting from the demands, expectations, and needs of poten-
tial participants (Nolda, 2018). Simultaneously, serving the public with universally 
accessible course offerings requires educational institutions to react flexibly and in 
accordance with current societal developments when planning educational programs 
(Gieseke & von Hippel, 2019). Kowalski (1988) argued that a static program design 
may eventually become outdated and may then fail to attract potential participants.
Time as a Central Condition of the Matching Process
There are two research perspectives on time as a central condition of the matching 
process. A first perspective focusses on the individual level. In this perspective,

participants need to raise time as a resource and element of indirect costs (Bellmann & 
Leber, 2019). The Adult Education Survey (AES; BMBF, 2019) investigates participa-
tion rates and the time volumes invested in nonformal education in Germany for dif -
ferent periods from 2007 to 2018. Overall, the participation rate increased from 44% 
(2007) to 54% (2018). Simultaneously, the average number of educational activities 
decreased from 1.9 to 1.7 per participant and the average volume of invested time 
decreased from 85 hours to 79 hours. For 2018, this resulted in an average of 43 hours 
per person within the entire population of 18- to 64-year-olds in Germany, which is 
spent on an average of 0.9 activities. In comparison, the average time spent per person 
within the population for educational activities decreased from 42 (2012) to 36 hours 
(2016). The increase from 2016 to 2018 is assumed to be the result of increased immi-
gration to Germany in 2015/2016 (BMBF, 2019).
In addition, invested time volumes vary with the content of educational activities. 
The AES distinguishes three segments of nonformal education. Employer-sponsored 
education constituted 72% of all educational activities in 2018 (2012: 69%) but only 
covered 45% of the time volume in 2018 (2012: 51%). By comparison, the share of 
job-related non-formal education was lower (2012: 13%; 2018: 10%), but the share of 
time was significantly higher at 33% in 2018 (2012: 25%). The same applies to the 
segment of non-job-related non-formal education. The share was 18% in 2018 (2012: 
18%), but the time volume covered 21% in 2018 (2012: 24%).
Although the AES provides first insights into trends of participation rates and 
time volumes, the variable time remains an observable outcome. Underlying deci -
sion-making processes and the causal effects of individual time-availabilities on 
participation rates remain unexplained. Regarding the participation decision, schol -
ars define time as a scarce resource affecting individual decision-making processes  
Rüter et al. (2020). Schmidt-Lauff and Bergamini (2017) argue for an understanding 
of time in a societal context characterized by complexity, ambivalence, and para -
doxes. In their work, time is characterized by change, resulting in heterogeneous 
effects on ALE participation. Accordingly, time availabilities result from multilay -
ered backgrounds and vary depending on life situations, positions in the employ -
ment system, age and gender. Other factors include different life phases such as 
career entry or advancement, starting a family, or retirement (Schmidt-Lauff, 2008).
In addition to factors on the individual level, individual time-availabilities are 
related to societal and organizational levels. These levels refer to, for example, the 
level of educational governance or the employer and respectively refer to measures 
such as laws on educational leave or employer offered leave of work, which intend to 
foster and support ALE participation by providing a specific timeframe. However, 
research and causal evidence on the effects of such measures is still scarce. Most 
recently,  Rüter et al. (2020) investigated the causal effects of implementing a law on 
educational leave in Germany on individual participation in ALE. The research applied 
a difference-in-differences estimation strategy with propensity score matching and 
instrumental variable and found no positive treatment effect on individual participa -
tion behavior of eligible employees.
Due to the scarce nature of temporal resources, the opportunity costs of activity 
participation increase (Klein, 2007). This also affects ALE as the required time to 
45Rüter and Martin
<<<PAGE=5>>>
participate rivals with other time commitments in adults’ private and professional lives 
(Schmidt-Lauff & Bergamini, 2017).
In a second perspective, time provides opportunities for ALE participation at the 
institutional level (Kuper, 2001). These opportunities are represented within educa -
tional programs, which define the temporal conditions of course access by sequencing 
teaching–learning interactions. The temporal structure of educational programs con -
stitutes different temporal formats (e.g., courses held once or several times a week) 
and course durations. With regard to structural components of educational institutions, 
a study by Schuetze and Slowey (2002) identified specific factors that influence par -
ticipation in higher education. The results highlight that flexible access to the curricu-
lum attracts adult learners and might influence individual participation decisions. This 
flexibility can be achieved by introducing and/or expanding methods of instruction, 
learning independent of place, or time, or other restrictions, by alternative modes of 
study or by financial support.
Employing qualitative interviews and analyzing educational programs, the study by 
Nahrstedt et al. (1998) focused on changes on the supply-side of VHS courses from 
1995 to 1997. The results revealed that educational programs were increasingly ori -
ented toward the time availability of potential participants and that the temporal struc-
tures within educational programs were becoming more diverse and complex. Compact 
formats on weekends, or courses with many short lessons spread over a long duration 
have gained increasing relevance (Brinkmann, 2000).
In addition, scholars investigated ALE participation differentiated by course con -
tent, timing, and duration. Although the AES does not directly include information on 
the educational institution framing ALE participation itself, the results provide infor -
mation regarding trends of temporal formats and course durations in nonformal educa-
tion from 2007 to 2018 (BMBF, 2017, 2019). Noteworthy is the increasing relevance 
of activities lasting several hours from 17% to 29%. At the same time, the share of 
activities lasting several days (2007: 34% and 2018: 27%) and several months (2007: 
15% and 2018: 12%) decreased. Single-day activities and formats covering several 
weeks vary in their relevance but are relatively constant at 21% (1-day) and 7% (sev-
eral weeks). Referring to Käpplinger (2018), there is a general trend toward shorter 
temporal formats in adult education.
Empirical findings of recent studies, meanwhile, both confirm and contradict this 
trend. Denninger et  al. (2020) argue that participants prioritize shorter courses over 
time-intensive courses because their private and professional lives are less affected. 
Furthermore, increasing learning times are assumed to cause increasing time rivalries 
between the educational activity and time spent at work, with family or on recreation 
(Lobe, 2015). In this context, the study by Richter et al. (2020) investigated the effects 
of the timing and duration on participation rates in continuing vocational education 
and training for teachers in the German federal state of Brandenburg. The study exam-
ined courses with a duration of 1 day (one-shot courses) or several days. The results 
revealed that the duration significantly predicts participation rates. Furthermore, 
teachers less frequently attended one-shot courses that were shorter than 2 hours or 
longer than 8 hours. However, participation rates increased as course duration 
increased within the 2 to 8 hours sweet-spot. Opposing the hypothesis that teachers 
might prioritize shorter courses because they are easier to match with high working 
46 Adult Education Quarterly 72(1)
<<<PAGE=6>>>
hours, the results also indicate that there is a higher demand for courses lasting several 
days. One possible explanation formulated by Richter et  al. (2020) refers to expec -
tancy-value theory (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000), arguing that teachers expect no returns 
from participating in one-shot courses.
Those findings indicate that, in addition to the matching logic of increasing the 
likelihood of a successful match by decreasing the course duration, there is another 
mechanism to consider and to control in our study. Generally, expectancy-value 
approaches predict individual motivation and behavior based on high expectations, a 
high-perceived value and low costs (Gorges, 2016). This rationale includes (temporal) 
resources that need to be invested in order to participate and the expected returns from 
ALE. In this perspective, course offerings with high opportunity costs and low 
expected monetary or non-monetary returns are only likely to enable ALE participa -
tion when the course duration is short. This primarily relates to the segment of non-
job-related nonformal education . In comparison, courses in job-related nonformal 
education that last longer are associated with higher costs, but also with higher 
expected returns.
However, the key condition for such rational decisions on ALE participation is the 
availability of, and accessibility to, learning opportunities. This remains a research gap 
because the existence of learning opportunities as the necessary conditions for the pos-
sibility of ALE participation is considered a given fact in present action-theoretical 
approaches. Ahl (2006) argued that theories that put their main emphasis on individu-
als “risk to blame individuals for not participating” (Boeren et  al., 2010, p. 56). This 
issue is followed up in our study by operationalizing the matching process on the 
supply-side and by investigating how the temporal organization of courses affects par-
ticipation counts longitudinally.
The Present Research
Although contemporary academia argues for a fundamental relationship between tem-
poral factors on the supply-side and the likelihood of participation, empirical and lon-
gitudinal studies aiming at causal inferences are still rare. Due to the scarce knowledge 
available, it is not possible to formulate generally valid conclusions on the impact of 
timing and duration on ALE participation. Hence, we argue that the scope of the dis -
cussion needs to be broadened by evidence-based and longitudinal research.
In our study, we hypothesize two central mechanisms of time on the matching pro-
cess and participation counts that need to be estimated. The first mechanism is related 
to the assumption that a wider and more flexible range of course offerings is an effec-
tive and efficient strategy to enable and widen ALE participation by overcoming 
institutional barriers (Cross, 1992). The more broadly educational programs are struc-
tured in terms of different temporal formats, the more likely it is that these temporal 
conditions of accessing any course will match with the time availabilities of potential 
participants. Based on this assumption, our first hypothesis is as follows:
47Rüter and Martin
<<<PAGE=7>>>
Hypothesis 1:  Participation counts increase with increasing program breadth in 
terms of temporal formats.
The second mechanism regards the course duration. We hypothesize that shorter 
course durations are easier to match to individual time-availabilities. Thus, shorter 
courses increase the likelihood of successful matching. Based on this assumption, our 
second hypothesis is as follows:
Hypothesis 2: Participation counts increase with decreasing course duration.
Data Description
To investigate our hypotheses, we use longitudinal data from the German VHS statis-
tics (Reichart et al., 2019). This annual survey initiated in 1962 by the German Institute 
for Adult Education—Leibniz-Centre for Lifelong Learning provides a near full sam -
ple of VHS in Germany. We selected data from the survey years 2007 to 2017. In 2007, 
958 VHS participated in the survey and, in 2017, 883 VHS. Throughout the whole 
observation period, 864 VHS consistently took part. The set of variables provides 
information on staff, financial means and expenditures, course counts, participation 
counts, cooperation with other institutions and activities such as study tours or exhibi-
tions. While the entire observation period covers 11 years, the inclusion of lagged 
variables in our models shrinks our factual observation period to 10 years from 2008 
to 2017 (for details: see analytical strategy).
Based on our hypotheses, the variables of interest include course counts, participa-
tion counts as well as temporal formats and course durations. The VHS statistics 
include the required information recorded in 86 subject areas, nested in six program 
areas for each VHS and year (Figure 1).
Figure 1. VHS (Volkshochschulen) statistics—Data structure.
48 Adult Education Quarterly 72(1)
<<<PAGE=8>>>
However, the VHS statistics only distinguish temporal formats at the program-area-
level: (1) once a week evening course; (2) once a week day course; (3) several times a 
week evening course; (4) several times a week day course; (5) day course; (6) week -
end course; (7) week-long course. Therefore, we investigated Hypothesis 1 at the 
VHS-level.
In 2018, 89% of all course offerings could be assigned to one temporal format 
(Reichart et  al., 2019). Due to a different statistical reporting strategy by VHS in 
the federal state of Bavaria, no information on temporal formats there is included. 
In addition, the VHS statistics include information regarding the time volume of 
course offerings in hours at the subject-area-level. Therefore, we investigated 
Hypothesis 2 on the subject-area-level. This process allowed us to control for the 
course content and to control for assumed heterogeneous effects of the course 
duration on participation counts. However, we could not identify individual course 
durations. Instead, we could only calculate the average course duration based on 
the reported course counts and the total time volume of course offerings for each 
subject area. Furthermore, we used regional context data from the German Federal 
Statistical Office and the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs, 
and Spatial Development. The first source supplied us with data regarding the 
population on the municipality-level and the latter with data regarding the settle -
ment types of municipalities. Since the regional context data from one municipal -
ity was sadly not consistently available between 2007 and 2011, we excluded the 
corresponding VHS from our models for this period.
Samples
Although the VHS statistics allow the creation of a balanced panel of VHS participat-
ing for the whole observation period, the variables of interest are not equally consis -
tent. For some variables, there are several runs of consecutive observations separated 
by gaps in the panel data. These gaps cause missing observations within each VHS 
(Hypothesis 1) and within each subject area (Hypothesis 2) that may bias the results of 
our analysis. In the following, we describe the process of creating our analytical 
samples.
Relevant for Hypothesis 1 is that, although the VHS statistics include the total 
number of course offerings for every VHS and year and distinguish course counts 
for the seven temporal formats, for some observations, the total number of course 
offerings of a VHS and the number of course offerings that could be assigned to 
temporal formats are mismatched. This mismatch results from either item-nonre -
sponse or temporal formats not covered by the VHS statistics (e.g., courses at 
nonregular intervals such as courses held every 2 weeks). To cope with this mis -
match, we created two VHS subsamples. The idea of the wide sample  is to include 
a new variable labeled “other temporal format” (course counts that could not be 
49Rüter and Martin
<<<PAGE=9>>>
assigned to one of the seven temporal formats). The  wide sample  includes VHS 
with the latest sequence of at least three consecutive observations, summing up n = 
727 VHS and N = 6,803 observations in the factual observation period. In contrast, 
the restrictive sample  includes observations with complete and consistent informa -
tion, with the latest sequence of at least three consecutive observations per VHS. 
Here, we excluded course counts that could not be assigned to a temporal format 
from the analysis. The restrictive sample  sums up n = 694 VHS and N = 5,571 
observations in the factual observation period.
Regarding Hypothesis 2, participation counts and average course durations at 
the subject-area level shape the basis of our analysis. However, there are gaps 
separating runs of consecutive observations of subject areas where no courses took 
place. These gaps could impede our analysis because of an observed average 
course duration of zero hours for a given year. Therefore, we created a sample that 
included observations within the latest sequence of at least three consecutive 
observations of course offerings per subject area with actual course counts. The 
sample sums up n = 33,639 unique subject areas and N = 242,805 observations in 
the factual observation period.
Variables
Our hypotheses target potential effects of the timing and duration of course offerings 
on participation counts. Accordingly, participation counts form our dependent variable 
at the VHS-level (Hypothesis 1) and the subject-area-level (Hypothesis 2). Within cur-
rent ALE participation research, participation counts are suitable performance indica-
tors (Widany et al., 2020). The main independent variables are the program breadth 
described by temporal formats at the VHS-level (Hypothesis 1) and average course 
durations at the subject-area-level (Hypothesis 2). To control for the most important 
factors that confound both outcome and predictors, we included further variables. At 
the VHS-level, we included the number of course offerings on the program-area-level 
for every VHS and year, percentages of full-time management, human resources, 
courses in cooperation with other institutions and the form of legal entity the VHS in 
question is designated as. To control potential influences of municipality-specific fac-
tors, we matched a variable covering the municipality population for every VHS and 
year, as well as a variable covering the settlement type of the municipality to our data-
set. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of all model-specific variables from 2007 
to 2017. Regarding Hypothesis 1, we only report descriptive statistics for the wide 
sample because it best describes the distribution of characteristics in the population 
and because the restrictive sample is a subsample of the wide sample. In addition, we 
created an online appendix on OSF (https://osf.io/by9wc/?view_only=4fec6d89cce94
9cda5300bd3343beebe) covering descriptive statistics for both samples.

Analytical Strategy
Measurement of Program Breadth—Lorenz-Coefficient
To measure the program breadth regarding temporal formats, we use the Lorenz-
coefficient (Hartung et  al., 2009). We estimated the Lorenz-coefficient for every 
VHS and year for both the wide and restrictive sample . The Lorenz-coefficient is 
standardized to values between 0 and 1, with 0 describing an equal distribution of 
courses across all temporal formats within an educational program and 1 describing 
a complete concentration of courses on a single temporal format. It is worth men -
tioning that once-a-week evening courses and day courses represent the majority 
(65.1%) of all courses (Reichart et  al., 2019). Figure 2 displays the development of 
the Lorenz-coefficient.
The results reveal a general trend toward an increasing program breadth of tempo-
ral formats on the supply-side of VHS. How this affects participation counts is exam-
ined with regard to Hypothesis 1.

Measurement of Average Course Duration
We calculated the average course durations of every subject area and year. We excluded 
the subject area entitled German as a foreign language because the demand for inte -
gration courses develops along continuing migration movements and is not affected by 
the supply-structure provided by VHS. Figure 3 displays the trajectories of the average 
course duration within six program areas. For ease of viewing, we present descriptive 
results on the program-area-level instead of results for all 85 subject areas.
Figure 3. Average course duration within program areas.
The plotted trends support the observation by Käpplinger (2018) of a general trend 
toward shorter temporal formats. The average course duration decreased among all 
program areas. How this affects participation counts is examined with regard to 
Hypothesis 2.
Estimation Strategy
To target our hypotheses, we apply statistical methods that account for high heteroge-
neity of VHS and control unobservable variables. We employ RE-models as the

conventional model and starting point in our panel analysis. However, unobserved 
time-invariant variables can confound the estimation. Therefore, RE-estimations are 
likely to be biased by the time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity of VHS. To address 
this issue, we further employ FE-models that provide estimates that are unbiased by 
between effects and that focus on a within comparison.
Regarding Hypothesis 1, we specify the RE-model as follows:

Here, yit  denotes the dependent variable describing participation counts within 
VHS i  at time t. Then, β1  is the constant including an error term ζ1  for the intercept. 
x it2  denotes the value of the main independent variable, the Lorenz-coefficient. x it3  
to x it12  are the values of course counts on the program-area-level, years of the obser -
vation period to control for possible periodic effects, course counts in cooperation 
with other institutions, the legal entity and the settlement structure. We included the 
number of course offerings on the program-area-level by VHS and year () □xxit it38 −  to 
control that the program breadth does not simply increase due to increasing course 
counts on the program-area-level, which vice versa would also cause increasing par -
ticipation counts. Including course counts on the program-area-level also allows us to 
control for possible heterogeneous effects when testing Hypothesis 1. x it13 1−  to x it15 1−  
are control variables covering the percentages of full-time management, human 
resources available and the municipality’s population size. The implementation of 
time gaps of 1 year t −() 1  is based on the assumption that effects due to changing 
control variable values are first observed the following year. For example, more 
human resources allow VHS to offer different courses and to introduce a greater flex-
ibility regarding temporal formats. However, changes within the educational program 
will become effective in the following year when the program is implemented. εit  is 
the error term.

Results
Regarding Hypothesis 1, we tested whether a wider access to educational programs 
(in terms of temporal formats) is an effective and efficient strategy to increase par -
ticipation counts. We estimated the effect of program breadth on participation counts 
by employing random and fixed estimations based on both the wide and restrictive 
sample. The Hausman test shows that the FE-model is preferable to the RE-model 
(wide sample : χ² = 368.85; degrees of freedom [ df] = 19; p < .001; restrictive 
sample : χ² = 211.21; df = 19, p < .001). Therefore, we only report the results of the 
FE-model.

The results displayed in Table 2 reveal that a change of the Lorenz-coefficient from 
zero to one significantly decreases participation counts by respectively 417.893 par -
ticipants (p < .01; wide sample) or 427.694 participants (p < .001; restrictive sample).

Regarding Hypothesis 2, we tested whether participation counts on the subject-area-

Therefore, we only report the results of the FE-model.
The results displayed in Table 3 reveal that an increase of 1 hour in the average 
course duration significantly increases participation counts on the subject-area-level 
by 0.062 (Model 1) or 0.445 (Model 2). Contrary to the hypothesis that participants 
prioritize shorter course offerings because they are easier to match with rival individ-
ual time-availabilities, the results reveal that the opposite holds true. Based on the 
results, we cannot support Hypothesis 2.
Discussion
Understanding the system of ALE as a multilevel system (e.g., Boeren et  al., 2010; 
Schrader, 2011) challenges scholars to integrate multi-layered perspectives into new 
research designs. Scholars have argued that a lack of integration prevents research 
“from generating full insight in the complexity of lifelong learning participation” 
(Boeren, 2017, p. 162). In our study, we develop the idea of layered thinking in ALE 
participation research by operationalizing time as a structural element of the necessary 
condition for the possibility of ALE participation and the required successful match 
between demand and institutionalized supply.
Our analyses provide two main conclusions. First, we found a significant effect of 
increasing program breadth at the VHS-level on participation counts. However, the 
effect size is rather small since a decrease of the Lorenz-coefficient from 1 (complete 
concentration of all course offerings on one temporal format) to 0 (equal distribution 
of course offerings across all temporal formats) increases participation counts at the 
VHS-level by 417.893 ( wide sample) or 427.694 (r estrictive sample) participants. In 
comparison, VHS within our observation period served an average of 6,910 partici -
pants per year. The results reveal, however, that VHS have not only widened educa -
tional programs in terms of temporal formats but that this increasing flexibility 
significantly increased participation counts. Although we use data from the German 
VHS statistics in our study, the results are not only valid on a national level in Germany. 
Based on the universal logic of a required successful match between supply and 
demand to achieve ALE participation, the estimation results of Hypothesis 1 provide 
generic knowledge on the matching process as theorized by Boeren et al. (2010).
Second, we found a significant association between increasing average course 
duration at the subject-area-level and participation counts. In fact, the effect size is 
rather small since participation counts only increased by 0.062 (Model 1) when the 
average course duration increases by 1 hour. However, the results in Model 2 reveal 
heterogeneous effects on participation counts by introducing the interaction of pro -
gram area and average course duration to the estimation. Here, participation counts 
increase by 0.445 when the average course duration increases by 1 hour.
Including an interaction allowed us to estimate specific effects on the program-area-
level. The results reveal significant negative interaction effects of the program areas 
Health (3), Work-V ocation (5) and Basic Education (6) on participation counts. 
59Rüter and Martin
<<<PAGE=19>>>
Varying the average course duration in these program areas has no effect on respective 
participation counts. One possible explanation for these results is that the program 
areas for which we found a significant negative interaction effect primarily include 
course offerings with the option to get a certificate or a degree. In these cases, the dura-
tion to complete a course and to get a certificate or degree is often standardized. Thus, 
the individual participation decision is not affected by the duration but rather by the 
fact that a certain certificate or degree can be achieved. Thus, the variation of the effect 
of the average course duration on participation counts between program areas can be 
explained by the variation in acquiring certificates or degrees.
The results further reveal that program planners can increase participation counts in 
program areas Society-Politics-Environment (1) and 2 Culture-Design (2) by increas-
ing the average course duration. However, only the interaction effect of program area 
1 is significant.
The first descriptive analysis (Figure 3) highlighted a trend toward shorter dura -
tions in every program area. However, the multivariate analyses revealed that shorter 
course durations do not have a positive effect on participation counts. For the pro -
gram areas Society-Politics-Environment (1) and Culture-Design (2), the opposite 
holds true and participation counts increase with increasing course duration. In those 
cases, the individual participation decision may be more affected by the course, its 
content or duration than by the fact that a certain certificate or degree can be achieved. 
Schmidt-Lauff and Bergamini (2017) argued that such learning time “is then subjec -
tively perceived as a special time quality, a time oasis and ‘time well-being’” 
(Schmidt-Lauff & Bergamini, 2017, p. 157). The results of Hypothesis 2 reveal het -
erogeneous effects on participation counts when including an interaction of program 
area and average course duration to the estimation. This finding raises a need for 
further research into whether this heterogeneity is replicable internationally and in 
other educational institutions in other reproduction contexts.
We based our study on the assumption that ALE participation requires the avail -
ability of, and accessibility, to learning opportunities on the institutional level as a 
necessary condition for the possibility of participation as well as a successful match of 
institutionalized supply with individual demand. The results of our study reveal that 
program planners can significantly influence the matching process by introducing a 
greater program breadth in terms of temporal formats of course offerings. Introducing 
those changes means that opportunities for successful matching and participation 
counts significantly increase.
Limitations and Conclusion
Although ours is one of the first studies that investigates the impact of timing and 
duration on ALE participation longitudinally, it has certain limitations.
First, the VHS statistics only include course counts of realized courses. Therefore, 
it is possible that various VHS initially offered courses that in the end did not take 
place due to a lack of demand. Courses that did not take place could change the 
observed temporal structure of educational programs or average course durations and 
60 Adult Education Quarterly 72(1)
<<<PAGE=20>>>
could therefore change the analyses and estimation results. Based on the VHS statis -
tics, we can only observe courses offerings that actually took place. Thus, we cannot 
estimate any effects for the entire educational program including those courses offer -
ings that were cancelled due to lacking demand. Nevertheless, the VHS statistics is the 
best available proxy for the actual educational program of VHS.
Second, our analyses are based on organizational data that identifies participation 
counts but not individual participants. Therefore, we are not able to investigate cross-
level interaction effects of timing and duration on the underlying decision-making pro-
cesses of individual participation behavior. Vice versa, we cannot formulate statements 
as to how individual demand affects the temporal organization of course offerings on 
the supply-side. Consequently, we are not able to operationalize the whole matching 
process and interactions between supply and demand as theorized by Boeren et  al. 
(2010). Such an operationalization requires an action-theoretical explanation of indi -
vidual participation decisions and data linkages of meso-data and micro-data. In 
Germany, this issue could be addressed in future research by linking meso-data from 
the VHS statistics with micro-data from the “Mikrozensus.” A dataset including longi-
tudinal data of participants nested in educational institutions is currently not available.
However, our study takes a first step toward exploring interactions between demand 
and supply. The findings highlight the significant effects of both timing and duration 
on participation counts. However, more research efforts are needed to explore such 
effects in terms of the theorized interactions between supply and demand. These 
efforts should also include investigating the rationale of program planners. First, it 
would be of particular interest to compare the effects of timing and duration on partici-
pation counts within the context of VHS to other reproduction contexts (e.g., organiza-
tions in the market context, Schrader, 2011). Second, we assume that the planning staff 
focuses on the availabilities of temporal resources of potential participants within dif-
ferent individual and societal circumstances while planning educational programs. In 
this regard, Schmidt-Lauff (2008) pointed out that research on the professional action 
of program planning regarding timing and duration is largely lacking. However, cur -
rent research addresses this call for further research. The study by Robak et al. (2015) 
analyzed temporal aspects of program planning when researching the revision of a law 
on educational leave in the German federal state of Bremen in 2010.
