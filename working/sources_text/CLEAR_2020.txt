CLEAR-AA
Introduction 
The practice of national and organisational capac-
ity-strengthening for monitoring and evalua-
tion (M&E) is gaining momentum in the Global 
South. However, little is known about the design, 
effectiveness, and impact of these M&E capac-
ity-strengthening initiatives. Adequate M&E 
capacity assists government officials, develop -
ment  managers, civil society organisations, and 
funding entities to improve project planning, facil-
itates progress, increases impact, and enhances 
learning (Segone, 2009). In addition, M&E capacity 
can identify what works, what does not work, and 
the reasons for each outcome. This report pro -
vides an overview of National Evaluation Capacity 
Development (NECD) across selected Anglophone 
African countries and provides recommendations 
on how to strengthen national evaluation capac-
ities. The report is based on a study undertaken 
by the Centre for Learning on Evaluation and 
Results for Anglophone Africa (CLEAR-AA) which 
examined M&E systems capacity-strengthening 
approaches in Anglophone African countries and 
how the effectiveness of these approaches has 
been measured. 
Methods 
The study adopted a mixed-method approach 
which enabled the researchers to use multiple 
sources of information from multiple approaches 
to gain new insights into how the capacity 
strengthening of M&E systems is evolving in the 
African context. The mixed-methods approach 
comprised a cross-sectional survey and a qual-
itative in-depth enquiry. The respondents were 
drawn from government departments or minis-
tries, non-governmental organisations, not-for-
profit organisations (both local and international), 
public training institutions, parliamentary staff, 
and Voluntary Organizations for Professional Eval-
uation (VOPEs). Quantitative and qualitative data 
were analysed separately and were integrated 
during analysis.
Findings
In the African countries selected for the study, 
M&E capacity-strengthening initiatives are pro -
vided both internally and externally and the ini-
tiatives range from training and technical assis-
tance to coaching and mentoring. International 
organisations with an interest in NECD have been 
the major funders of initiatives in the region and 
have invested substantial sums of money. This 
study concludes that although the literature on 
the measurement of M&E capacity-strengthening 
initiatives is still nascent, state and non-state insti-
tutions providing capacity strengthening fail to 
adequately measure the efficiency, impact, effec-
tiveness, relevance, sustainability, and worthiness 
of the approaches. In cases where measurement 
has been done, knowledge management sys-
tems do not capture the measurement informa-
tion effectively. This is tantamount to missing 
opportunities for reflection on the worthiness of 
capacity-strengthening approaches and the loss 
of potential lessons that could have been learnt 
during the process of implementation. 
Key findings 
Firstly, it was found that the capacity needs assess-
ments and capacity-strengthening plans are 
lacking in all eight countries. The implication is that 
capacity-strengthening initiatives are haphazard, 
unsystematic, ad hoc, inadequate, and ineffec-
tive. The failure to define country capacity needs 
has led to the narrow perception that capacity is 
limited to the micro level, revealing a distinct lack 
of understanding of the inherent interconnected-
ness of all levels of capacity. 
The second issue identified is that capacity 
strengthening is frequently divorced from the 
prevailing contextual factors (culture, socio-eco -
nomic, political and governance systems), with 
the approach to strengthening capacity being 
that of a generic one-size-fits-all solution which 
fails to acknowledge that M&E capacity determi-
nants such as culture, the value of M&E, and the 
general environment of M&E practice, are endog-
enous and context-specific. The implication is 
that there is a mismatch between the supply and 
demand aspects of capacity.

Thirdly, study findings show that current M&E 
capacity-strengthening initiatives do not empha-
sise the key elements which are crucial for the 
holistic development of M&E systems. Capacity 
strengthening at a macro level (country level) 
should create an enabling environment which 
facilitates and values the practice of M&E. This 
can be achieved by assisting countries to develop 
coherent policies, culture, structures, and strat -
egies and by inducing behaviour change – all of 
which will add value at both micro and macro 
levels of capacity. In state institutions the creation 
of an enabling environment is an immense task 
which is exacerbated by a lack of human capacity, 
inadequate resources, an absence of policies and 
frameworks, and a weaker demand for M&E com-
pared to the non-state sector. This has a direct 
implication on state programmes’ effectiveness 
and accountability and impedes the development 
of a culture of evaluation. 
Fourthly, the findings of this study show that there 
is a general shortage of resources (material, human 
and financial) across all levels (individual, insti-
tutional, and state level) for the development of 
M&E capacities. At the state level, there is a heavy 
dependence on non-state capacity-strengthening 
funders and this compromises the sustainability 
of such approaches. In several countries, funders 
dictate the capacity-strengthening goals and 
approaches to be adopted thereby depriving state 
entities of the opportunity to utilise the resources 
where they are needed most. Non-state sector 
institutions receiving funding from international 
organisations have guaranteed funding for M&E 
system capacity strengthening and setting up 
of M&E systems with the objective of improving 
accountability and performance monitoring. 
However, these funds do not extend to measure -
ment activities to assess the efficiency, effective -
ness, and impact of these capacity-strengthening 
approaches. At individual level, resources are 
scarce for academic and professional training for 
individuals who are not attached to institutions. 
Fifthly, the study shows that across all the eight 
countries, the measurement of M&E capaci-
ty-strengthening activities is amorphous and 
vague. Measurement only exists at the input, 
process, and output stages of the micro-level 
spectrum. Absence of monitoring tools for capac-
ity-strengthening activities implies that the effi-
ciency and effectiveness of capacity-strength-
ening activities are unknown hence implementers 
are deprived of the opportunity to reflect on what 
is working, not working, for whom and under 
what circumstances. Also, the absence of evalua-
tions means that the relationship between capac-
ity-strengthening interventions and M&E capacity 
outcomes is not defined.
Recommendations 
The study makes four recommendations, namely: 
(1) Know your capacity needs and be systematic 
– countries and organisations providing funding 
for capacity strengthening must prioritise coun-
try-level M&E capacity needs assessments and 
formulate country capacity development plans 
according to the identified needs. The plans should 
include specific measurement indicators to mea-
sure achievement levels. (2) Strengthen capacity 
at all levels – individual, institutional, and country. 
(3) Be fully cognisant of the context, applicability, 
and demand for M&E capacity-strengthening 
approaches. To ensure maximum impact and sus-
tainability, situations with the most pressing needs 
and greatest potential for effective outcomes 
should be prioritised and not simply be provided 
with a ‘tick-the-box’ or ‘one-size-fit-all’ approach to 
capacity-building; (4) Create the necessary syner -
gies and networks between state and non-state 
sectors as these synergies dispel the silo mindset 
frequently adopted for M&E capacity-strength-
ening and create opportunities for mutual benefit 
by learning, sharing experiences, and identifying 
what works best in a particular country. Most 
importantly, it is emphasised that these recom-
mendations will be ineffective in meeting the 
overall objective of ensuring measurement of 
M&E capacity-strengthening approaches if equal 
attention is not paid to the enabling environment, 
for example, allocation of resources, not only for 
capacitation but also for measurement.

1.1 Introduction and Background 
to the study
The Centre for Learning on Evaluation and Results 
for Anglophone Africa (CLEAR-AA) is a centre 
within the faculty of Commerce, Law and Man-
agement at the University of Witwatersrand (Wits 
University), located in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
CLEAR-AA is one of six regional centres housed 
in academic institutions across the globe which 
support the development of monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) capacity. The other CLEAR cen-
tres are in Senegal, Mexico, India, China and Brazil, 
and are supported by the CLEAR Global Initiative 
in Washington, D.C. CLEAR-AA aims to improve 
the practice of M&E and to assist in strength-
ening the ability of countries and organisations 
to plan, report on what is being achieved, and to 
assess results. CLEAR-AA works with various stake-
holders such as policymakers, parliamentarians, 
academics, M&E networks, practitioners, and civil 
society organisations.
Strengthening the capacities of countries and 
organisations to perform M&E functions is gaining 
momentum in the Global South. However, little 
is known about the design, effectiveness and 
impact of these M&E capacity strengthening ini-
tiatives. M&E capacity assists government officials, 
development  managers, civil society organisa-
tions, and funding entities to improve the plan-
ning of their projects, facilitates progress, increases 
impact, and enhances learning (Segone, 2009). In 
addition, M&E capacity can identify what works, 
what does not work, and the reasons for each 
outcome. In Africa there is a dearth of literature 
on M&E system capacity development/building, 
leaving the impacts of such initiatives undocu-
mented and unclear. Given the gaps in the current 
literature on the topic, this study seeks to inform 
CLEAR-AA’s M&E capacity-strengthening initia-
tives across Anglophone Africa. An M&E system 
in this study is defined as a coordinated and har -
monised monitoring and evaluation system that 
provides timely and accurate strategic informa-
tion to guide planning and decision making at 
national level (Shepherd, 2011). This study focuses 
on M&E systems which seek to inform a process 
of learning and change to promote real develop -
mental impact. This suggests an approach where 
monitoring enables adaptive management, evalu-
ative processes, and rigorous evaluation. 
1.2 Study objectives 
The objective of this study is to examine the status 
of capacity-strengthening initiatives of selected 
M&E systems in Anglophone Africa in terms of 
how the systems have been implemented and 
how their effectiveness has been measured. 
The study seeks to gain greater insights into the 
impact of M&E capacity strengthening in Anglo -
phone Africa by investigating the experiences 
of Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, 
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. This selection is 
based on CLEAR-AA having previously worked 
with M&E stakeholders in these countries and is in 
the process of developing stronger partnerships 
for strengthening country-driven M&E systems. 
The underlying assumption is that if CLEAR-AA 
is better able to understand the ecosystem of 
M&E capacity-strengthening interventions at the 
country level, it will be a more effective convener 
of suitable partners, be they VOPEs, INOs, univer -
sities or thought leaders, to collaborate and, with 
the appropriate set of interventions, to strengthen 
national M&E systems.
This study seeks to answer the following research 
question: What approaches to M&E system 
capacity strengthening have been used in selected 
Anglophone African countries and how has their 
effectiveness been measured? The following 
sub-research questions will be explored:
1. What is the current status of M&E system 
capacity strengthening in selected countries 
in Anglophone Africa?
2. What do both research and practice suggest 
is ‘good’ practice in M&E CS at individual/
organisational/system level?
3. What are the gaps in M&E capacity 
strengthening in selected countries in 
Anglophone Africa?
4. What approaches, mechanisms and measures 
are being used by various institutions 
to measure the impact of this capacity 
strengthening (for example to influence 
policies, programmes, management systems) 
as well as the combination and quality of the 
interventions themselves?

1.3 Defining M&E capacity 
strengthening
The literature alludes to various stakeholders 
(both state and non-state entities) which are 
implementing interventions targeting both the 
development and the building of M&E capacity 
of individuals, the state and non-state institutions. 
This M&E capacity is also referred to as National 
Evaluation Capacity Development (NECD). The 
interventions which are being implemented in 
the African context are, to a lesser extent, aimed 
at building M&E capacity. A more widespread 
approach of interventions is targeted at devel-
oping M&E capacity. M&E capacity building
1 refers 
to the building of new M&E systems, according 
to a prescribed design whilst capacity develop -
ment refers to building on existing M&E skills and 
knowledge, driving a dynamic and flexible pro -
cess of change, borne by local actors (European 
Parliament, 2017). This study takes cognisance of 
the academic debate and contention regarding 
the definitions of the two terms. In this study, the 
terms M&E capacity building and capacity devel-
opment are collectively referred to as capacity 
strengthening (CS) which is defined as the process 
through which individuals, institutions and coun-
tries develop, enhance and organise their M&E 
systems to effectively monitor the performance 
and evaluate development interventions at both 
state and institutional (non-state/state) levels. In 
this study, M&E capacity is viewed as consisting 
of three interconnected levels – the individual, 
institutional and country levels (system level). The 
individual and institutional capacities are regarded 
as the ‘micro’ level whilst the country capacity is 
regarded as the ‘macro’ level. At the individual level, 
M&E capacity refers to the ability of individuals to 
perform M&E duties and functions according to 
their individual skills and abilities (Babu, 2018). At 
an institutional level, capacity requires an enabling 
environment with the necessary structures, pro -
cesses, resources, management, and governance 
frameworks to support the development of an 
M&E system (Struyk, Damon and Haddaway, 
2011). At the country level, coherent policies and 
strategies in state and non-state entities create an

adapted from Preskill and Boyle’s (2008) definitions of evaluative

emphasise evaluation capacity. 
enabling environment for the development and 
use of M&E system products (Nuyens, 2005). It 
should be noted at the outset that this study does 
not focus on the strengthening of national evalu-
ation systems (NES) which routinely include eval-
uations as a regular component in the life cycle 
of public policies and programmes. This study 
focuses on performance monitoring and evalua-
tion.
Capacity strengthening of M&E systems applies 
a strengths-based approach and builds on capa-
bilities i.e. the ability to apply enhanced values, 
attitudes, knowledge, and skills (Mackay, 2007). 
Capacity refers to the ability to effectively, effi-
ciently, and sustainably perform functions, solve 
problems, and set and achieve M&E objectives at 
individual, institutional, and system levels (UNDP , 
2009). As the definition above infers, the term 
capacity relates somewhat differently at individual 
and institutional levels depending on the organisa-
tional objectives (Tall, 2009). This includes product 
aspects (e.g. establishing M&E frameworks) and 
process dimensions (e.g. building the capability 
to analyse problems, and to plan and develop 
M&E frameworks) (Görgens and Kusek, 2010). 
Critical to M&E capacity strengthening is the rec-
ognition that capacity involves three interdepen-
dent levels – individual, institutional and system 
level (enabling environment) (Lennie and Tacchi, 
2014). At the individual level, there is a need to 
strengthen knowledge, technical skills, and indi-
vidual experience. At an institutional level, there is 
a need to improve internal policies, M&E arrange -
ments, procedures, and resources. An enabling 
environment which includes the appropriate poli-
cies, legislation, power relations and social norms, 
is a prerequisite for strengthening M&E capacity at 
individual, institutional and system level (Segone, 
2009). 
M&E CS is a long-term change process aimed at 
strengthening capacity in related management 
systems and the development of national or sec-
toral performance monitoring and evaluation 
systems. It also  enables the achievement of more 
effective policies and programmes and helps to 
achieve optimal public and private sector perfor -
mance (Shepherd, 2011). Other important aspects 
of M&E CS involve the design and implementation 
of teaching and learning strategies to inform indi-
viduals, groups, and organisations on what consti-

tutes effective, useful, and professional M&E prac-
tice (Morkel and Ramasobama, 2017). It reflects 
an intention to improve participants’ knowledge 
and skills and to promote a more positive attitude 
to evaluation (Preskill and Boyle, 2008). Sustain-
able M&E practice also requires the development 
of systems, processes, policies, and plans that 
embed M&E practices in the procedures used by 
organisations and governments to accomplish 
their missions and strategic goals. The ultimate 
benefit is that information and evidence from an 
M&E system enables sound and informed deci-
sion-making.
1.4 Role of M&E in achieving 
development outcomes 
M&E systems play a significant role in devel-
opment initiatives as they generate relevant, 
accurate, and timely information that is used to 
improve programme design and decision-making 
thereby enhancing the impact of development 
interventions (Elkins, 2006). At state level in 
democracies, citizens are party to a contractual 
agreement with the state. The citizens pay taxes 
thereby acknowledging the legitimacy of the state 
and showing their allegiance while the respon-
sibility of the state is to secure development for 
its citizens. The continued legitimacy of the state 
depends on whether it fulfils its expected duties 
and obligations. In effect, citizens are constantly 
monitoring and evaluating government perfor -
mance (through demands for improved service 
delivery, support for political parties, government, 
and the media) albeit without formal, established 
structures to do so (Kimaro and Fourie, 2017a). 
These informal assessments of government per -
formance have proved successful in prompting a 
change of course for governments, especially in 
cases of unpopular actions or policies (Branch and 
Mampilly, 2015). Formal M&E systems act as a tool 
for citizens to monitor the state’s development 
interventions and evaluate the outcomes (Franco 
and Shankland, 2018). In the African context, 
the demand for M&E systems is growing, ema-
nating from a desire to align institutions with evi-
dence-based decision-making processes hence 
the need for national M&E systems which have 
the capacity to perform effectively and efficiently 
(Eresia-Eke and Boadu, 2019). By strengthening a 
country’s M&E system, citizens and the state will 
be capacitated to monitor and evaluate develop -
ment outcomes. 
Despite the significant attention being given to 
M&E capacity strengthening by organisations 
and the substantial investments being made to 
achieve this goal, M&E capacity strengthening is 
still impaired by the adoption of untried, imprac-
tical theories with the result that many pro -
grammes fall short of their goals and expectations 
(Holvoet, Gildemyn and Inberg, 2012). If African 
governments and civil society are to improve 
development outcomes and reduce corruption 
and poverty, there is a need for sound analysis 
based on adequate information which can be pro-
vided by a well-functioning M&E system (Hope, 
2017). Developing M&E capacity is essential to 
improve governance and ensure proper manage-
ment of public resources (Mackay, 2006). 
1.5 Conceptual framework
In this conceptualisation, an M&E system is 
regarded as a country M&E system, which includes 
both state and non-state institutions. Drawing 
from the definition of M&E system capacity alluded 
to earlier, a country M&E system can be described 
in terms of three levels - the individual, the institu-
tional and the country level (system level). These 
three levels are interconnected and complement 
each other to form a country M&E system (see 
Figure 1 below). A country M&E system consists of 
different M&E sub-systems which are interlinked 
and which, at times, may operate independently. 
The conceptual framework is underpinned by the 
following principles: 
 ■ M&E system capacity is broad and does not 
consist solely of individual skills and abilities 
but also involves institutional systems and a 
country-level enabling environment. 
 ■ M&E system capacity-strengthening 
approaches should go beyond capacitating 
individuals and must target the three levels 
(individual, institutional, and country) in 
a systematic manner, depending on the 
system needs.

1.6 M&E capacity strengthening 
in Africa 
There is a dearth of literature on M&E capacity 
strengthening in the African context. Where such 
literature exists, it generally deals specifically with 
strengthening the evaluation capacity of individ
-
uals and institutions and there is limited literature 
available on the topic of strengthening perfor
-
mance monitoring. This is also the case in terms 
of literature related to evaluations of M&E system 
strengthening approaches. Despite these limita
-
tions, an examination of the literature shows that 
M&E institutional frameworks and systems for the 
practice of M&E are not widely developed across 
most African countries and are characterised 
by a limited local demand for evaluation (Lahey, 
2015). M&E capacity strengthening is still not rec
-
ognised as a priority intervention area due to the 
lack of clear guidelines on how to operationalise 
CS and the limited number of capacity assess
-
ments undertaken at national level (Kimaro and 
Fourie, 2017b), leading to countries not having a 
clear understanding of their M&E capacity needs. 
M&E demand is largely externally driven and M&E 
capacity-strengthening interventions are driven 
largely by the interests of the funder (external) in 
ensuring the success and leveraging the impact 
of their respective programmes in a variety of 
countries (Stewart et al., 2019). Historically, inter
-
national CS funders have committed the majority 
of their resources to discrete, short-term capaci
-
ty-building activities which are often fragmented 
and, as such, there is limited evidence to show 
that their impacts yield long-term benefits. 
The lack of systematic recognition of CS, less so 
amongst the largest donors, is quite surprising 
considering the plethora of international agree
-
ments intended to enhance development effec -
tiveness through the promotion of evaluations, 
country ownership, and institutional strength
-
ening (Tarsilla, 2014). In the African context, pre -
vious evaluations, reviews of evaluation capacity, 
and performance monitoring have pointed to 
certain scarce skills in the region and indicate a 
pressing need for greater utilisation of locally avail
-
able skills when evaluations are conducted, and 
also to the strengthening of institutional mecha
-
nisms in the evaluation sector, such as communi -
ties of practice and mechanisms for peer learning 
(Mapitsa, Khumalo, Engel and Wooldridge, 2019). 
The focus has been on enhancing individual 
capacities to conduct and manage evaluations, 
with limited interventions targeting the capaci
-
tation of institutions and the creation of enabling 
environments in which M&E systems can operate 
effectively.
In the African context, capacity-strengthening 
activities are largely targeted at strengthening the 
knowledge and skills of individuals (Di Ciommo, 
2017) and M&E skills development falls into two 
categories: (1) academic training, which is the 
domain of universities and institutions of higher 
learning; and (2) professional development 
training (workshops and conferences). For aca
-
demic training, while the field is growing there are 
limited institutions and courses which focus spe
-
cifically on M&E (Basheka and Byamugisha, 2015). 
In most cases, M&E is taught in various postgrad
-
uate programmes as a specialisation, e.g. in man -
agement or public health (Tirivanhu, Robertson, 
Waller and Chirau, 2018). Furthermore, there are 
no institutions that offer M&E at an undergraduate 
level. 
In terms of the professional training approach, 
Kithinji (2015) reports the existence of extensive 
capacity-strengthening efforts in Africa including 
training and scholarships, workshops, technical 
support for projects/programmes, financial sup
-
port, joint evaluations, coaching and mentoring, 
dialogue at policy level, and communities of prac
-
tice. Other interventions in the African context 
are varied and include training parliamentarians 
on how to interpret and respond to evaluation 
reports, the provision of information technology 
infrastructure for data collection systems, the 
empowerment of beneficiaries to participate 
actively in assessing programme outcomes, the 
training of programme managers to draft quality 
terms of reference, opportunities for internships, 
improvement of data analysis skills and assisting in 
the development of theories of change (Goldman 
et al., 2018; Porter and Goldman, 2013). 
Voluntary Organizations for Professional Eval
-
uation (VOPEs) are also active in M&E capacity 
strengthening. VOPEs act as a platform for 
strengthening individual knowledge and skills 
(Rodríguez-Bilella and Lucero, 2016). As such, 
“VOPEs are established by evaluation practitioners, 
that is, people who make their living by doing or

commissioning evaluations, who self-organize to 
discuss and share professional experiences and 
challenges and to jointly advance the profession 
and develop professional standards. VOPE events, 
such as conferences, workshops and seminars, 
and publications provide a platform for profes-
sional exchange” (Kosheleva and Segone, 2013, p. 
8). Currently, more than 30 VOPEs are operational 
in Africa under an umbrella body – the African 
Evaluation Association (AFREA) – and are seen as 
important for providing practitioners with a plat -
form for peer learning, sharing good practice and 
speaking with one voice on M&E issues (Basheka 
and Byamugisha, 2015).
1.7 Constraints to M&E systems 
strengthening
Overall, M&E CS is heavily linked to international 
development partners who commission and con-
duct evaluations (Ngwabi and Wildschut, 2019). As 
such, M&E capacity strengthening in the African 
context has been supply-driven to serve interna-
tional partners’ objective of strengthening organ-
isational accountability capacity. The approach is 
narrow, it is mainly micro-focused, and is gener -
ally short term. The dominance of international 
development organisations in M&E CS has led to 
the piecemeal strengthening of ‘partner’ organisa-
tions’ local staff using approaches and frameworks 
imported from western countries and devoid of 
the context in which they are implemented (Tall, 
2009, Tarsilla, 2014). This has resulted in the pace 
of M&E CS being determined by supply, hence the 
poor adaptation of M&E systems in Africa (Morkel 
and Mangwiro, 2019). 
Perhaps one of the biggest barriers to capacity 
strengthening is the manner in which evalua-
tions are commissioned. As evaluations remain 
largely donor-driven, there is a longstanding and 
widespread practice of international organisa-
tions commissioning evaluations and engaging 
foreign evaluators thereby overlooking available 
local evaluators (Basheka and Byamugisha, 2015; 
Mackay, 2007; Tarsilla, 2014). This deprives local 
evaluators of opportunities to gain the requisite 
experience and build individual skills which are 
essential for strengthening the supply side of the 
development and sustainability of country M&E 
systems. Context-specific innovations which con-
tribute to the production of knowledge for adap -
tation are lost when commissioners of evaluations 
engage foreign evaluators and neglect to invite 
the participation of local evaluators in their teams.

2.1 Design
A mixed-method design was adopted for this 
study. Mixed-method design draws on the poten-
tial strengths of both qualitative and quantitative 
methods (Creswell and Clark, 2017), allowing 
researchers to explore diverse perspectives and 
uncover relationships that exist in a multifaceted 
research objective. The mixed-method approach 
provided a platform for this study to use “multiple 
sources of information from multiple approaches 
to gain new insights” (Axinn and Pearce, 2006, p. 
1) into how M&E system capacity strengthening is 
unfolding in the African context. In this study, the 
mixed-methods approach comprised a cross-sec-
tional survey and a qualitative in-depth enquiry. 
2.1.1 Cross-sectional online survey 
The cross-sectional survey was targeted at the 
staff of organisations responsible for M&E system 
CS in Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, 
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Given the time and 
resource constraints, convenience sampling was 
used to select the participants. This potentially 
results in a degree of selection bias as respondents 
were selected using the subjective judgement of 
the researcher, rather than  relying on random 
selection. This has an implication on the general-
isability of the study (see limitations and delimita-
tions section). The respondents were drawn from 
government departments or ministries, non-gov-
ernmental organisations, not-for-profit organisa-
tions (both local and international), public training 
institutions, parliamentary staff, and Voluntary 
Organizations for Professional Evaluation (VOPEs). 
The research team worked with stakeholders in 
the targeted countries to create a sampling frame 
for the survey. Details such as the email addresses 
and telephone numbers were collected during 
the creation of the sampling frame.
The sampling frame included information on 
the contact details of 322 respondents across 
the selected eight countries. A Survey Monkey
2 
survey link was sent to the 322 respondents, of 
which 18 (6%) bounced back due to incorrect 
email addresses, and 117 (36%), did not open the 
email. One hundred and forty-two respondents 
completed the survey (44%) which is regarded as 
an adequate response rate for a population size of 
322. The table below presents the distribution of 
respondents across the selected eight countries.

2.1.2 Semi-structured interviews
Semi-structured interviews were used to gain 
a more comprehensive understanding of the 
various M&E system capacity-strengthening 
approaches and their impacts, and to elicit 
information on how the effectiveness of these 
approaches are measured. The interviews were 
conducted either telephonically or in-person with 
purposively selected participants from Botswana, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda 
and Zambia. Respondents were also drawn from

organisations involved in capacity strengthening 
such as UNICEF, African Union (AU), African Devel-
opment Bank (AFDB) and non-governmental 
organisations. The respondents included govern-
ment officials, non-governmental organisation 
staff, public training institutions academics, M&E 
units in government, and international support/
donor agencies. The criteria for selecting the 
respondents for the in-depth enquiry were: 
 ■ Significant experience in M&E capacity 
strengthening in Africa. 
 ■ Currently working in the M&E sector or 
related field.
The initial target was at least 20 in-depth inter -
views or to the point at which saturation was 
reached, which occurred after 15 interviews. These 
interviews provided a rich and comprehensive 
understanding of capacity-strengthening activi-
ties throughout the selected countries. The distri-
bution of respondents is as follows:

2.2 Data analysis
Data analysis was guided by the study objectives 
and also by the study design. Quantitative and 
qualitative data were analysed separately and 
were integrated at the analysis stage. Quantita-
tive data were downloaded from Survey Monkey, 
cleaned, and analysed using STATA, which allowed 
for data to be managed, analysed, and translated 
into a graphical display of data. Descriptive statis-
tics (count, frequencies, percent distribution and 
mean) were used to analyse the closed-ended 
survey questions whilst manual content analysis 
was used for the open-ended questions. Qualita-
tive data from the interviews were transcribed and 
analysed using content analysis. This enabled the 
research team to make sense and meaning of the 
thematic content and, more importantly, to sort 
data by thematic areas linked to the study objec-
tives.
2.3 Limitations and delimitation
Limited time and resources to conduct the study 
influenced the choice of convenience sampling as 
the sampling approach. Convenience sampling 
limits the findings of the study as they cannot be 
generalised across the selected eight countries. 
However, analytic generalisation was applied by 
determining which findings apply to all countries 
and which are unique to specific countries.

T
he findings presented below addresses the 
overarching aim of the study, which was to 
examine the status of M&E systems capacity 
strengthening in relation to how it has been 
implemented and how its effectiveness has been 
measured. The first section presents the descrip -
tion of the study sample and the subsequent sec-
tions expand on the various research objectives.
3.1 Study sample profile 
As previously mentioned in the methodology sec-
tion, the semi-structured interview respondents 
and the survey participants were drawn from 
eight targeted Anglophone countries – Botswana, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda 
and Zambia (see Table 2). For the cross-sectional 
survey, respondents were distributed evenly 
across the countries except for Botswana (0%) 
and Rwanda (2%). Semi-structured interview par -
ticipants were also drawn from the selected eight 
countries and were drawn from entities such as 
national government M&E departments, interna-
tional non-governmental/multilateral institutions, 
and local non-governmental institutions. All par -
ticipants are employed at a senior level within 
their organisations and are directly involved in 
M&E capacity strengthening, either at country or 
regional level.
Whilst the majority of the participants who 
responded are from national governments (39%), 
the remaining participants (61%) were drawn from 
other M&E stakeholders. Figure 2 provides infor -
mation on the respondents’ employers.

M&E CAPACITY-STRENGTHENING APPROACHES  AND MEASUREMENT IN AFRICA

CLEAR-AA
3.2 Capacity strengthening
This study views capacity as multi-dimensional, 
not limited to individual skills, knowledge and 
abilities but also incorporating the availability 
and use of functional M&E systems, processes, 
resources, management and governance of M&E 
activities within institutions. At the country level, 
capacity includes sound M&E policies and strat -
egies that create an enabling M&E environment. 
In this study, capacity-strengthening approaches 
are classified at three levels – individual, institution 
and system levels.
3.3 Overview of organisations 
implementing capacity 
strengthening 
The findings of this study indicate that there are 
various organisations currently involved in capac-
ity-strengthening activities in the eight selected 
countries. The organisations include government 
departments, higher education training institu-
tions, multilateral organisations, local and inter -
national non-governmental organisations, VOPEs, 
and individuals acting as consultants. Multilateral 
organisations such as the World Bank, UNICEF, 
USAID, UNDP and AFDB are involved in capaci-
ty-strengthening activities across several African 
countries but their approaches vary from country 
to country. Although CLEAR-AA is not a multi-
lateral organisation, it is active in strengthening 
capacity at the country level by supporting coun-
tries to develop M&E policies and frameworks at 
both country and institutional levels. CLEAR-AA’s 
support also extends to supporting the VOPEs 
with the aim of strengthening their influence on 
organisational and national evaluation policies 
for the benefit of society at large. Certain organi-
sations are reported to be involved in sector-spe -
cific projects such as in health and agriculture 
etc. These projects are not necessarily related to 
capacity strengthening despite the organisations 
involved being listed as capacity-strengthening 
organisations. In the study, interviewees indicated 
that these organisations focus on strengthening 
the capacity of their staff largely for accountability 
purposes and that the state sector benefits little 
from these efforts.
In this study, specific government units were iden-
tified as being responsible for coordinating M&E 
in the various countries and were also listed as 
organisations providing capacity strengthening. 
Several respondents confirmed that capacity 
strengthening is provided by such units in the 
various countries involved in this study. These 
include Uganda’s Prime Minister’s office, Botswa-
na’s National Strategy Office, Tanzania’s Public Ser-
vice Management and Good Governance Office, 
and Kenya’s Monitoring and Evaluation Depart -
ment. Two points should be noted with regard 
to government interventions in M&E capacity 
strengthening. The first point is that there is sig-
nificant involvement and influence of multilat -
eral and other organisations in state-led M&E 
capacity-strengthening activities. Throughout the 
selected eight countries, multilateral and other 
organisations provide funding for these activities 
and set specific goals which are required to be 
achieved during the period of funding. In Uganda, 
the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) was listed 
by all 26 respondents from Uganda as providing 
CS. However, respondents also revealed that the 
OPM plays a coordinating role and works in part -
nership with several other organisations who pro-
vide material and technical assistance for capacity 
strengthening. In other countries, the coordina-
tion by the central government is not as strong 
as it is in Uganda. The second point is that state 
capacity-strengthening activities are focused on 
strengthening government institutions and have 
limited reach in organisations outside the state 
system. Although the state is focused on strength-
ening capacity within its own institutions, the high 
turnover of state M&E personnel was highlighted 
as an obstacle effectively making the government 
system a training ground for staff who will later 
move to either local or international non-govern-
mental organisations. 
Higher education institutions are also listed as 
providing M&E capacity strengthening across all 
the eight countries but the majority offer short 
courses and M&E modules which are targeted at 
specific sectors e.g. health, agriculture etc. Evi-
dence shows that there is no direct career path 
for those who want to study M&E from under -
graduate level to postgraduate level. This reflects 
the poor development of M&E as a discipline and 
casts a certain doubt on the quality of M&E cur -
ricula, with consequent detrimental effects on the 
skills of the graduates.

VOPEs are listed as organisations that are active in 
M&E capacity strengthening in seven of the eight 
countries, with the exclusion of Botswana. It is 
evident from the respondents that they believe 
that although the VOPEs in some of the countries 
are not yet fully developed they have the poten-
tial to transform the M&E system and practice by 
strengthening individual M&E practitioner skills 
and playing an advisory role in the various state 
departments. 
3.4 M&E capacity strengthening-
approaches 
The survey and the in-depth interviews revealed 
that various capacity-strengthening approaches 
are being implemented across the eight African 
countries. The approaches are being imple -
mented by a variety of stakeholders including 
central government, training institutions (higher 
education institutions), multilateral organisations, 
local and international non-governmental organ-
isations, and consultancies. The targets of the 
capacity-strengthening approaches are presented 
below. 
Although 48% of respondents indicated that the 
capacity-strengthening approaches are targeted 
at the institutional level, it is important to note 
that when respondents were asked to describe 
the CS activities, the description reveals that the 
activities are mainly for the imparting of specific 
skills to individuals within organisations and these 
activities should, therefore, be regarded as individ-
ual-level approaches. 
3.5 Country system-level capacity 
strengthening 
The perception of both the interviewees and the 
survey participants is that capacity-strengthening 
activities such as developing M&E policies and 
frameworks, creating an enabling environment, 
and developing institutional M&E systems do 
not constitute capacity strengthening. It is evi-
dent from the responses to the survey and the 
in-depth interviews that the focus is narrow and 
concentrates on strengthening individuals’ skills 
and knowledge. Respondents highlighted that 
country-level M&E capacity strengthening is dom-
inated by multilateral organisations or the organi-
sations they fund and the government itself. There 
is a distinct focus on strengthening government 
systems whilst the non-state sector largely oper -
ates as a parallel system. 
At country M&E system level, very few respon-
dents (survey and semi-structured interviews) 
were of the opinion that capacity-strengthening 
activities are taking place. Capacity-strengthening 
approaches at country system-level focus on 
developing policies, frameworks and M&E systems 
specifically for state institutions. These approaches 
are being implemented in collaboration with

other international organisations but national 
M&E coordinators dominate. The various capaci-
ty-strengthening activities appear to concentrate 
on the formulation of policies and guidelines to 
guide the institutionalisation of M&E in the state 
sector rather than on the implementation of M&E 
guidelines and policies within the state sector. 
3.6 The institutionalisation of 
M&E (institutional level)
Respondents were asked to describe the capac-
ity-strengthening activities at the institutional/
organisational level. Respondents to both the 
survey and the semi-structured interviews clas-
sified capacity-strengthening activities into state 
sector and non-state sector activities. In the state 
sector, countries such as Botswana, Tanzania and 
Kenya are implementing strategies to institu-
tionalise M&E within government departments. 
This is being done by the creation and capacita-
tion of M&E units within government ministries 
and departments. Respondents indicated that in 
Botswana concerted efforts are being made to set 
up M&E units in government departments whilst 
in Uganda a few of the ministries have appointed 
M&E officers but others still lack M&E structures 
due to resource constraints. The results show that 
across the eight countries, challenges such as 
poor funding for the institutionalisation of M&E, 
the perception that M&E is not relevant or is a 
fault-finding tool, and the poor appreciation of the 
value of M&E make institutionalisation difficult.
Respondents indicate that in the non-state sector 
the situation is somewhat different with var -
ious approaches having been implemented to 
strengthen M&E structures and processes and 
to capacitate individuals. A respondent summed 
up this scenario by saying that the non-govern-
mental organisations which receive funding from 
international organisations are required to follow 
stringent accountability requirements which a 
functional organisational M&E system can provide 
and they therefore have an obligation to build 
their own capacity. However, despite having this 
capacity, respondents indicated that non-gov-
ernmental organisations do not share their per -
formance data and evaluation reports with state 
stakeholders, hence the existence of parallel M&E 
systems.
3.7 Approaches to developing 
individual skills and abilities 
As mentioned earlier, several organisations are 
involved in strengthening individual-level skills 
and abilities across the eight African countries. 
However, it is important to note that there seems 
to be a perception among respondents (both 
from the survey and the interviews) that M&E 
capacity is largely concerned with individual 
skills and abilities. The majority of respondents 
listed strengthening of individual-level skills and 
abilities as the main capacity-building activity in 
their country. These activities were project-based 
and aimed at improving organisational reporting, 
mainly for the purposes of accountability. The 
approaches used at the individual level only target 
at M&E practitioners. At an individual level, the fol-
lowing approaches were listed as being used to 
strengthen capacity: 
■ Short term courses – training individuals 
(M&E practitioners) on specific skills e.g. 
impact evaluation, data analysis and report 
writing; 
■ In-house M&E training – internships, 
mentoring and coaching;
■ Higher training institutions offering training 
(sector-specific M&E courses); and
■ Stakeholders, such as VOPEs, offering 
pre-conference training workshops to 
participants.
During the study respondents were asked their 
opinion on the rationale for offering this wide 
range of types of training. Despite the fact that 
some of the respondents were working for M&E 
coordination units, they could not say with cer -
tainty what guided these approaches. However, 
respondents from countries such as Uganda 
indicated that a country capacity needs assess-
ment had been conducted and gaps have been 
identified. This would allow for capacity-strength-
ening funding to be directed to the appropriate 
capacity-strengthening activity. Respondents 
indicated that organisations funding and imple -
menting capacity-strengthening activities work in 
silos, without linking and coordinating with other 
role players. The lack of coordination of individual 
training activities also means that strengthening 
individual skills and knowledge is conducted on

an ad hoc basis, it is not centrally coordinated, and 
is conducted using different curricula and there -
fore fails to meet the capacity needs of an indi-
vidual.
3.8 Capacity-strengthening issues 
Despite the interventions which have been 
implemented in these eight these countries, it 
appears that there is no systematic approach to 
understanding the M&E system gaps and needs. 
Respondents indicated that capacity-strength-
ening interventions are disjointed, unsystematic, 
and seem to address the individual skills and abili-
ties of the practitioners rather than the consumers 
of the M&E products. Respondents working at 
the regional level indicated that there is a need 
to realise that capacity is multi-dimensional and 
to achieve full capacity there is a need for various 
elements of capacity to work together. Across 
all the countries except for Uganda, capacity 
strengthening is not informed by capacity needs 
assessments but by assumptions of the needs of 
the country. Respondents alluded to the unsys-
tematic and ad hoc nature of capacity strength-
ening across the eight countries and the lack of 
capacity-strengthening frameworks or strategies 
to address the capacity gaps. 
Respondents were asked about the effectiveness 
of capacity-strengthening activities being imple -
mented in their countries. There is a consensus 
that these approaches are effective, with only 1% 
indicating that they are not effective. However, 
effectiveness needs to be measured according to 
the intended outcomes and its contribution to the 
broader country M&E system. As will be discussed 
in detail later in this report, capacity strengthening 
is not being measured and effectiveness is, there -
fore, subjective.
local context and 66% indicated that they are rel-
evant to their context whilst only 5% indicated 
low relevance. This finding contradicts the litera-
ture on the topic of capacity strengthening which 
indicates a general lack of contextual relevance of 
capacity-strengthening approaches across Anglo-
phone African countries. It can be inferred that 
due to the outcomes of capacity strengthening 
not being measured and the absence of capacity 
needs assessments in these countries, the contex-
tual relevance of these activities lacks a reference 
point.

3.9 Capacity-strengthening 
enabling factors 
Respondents to the semi-structured interview 
cited several capacity-strengthening enabling fac-
tors. Key enablers identified are the initiatives being 
undertaken by the governments of the selected 
eight countries to formalise M&E into government 
systems and the anchoring of these systems in 
national budgets. This has been achieved by the 
development of M&E units and policies and by 
linking them to national development agendas. 
Respondents highlighted that such develop -
ments enable M&E capacity strengthening which 
is critical for defining roles and responsibilities of 
the stakeholders outlined in M&E country policies.
The role of development funders/donors was 
highlighted as enabling capacity strengthening. 
Respondents across the eight countries high-
lighted the fact that funding for development 
programmes is now seldom granted without 
the imposition of stringent M&E requirements 
and the availability of funding to capacitate staff  
of the organisations receiving the funding. This 
has played a significant role in building the M&E 
human capital of the various countries and fur -
thering the development of M&E institutional 
capacity in both state and non-state institutions.
A growing demand for M&E products by both the 
bureaucratic and political arms of governments 
was cited as one of the enabling factors for M&E 
capacity strengthening. Although respondents 
indicated that there are challenges in situations 
where the importance of M&E is undervalued 
and there is a poor appreciation and awareness of 
M&E by politicians, demand for M&E products was 
increasing thereby opening avenues for capacity 
strengthening within the state. Respondents high-
lighted that M&E champions within state institu-
tions have played a significant role in creating 
this demand. Champions at this level of authority 
have a valuable role to play in the integration of 
M&E across the public policy cycle at sectoral and 
national level.
Partnerships between state and non-state enti-
ties were also cited as enabling M&E capacity 
strengthening. Respondents reported that part -
nerships between stakeholders such as VOPEs, 
government departments, and donors are 
common in various countries. These partnerships 
have resulted in various capacity-strengthening 
activities which include developing M&E policies 
and frameworks at national level, M&E institution-
alisation, and development of individual skills and 
abilities. Despite these partnerships, respondents 
indicated that the non-state and state sectors 
operate in silos when it comes to the practice of 
M&E with the former having developed efficient 
M&E systems whilst the latter is poorly funded and 
struggles with limited human resource capacity.

3.10 Barriers to effective 
M&E systems capacity 
strengthening 
3.10.1 Scarce resources 
In an effort to understand the factors that impede 
capacity strengthening across the selected eight 
countries, survey participants were asked for 
their opinions on the main barriers responsible 
for impeding capacity strengthening. The bar -
riers were pre-coded and are presented in Table 
3. The table lists the various barriers identified 
by participants. Poor funding for M&E capacity 
strengthening was regarded as the main obstacle 
to capacity strengthening. This perception con-
curred with that of the interview respondents 
who stated that the state sector allocates lim-
ited funding for M&E capacity strengthening and 
implementation of M&E policies. State institutions 
depend too heavily on international donors for 
M&E capacity strengthening. 
Interviewees indicated that the situation is com-
pletely different for non-state sector organi-
sations that are implementing donor-funded 
programmes. They highlighted how these organ-
isations are guaranteed funding for M&E system 
capacity strengthening and the setting up of M&E 
systems with the objective of improving account-
ability and performance monitoring. At the indi-
vidual level, there are scarce resources available for 
the academic and professional training for individ-
uals not attached to institutions. 
3.10.2 Lack of a culture of evaluation
Most respondents cited the lack of a culture of 
evaluation as a barrier to capacity strengthening. 
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the general 
perception that M&E is a type of audit stems from 
civil servants seeing M&E as doing ‘police work’ 
or as a tool for checking what went wrong rather 
than an opportunity to learn how to improve on 
their activities and they will therefore often avoid 
engaging in M&E. Most survey participants (73%) 
concurred with the perception of interviewees 
who indicated that M&E is used as a tool for 
accountability to the programme funders. Only 
27% indicated that M&E is used for learning and 
improving programme implementation. Consid-
ering the poor history of evaluation being used 
as a tool for informed decision-making but rather 
regarded as a means to determine accountability, 
these findings suggest that while demand for M&E 
products may be growing, this demand might 
be misplaced and might not assist countries to 
achieve their intended development outcomes. 
3.10.3 Limited understanding of 
the role of M&E by critical 
stakeholders 
Growing the demand for evaluations and M&E 
products has been highlighted as an enabling

CLEAR-AA
factor for capacity strengthening. However, 
respondents state that the lack of awareness and 
appreciation of the role of M&E amongst state 
bureaucrats, political principals, and funders act as 
a barrier to M&E capacity strengthening. Respon-
dents indicate that while M&E products are in 
demand, there is lack of knowledge on how to 
use the products and that there is poor availability 
of M&E evidence to enable informed decision 
making. Commonly, M&E products have little influ-
ence on programme learning and implementa-
tion as they are received and acted upon after the 
fact and this was found to be the case for all the 
eight countries in the study. This has diminished 
the value of M&E and has indirectly affected the 
availability of capacity-strengthening resources.
3.10.4 Mistrust in sharing M&E 
products 
The degree to which the development of M&E 
across the continent has been driven by develop -
ment partners has created a system of fragmenta-
tion regarding what evidence is generated by M&E 
systems and how it is shared or coordinated. This 
is particularly pervasive amongst civil society enti-
ties. As CSOs, NGOs, and international NGOs are 
largely donor-driven, the reporting requirements 
for this funding have proved beneficial as they 
have helped to build M&E capacity within civil 
society. Unfortunately, the reporting requirements 
are such that often the analysis of these systems is 
only shared with development partners and not 
with the state drivers that provide the direction, 
the setting, and the national performance mon-
itoring systems of these same sectors. This poor 
sharing of information between civil society and 
government in more inclusive societies, such as 
Ghana, is largely due to the lack of coordination 
mechanisms for centralising government and civil 
society-generated data. In other countries that are 
less inclusive, such as Uganda, there tends to be 
mistrust regarding how the data will be used. 
In Uganda, there is limited sharing of data between 
government, NGOs, and INGOs. As noted above, 
the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) has over -
seen a steering committee for selecting all eval-
uations to be carried out in the country and this 
includes civil society, academia, and the private 
sector. To address this lack of sharing, the OPM 
is establishing a framework to streamline CSO 
reporting through the government in order to 
reap the benefits of CSO performance monitoring 
and evaluation. 
3.10.5 M&E curricula and training 
barriers 
Respondents indicated that there are several 
barriers related to M&E training. Respondents 
reported the non-availability of M&E courses at the 
undergraduate level as being directly responsible 
for the human capacity shortages across African 
countries and the poor development and adapta-
tion of M&E as a discipline in the African context. 
Respondents also stated that while professional 
courses, workshops and postgraduate academic 
courses are being offered across Africa, these are 
frequently beyond the reach of the very individuals 
and institutions in critical need of training. Organ-
isations and government departments which lack 
resources have very limited access to these profes-
sional courses whilst non-state entities who have 
the necessary funds can afford to capacitate their 
institutions by sending individuals for professional 
development courses. Respondents indicated 
that due to the disparity in remuneration between 
state and non-state organisations (INGOs) in 
Africa, qualified M&E individuals tend to migrate 
to the non-state sector (INGOs). Respondents indi-
cated that state institutions effectively become 
a training ground for the non-state sector as the 
most capable and qualified M&E human capital 
moves out of the state. 
The absence of post-training follow-up of those 
who have received various types of professional 
training makes it difficult to ascertain the impact 
of capacity strengthening at an organisational 
or systems level. The emphasis appears to be 
on training rather than on a broader, long-term 
strategy for national M&E capacity development 
plans. Such plans could serve to identify the needs 
of the country for the next generation and it is 
therefore essential that competency is strength-
ened to be able to provide the scale of capacity 
needed to meet the future needs of the countries.

3.10.6 Unknown M&E capacity needs
Unknown capacity needs of countries, institu-
tions, and individuals across the eight countries 
have been identified as a barrier to capacity 
strengthening. Respondents highlighted that 
country capacity needs and gaps are not known 
and are decided by whoever is funding the 
capacity strengthening. This has led M&E capacity 
strengthening approaches’ design and activities 
being dictated and driven by international funders 
and those implementing capacity strengthening 
activities. During interviews, respondents empha-
sised that given the limited resources for capacity 
strengthening, it is prudent for countries to assess 
their M&E capacity needs and prioritise the meagre 
resources towards areas with the greatest need. 
3.11 Measuring M&E capacity-
strengthening activities 
3.11.1 How is M&E system capacity 
strengthening measured?
Measuring the effectiveness of M&E capacity 
strengthening is critical as it allows the imple -
menters to understand how the intervention 
has performed and the extent to which it has 
addressed the initial needs or objectives of the 
intervention. There is consensus amongst all the 
respondents that M&E capacity-strengthening 
results are not necessarily seen in the short-term 
but provide benefits in the longer term. This 
means that the impact and effectiveness of capac-
ity-strengthening approaches are noticed after 
a much longer period. The fact that the major 
stakeholders, both funders and implementers 
of capacity-strengthening activities, are usually 
from outside the country means that their inter -
ventions are targeted at a specific area/level and 
are of a limited duration. This also means that the 
resources for measuring the effectiveness of M&E 
capacity strengthening are also only available for 
a short period of time, hence it is often difficult 
to measure the long-term impacts of the capac-
ity-strengthening activities. Respondents empha-
sised that M&E capacity strengthening should be 
funded locally or, in cases where resources are 
limited, the state should take a lead (driven from 
within) and set long-term measurable goals. 
 
 
The second issue raised by respondents is that in 
both state and non-state institutions, M&E capac-
ity-strengthening activities are often viewed as a 
very small item or process in the whole develop -
ment intervention/programme cycle and may be 
regarded as not worth reporting or evaluating at 
the end of the cycle. The result is that the design 
for capacity strengthening is ad hoc and is not 
carefully considered, and CS activities do not 
receive adequate funding and support by state 
decision-makers. Respondents indicated that the 
implication is that funding is allocated for capacity 
strengthening itself e.g. training of individuals, 
rather than on the assessment of the impact of 
CS. One respondent summarised the implication 
of not measuring M&E capacity development by 
saying that despite significant investment being 
made in the African context to develop evalua-
tion capacity, both state and non-state institutions 
still decry the lack of evaluation skills within their 
organisations and the sector still depends on for -
eign evaluators. The respondent apportioned the 
blame for the skills shortage to the lack of evalu-
ation of the design, processes and outcomes of 
M&E capacity-strengthening activities. The argu-
ment is that if the funders and implementers of 
M&E system capacity development insisted on 
the measurement of outcomes, this would result 
in sound and informed solutions for addressing 
capacity strengthening. 
3.11.2 What has been measured and 
how?
Survey respondents were asked how the various 
capacity-strengthening activities being imple -
mented in their countries were being measured, 
and especially their effectiveness was being 
measured. The responses were elicited by means 
of an open-ended question. Sixty participants 
responded to the question and 54 stated that pro-
cess and output indicators were the only forms of 
measurement.

The process and output indicators are clustered as 
follows: 
■ Pre- and post-training scores; 
■ Number of individuals trained;
■ end-of-module assessments; 
■ Number of courses held; and 
■ The number of graduates.
In terms of intermediate outcomes (building 
capacity or systems) two indicators were identi-
fied:
■ Number of CSOs with the ability to produce 
quality data in their programmes; and 
■ Ability to perform data quality assurance. 
Only four respondents listed wider outcome indi-
cators around changes in behaviour or perfor -
mance which are related to the broader goal of 
capacity strengthening. The indicators are:
■ Level of parliamentary and citizen demand 
for M&E system products; and 
■ Utilisation of national statistics for decision-
making purposes. 
Respondents indicated that those implementing 
capacity strengthening did not measure how 
M&E system CS was performing. However, respon-
dents suggested that if a country has a capacity 
development framework, then it is necessary to 
set long-term goals that will lead to measurable 
immediate and wider outcomes.
The interviewees proposed the following indica-
tors to measure CS indicators for immediate out -
comes:
■ Quality of reporting; 
■ Quality of evaluations;
■ Quality of data produced; and 
■ Timeliness of reporting and is reporting 
aligned to the decision-making process.
The interviewees proposed the following indica-
tors to measure CS indicators for wider outcomes:
■ Evidence use in decision making by both 
state and non-state entities; 
■ Use of performance data for programme 
learning and adaptation at the institutional 
level; and 
■ Uptake of M&E in the decision-making 
process. 
The results show that issues related to the mea-
surement of M&E capacity-strengthening activ-
ities are not divorced from the broader issues of 
capacity strengthening. The fact that the majority 
of capacity-strengthening activities are focused 
at the individual level means that performance 
monitoring indicators are more dominant than 
the system-level outcomes. Respondents high-
lighted that various compounding factors make 
it difficult to measure outcomes. These include 
problems with disjuncture in the design of capac-
ity-strengthening activities, an unsystematic 
approach, and the disjuncture between what the 
training curriculum offers and the M&E sector skills 
requirements. Given the observations presented, 
it can be argued that for effective measurement 
of the outcomes of M&E capacity-strengthening 
activities, a systematic approach to capacity 
strengthening is needed, and the design should 
address known capacity needs at institutional 
and system level. Such an approach addresses the 
non-availability of resources for measuring out -
comes and refocuses capacity strengthening to 
national needs.

T
he objective of this study was to explore the 
approaches to M&E system capacity strength-
ening that have been used in selected Anglo -
phone African countries and to determine how 
their effectiveness has been measured. The fol-
lowing specific research questions were pursued: 
What is the status of M&E system capacity strength-
ening in selected countries in Anglophone Africa? 
What are the gaps in M&E capacity strengthening 
in selected countries in Anglophone Africa? What 
approaches, mechanisms and measures are being 
used by various institutions to measure the impact 
of this capacity strengthening (for example to 
influence policies, programmes and management 
systems) as well as the combination and quality 
of the interventions themselves? What do both 
research and practice suggest is ‘good’ practice in 
M&E CS at individual/organisational/system level? 
This discussion section is structured according to 
these research questions. 
4.1 Current status of M&E system 
capacity strengthening.
Despite the widespread practice of M&E in the 
countries involved this study, evidence shows that 
there are frequently dual parallel M&E systems. 
One is led by central (national) government and 
focuses on the development of M&E within gov-
ernment institutions and the other is composed 
of various non-state organisations running their 
systems parallel to those of the government. Per -
formance monitoring data and evaluations from 
these two systems rarely cross the parallel divide 
to influence policy, planning and decision making 
within the other. 
At the sector level, certain sectors’ performance 
monitoring capacity is more developed, especially 
those sectors receiving substantial funding from 
the international community, such as health and 
agriculture. At an institutional level, the capacity 
of the M&E systems of certain state institutions/
departments are more developed whilst others 
are still in the development phase. This is largely 
dependent on the investments of resources by 
both the state and non-state sectors. In the non-
state sector, M&E systems function as measures of 
accountability to meet to funders’ requirements. It 
is important to note that in state institutions eval-
uations and assessment of evaluation capacity are 
not frequently undertaken whilst in the non-state 
sector significant numbers of evaluations are car -
ried out and, in cases where evaluation capacity is 
lacking, the non-state sector draws from outside 
the country. 
VOPEs and academic/training institutions also 
focus on M&E policy advocacy and the strength-
ening of individual skills and abilities. What is sig-
nificant in these eight countries’ systems is the 
lack of coordination and integration between 
state institutions, the VOPEs, and higher educa-
tion institutions in pursuit of a consolidated M&E 
system. This has resulted in these key stakeholders 
working in silos thereby losing potential opportu-
nities for strengthening M&E capacity. Non-state 
sectors play a limited role in state sector perfor -
mance monitoring and evaluations, whilst aca-
demic institutions’ curricula are not driven by the 
M&E industry needs and neither are they localised 
resulting in a mismatch between the skills pro -
duced and the M&E industry requirements. 
4.2 Demand for M&E products 
and evidence-informed 
decision-making 
The responses to this study strongly emphasise 
that the generation of demand for M&E products 
plays a pivotal role in strengthening capacity for 
countries. Demand for M&E products has been 
classified as modest to the extent that even in 
cases where evaluative evidence is available, it 
is rarely used for decision making. There is an 
assumption that generating demand and con-
scientising decision-makers (both political and 
administrative) on the importance of M&E will 
lead to a top-down demand for M&E products 
which will result in the strengthening of M&E 
system capacity. If this demand is sustained, it 
will advance the institutionalisation of M&E. This 
can be achieved by better allocation of resources, 
advocating for the formalisation of M&E within 
institutions, strengthening data collection sys-
tems, and increasing the demand for quality M&E

CLEAR-AA
products. However, in countries such as Uganda, 
with a more developed M&E system, it was high-
lighted that evaluative evidence complemented 
by other types of evidence is not always available 
when decisions are being made. With regard to 
the demand for M&E products, it is important to 
understand what informs that demand – is it the 
demand for accountability, programme improve -
ment or learning? For demand to be strengthened 
there is a need to understand whether and under 
what circumstances robust evidence directly con-
tributes to decision making. 
4.3 M&E system capacity-
strengthening gaps
Evidence has shown that outside entities and for -
eign donors influence the agenda of M&E system 
capacity strengthening. The implication is that 
capacity-strengthening approaches are designed 
without an inclusive capacity needs assessment, 
they do not consider the in-country context and, 
in most cases, they focus on non-state sector 
organisations and individuals to strengthen 
accountability and project reporting mechanisms. 
None of the eight countries selected for this study 
has conducted a countrywide capacity needs 
assessment or have formulated an M&E capaci-
ty-strengthening framework. 
Other stakeholders involved in capacity strength-
ening are separating evaluation from perfor -
mance monitoring to focus on evaluation capacity 
strengthening. Monitoring provides performance 
information on policies, programmes, or projects 
at any given time in relation to set targets and out-
comes. Evaluation provides evidence of whether 
targets and outcomes are being achieved and is 
an essential measurement tool for use during the 
programme life cycle rather than an activity to be 
performed at the end of the project. The focus on 
evaluations is underpinned by the belief that the 
more frequently evaluations are conducted, the 
more evidence-based decision making will be 
enabled. Separating evaluation from performance 
monitoring means that those responsible for the 
implementation process lose the opportunity to 
learn and adapt during project implementation. 
Evaluation skills are integral in performance mon-
itoring, as these skills enable the development 
of an evaluative culture within institutions and 
have a direct influence on learning and adapta-
tion during the implementation of interventions. 
In resource-constrained countries, strengthening 
the evaluation skills of staff who are responsible 
for performance monitoring will also address the 
skills shortage and foster a culture of using evi-
dence in decision-making at the implementation 
level. This will change the perception that decision 
making is restricted to senior managers. 
4.4 Enabling factors 
There are several opportunities which enable 
capacity strengthening. There is an increasing will-
ingness to develop M&E systems with government 
departments and the sharing of technical exper -
tise could significantly assist in developing effec-
tive M&E systems with subsequent positive devel-
opment outcomes. This, coupled with a growing 
demand for M&E products, could highlight the 
necessity and demand for evidence to inform 
concrete policy decisions such as programme 
redesign, scale-up or discontinuation, and will ulti-
mately lead to positive development outcomes. 
Also, the availability of a variety of partners such as 
VOPEs, donors, educational, and multilateral insti-
tutions presents a valuable opportunity for coun-
tries to make the best use of these partnerships 
by directing the partnership resources to where 
the need for strengthening country M&E systems 
is the greatest. The prevailing ineffective situa-
tion of the state and other development partners 
each using their own M&E systems to implement 
development interventions which are targeted at 
the same/or similar development challenges indi-
cates a need to break these M&E silos. This would 
create opportunities for mutual learning through 
the sharing of knowledge and experience to col-
laboratively determine what works best in the par-
ticular country. 
4.5 Barriers 
The majority of the barriers relate to the poor 
appreciation of the role of M&E by decision-makers. 
The findings of this study show that there is a 
shortage of resources across all levels (individual, 
institutional and system levels) to develop a fully 
functional M&E system. At the state level, there is 
a dependence on non-state funders for capacity 
strengthening. This is not sustainable and, in most 
cases, the funder dictates the capacity-strength-
ening goals and approaches thereby depriving
<<<PAGE=30>>>
22
RESEARCH REPORT
M&E CAPACITY-STRENGTHENING APPROACHES  AND MEASUREMENT IN AFRICA
CLEAR-AA
state entities of the opportunity to channel the 
resources where they are needed most. At the 
institutional level, despite the push to develop 
functional M&E systems, state institutions lack the 
necessary human and material resources to realise 
this goal. At individual level, individuals are often 
exposed to a variety of ad hoc professional and 
non-professional training interventions offered by 
various entities, and these training opportunities 
are frequently priced beyond the financial reach 
of individuals who are not sponsored by their 
employers. To address the resource challenge, 
there is a need for the state to assume overall 
responsibility for M&E system capacity strength-
ening and allocate adequate resources to address 
M&E system capacity gaps in state institutions. 
Another important barrier common across the 
eight countries is the absence of a culture of eval-
uation. The poor perception and lack of appre -
ciation of the potential benefits of M&E results 
in situations where evaluation results are used 
selectively for justifying prior decisions or, in some 
cases, results are suppressed or used to advance 
specific political agendas. In some cases, despite 
the availability of evidence from M&E, decisions 
are made without using that evidence – delib -
erately or inadvertently. What can be learnt from 
such situations is that the development of a cul-
ture of evidence-informed decision making does 
not only strengthen the capacity of M&E practi-
tioners but is also of value for decision-makers. 
There is a need to develop synergies and partner -
ships amongst all stakeholders who are addressing 
the same development challenges. These syn-
ergies and partnerships must also extend to 
programme design and the implementation 
of development programmes. This will prevent 
duplication of efforts and enable both the state 
and the non-state sectors to work collaboratively.
As has been the case in other disciplines, the M&E 
curriculum is flawed due to its non-alignment 
with local M&E practice needs. Curriculum align-
ment is crucial in realising learning objectives but 
in the case of M&E, alignment objectives are often 
subject to practical problems. Professional training 
of individuals in M&E is haphazard with individuals 
randomly attending workshops and short courses 
without any pre-determined learning trajectories 
or plans across the curriculum.
4.6 Measuring the effectiveness 
of M&E system capacity-
strengthening approaches 
Measuring the effectiveness of M&E capacity 
strengthening is critical as it allows the imple -
menters to understand how the intervention has 
performed and to what extent it has addressed 
the initial needs or objectives of the interven-
tion. The findings of this study show that across 
all eight countries, the measurement of M&E 
capacity-strengthening activities is amorphous 
and vague. Measurement only exists at the input 
and output stages of the micro-level spectrum. 
Absence of monitoring tools for capacity-strength-
ening activities implies that the efficiency and 
effectiveness of capacity-strengthening activities 
are unknown hence implementers are deprived 
of the opportunity to reflect on what is working, 
not working, for whom and under what circum-
stances. Also, the absence of evaluations means 
that the relationship between capacity-strength-
ening interventions and M&E capacity outcomes 
is not defined.
4.7 M&E capacity-strengthening 
‘best’ practice 
The findings on M&E capacity strengthening in 
Africa show that it is unsystematic, chaotic and is 
largely focused on developing individual skills. The 
absence of well-planned capacity-strengthening 
activities and evaluation of these activities makes 
it difficult to identify best practices in M&E capacity 
strengthening. It is also pertinent to mention that 
there is consensus amongst respondents from all 
the countries in the study that to achieve positive 
outcomes, it is essential that the design and imple-
mentation of approaches takes cognisance of the 
context in which capacity strengthening activities 
are to be implemented. Therefore, it can be argued 
that approaches to M&E capacity strengthening 
from other countries cannot be accepted as good 
practice without interrogating their sustainability 
and suitability in the local context. The context in 
which the M&E system operates determines the 
value attached to M&E and the extent to which 
it will influence the decision-making process by 
both state and non-state entities. Drawing on les-
sons learnt from this study and from existing lit -
erature on evaluation capacity strengthening and 
general capacity development in the African con-

text, principles of ‘good’ practices in M&E capacity 
strengthening are starting to emerge. These prin-
ciples are presented below.
The unsystematic, short-term, and piecemeal 
nature of M&E system capacity strengthening 
shows that it is not informed by situational/needs 
assessments at all the three levels of M&E sys-
tems. As a good practice, M&E system capacity 
strengthening must be preceded by a situational 
and needs assessment of the intended beneficia-
ries, it must be demand-driven, and must respond 
to specific needs. Without a situational analysis or 
needs assessment, M&E system capacity strength-
ening will remain supply-side driven. Good prac-
tice, in this case, demands that M&E CS be driven 
from within and although there is a greater like -
lihood of success if structuring interventions are 
based on demand, attention to the incentives 
behind the demand is essential.
The findings of this study have shown that M&E 
capacity-strengthening activities which go 
beyond individual skills and abilities are likely to 
yield better outcomes. There is a need to reassess 
the commonly held belief that strengthening 
individual skills-sets and abilities automatically 
leads to significant improvements in institutional 
and system-level outcomes. The design for M&E 
system capacity-strengthening approaches must 
go beyond improving individual competencies or 
the identification of sector skills deficiencies to the 
linking of M&E capacity-strengthening activities to 
institutions’ performance gaps. 
A novel approach to CS is the use of change 
agents (seconding M&E staff ) within institu-
tions to change M&E organisational culture and 
this approach has sometimes been adopted to 
strengthen M&E systems. The effectiveness of this 
technical assistance depends on two issues. Firstly, 
the change agent must wield enough power to 
change the organisational culture (Benn, Edwards 
and Williams, 2014), both M&E practice and the use 
of M&E products in decision making. The second 
issue is that, for sustainability, there is a need to 
consider the role of the change agent beyond that 
of providing technical assistance. 
Capacity-strengthening approaches which focus 
on individuals should be reinforced by the pro -
vision of the requisite tools and enabling envi-
ronment and should utilise context-appropriate 
approaches which enable the capacitated indi-
viduals to practice what they have learnt. Training 
should not be regarded as an end in itself but 
should mark the beginning of an individual’s M&E 
capacity-strengthening proficiency. Individuals 
should be long-term catalysts for institutional 
strengthening by facilitating improvements in 
institutional behaviour and culture which will 
strengthen the M&E system. To achieve this, 
the curricula for training interventions must be 
adapted to the local context and must go beyond 
classroom training and include implementation of 
what is learnt through post-training follow-up.
Finally, capacity-strengthening interventions are 
rarely evaluated. Capacity-building plans should 
include an M&E component to monitor and eval-
uate not only the outputs but also the outcomes 
to understand whether the interventions change 
behaviour and performance at individual and insti-
tutional levels. Evaluation of capacity-strength-
ening activities enables individuals to learn from 
experience and to adapt the interventions to meet 
local needs.

T
he recommendations are targeted at both 
national institutions and organisations funding 
M&E capacity development in the eight selected 
countries. The success of the suggested recom-
mendations depends on the creation of effective 
synergies between state and non-state sectors and 
the recognition at policy level that such networks 
and synergies are relevant when seeking a holistic 
solution to M&E capacity challenges. When imple -
menting these recommendations, it is important 
to incorporate a sufficient degree of flexibility and 
scope to enable adaptation to the specific country 
context.
Recommendation 1 – Know your 
capacity needs and be systematic
Capacity-strengthening funding initiatives for 
countries and organisations must prioritise coun-
try-level M&E capacity needs assessments in order 
to determine the existing capacity at the time of 
the assessment as this affects the overall practice 
of M&E within the country. The follow-up step is 
to develop a country-specific capacity develop -
ment plan which provides details on the neces-
sary capacity improvements or makes recommen-
dations on new types of capacity which may be 
required. It is also important to develop measure -
ment tools for assessing the impact, effective -
ness, and merit of M&E capacity-strengthening 
approaches. Key to the implementation of the plan 
is a robust knowledge management system where 
state and non-state institutions mine knowledge/
evidence to enable productive reflection on what 
is working, not working, for whom, and under 
what circumstances.
Recommendation 2 – Improve the 
strengthening of capacity at all 
levels – individual, institutional and 
country 
Stakeholders who fund or implement capaci-
ty-strengthening initiatives must focus on the M&E 
system as a whole and strengthen all capacity 
levels – individual, institutional and country. The 
focus should not be limited to the monitoring of 
micro-level technical skills and abilities but should 
take a broader view and include the strengthening 
of macro-level capacity and evaluation skills. 
Recommendation 3 – Context matters 
Countries are not homogenous and M&E capacity 
depends largely on the contextual factors/nuances 
prevalent in each organisation and country. Indi-
viduals or stakeholders responsible for the design 
of M&E capacity-strengthening approaches should 
devise context-specific approaches which are 
acceptable to the recipients of such interventions 
and permit them to adapt easily and sustain the 
capacity they have gained. 
Recommendation 4 – Extend capacity 
strengthening to decision-makers 
and create an enabling environment 
The lack of capacity-strengthening approaches 
which create an enabling environment and 
develop the capacities of decision-makers cre -
ates obstacles for the development of a culture 
of evaluation and the use of M&E information and 
evidence within organisations. To optimise pro -
gramme effectiveness, those who are funding, 
designing, and implementing capacity-strength-
ening initiatives must extend their focus to include 
these aspects.
Recommendation 5 – Create 
synergies and networks
The state and other development partners are 
implementing development interventions which 
address the same or similar development chal-
lenges in various entities but fail to consider that 
these entities may have significantly different M&E 
capacities. It is recommended that synergies be 
developed between state and non-state sectors 
to eliminate the existing M&E capacity silos and 
to create opportunities for mutual learning and 
sharing to determine what strategy works in their 
particular country. The state should be leading the 
development of these synergies.

CONCLUSION 
 
This study affirmed the importance of strengthening M&E system capacity in Anglophone Africa, given the 
key role of effective M&E systems in enabling countries to achieve their development goals. A clear under -
standing of country context, the conducting of M&E system capacity assessments, and the development of 
capacity-strengthening plans are all vitally important for the strengthening of country M&E systems. Further 
research is needed to fully understand the various approaches to country M&E system capacity strength-
ening, and how the design and training curricula can be adapted to specific country needs and contexts.
