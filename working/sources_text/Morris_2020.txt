Experiential learning—a systematic review and revision of Kolb’s model 
Abstract 
Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning cycle is perhaps  the most scholarly influential and  cited 
model regarding  experiential  learning  theory.  However,  a  key  issue  in  interpreting  Kolb’s 
model concerns a lack of clarity regarding what constitutes a concrete experience, exactly. A 
systematic literature review was conducted in order to examine: what constitutes a concrete 
experience and  what  is  the  nature  of  treatment  of a  concrete  experience  in  experiential 
learning? The analysis  revealed  five  themes:  learners  are  involved,  active,  participants; 
knowledge is situated  in place and time; learners are exposed to novel experiences, which 
involves risk; learning demands inquiry to specific real-world problems; and critical reflection 
acts as a mediator of meaningful learning. Accordingly, a revision to Kolb’s model is proposed: 
experiential learning  consists  of contextually rich  concrete  experience,  critical  reflective 
observation, c
ontextual-specific abstract  conceptualization,  and  pragmatic active 
experimentation. Further empirical studies are required to test the model proposed.

1. Introduction
What is fascinating about learning is that it cannot occur without experience. Imagine trying 
to learn to tie shoelaces without having practical experience of having hands on laces. On 
the other hand, try to forget your knowledge of how to ride a bike. Perhaps most notably, 
John Dewey (1938/1963) proposed that although not all experiences are equally educative, 
“all genuine education comes about through experience” (p. 25). 
Experiential learning takes a fundamentally different view of the learning process in 
comparison to behavioral learning theory. It places life experience as a central and necessary 
part of the learning process, where “knowledge is created through the transformation of 
experience” (Kolb, 2015, p. 49). However, relatively little empirical research has been 
conducted on experiential learning (Bergsteiner, Avery, & Neumann, 2010; Jarvis, 2012).  
Nonetheless, according to Kolb (2015), over the past twenty years research on 
experiential learning theory has more than quadrupled in many fields such as management, 
education, information science, psychology, medicine, nursing, accounting, and law; this 
includes a renewed interest in and attention to employing experiential learning theory in 
formal educational settings, especially in Higher Education. Thus, furthering our 
understanding of the concept of experiential learning, and how to facilitate it, is an 
important area for research, especially given the limitations of experiential learning theory 
highlighted in the following section.
<<<PAGE=5>>>
2. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle
Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning cycle remains the most widely influential and cited model, 
or “clearest expression”, of experiential learning theory (Seaman, Brown, & Quay, 2017, p. 
3). Kolb theorized that, 
Learners, if they are to be effective, need four different kinds of abilities—concrete 
experience abilities (CE), reflective observation abilities (RO), abstract 
conceptualization abilities (AC) and active experimentation (AE) abilities. That is, they 
must be able to involve themselves fully, openly, and without bias in new experiences 
(CE). They must be able to reflect on and observe their experiences from many 
perspectives (RO). They must be able to create concepts that integrate their 
observations into logically sound theories (AC), and they must be able to use these 
theories to make decisions and solve problems (AE). (1984, p. 30) 
More than thirty years onwards, Kolb (2015) defended his theoretical position against a 
multitude of critiques (e.g., Bergsteiner et al., 2010, 2014; Jarvis, 2012; Miettinen, 2000; 
Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015) that the experiential learning process consists of, 
a four-stage cycle involving four adaptive learning modes (p. 66)… [where] Learning 
arises from the resolution of creative tension among these four learning modes. This 
process is portrayed as an idealized learning spiral where the learner ‘touches all the 
bases’—experiencing (CE), reflecting (RO), thinking (AC), and acting (AE)—in a
<<<PAGE=6>>>
recursive process that is sensitive to the learning situation and what is being learned. 
(p. 51) 
Kolb acknowledged that he discovered or “noticed the dimensions” (Kolb, 2015, p. 
56) of the theory in the works of prominent twentieth-century scholars Kurt Lewin, John 
Dewey, and Jean Piaget, and attempted to “integrate the common themes in their work into 
a systematic framework that can address twenty-first century problems of learning and 
education” (2015, p. xvii). Intertwined with experiential learning theory is the concept of 
learning styles (outside the scope of the present paper; refer to Kolb & Kolb, 2013 for review 
(Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 for critique)).  
A damming critique of experiential learning theory is that it lacks sound theoretical 
and empirical foundations (cf. Coffield, Moseley, Hall, & Ecclestone, 2004; Miettinen, 2000). 
In particular, Miettinen (2000) noted that Kolb’s interpretation of key works, upon which his 
model was assembled, fundamentally “gives a unilateral and erroneous picture” (p. 65) of 
the original theories.  
Miettinen also argued that Kolb’s work is eclectic. Consequently the phases of the 
learning cycle “do not connect to each other in any organic or necessary way” (p. 61).  
In addition, some scholars (e.g., Seaman, Brown, & Quay, 2017) proposed that Kolb’s 
model in its current form actually presents as a barrier to a clearer understanding and 
successful facilitation of experiential learning. Alternative models have been proposed (e.g., 
Bergsteiner et al., 2014; Miettinen, 2000; Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015). However, these 
alternative models also lack sound empirical foundations.
<<<PAGE=7>>>
Kolb’s model remains the principle and most influential model in experiential learning 
theory (Seaman, Brown, & Quay, 2017). Nevertheless, the lack of empirical foundation to the 
model remains a foremost concern.  
A key issue in interpreting the Kolb model, that remains unresolved, is the issue of 
interpretation of what is meant, exactly, by a “concrete experience”. In this regard, 
Bergsteiner, Avery, and Neumann (2010) describe Kolb’s typology as “highly muddled” (p. 
32). 
For example, Blenkinsop, Nolan, Hunt, Stonehouse, & Telford (2016) note that many 
educators will not consider activities such as reading a book or sitting listening to a 
traditional lecture a concrete experience or part of experiential learning, whereas some 
educators would. This confusion seems somewhat ironic given experience is, theoretically, 
the central and perhaps most salient feature of experiential learning theory. 
Further understanding in this regard may assist the successful facilitation of and 
contribute to scholarly work on the concept. To address this concern, the aim of the present 
study was to understand how educators interpret the meaning of a “concrete experience”. A 
systematic literature review of empirical studies on experiential education was conducted in 
a genuine attempt to examine, in experiential learning,    
Research Question 1: what constitutes a concrete experience? 
Research Question 2: what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience?
<<<PAGE=8>>>
3. Methodology
An inductive thematic analysis was conducted upon data collected through a systematic and 
targeted literature review.  
3.1. Data collection 
The systematic literature review was made on the premise that there is a tendency and 
nature of knowledge to develop and advance over time, especially in scholarly journals. A 
sample of 60 journal articles (summarized in Table 1) from a total of 1323 published journals 
in the targeted depository were analyzed in the present study. Data were drawn initially 
from the most recent up-to-date empirical literature on experiential learning (starting with 
advance online publications).  
The investigator reviewed the sample in a stepwise nature. Journal articles were 
drawn from the Journal of Experiential Education, with the premise that the editors and 
peer-reviewers are experts in the field of experiential learning and publish articles that are 
fitting with the concept. 
All articles were fully read by the investigator, who sought themes in the data. The 
investigator systematically drew on further research published in each preceding year of 
publication until themes were finalized and further data did not appear to significantly 
further the findings and conclusions drawn.

3.2. Data analysis 
Data analysis software MAXQDA10 (VERBI GmbH, 2011) was used to code and organise the 
data. The sixty journal articles were uploaded in PDF format into the software in order to 
begin the process of data coding and identifying themes. The analysis followed six phases 
suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006) and exampled by Morris (2018), which involves the 
investigator (1) familiarising themselves with the data (2) generating initial codes (3) 
searching for themes (4) reviewing themes (5) defining and naming themes, and (6) 
producing the report.  
Data familiarisation was made where the investigator began to read the articles in 
full and noted down initial ideas regarding possible themes and codes within the data. The 
analysis was inductive in that codes and themes were not predetermined, but defined and 
redefined during the analysis. Using the data analysis software, parts of sentences, whole 
sentences, and groups of sentences were assigned one or more code(s). During the analysis 
new codes were defined and the initial analysis revisited and data were recoded, where 
applicable. Themes were identified and redefined a number of times during the analysis. A 
thematic map was drawn (Figure 1) to assist the organisation of themes. 
After completion of the coding stage, the data software program was used to extract 
a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Professional Plus, 2016) data document with data 
extracts. At times, the data organisation was complicated by the overlapping of data into the 
themes identified at this stage of the analysis and the researcher took a “best-fit” approach 
to the classification of the data. The researcher made further notes about the data extracts, 
which assisted the process of finalising the themes presented in this report (refer to Figure
<<<PAGE=11>>>
1). Post hoc of data analysis, the themes were critically analysed against the dimensions of 
Kolb’s experiential learning model (cross-references shown in Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Thematic map 
4. Results
The results give a rich overview of the conceptualization of the experiential learning in 
accordance with the studies analysed. A notable observation when eyeballing Figure 1 
(summary of themes in data) is that learner responsibility was an underpinning theme of the 
concept. This should be considered by readers when interpreting the findings presented. 
Five themes were identified; three relating to research question 1, two relating to research 
question 2 and are discussed in detail in the forthcoming sections of this report, which is 
followed by a proposed revision to Kolb’s (1984) learning cycle.
<<<PAGE=12>>>
4.1. Research question 1: what constitutes a concrete experience? 
In experiential learning, learners are involved, active, engaged, participants in the learning 
process. Learner participation is central, were “learning by doing” is a founding concept 
(Munge, Thomas, & Heck, 2018). It is a “hands on”, task-oriented, process (Blair, 2016; 
Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2017), which is based on direct experience (Blair, 2016; Seaman, 
Brown, & Quay, 2017) that necessitates that learners are active in the process (Fűz, 2018; 
Munge, Thomas, & Heck, 2018).  
Learners are placed physically, often in collaboration with others, in rich contextual learning 
environments that represent in the moment, uncontrived, experience (Karoff, Tucker, Alvarez, & Kovacs, 
2017). Learners assume full or collaborative responsibility for the learning process (cf. Hou & Pereira, 
2017). Physical contact seems important in the process (Fűz, 2018). Jordan, Gagnon, Anderson, and 
Pilcher (2018) explain that students are engaged socially, intellectually, and physically, which supports the 
embodied nature of experiential learning. 
Coker, Heiser, Taylor, and Book (2017) highlight that the process of experiential learning can 
demand a significant amount of time and effort. They refer to two dimensions, breadth and depth, which 
provide unique benefits: depth (time invested) is perhaps important for higher order thinking. Whereas, 
breadth (different types of experiences) is essential for fostering softer skills such as social competence. 
Knowledge is situated in context: emphasising place and time. Experiential learning 
occurs in a specified place (Smith & Segbers, 2018), in which interactions and contact with 
people are key (Harper, 2018). Pipitone (2018) conceptualizes place, which has both 
geographical and conceptual aspects (cf. Harper, 2018), as “landscapes full of sociocultural 
and historical meanings to be engaged with” (p. 59).  
Engagement with place is imperative in modulating participants to think more deeply 
and critically about the societal norms and power structures that surround them (Deringer,
<<<PAGE=13>>>
2017), providing a broader life experience (Ribbe Jr, Cyrus, & Langan, 2016). Pipitone and 
Raghavan (2017) highlight the importance of “social interactions, engagement with local 
rhythms and histories, and intentional narrative activities” (p. 264) in grasping the nature of 
the experience.  
Moreover, Smith, and Segbers (2018) explain that students learn from and learn how 
to live with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, which can assist learners to 
appreciate transculturality. This “attends to the way in which humanity has moved about the 
globe with single cultures now intertwined” (Smith & Segbers, 2018, p. 77).  
Community engagement is central to the process (Deringer, 2017), where learners 
themselves are central to the context (cf. Burns, & Danyluk, 2017). Blair (2016) identifies 
that the nature of knowledge construction is a social process (highlighting the works of 
Dewey, Piaget, and Vygotsky).  
Furthermore, Fifolt, Morgan, and Burgess (2017) discuss the role of experiential 
learning in bringing a community together. This is particularly evident in service learning (cf. 
Bennett, Sunderland, Bartleet, & Power, 2016). Pipitone (2018) discuss that to consider the 
learning space or place associated is to consider the sociocultural and sociospatial aspects of 
learning. 
Blair (2016) refers to the work of Roberts (2012) to identify that experience is also 
bound in time as well as place. In this regard, appreciation of historical aspects of knowledge 
may necessitate a triangulation of learning means, which could include for example 
historical artefacts and videos of the historical occasion. Dorfsman and Horenczyk (2017) 
example that “educational museums are composed of objects, documents, and narratives 
that together create a learning experience” (p. 1).
<<<PAGE=14>>>
Learning involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, challenging, 
experiences. Learners must respond to and accept challenge and behave with spontaneity to 
new, novel, learning place or space that involves unpredictability and experimentation 
(Davidson, Ewert, & Chang, 2016; Fűz, 2018; Karoff, Tucker, Alvarez, & Kovacs, 2017; 
Whittington, Garst, Gagnon, & Baughman, 2017).  
Isaak, Devine, Gervich, and Gottschall (2018) point out that risk and uncertainty is 
inevitable in engagement with the real world. Experiences are unique, thus learners are 
unlikely to experience a uniform experience again (Asfeldt & Beames, 2017).  
In addition, experiential learning is more often than not a collaborative process. 
Gibbons, Ebbeck, Gruno, and Battey (2018) provide examples of collaborative challenges: 
balancing a group on a small object or group negotiation of a challenging obstacle course. 
Karoff, Tucker, Alvarez, and Kovacs (2017) discuss that for such novel experiences learners 
do not have a “script”, which promotes task difficulty. In this regard, support and trust from 
co-actors in the learning process seems essential (cf. Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2017). 
Moreover, the educator inevitably plays a very important role in facilitating the 
process, such as assisting learners to remain open to trying novel solutions to problems, 
encouraging tenacious attitudes, and promoting the effectiveness of communication skills 
(Isaak, Devine, Gervich, & Gottschall, 2018).  
Additionally, the process is often progressive in difficulty. Educators gradually 
increase the difficulty of the intellectual, social/emotional, and physical challenge (Gibbons, 
Ebbeck, Gruno, & Battey, 2018).
<<<PAGE=15>>>
4.2. Research question 2: what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience? 
Critical reflection is imperative in the process, which may act as a mediator of meaning 
making. The complex nature of problem solving involved with experiential learning demands 
higher order thinking (Collins, Sibthorp, & Gookin, 2016). It is not surprising therefore, that 
experiential learning fosters critical thinking skills (cf. James & Williams, 2017; Scogin, 
Kruger, Jekkals, & Steinfeldt, 2017).  
Reflection and analysis, which is often undertaken both alone (e.g., quiet time for 
journaling, Harper, 2018) and in collaboration with others, are two central features of the 
experiential learning process (Fede, Gorman, & Cimini, 2018; Isaak, Devine, Gervich, & 
Gottschall, 2018).  
In reference to the works of Dewey (1916; 1938/1963), Asfeldt, Hvenegaard, and 
Purc-Stephenson (2017) discuss that reflection plays a central role in the learning process 
and is vital for making meaning of experience (cf. Deringer, 2017). In this regard, scholars 
generally position with a constructivist stance toward meaning making (e.g., Dorfsman & 
Horenczyk, 2017; Grimwood, Gordon, & Stevens, 2017; Isaak, Devine, Gervich, & Gottschall, 
2018).  
Dialogue in collaboration with others, such as with the instructor and peers, allows 
further (double loop) deeper critical reflection (Asfeldt, Hvenegaard, & Purc-Stephenson, 
2017; Collins, Sibthorp, & Gookin, 2016). This often demands that learners critically reflect 
upon their previously uncritically assimilated abstract conceptualizations, where learner self-
awareness is brought about and new or revised understanding is construed (cf. Hou & 
Pereira, 2017).
<<<PAGE=16>>>
Consequently, experiential learning is often an emotionally intense experience, as 
metacognitive awareness of “self” is brought about. Larsen (2017) concludes that 
experiential learning is a “highly charged, emotional experience” (p. 279).  
Learning is purposeful and demands learners to take responsibility to act 
pragmatically to find solutions, through an inquiry process, to specific real-world problems. 
Learners have clear and purposeful roles and responsibilities in the learning process (Bialka 
& Havlik, 2016; Fifolt, Morgan, & Burgess, 2017).  
Learning is problem-based, often project-based (Scogin, Kruger, Jekkals, & Steinfeldt, 
2017). Thus, utilises inquiry-driven learning methodologies (Munge, Thomas, & Heck, 2018). 
Terms associated with experiential learning include, inquiry-based learning, student-directed 
learning, active learning, problem-based learning, service-learning, and project-based 
learning (Blair, 2016; Breunig, 2017). 
Furthermore, in reference to the definition of experiential learning given by the 
Association for Experiential Learning (2017), Fede, Gorman, & Cimini, (2018) point out that a 
key feature is that students are responsible for decision making throughout the process. This 
demands initiative and stimulates learner intellectual and emotional engagement.  
Thus, there is emphasis on learner choice, which Isaak, Devine, Gervich, and 
Gottschall (2018) identify as the sine qua non of experiential learning. In sum, learners are 
offered autonomy and are empowered to make decisions (Barron, Khosa, & Jones-Bitton, 
2017; Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2017). 
Learners may negotiate solutions through creative means, the outcome of which 
cannot be predicted at the start of the learning process. Learners often complete problem-
solving activities in small teams. Gibbons, Ebbeck, Gruno, and Battey (2018) example that
<<<PAGE=17>>>
“Typically, participants work in groups of six to eight on physically challenging tasks that 
require elements of communication, cooperation, trust, and risk” (p. 3).  Isaak, Devine, 
Gervich, and Gottschall (2018) discuss a “sense of connection” (p. 34) as learners work 
collaboratively. 
Learner communication is essential for success of the process (Gibbons, Ebbeck, 
Gruno, & Battey, 2018), as students learn with and from each other (Murphy, Wilson, & 
Greenberg, 2017), pondering solutions through dialogue (Glowacki-Dudka et al., 2017). 
Consequently, relationships tend to develop through the process (Fifolt, Morgan, & Burgess, 
2017).  
Solutions to problems inherently stipulates creative ideas and creative solutions. 
Thus demanding learners to think creatively (Collins, Sibthorp, & Gookin, 2016; Isaak, 
Devine, Gervich, & Gottschall, 2018; Jordan, Gagnon, Anderson, & Pilcher, 2018; Scogin, 
Kruger, Jekkals, & Steinfeldt, 2017).  
In particular, Collins, Sibthorp, and Gookin (2016) point out that the process involves 
the solving of ill-structured problems, which is positioned as a critical competency in 
contemporary complex societies. They identify three important aspects: creativity, tolerance 
for novelty, and cognitive flexibility, in which adaptability is a central feature, which enables 
the bridging between theory and practice (Barnes, 2016).  
4.3 Revision to Kolb’s model 
The aim of the present study was to understand how educators interpret the meaning of a 
“concrete experience”. In the studies examined, concrete experience represented highly
<<<PAGE=18>>>
contextualised, primary, experience that involves hands on learner experience in 
uncontrived real-world situations. 
This is contrary to Kolb’s (1984, 2015) own conceptualization that experiential 
learning refers to “the individual learning process that applied in all situations and arenas in 
life, a holistic process of learning” (2015, p. xx). This finding represents a clear and important 
difference in conceptualization of what constitutes a concrete experience and seemingly 
warrants a revision to Kolb’s learning cycle (Figure 2).  
The present paper did however provide support for four dimensions of experiential 
learning, as per Kolb’s model (1984). The five themes identified in the analysis coupled 
closely with Kolb’ four dimensions (refer to figure 1), with however some very subtle, but 
significant differences, which are summarised in Figure 2. These seemingly very important 
differences are explained further in the following sections. 
As noted in the methodology section of the present report, the data organisation was 
complicated by the overlapping of the data into the themes identified. In this regard, 
themes, which are represented in the proposed model (Figure 2), were clearly very 
organically adjoined, which addresses Miettinen’s (2000) concern of Kolb’s model that its 
dimensions do not couple in a very organic or necessary way. 
Moreover, the proposed model takes into account graphical syntax issues highlighted 
by Bergsteiner, Avery, and Neumann (2010) that: (1) in accepted modelling practice time-
lines should represent activities; and, (2) simplification of the model can be achieved by 
removing the horizontal and vertical bidirectional arrows on Kolb’s model, which merely 
highlights orthogonal bi-polar relationships between active experimentation and reflective
<<<PAGE=19>>>
observation, and concrete experience and abstract conceptualization (Figure 2). The 
proposed changes to the Kolb model are detailed in the following sections.

4.3.1. Concrete experience 
In the studies examined in the present report, learners were involved, active, engaged, 
participants in the learning process. Learners were placed physically, often in collaboration 
with others, in contextually rich learning environments that represented in the moment, 
uncontrived, “hands on”, real-world primary concrete experiences (e.g, Grimwood, Gordon, 
& Stevens, 2017; Larsen, 2017; Schary & Waldron, 2017).  
The idea of a “contextually rich” concrete experience (refer to Figure 2) actually falls 
against Kolb’s own conceptualization of experiential learning theory, who rather viewed
<<<PAGE=20>>>
concrete experience as experiences that occur in “all situations and arenas in life” (Kolb, 
2015, p. xx) that come through the sensory cortex (Kolb & Kolb, 2013). 
An important difference concerning the interpretation of what is considered a 
concrete experience in experiential learning theory is highlighted in one theme in the data of 
the present report: that knowledge is situated in context: emphasising place (including 
community, cultural, societal, and social aspects) and time (present or historical).  
A key aspect of the learning process concerns learners learning to appreciate that 
knowledge is situated in context: fluid across time and place. Again the need for learning to 
be situated in context was not stipulated in Kolb’s conceptualization of experiential learning 
(1984, 2015).  
However, the present research report found that, rather, experiential learning is 
conceptualized by educators and scholars as a process in which learners are immersed in 
learning experiences that contain the fullest contextual information possible, in which the 
experiential learning process takes place.  
In this regard, Jarvis (2012), in particular, voiced a clear critique of Kolb’s model: that 
it does not take into consideration the social context of learning. Again, the studies 
examined in the present paper highlighted that the social context of learning has a central 
place in experiential learning theory.  
For example, in examining experiential learning from a socio-spatial perspective, 
Pipitone and Raghavan (2017) identified meaning making as both a “participatory and 
collaborative process mediated through the body and embedded within social, spatial, and 
temporal realities” (p. 265) and it is through our bodies senses that we are able to 
experience place.
<<<PAGE=21>>>
Embodiment is a central consequence of immersing learners physically in the 
learning space. This is a key area for further research, which is discussed in more detail in the 
conclusions of the present report.  
4.3.2. Reflective observation 
Kolb (1984, 2015) did not stress the need for “critical” reflection in his conceptualization of 
experiential learning: he did not differentiate between the requirement for critical or non-
critical reflection during the learning process.  
However, it was clear in the present study that the solving of problems in context 
stipulates the need for critical reflection. Indeed, some authors (e.g., Harper, 2018) 
acknowledged that their course of experiential learning was informed by critical theory 
(Brookfield, 2001; Mezirow, 1981). 
In this regard, the studies analyzed in the present report highlighted that critical 
reflective observation is essential in the process (Figure 2), which acts as a mediator of 
meaning making. In the process, learners must act in an investigator-like manner and test 
the fittingness of new or pre-existing abstract conceptualizations against the present 
moment real-world experience (cf. Barron, Khosa, & Jones-Bitton, 2017).  
That is, in order to effectively solve problems situated in context that are posed 
during the learning process, considering the details of the conditions of the context seems 
imperative because solutions to problems are inherently context specific (cf. Langer, 2017). 
In the studies examined in the present paper, problems were authentic, but also generally 
open-ended (Scogin, Kruger, Jekkals, & Steinfeldt, 2017), with a purposeful aim (Breunig, 
2017), where there was a need for learners to be comfortable with ambiguity and 
uncertainty (Ricke, 2018).
<<<PAGE=22>>>
This may be understood further in terms of the Socratic concept that learners may 
approach the learning situation with a stance that all knowledge is provisional: learners 
appreciate that they do not yet “know” and that solutions to problems in a real-world 
context are context specific (cf. Scott, 2018). Through experiential learning, learners may 
begin to appreciate the fluidity of contextual-conditions across place and time and become 
comfortable with change and uncertainty (cf. Langer, 2017). 
Indeed, in remodelling Dewey’s theory on experience and reflective thought and 
action, Miettinin (2000) interprets Dewey’s ideas in a different way to Kolb: depicting a 
process of learning that includes defining the problem and studying the conditions of the 
problem situation in order to formulate a working hypothesis. The model presented by 
Miettinin (2000) is seemingly complementary to the model proposed in the present paper 
and may, in addition, assist readers to understand the meaning of experiential learning 
theory. 
4.3.3. Abstract conceptualization 
Resultant from critical reflection on contextually rich concrete experience, the present 
model proposes that abstract conceptualizations may construe critically, that is, contextual-
specific (Figure 2).  
Again, Kolb (1984, 2015) did not make the distinction between the formation of 
uncritically or critically assimilated abstract conceptualizations. Conversely, the proposed 
model predicts that in order for the model to operate as a spiral, with increasing complexity 
as humans develop and mature, contextual-specific abstract conceptualizations are 
mandatory.
<<<PAGE=23>>>
A key aspect of this concerns learners becoming to appreciate that the conditions of 
the context may change across time and place and therefore all knowledge is provisional and 
needs testing in context. This could be conceptualized as a “working hypothesis” (as per 
Dewey’s ideas, described in Miettinin, 2000), which when passed through active 
experimentation in new concrete experiences they become, potentially, higher order 
concepts.  
The importance of appreciating that abstract conceptualizations construe as 
contextual-specific in experiential learning theory, which are critically assimilated, rather 
than contextual-indifferent, which are uncritically assimilated, is found in critical theory. 
Mezirow’s (1978, 1981, 1991) work highlights that when abstract conceptualizations are 
uncritically assimilated, we get “caught in our own history and are reliving it” (1978. p. 101; 
readers are encouraged to read further in this regard: Mezirow, 1991). This form of learning 
may actually limit a person’s growth potential toward becoming the person they could be 
(Arnold, 2017). 
In this regard, it is possible to plot a very different alternative learning cycle which 
involves (1) contextually-poor experience (2) uncritical reflective observation (3) contextual-
indifferent abstract conceptualization and (4) reinforcing/repeating active experimentation. 
Rather than a spiral this cycle would represent a circle, where actions are repeated and 
would, rather, complement behaviourist epistemology (cf. Murtonen, Gruber, & Lehtinen, 
2017) 
Indeed, it seems important to point out that experiential learning theory does not 
capture all forms of human learning; and probably no learning model will ever do so 
(Merriam, Caffarella, & Baumgartner, 2007).
<<<PAGE=24>>>
4.3.4. Active experimentation 
A key consequence of contextual-specific abstract conceptualizations is that they may enable 
learners to act pragmatically—to base their actions on their concrete experiences—in active 
experimentation with an encounter with a new concrete experience. In other words, this 
involves testing the fittingness of abstract conceptualizations formulated against new 
concrete experiences. 
Indeed, Roberts (2018) explains that a central tenet of experiential learning is found 
in the etymology of the word “experience”, which means “to test”, or “to risk” in Latin. In 
this regard, the process integrally involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, 
challenging, experiences. Learners must respond to, accept the challenge of, and behave 
with spontaneity to unpredictability that is inherent in the process. 
It should be considered that experiential learning is a process that deliberately places 
learners out of their comfort zones and, consequently, learners may become to appreciate 
that conditions change, sometimes very discretely, across time and place. Bailey, Johann, 
and Kang (2017) discuss that novelty and challenge, inherent in experiential learning, 
facilitates the process of inducing cognitive dissonance, as learners are challenged and 
“destabilized” (Glazier, Bolick, & Stutts, 2017; McGowan, 2016).  
It was clear in the analysis of the present paper that experiential learning is a process 
in which the concrete experiences “push the edges of what they [the learners] are familiar 
with” (Grimwood, Gordon, & Stevens, 2017, p. 9). Wainwright, Bingham, and Sicwebu (2017) 
discuss that immersion in a new place or space is one aspect that induces unfamiliarity. 
Kolb (1984) did acknowledge that active experimentation involves utilizing “theories 
to make decisions and solve problems” (p. 30). However, the model proposed in the present
<<<PAGE=25>>>
paper (Figure 2) makes the distinction, which was not made by Kolb (1984, 2015) that 
problems are contextual specific; therefore learners must appreciate the conditions in which 
the problem is situated in order to progress successfully, in a spiral, towards maturation and 
growth.  
5. Conclusions and future works
The present study provides a rich insight into how educators may conceptualize and 
facilitate the concept of experiential learning (refer to Figure 1 for a summary of themes). 
The findings warranted subtle but key adjustments to Kolb’s (1984, 2015) learning cycle 
(Figure 2), which are proposed as important considerations in further works on experiential 
learning theory.  
The revision to Kolb’s model proposed addresses many key critiques that: there is a 
lack of a sound empirical foundation to the model (e.g., Coffield, Moseley, Hall, & 
Ecclestone, 2004; Miettinen, 2000); the dimensions of the model do not connect to each 
other cohesively (e.g., Jarvis, 2012; Miettinen, 2000); and, the model typology fails clarity 
(Bergsteiner, Avery, & Neumann, 2010). 
There were some weaknesses of the present study. In particular, although the 
systematic nature of the study allowed a rich insight into how educators conceptualize and 
facilitate experiential learning in practice, most studies reviewed were limited to contexts 
that represented out-of-classroom experience.  
There may be multiple reasons for this, including that physically getting out of the 
classroom may assist to facilitate experiential learning. In this case, examining the factors 
that encourage or discourage out-of-classroom experience seems essential. Moreover, 
publication bias toward what is seen as experiential learning cannot be ruled out.
<<<PAGE=26>>>
Furthermore, many of the studies analyzed were conducted in North America. This is 
an important consideration because it is possible that there are differential 
conceptualizations of experiential learning in different contexts. Moreover, studying the 
factors that limit the facilitation of experiential learning was not an aim of the present study 
but is an important area for future research. 
Empirical testing of the proposed model is required, with potentially further 
revisions. Further studies may focus to address other critiques, which was not possible to in 
the present research; especially concerns of further modelling issues including whether the 
arrows should be bi-directional rather than unidirectional and whether concrete experience 
should be assigned as the starting point (cf. Jarvis, 2012). 
Furthermore, the complexity of the experiential learning process as depicted in 
Figure 1 should not be taken for granted. In this regard, further research could consider 
facilitation of experiential learning from an educator’s perspective, including how to train 
educator competence to facilitate experiential learning. 
Moreover, another key area for further research concerns how over time one’s 
learning spiral may become more complex, as a human develops and matures. In this regard, 
some scholars in the field of experiential learning have realized the need to appreciate 
complementary knowledge in the field of cognitive science (e.g., Schenck & Cruickshank, 
2015). 
Specifically, as identified in the present paper, embodiment that accompanies the 
experiential learning process appears a very important focus for further studies. 
Embodiment is a relatively underdeveloped area of research in educational and cognitive 
sciences (refer to Dijkerman & Lenggenhager, 2018; Kiefer & Trumpp, 2012, for reviews).
<<<PAGE=27>>>
Further studies should appreciate the recent findings from cognitive science that 
suggests that embodiment is an essential part of fostering a learner’s deep conceptual 
understanding. In particular, in a review article Kiefer and Trumpp (2012) discuss that over 
the last decades scholars wrongly assumed that when perceptual and motor systems coded 
knowledge in abstract-symbolic format, modality-specific sensory-motor information was 
lost. Rather, there is surmounting evidence that cognition is, vitally, based on reinstatements 
of sensing (using the relevant sensory organs), and/or feeling/acting (using the 
motor/proprioceptive organs) that accompanied the original experience. 
Thus, when learners are immersed, with their body, in a contextually rich experience, 
sensory-motor information becomes embodied in memory traces. It is thought that 
embodiment is essential for deep conceptual understanding and “for human cognition to 
develop at the highest level” (Kiefer & Trumpp, 2012, p. 19). In other words, potentially, to 
secure deep and meaningful learning the body cannot be decoupled from the mind during 
the process of learning. 
Indeed, in some educational contexts, such as in the vocational training of adults in 
the Netherlands, there has been a shift away from domain-specific knowledge taught in 
classrooms (mind work, no body work) exactly because it has been realized that such 
education does not foster a deep conceptual understanding of workplace knowledge and 
skills (cf. Biemans, Nieuwenhuis,  Mulder, & Wesselink, 2004; Descy & Tessaring 2002; 
Jossberger et al., 2010, 2017). 
In this regard, experiential learning may represent a particular form of learning that, 
in addition to the many other possible learner benefits gained from the process detailed in 
the present paper, has much potential to foster learners’ deep conceptual understanding.
<<<PAGE=28>>>
Thus, experiential learning is potentially applicable, but to date perhaps hugely unrealized, in 
a wide variety of educational contexts.
