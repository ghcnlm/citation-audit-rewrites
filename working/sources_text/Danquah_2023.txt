ABSTRACT
The bounds of the field of human resource development (HRD) 
have expanded beyond the individual and organizational levels of 
analysis to macro perspectives of HRD such as National, Regional, 
and Global HRD. In international development contexts, 
a comparable construct is used by development agencies and 
national governments to describe knowledge- and skill-building, 
i.e. capacity development (CD) or capacity building. To overcome 
the complexity and ambiguity involved in these two concepts in 
the extant literature, this conceptual article provides an overview of 
the conceptualization, objectives, levels, approaches, evaluation, 
and definitional analysis of CD. It then presents a comparison 
between the concepts of CD and HRD and highlights key similarities 
and differences. The paper concludes with implications for HRD 
research and practice as it relates to CD and a call for HRD scholars 
to support CD practice and policy through research and learn from 
CD practitioners in terms of understanding mechanisms for 
national, regional, and global development.

As the field of human resource development (HRD) began taking shape since Nadler 
( 1984 ) published the first Handbook of Human Resource Development , the scope and 
activities considered HRD have steadily expanded from early foci on individual and 
organizational performance improvement to ‘any process or activity’ that develops 
‘adults’ work-based knowledge, expertise, productivity and satisfaction’ (McLean and 
McLean 2001 , 322). Scholars and practitioners have stressed the need for organizations to 
invest in HRD to enhance the quality of human contributions and engagement and 
thereby gain a sustainable competitive advantage (Nolan and Garavan 2016 ; Torraco and 
Lundgren 2020 ). Prior to and throughout this time, a related field of practice emerged 
around the world that also contributed to the development adults’ knowledge, skills, 
abilities as well as the improvement or organizational effectiveness and societal develop -
ment. This was capacity development. What is capacity development and how, if at all, 
does it differ from the work of HRD? Does conflating the terms matter for HRD

scholarship and practice? Should the work of governments and international organiza -
tions in building the capacity of adults in emerging economies be considered HRD? 
These questions underpin this conceptual paper as we seek to disentangle these inter -
related concepts and offer clarity for HRD scholars and practitioners.
Though the concept of capacity development (CD) is relatively new in academic 
literature and lacks a robust theoretical foundation, it has long been a central focus in 
development and assistance programmes throughout the world after World War II. In 
international development projects often led by governments and international non- 
governmental organizations (NGOs), CD is regarded as the fundamental means to 
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Vallejo and When 2016 ). CD is 
often conceptualized at three comprehensive and reciprocally interactive levels: indivi -
dual, organizational, and environmental (i.e. the enabling environment) (Otoo, 
Agapitova, and Behrens 2009 ). It focuses on processes, approaches, methodologies, and 
plans that seek to improve performance at these levels through education, training, 
development, and learning. It is evident in the extant literature that HRD activities like 
training are central to nearly every CD initiative typically undertaken by donor agencies 
or NGOs in emerging economies (Pearson 2011 ). In addition to donor agencies, many 
organizations such as educational institutions and business conglomerates also run CD 
activities that look beyond training to a broader conception of HRD (Analoui and 
Danquah 2017 ). Hence, the concept of CD which is generally used within the literature 
on international development has relevance to the field of HRD. This relevance is found 
in a cursory review of HRD literature, which shows the study of capacity building (the 
activity of CD) in the Royal University of Phnom Penh (Brooks and Monirith 2010 ), the 
multi-level framework for CD for National HRD (Alagaraja and Githens ( 2016 ), and the 
use of CD in understanding Regional HRD in Southeast Asia (Crocco and Tkachenko 
2022 ).
Both CD and HRD are primarily concerned with learning as a way to bring about 
effectiveness and efficiency within different spheres of adult life. While HRD tends to 
focus on training and development in organizational contexts (Torraco and Lundgren 
2020 ), CD often considers broader applications, which include institutional building and 
development at the community and societal levels (Lusthaus, Adrien, and Perstinger 
1999 ). Thus, this article contends that CD encompasses HRD in that training as an HRD 
intervention is part of nearly all CD. On the other hand, the emerging discourse around 
National HRD implies that National HRD encompasses CD. Given the apparent overlap 
and ambiguity of these concepts, this study aims to enhance conceptual clarity between 
CD and HRD by exploring their definitions, theoretical underpinnings, and practical 
approaches.
The specific objectives guiding this inquiry are first to explore the concept and critical 
aspects of CD, and second to reflect on how CD fits within HRD research and practice. 
Conceptual papers ‘focus on a problem sharing new insights by connecting existing 
theories, working across disciplines, and providing in-depth insights that push the 
boundaries of a concept’ (Rocco et al. 2022 , p. 115). In the case of this paper, the 
contribution is in ‘connecting concepts’ i.e. CD and HRD, and ‘proposing 
a relationship between [these] concepts’ (Rocco et al. 2022 , pp. 118–119). Building on 
the authors’ experience in both HRD and CD in multiple contexts around the world as 
well as a review of the scholarly literature, this conceptual paper offers important

conceptual clarity missing from existing HRD research. This article is organized by first 
providing an overview of the conceptualization, objectives, levels, approaches, evalua -
tion, and definitional analysis of CD. It then presents a comparison between the concepts 
of CD and HRD and highlights key similarities and differences. The paper concludes with 
implications for HRD research and practice as it relates to CD.
Capacity development
Conceptualization of CD
Since the 1960s, conventional forms of development aid have been criticized due to the 
discrepancy between the substantial amount of investment – including the ample num -
ber of expatriates assigned to emerging economies for providing support – and the 
unimpressive outcomes attained in the form of sustainable development (Kühl 2009 ; 
Nair 2003 ). This has necessitated a growing sense that emerging economies must seek to 
capitalize more efficiently on development assistance to achieve desired results (Kühl 
2009 ). The success of development aid fundamentally depends on how well the recipients 
apply the aid to resolve their problems rather than treat the assistance as a credit, subsidy, 
or expert advice (Jaycox 1993 ). The concept of CD emerged in the 1980s in discussions 
between funding agencies, governments, and leaders in countries and communities 
receiving aid. These stakeholders agreed that without enhanced capability of individuals, 
groups, organizations, and society at large, efficient utilization of resources and economic 
development would be difficult to achieve (Lusthaus, Adrien, and Perstinger 1999 ).
The concept of CD gained prominence during the 1990s and has since become 
a central focus of development work (Kühl 2009 ; Lavergne and Saxby 2001 ). Initially, 
CD was promoted as an instrument to decrease poverty in emerging economies but has 
expanded beyond poverty reduction (Analoui and Danquah 2017 ; Merino and 
Carmenado 2012 ). In its current forms, CD draws on long-term experience to cultivate 
more methodical and multilingual approaches that are embedded in emerging economy 
ownership and concentrated on a host of viable outcomes (Bolger 2000 ). Now, CD has 
widespread adoption, and almost all the major national and transnational development 
assistance organizations have published policy papers related to its implementation and 
value (Kühl 2009 ).
The term ‘capacity’ denotes the capabilities that are necessary to assume responsibility 
for the improvement of an individual’s life and work environment. This includes job- 
specific skills, such as operating machinery, technical know-how, and manual skills, as 
well as generic skills, such as conceptual, diagnostic, problem-solving, decision-making, 
and communication skills (Kühl 2009 ). Developing capacity is needed at every level 
ranging from individual to supranational since it is a vital vehicle of performance 
improvement (Horton 2002 ). Thus, capacity in its varied forms is the outcome of CD 
processes (Analoui and Danquah 2017 ). Put another way, CD is the process by which 
individuals, groups, and organizations can enhance their capabilities to perform their 
roles and attain the anticipated outcomes over time (Morgan 1997 ).
From the definition of Morgan ( 1997 ), Horton ( 2002 ) discovered two vital aspects of 
CD: that it is mostly an internal growth and development process and that it should focus 
on lasting results or impact. It also has a scope ranging from individual to organizational 
248

development (Morgan 1997 ). The scope of CD, much like the scope of HRD, has expanded 
in recent years and many conceive of it as including societal or national development 
(CIDA 2000 ; OECD-DAC 2006 ; Otoo, Agapitova, and Behrens 2009 ; UNDP 2008 ; 
Wubneh 2003 ). This expansion of scope and focus on lasting results has come with the 
recognition that change and development happens within complex social systems and will 
not result in sustainable development if conducted in isolation (Kühl 2009 ).
Notably, the terms CD and capacity building are often used interchangeably and can 
be stretched to embrace many different activities, such as training and workshops 
(Horton 2002 ), organizational development (Harrison 1994 ), employee empowerment 
(Eade 1997 ; Fals-Borda and Rahman 1991 ), and institutional improvement (Picciotto 
and Wiesner 1998 ; UNDP 1998 ). Despite their overlapping use in development discourse 
(Analoui and Danquah 2017 ), they have different connotations in practice. The idea of 
capacity building refers to introducing new capacities in a population through activities 
that are cautiously planned and implemented by following a clear blueprint (Horton 
2002 ). On the other hand, CD is an approach that builds on the pre-existing knowledge 
and skills, driving a dynamic and flexible transformation process that is acknowledged by 
local actors. Thus, to conduct CD requires more investigation as well as learning (Horton 
1999 ). It can be viewed as an umbrella concept (Morgan 1998 ) under which several 
approaches to development support are included (Kühl 2009 ) to achieve certain objec -
tives, which are discussed in the next section.
Objectives of CD
Whether CD is manifested as a large-scale initiative or a targeted project (Lavergne and 
Saxby 2001 ), the overarching purpose of CD is to pursue development goals or long-term 
objectives and accelerate development systematically (Analoui and Danquah 2017 ). CD 
as an approach intends to achieve development goals such as the SDGs and millennium 
development goals (MDGs) which are articulated and agreed upon by international 
bodies like the United Nations (Analoui and Danquah 2017 ). Furthermore, CD empha -
sizes bridging development gaps that agencies recognize require action, such as inter -
ventions related to education, training, and organizational development (Analoui and 
Danquah 2017 ).
More precisely, the major objectives of CD are enhancing and utilizing abilities, skills, 
and resources more effectively; strengthening understanding and relationships among 
stakeholders; and addressing issues of values, attitudes, motivations, and conditions for 
supporting sustainable development (Bolger 2000 ). Put another way, Merino and 
Carmenado ( 2012 ) opined that CD as a strategy relates primarily to improving living 
standards or building new organizations with enhanced capacity to address and solve 
different socio-economic problems such as poverty. To achieve these objectives, capa -
cities are to be developed at three interdependent levels.
Levels of CD
CD is comprised of three comprehensive and reciprocally interactive levels which are 
individual, organizational, and enabling environment or system (Analoui and Danquah 
2017 ; Nair 2003 ; OECD-DAC 2006 ; UNDP 2008 ). Given the nature of social systems, 
HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL
 249
<<<PAGE=6>>>
these three levels of CD are interlinked in such a way that any guided advancement is 
possible only when all these levels are considered (Kühl 2009 ). If any intervention is 
undertaken at just one level, the consequences will dissipate, and hence sustainable 
development will be difficult to ensure. Thus, effective CD requires the simultaneous 
development of human resources, strengthening of the organization, and founding of 
supportive environmental conditions (Kühl 2009 ).
CD at the individual level
Conventionally, CD at the individual level focuses on training through which the 
knowledge, mindsets, and/or skills of an individual are enhanced (Brinkerhoff and 
Morgan 2010 ). Organizations and countries today are compelled to nurture their 
employees/citizens with required knowledge, skills, abilities, and other competencies 
so that they can function more efficiently (Analoui and Danquah 2017 ). This can be 
ensured through three measures i.e. education, training, and learning (Analoui 2007 ). 
The individual level refers to individuals from all walks of life, e.g. planners, accoun -
tants, engineers, farmers, etc. who are viewed as social or organizational actors (Bolger 
2000 ). The underlying perspective is that change at the individual level in terms of skills 
and abilities should be contemplated as a segment of a broader CD framework (Bolger 
2000 ).
CD at the organizational level
At the organizational level, CD mainly focuses on the improvement of the manage -
ment system as well as restructuring within the organization or reformation of the 
public sector which may be decentralization or modernization of civil service 
(Brinkerhoff and Morgan 2010 ). Though in this scenario Brinkerhoff and Morgan 
( 2010 ) mainly emphasized public sector reformation, the OECD-DAC ( 2006 ) argues 
that organizational level CD encompasses public, private, and even civil society 
organizations in terms of strategic management activities, operational capacity, 
human resources, financial resources, information resources, and infrastructure. In 
fact, every formal and informal institution should be taken into consideration in the 
process of capacity building and institutional strengthening as disregarding informal 
institutions might adversely lead to resistance, and consequently, endanger CD pro -
spects (Abdel-Malek, Leautier, and Straface 2011 ). At this level, the institutional 
development approach is incorporated (Kühl 2009 ) to allow organizations to operate 
and deliver their directions by having internal rules, regulations, and frameworks that 
enhance the capacity of individuals to work collectively in the path of attaining 
organizational objectives (UNDP 2008 ).
CD at the environmental level
The enabling external environment or system significantly influences the success of 
individual and organizational level CD interventions, and this realization consequently 
leads CD initiatives to address politics and policies (Brinkerhoff and Morgan 2010 ). For 
instance, strengthening civil society and budgeting for the poor are such upper-level CD 
initiatives that they are inextricably connected to individual-level CD efforts (Brinkerhoff 
and Morgan 2010 ). The type of approach being incorporated at the system level is called 
new institutionalism (Kühl 2009 ).

<<<PAGE=7>>>
The enabling environment supports the cycle by which the partner country is being 
empowered to enhance its CD with the financial and technical assistance primarily from 
donors (Analoui and Danquah 2017 ). It subsequently reinstates the concern and involve -
ment of both individuals and organizations (Analoui and Danquah 2017 ). However, both 
enablers and disablers subsist in the environment affecting CD initiatives of the recipient 
country. Thus, Abdel-Malek, Leautier, and Straface ( 2011 ) asserted that the desire and 
devotion of individual champions, combined with the incentives posed by enablers and 
restraints prevailing in the environment, will ascertain whether change and CD will 
indeed take place.
Approaches to CD
While a holistic view of CD necessitates all three levels discussed above, there are 
different approaches to CD which emphasize the different levels. Lusthaus, Adrien, and 
Perstinger ( 1999 ) provided a taxonomy of four specific approaches to CD which 
include the organizational approach, institutional approach, system approach, and 
participatory process approach. The first approach emphasizes building capacity at 
the single organization level. The second approach focuses on the rules and processes 
regulating the socio-economic and political institutions in society at large. The third 
approach accentuates the interdependencies among social actors as well as the necessity 
for fostering capacity building holistically. Finally, the participatory approach considers 
ownership and participation as elementary components of CD. While all approaches 
have merit, Analoui and Danquah ( 2017 ) stressed that adopting the participatory 
approach in CD programmes and projects increases chances of long-term progress. 
They also asserted that this approach should be developed into an empowering 
partnership so that all who are involved can have a higher sense of belonging 
(Analoui and Danquah 2017 ).
Evaluation of CD
Given the expectations of donors and funding agencies to produce measurable results, 
evaluation has always been a core component of CD and has evolved over time in three 
waves (Huyse et al. 2012 ). In the 1980s, the central focus of donors’ practice and 
discourse was not the financial or technical support to be provided for recipients’ CD 
(Huyse et al. 2012 ), and accordingly, the early endeavour regarding the evaluation of CD 
interventions was significantly influenced by the assessment procedures stemming from 
formal education and training (Horton et al. 2003 ). The various CD interventions were 
based on a fundamental assumption that education or training can positively change the 
performance level of individual employees and subsequently lead to a better-performing 
organization in a linear fashion (Huyse et al. 2012 ). This tunnel vision of how the change 
process occurs through almost a direct cause-and-effect relationship is followed by the 
corresponding evaluation practices, i.e. striving to track the consequences of education or 
training from the output to the impact level (Huyse et al. 2012 ). However, this evaluation 
approach was later criticized for having major limitations in real-life situations, given 
that there are many factors other than education or training that can deter learning and 
utilization of skills (Horton et al. 2003 ; Simister and Smith 2010 ).
HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL
 251
<<<PAGE=8>>>
The second wave of evaluation, known as the organizational and institutional wave, 
took place towards the end of the 1990s when new interventions emphasized the 
importance of organizational and institutional development (Huyse et al. 2012 ). 
Practitioners started applying several organizational capacity assessment (OCA) tools 
to plan, monitor and evaluate CD activities (Huyse et al. 2012 ). Initially, these tools 
mostly focused on harder aspects of capacity such as infrastructure and accounting and 
were consequently criticized for their incapability to capture the softer dimensions like 
organizational change (e.g. skill development), as well as the problems associated with the 
non-specific use of explicit categorization of capacity, and the problems with the accu -
mulation of contrast of scoring across the organizations (Huyse et al. 2012 ).
The limitations of the second wave gave rise to a third, more complex wave of 
evaluation. Over the years, stakeholders experienced frustrating outcomes of CD inter -
ventions (OECD-DAC 2006 ). During this third wave, particularly from 2005 to 2010, the 
complex nature of the CD process had been critically addressed in numerous studies and 
white papers (Baser and Morgan 2008 ; Boesen 2009 ; Ubels, Acquaye-Baddoo, and Fowler 
2010 ). The conventional evaluation approaches of previous waves tended only to capture 
a closed-system perspective of organizational and institutional change undermining the 
impact of internal and external variables on the aspect of CD as well as how it arises 
(Huyse et al. 2012 ). This third wave began to recognize the oversimplification of those 
waves and led to a more holistic form of evaluation.
The different insights that emerged during the last wave of evaluation (Eraut 2007 ; 
Reeler 2007 ) helped to develop a consensus concerning the building block of CD 
holistically (Baser and Morgan 2008 ; James and Haily 2007 ). The consensus was that 
the term capacity does not merely imply the ability to develop hard or technical skills, 
rather it also encompasses soft elements such as motivation, morale, flexibility, genuine -
ness, and the realization of a positive organizational culture (Baser and Morgan 2008 ; 
James and Haily 2007 ). It also regarded CD as a multifaceted, extensive, constant, and 
endogenous process that occurs inside the organization and hence cannot be controlled 
by external variables though actors residing outside can sometimes affect the pace and 
direction of change (Baser and Morgan 2008 ; James and Haily 2007 ). Thus, in terms of 
the evaluation of a CD programme, it can be inferred that both hard and soft elements are 
vital components of CD interventions.
Definitional analysis of CD
Synthesizing the definitions of CD (see Table 1 ) and their underlying themes, CD 
emerges as a complicated endogenous process that entails individuals, groups, organiza -
tions, society, and countries. Though this term is applicable broadly, it is mostly used by 
donors, international development agencies, planners, and strategists. The typical inter -
ventions that are undertaken to make the CD process a success are comparable to HRD 
measures which include education, training, and organizational development. This 
continuous learning process is centred on developing a competent workforce to ensure 
improved individual and collective performance with the aim of attaining long-term 
development goals in a sustained way. Though it involves making all the required hard 
and soft resources available and ensuring their proper utilization, specifically its focus is 
on the human aspect of the organization or society. Thus, the success of CD interventions 
252

largely relies on how efficiently people can learn and apply relevant knowledge and skills 
into practice. Given this focus on people, exploring the nature of HRD facilitates under -
standing of the relevance and relationship between CD and HRD, which is discussed in 
the subsequent section.
Connecting concepts: the link between CD and HRD
To connect the concepts of CD and HRD, it is important to see how their evolution as 
constructs moved them closer together over time. Take the emergence of CD. Though 
the general goals of development projects have always been similar in nature, i.e. 
alleviating poverty and enhancing quality of life (WRI 2008 ), the focus of these projects 
shifted from the 1950s to the 1970s (Horton et al. 2003 ; Lusthaus, Adrien, and 
Perstinger 1999 ). In the 1950s, development was more concentrated on concrete,

tangible aspects like financial and physical infrastructure to establish institutions (WRI 
2008 ). However, development agencies and governments soon realized that simply 
giving countries and communities financial resources and constructing infrastructure 
without providing training for people meant that their contributions would quickly 
fade away. Thus, in the 1970s, the focus shifted to more people-centric and intangible 
facets such as education and health care (Merino and Carmenado 2012 ) to strengthen 
those established institutions (WRI 2008 ). Soon after, the focus on formal education 
was replaced by an emphasis on short-term training (Merino and Carmenado 2012 ). 
Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, the central focus moved to macro considerations of the 
CD of national institutions (Merino and Carmenado 2012 ). The current ethos of CD 
focuses on building joint projects with shared ownership and processes as crucial 
elements that involve sustainability in their goals (Horton et al. 2003 ; Lusthaus, 
Adrien, and Perstinger 1999 ).
In the 21
st 
century, development agencies such as UNESCO ( 2010 ) began emphasizing 
HRD as the individual-level focus of CD activities, in particular training. Other organiza -
tions like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) spoke of Regional HRD 
policies and activities that related to building capacity of adult workers through training 
and development (Crocco and Tkachenko 2022 ; Crocco 2021 ). While early conceptua -
lizations of HRD were narrower, as the field developed, it broadened its scope beyond 
foci on training and development and moved to changes in the overall system of the 
organization centred on human resources (Swanson 1999 ). HRD also deals with devel -
oping the organization focusing on the attainment of both individual as well as institu -
tional goals (Chalofsky 1992 ; Marsick and Watkins 1994 ; McLagan and Suhadolnik 1989 ; 
Stewart and McGoldrick 1996 ; Swanson 1995 ; Watkins 1989 ). And now, with the 
emergence of National HRD (Alagaraja and Githens 2016 ; McLean 2014 ) and Regional 
HRD (Crocco and Tkachenko 2022 ; Tkachenko et al. 2022 ), there is even more overlap 
between the HRD and CD in terms of national and supranational development. Still, 
there are some important key differences and similarities in need of discussion (see 
Table 2 ).
As Analoui and Danquah ( 2017 ) demonstrate, in many ways CD is broader and more 
all-encompassing than HRD given that enhancing employees’ and even organization 
development are only two levels of CD. At the individual level, CD and HRD are virtually 
interchangeable given their alignment with seminal definitions like McLean and McLean 
( 2001 ) as harnessing or strengthening the skills and abilities of individual actors so that 
they can better contribute to the achievement of development objectives (Bolger 2000 ). 
At the organizational level, the inherent meaning of CD and HRD is also riddled with 
overlap given that an organization is nothing but a group of people working together in 
a structured and coordinated fashion to achieve a set of goals effectively and efficiently 
(Griffin 2017 ). Therefore, the capacity of the organization and that of its employees can 
be regarded as aligned. Lengnick-Hall, Beck, and Lengnick-Hall ( 2011 ) suggested that 
despite experiencing unfavourable, unstable, and uncertain circumstances, resilient 
organizations can thrive through practising strategic HRD activities and specifically 
creating competencies among key employees. When an organization faces severe 
shock, it can subsist and grow further by developing its capacity for resilience and this 
capacity aggregated at the organizational level refers to the capacity to develop human 
resources (Lengnick-Hall, Beck, and Lengnick-Hall 2011 ).

Table 2. Comparison of CD and HRD.
Component CD HRD Key Similarities Key Differences
Meaning CD is an organic process by which an 
individual, group, organization, society 
and broadly a nation can improve 
capacities to make the best utilization of 
resources available
HRD is a strategic learning and development 
process incorporating proactive and system- 
wide interventions by which individuals and 
organizations can improve their workplace 
effectiveness and efficiency
Focus on improving 
performance
HRD is primarily concerned with performance 
through an organization while CD more 
commonly is associated with performance 
through country’s/national development 
strategy
Users This term is used by international 
development agencies, donors, planners, 
strategists, and development 
practitioners
This term is largely used by HRD professionals 
within organizations and researchers across 
the HRM and HRD disciplines
Occasional overlap on 
international projects or 
partnerships between 
corporations and 
development agencies
CD practitioners are often trained in 
development studies or a content area of 
development such as healthcare whereas 
HRD practitioners are often trained through 
explicit HRD programs
Objective To accomplish long-term development 
goals in a sustainable way that align with 
international development frameworks
To foster employee learning as well as 
strengthen overall organizational strategy 
and system to improve performance and 
achieve both individual and organizational 
long-term goals
Achieving goals of host 
system
HRD typically achieves organizational 
development through organizational 
strategies while CD typically achieves 
sustainable development through country’s 
development strategies
Scope Involves three major levels encompassing 
individual, organizational and 
environmental or system level
Primarily at individual and organizational levels 
but recognition of systems theory and 
increasingly popular National and Regional 
HRD
Encompasses individual, 
organizational and 
systems
HRD occurs primarily at the organizational level 
whereas the scope of CD is primarily at the 
country level
Assumption Positive change in capacities is the key to 
achieving development goals
Change is inevitable, so it is better to focus is on 
performance improvement through learning 
and behavioural change to achieve or 
maintain competitive advantage
Change is a natural and 
unstoppable aspect of 
social reality
CD assumes societal change comes from 
interventions at individual, organizational, 
and societal levels whereas HRD is not as 
concerned with societal change unless it 
influences an organizations ability to 
accomplish its goals
Activities Workshops, training, education, 
organizational development, employee 
empowerment, institutional 
improvement, etc.
Education, training and development, coaching, 
mentoring, career development, and various 
organization development interventions
Training and learning 
activities
HRD tends to have a short-term lens while CD 
tends to focus more on long-term and 
sustained change
Focus Developing both hard resources as well as 
technical skills and soft or managerial 
skills that support a country’s 
institutional development
Developing human potential in every learning 
aspect as it is aligned with the values of the 
host system or organization.
Focuses on soft aspects of 
developing human skills, 
knowledge, abilities, 
mindsets, dispositions, 
etc.
CD can include so-called hard development 
such as financial resources, infrastructure, or 
technology

Component CD HRD Key Similarities Key Differences
Evaluation 
Approach
Measuring individual and organizational 
performance as well as human 
development metrics and national 
development
Evaluate employee learning and performance 
as well as organizational outcomes and 
return on investment
Oriented towards 
demonstrating results
CD includes metrics related to health, 
wellbeing, and equity that are less 
emphasized in most HRD contexts
Influence The external environment or system 
significantly influences the effectiveness 
of CD efforts, and CD seeks to change 
legal and cultural frameworks to suit 
other levels
HRD activities are affected by the state of the 
overall system or broader macro- 
environmental segments such as political, 
cultural, and economic forces and often do 
not seek to transform national systems
Recognition of external 
influences
CD activities are almost sponsored by 
development agencies and can include loans 
or other repayment methods whereas HRD 
activities are typically funded by the host 
system and influenced by organizational 
priorities and resource allocation

CD at the organizational level emphasizes developing management systems and 
broadly the institution or organization (Brinkerhoff and Morgan 2010 ; Kühl 2009 ). 
This emphasis is also a common objective within HRD as exemplified by Wilson 
( 2009 ) regarding people as the focal point of organization development (OD) and view -
ing the development and involvement of people as central to organizational CD. Ideally, 
practices like staffing, ethnic group integration, and HRD functions are positively 
correlated with an enhanced state of capacity and performance and are instrumental to 
decentralization and reformation (Berman 2015 ). Without having more capable and 
efficient performers it is not at all possible to satisfy development goals at any stage 
(Berman 2015 ) and hence individual development should be given the top priority. Thus, 
one key difference is in the objectives of CD and HRD. Whereas CD seeks to accomplish 
long-term development goals according to frameworks like the SDGs, HRD seeks to 
employ interventions related to the learning and performance goals of the host system (or 
individual actors) for either the short or long term (Wang et al. 2017 ). This means that 
while CD generally assumes positive change and is grounded in ethical frameworks such 
as human development (Sen 2000 ) or the capabilities approach (Nussbaum 2001 ), HRD 
is employed by individuals, groups, organizations, communities, nations, and regions to 
achieve the goals of those individuals and organizations, which are typically connected to 
competitive advantage in a free market economy.
With regard to the environmental level, CD interventions are affected by the external 
environment as well as the system (Brinkerhoff and Morgan 2010 ). Similarly, HRD is 
underpinned by systems thinking, and HRD practitioners must consider environmental 
factors to gain competitive advantage (Beer and Spector 1985 ; Gubbins and Garavan 
2009 ; Swanson 2001 ). To be successful, HRD professionals are now required to satisfy the 
existing demands of multiple stakeholders and predict their future demands (Garavan 
2007 ). They are expected to facilitate change in the process and systems as well as 
contribute to greater flexibility (Garavan 2007 ). Developing a global approach is increas -
ingly becoming an important responsibility for which they must make cautious decisions 
relating to policies and practices that may be local, regional, or even global (Garavan 
2007 ). That said, typically HRD works within national legal and cultural systems and 
does not often play a transformative role in those systems. For example, in international 
HRD (Garavan, McCarthy, and Carbery 2019 ) multinational corporations are influenced 
by the global HRD ecosystem but they work within those cultural and legal frameworks 
to achieve their organizational goals. This is in contrast to CD which has goals, for 
example women or ethnic group empowerment, that may include advocating for 
national policy change if there are laws in place blocking implementation. While busi -
nesses do lobby governments to adjust laws and policies in their favour, it does not occur 
to the same degree as the influence of international development agencies like the World 
Bank, UNESCO, and USAID.
Though development literature frequently praises the implications of HRD, limited 
studies focus on them in development in an inclusive manner (Berman 2015 ). Berman 
( 2015 ) emphasized the HRD activities and expertise in a development context and 
elaborated on their contributions to reinforcing the state institutions and strengthening 
performance in development backgrounds, which is the underlying perspective of the CD 
concept. Berman ( 2015 ) also claimed that unanticipated political support and corruption 
are the fundamental causes of poor governance processes and insignificant advancement 
HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL
 257
<<<PAGE=14>>>
of development goals. The solution to this problem, as he mentioned, is the distinctive 
HRD practices like training that can play a critical role in mitigating corruption (Berman 
2015 ).
However, as the term CD is mostly used by national and international development 
assistance organizations (Lusthaus, Adrien, and Perstinger 1999 ) who support local 
institutions in numerous ways such as developing financial, technical, business, and 
political skills, and by building human, social, and organizational capital (Baser and 
Morgan 2008 ; James and Haily 2007 ), HRD can be seen as a vital subset or a parallel set of 
processes in the overarching national development process (Lusthaus, Adrien, and 
Perstinger 1999 ). CD has a broader spectrum and hence Lavergne and Saxby ( 2001 ) 
notably stated that it not only involves everything that development agencies usually do, 
rather all development taking place in the society is in a sense fundamentally about CD. 
The term development is generic and refers to the capacity of a society to satisfy the 
demands of different stakeholders in a continuous manner based on whatever resources 
are available to it (Lavergne and Saxby 2001 ).
Implications and conclusion
Historically the concept of CD emerged when the conventional form of technical and 
financial support provided by international development agencies and donors failed to 
solve the development-related problems and achieve desired outcomes. Early CD prac -
tice revealed that merely making financial, physical, and informational resources avail -
able cannot resolve complex problems. Rather, it is more imperative in this regard to 
create a competent workforce that will be directly involved in utilizing these resources. It 
is evident that unless people have the right knowledge, skills, and abilities, the mere hard 
forms of aids such as money, infrastructure, or technology will not bring any lasting 
change and will either be ignored, underused, or abused. The concept of CD has evolved 
to focus on the same soft aspect that the HRD field is embedded in, which is the 
assumption that other resources make things possible , but it is the people who will 
make things happen . The concept of HRD is undeniably relevant to the central theme 
and aim of CD given that any long-term development goal can be sustainably attained if 
the sponsored organization, society and even country can develop the right talent pool 
through requisite HRD interventions.
This conceptual article demonstrates the increasing overlap of these concepts as CD 
expands to include training, wellbeing, and workplace skills and HRD widens to include 
national, regional, and global development. Moreover, it is noteworthy to mention that 
both concepts are based in the assumption and value that (a) what a person can do is 
more important than what a person owns and (b) that capability at the societal level 
necessarily relates to the capabilities of its individuals. This individual-level capability can 
be fostered through HRD activities like education, learning, training, and development 
that eventually facilitate performing the roles and responsibilities more efficiently and 
achieving long-term development objectives in a sustained manner. From a critical 
perspective, they must also foster ‘holistic, socially conscious economic development’ 
(Collins, Zarestky, and Tkachenko 2017 , 244).

This conceptual paper aimed to deal with the complexity and overlap involved in the 
conceptualization of CD and HRD. The main contribution of this study lies in synthesiz -
ing the literature on CD and discussing its relevance and connection with HRD through 
exploring and comparing these two concepts. Given that there is a lack of theoretical 
research related to CD as a result of its focus on program evaluation and national 
development, future research should take the theoretical and empirical grounding of 
HRD scholarship and build a research agenda that would bolster understanding of CD’s 
theoretical underpinnings and connection to national development. HRD scholars inter -
ested in macro perspectives of HRD such as National HRD, Regional HRD, and Global 
HRD, should consider the role that governments and international development agencies 
play in facilitating HRD. Future research could seek to further delineate these concepts 
through empirical research based on emerging economic contexts with an abundance of 
both forms of development. Additional studies could also conduct cross-case analyses of 
CD projects to see how HRD mechanisms are employed in those contexts and more 
precisely compare them with traditional HRD activities in high-income economies. CD 
and HRD practitioners will also benefit from this article in identifying the core focus of 
any development goals which are related to workforce development. The world is 
becoming increasingly interconnected, and interventions that seek to build capacity, 
promote learning, or foster development are necessarily tied to the systems (organiza -
tional, political, national, global) in which they are embedded. Thus, it is incumbent on 
HRD researchers to identify ways they can (a) support CD practitioners in terms of 
research design and theoretical contributions and (b) learn from CD in terms of facil -
itating National, Regional, and Global HRD.
