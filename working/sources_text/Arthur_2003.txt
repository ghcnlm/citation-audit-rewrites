The authors used meta-analytic procedures to examine the relationship between specified training design
and evaluation features and the effectiveness of training in organizations. Results of the meta-analysis
revealed training effectiveness sample-weighted meands of 0.60 (k /H1100515,N /H11005936) for reaction criteria,
0.63 (k /H11005234,N /H1100515,014) for learning criteria, 0.62 (k /H11005122,N /H1100515,627) for behavioral criteria, and
0.62 (k /H1100526,N /H110051,748) for results criteria. These results suggest a medium to large effect size for
organizational training. In addition, the training method used, the skill or task characteristic trained, and
the choice of evaluation criteria were related to the effectiveness of training programs. Limitations of the
study along with suggestions for future research are discussed.
The continued need for individual and organizational develop-
ment can be traced to numerous demands, including maintaining
superiority in the marketplace, enhancing employee skills and
knowledge, and increasing productivity. Training is one of the
most pervasive methods for enhancing the productivity of individ-
uals and communicating organizational goals to new personnel. In
2000, U.S. organizations with 100 or more employees budgeted to
spend $54 billion on formal training (“Industry Report,” 2000).
Given the importance and potential impact of training on organi-
zations and the costs associated with the development and imple-
mentation of training, it is important that both researchers and
practitioners have a better understanding of the relationship be-
tween design and evaluation features and the effectiveness of
training and development efforts.
Meta-analysis quantitatively aggregates the results of primary
studies to arrive at an overall conclusion or summary across these
studies. In addition, meta-analysis makes it possible to assess
relationships not investigated in the original primary studies.
These, among others (see Arthur, Bennett, & Huffcutt, 2001), are
some of the advantages of meta-analysis over narrative reviews.
Although there have been a multitude of meta-analyses in other
domains of industrial/organizational psychology (e.g., cognitive
ability, employment interviews, assessment centers, and
employment-related personality testing) that now allow research-
ers to make broad summary statements about observable effects
and relationships in these domains, summaries of the training
effectiveness literature appear to be limited to the periodic narra-
tiveAnnual Reviews.A notable exception is Burke and Day
(1986), who, however, limited their meta-analysis to the effective-
ness of only managerial training.
Consequently, the goal of the present article is to address this
gap in the training effectiveness literature by conducting a meta-
analysis of the relationship between specified design and evalua-
tion features and the effectiveness of training in organizations. We
accomplish this goal by first identifying design and evaluation
features related to the effectiveness of organizational training
programs and interventions, focusing specifically on those features
over which practitioners and researchers have a reasonable degree
of control. We then discuss our use of meta-analytic procedures to
quantify the effect of each feature and conclude with a discussion
of the implications of our findings for both practitioners and
researchers.
Overview of Design and Evaluation Features Related to
the Effectiveness of Training
Over the past 30 years, there have been six cumulative reviews
of the training and development literature (Campbell, 1971; Gold-
stein, 1980; Latham, 1988; Salas & Cannon-Bowers, 2001; Tan-
nenbaum & Yukl, 1992; Wexley, 1984). On the basis of these and
other pertinent literature, we identified several design and evalu-
ation features that are related to the effectiveness of training and
development programs. However, the scope of the present article
is limited to those features over which trainers and researchers
have a reasonable degree of control. Specifically, we focus on (a)
the type of evaluation criteria, (b) the implementation of training
needs assessment, (c) the skill or task characteristics trained, and

training delivery method. We consider these to be factors that
researchers and practitioners could manipulate in the design, im-
plementation, and evaluation of organizational training programs.
Training Evaluation Criteria
The choice of evaluation criteria (i.e., the dependent measure
used to operationalize the effectiveness of training) is a primary
decision that must be made when evaluating the effectiveness of
training. Although newer approaches to, and models of, training
evaluation have been proposed (e.g., Day, Arthur, & Gettman,
2001; Kraiger, Ford, & Salas, 1993), Kirkpatrick’s (1959, 1976,
1996) four-level model of training evaluation and criteria contin-
ues to be the most popular (Salas & Canon-Bowers, 2001; Van
Buren & Erskine, 2002). We used this framework because it is
conceptually the most appropriate for our purposes. Specifically,
within the framework of Kirkpatrick’s model, questions about the
effectiveness of training or instruction programs are usually fol-
lowed by asking,“Effective in terms of what? Reactions, learning,
behavior, or results?” Thus, the objectives of training determine
the most appropriate criteria for assessing the effectiveness of
training.
Reaction criteria,which are operationalized by using self-report
measures, represent trainees’affective and attitudinal responses to
the training program. However, there is very little reason to believe
that how trainees feel about or whether they like a training pro-
gram tells researchers much, if anything, about (a) how much they
learned from the program (learning criteria), (b) changes in their
job-related behaviors or performance (behavioral criteria), or (c)
the utility of the program to the organization (results criteria). This
is supported by the lack of relationship between reaction criteria
and the other three criteria (e.g., Alliger & Janak, 1989; Alliger,
Tannenbaum, Bennett, Traver, & Shotland, 1997; Arthur, Tubre,
Paul, & Edens, 2003; Colquitt, LePine, & Noe, 2000; Kaplan &
Pascoe, 1977; Noe & Schmitt, 1986). In spite of the fact that
“reaction measures are not a suitable surrogate for other indexes of
training effectiveness” (Tannenbaum & Yukl, 1992, p. 425), an-
ecdotal and other evidence suggests that reaction measures are the
most widely used evaluation criteria in applied settings. For in-
stance, in the American Society of Training and Development
2002 State-of-the-Industry Report,78% of the benchmarking or-
ganizations surveyed reported using reaction measures, compared
with 32%, 9%, and 7% for learning, behavioral, and results,
respectively (Van Buren & Erskine, 2002).
Learning criteriaare measures of the learning outcomes of
training; they are not measures of job performance. They are
typically operationalized by using paper-and-pencil and perfor-
mance tests. According to Tannenbaum and Yukl (1992),“trainee
learning appears to be a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite
for behavior change” (p. 425). In contrast,behavioral criteriaare
measures of actual on-the-job performance and can be used to
identify the effects of training on actual work performance. Issues
pertaining to the transfer of training are also relevant here. Behav-
ioral criteria are typically operationalized by using supervisor
ratings or objective indicators of performance. Although learning
and behavioral criteria are conceptually linked, researchers have
had limited success in empirically demonstrating this relationship
(Alliger et al., 1997; Severin, 1952; cf. Colquitt et al., 2000). This
is because behavioral criteria are susceptible to environmental
variables that can influence the transfer or use of trained skills or
capabilities on the job (Arthur, Bennett, Stanush, & McNelly,
1998; Facteau, Dobbins, Russell, Ladd, & Kudisch, 1995; Qui-
n˜ones, 1997; Quin˜ones, Ford, Sego, & Smith, 1995; Tracey, Tan-
nenbaum, & Kavanagh, 1995). For example, the posttraining en-
vironment may not provide opportunities for the learned material
or skills to be applied or performed (Ford, Quin˜ones, Sego, &
Speer Sorra, 1992). Finally,results criteria(e.g., productivity,
company profits) are the most distal and macro criteria used to
evaluate the effectiveness of training. Results criteria are fre-
quently operationalized by using utility analysis estimates (Cascio,
1991, 1998). Utility analysis provides a methodology to assess the
dollar value gained by engaging in specified personnel interven-
tions including training.
In summary, it is our contention that given their characteristic
feature of capturing different facets of the criterion space— as
illustrated by their weak intercorrelations reported by Alliger et al.
(1997)— the effectiveness of a training program may vary as a
function of the criteria chosen to measure effectiveness (Arthur,
Tubre, et al., 2003). Thus, it is reasonable to ask whether the
effectiveness of training— operationalized as effect sizeds— var-
ies systematically as a function of the outcome criterion measure
used. For instance, all things being equal, are larger effect sizes
obtained for training programs that are evaluated by using learning
versus behavioral criteria? It is important to clarify that criterion
type is not an independent or causal variable in this study. Our
objective is to investigate whether the operationalization of the
dependent variable is related to the observed training outcomes
(i.e., effectiveness). Thus, the evaluation criteria (i.e., reaction,
learning, behavioral, and results) are simply different operational-
izations of the effectiveness of training. Consequently, our first
research question is this: Are there differences in the effectiveness
of training (i.e., the magnitude of theds) as a function of the
operationalization of the dependent variable?
Conducting a Training Needs Assessment
Needs assessment,o rneeds analysis, is the process of determin-
ing the organization’s training needs and seeks to answer the
question of whether the organization’s needs, objectives, and prob-
lems can be met or addressed by training. Within this context,
needs assessment is a three-step process that consists of organiza-
tional analysis (e.g., Which organizational goals can be attained
through personnel training? Where is training needed in the orga-
nization?), task analysis (e.g., What must the trainee learn in order
to perform the job effectively? What will training cover?), and
person analysis (e.g., Which individuals need training and for
what?).
Thus, conducting a systematic needs assessment is a crucial
initial step to training design and development and can substan-
tially influence the overall effectiveness of training programs
(Goldstein & Ford, 2002; McGehee & Thayer, 1961; Sleezer,
1993; Zemke, 1994). Specifically, a systematic needs assessment
can guide and serve as the basis for the design, development,
delivery, and evaluation of the training program; it can be used to
specify a number of key features for the implementation (input)
and evaluation (outcomes) of training programs. Consequently, the
presence and comprehensiveness of a needs assessment should be
235TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS
<<<PAGE=3>>>
related to the overall effectiveness of training because it provides
the mechanism whereby the questions central to successful train-
ing programs can be answered. In the design and development of
training programs, systematic attempts to assess the training needs
of the organization, identify the job requirements to be trained, and
identify who needs training and the kind of training to be delivered
should result in more effective training. Thus, the research objec-
tive here was to determine the relationship between needs assess-
ment and training outcomes.
Match Between Skills or Tasks and Training
Delivery Methods
A product of the needs assessment is the specification of the
training objectives that, in turn, identifies or specifies the skills and
tasks to be trained. A number of typologies have been offered for
categorizing skills and tasks (e.g., Gagne, Briggs, & Wagner,
1992; Rasmussen, 1986; Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977). Given the
fair amount of overlap between them, they can all be summarized
into a general typology that classifies both skills and tasks into
three broad categories: cognitive, interpersonal, and psychomotor
(Farina & Wheaton, 1973; Fleishman & Quaintance, 1984; Gold-
stein & Ford, 2002). Cognitive skills and tasks are related to the
thinking, idea generation, understanding, problem solving, or the
knowledge requirements of the job. Interpersonal skills and tasks
are those that are related to interacting with others in a workgroup
or with clients and customers. They entail a wide variety of skills
including leadership skills, communication skills, conflict manage-
ment skills, and team-building skills. Finally, psychomotor skills
involve the use of the musculoskeletal system to perform behav-
ioral activities associated with a job. Thus, psychomotor tasks are
physical or manual activities that involve a range of movement
from very fine to gross motor coordination.
Practitioners and researchers have limited control over the
choice of skills and tasks to be trained because they are primarily
specified by the job and the results of the needs assessment and
training objectives. However, they have more latitude in the choice
and design of the training delivery method and the match between
the skill or task and the training method. For a specific task or
training content domain, a given training method may be more
effective than others. Because all training methods are capable of,
and indeed are intended to, communicate specific skill, knowledge,
attitudinal, or task information to trainees, different training meth-
ods can be selected to deliver different content (i.e., skill, knowl-
edge, attitudinal, or task) information. Thus, the effect of skill or
task type on the effectiveness of training is a function of the match
between the training delivery method and the skill or task to be
trained. Wexley and Latham (2002) highlighted the need to con-
sider skill and task characteristics in determining the most effec-
tive training method. However, there has been very little, if any,
primary research directly assessing these effects. Thus, the re-
search objective here was to assess the effectiveness of training as
a function of the skill or task trained and the training method used.
Research Questions
On the basis of the issues raised in the preceding sections, this
study addressed the following questions:
1. Does the effectiveness of training— operationalized as effect
sizeds— vary systematically as a function of the evaluation criteria
used? For instance, because the effect of extratraining constraints
and situational factors increases as one moves from learning to
results criteria, will the magnitude of observed effect sizes de-
crease from learning to results criteria?
2. What is the relationship between needs assessment and train-
ing effectiveness? Specifically, will studies with more comprehen-
sive needs assessments be more effective (i.e., obtain larger effect
sizes) than those with less comprehensive needs assessments?
3. What is the observed effectiveness of specified training
methods as a function of the skill or task being trained? It should
be noted that because we expected effectiveness to vary as a
function of the evaluation criteria used, we broke down all mod-
erators by criterion type.
Method
Literature Search
For the present study, we reviewed the published training and develop-
ment literature from 1960 to 2000. We considered the period post-1960 to
be characterized by increased technological sophistication in training de-
sign and methodology and by the use of more comprehensive training
evaluation techniques and statistical approaches. The increased focus on
quantitative methods for the measurement of training effectiveness is
critical for a quantitative review such as this study. Similar to past training
and development reviews (e.g., Latham, 1988; Tannenbaum & Yukl, 1992;
Wexley, 1984), the present study also included the practitioner-oriented
literature if those studies met the criteria for inclusion as outlined below.
Therefore, the literature search encompassed studies published in journals,
books or book chapters, conference papers and presentations, and disser-
tations and theses that were related to the evaluation of an organizational
training program or those that measured some aspect of the effectiveness of
organizational training.
An extensive literature search was conducted to identify empirical
studies that involved an evaluation of a training program or measured some
aspects of the effectiveness of training. This search process started with a
search of nine computer databases (Defense Technical Information Center,
Econlit, Educational Research Information Center, Government Printing
Office, National Technical Information Service, PsycLIT/PsycINFO, So-
cial Citations Index, Sociofile, and Wilson) using the following key words:
training effectiveness, training evaluation, training efficiency,and training
transfer. The electronic search was supplemented with a manual search of
the reference lists from past reviews of the training literature (e.g., Alliger
et al., 1997; Campbell, 1971; Goldstein, 1980; Latham, 1988; Tannenbaum
& Yukl, 1992; Wexley, 1984). A review of the abstracts obtained as a
result of this initial search for appropriate content (i.e., empirical studies
that actually evaluated an organizational training program or measured
some aspect of the effectiveness of organizational training), along with a
decision to retain only English language articles, resulted in an initial list
of 383 articles and papers. Next, the reference lists of these sources were
reviewed. As a result of these efforts, an additional 253 sources were
identified, resulting in a total preliminary list of 636 sources. Each of these
was then reviewed and considered for inclusion in the meta-analysis.
Inclusion Criteria
A number of decision rules were used to determine which studies would
be included in the meta-analysis. First, to be included in the meta-analysis,
a study must have investigated the effectiveness of an organizational
training program or have conducted an empirical evaluation of an organi-
zational training method or approach. Studies evaluating the effectiveness
of rater training programs were excluded because such programs were
236 ARTHUR, BENNETT, EDENS, AND BELL
<<<PAGE=4>>>
considered to be qualitatively different from more traditional organiza-
tional training studies or programs. Second, to be included, studies had to
report sample sizes along with other pertinent information. This informa-
tion included statistics that allowed for the computation of ad statistic (e.g.,
group means and standard deviations). If studies reported statistics such as
correlations, univariateF, t,
/H92732, or some other test statistic, these were
converted tods by using the appropriate conversion formulas (see Arthur
et al., 2001, Appendix C, for a summary of conversion formulas). Finally,
studies based on single group pretest–posttest designs were excluded from
the data.
Data Set
Nonindependence. As a result of the inclusion criteria, an initial data
set of 1,152 data points (ds) from 165 sources was obtained. However,
some of the data points were nonindependent. Multiple effect sizes or data
points are nonindependent if they are computed from data collected from
the same sample of participants. Decisions about nonindependence also
have to take into account whether or not the effect sizes represent the same
variable or construct (Arthur et al., 2001). For instance, because criterion
type was a variable of interest, if a study reported effect sizes for multiple
criterion types (e.g., reaction and learning), these effect sizes were consid-
ered to be independent even though they were based on the same sample;
therefore, they were retained as separate data points. Consistent with this,
data points based on multiple measures of the same criterion (e.g., reac-
tions) for the same sample were considered to be nonindependent and were
subsequently averaged to form a single data point. Likewise, data points
based on temporally repeated measures of the same or similar criterion for
the same sample were also considered to be nonindependent and were
subsequently averaged to form a single data point. The associated time
intervals were also averaged. Implementing these decision rules resulted in
405 independent data points from 164 sources.
Outliers.We computed Huffcutt and Arthur’s (1995) and Arthur et al.’s
(2001) sample-adjusted meta-analytic deviancy statistic to detect outliers.
On the basis of these analyses, we identified 8 outliers. A detailed review
of these studies indicated that they displayed unusual characteristics such
as extremely largeds (e.g., 5.25) and sample sizes (e.g., 7,532). They were
subsequently dropped from the data set. This resulted in a final data set of
397 independentds from 162 sources. Three hundred ninety-three of the
data points were from journal articles, 2 were from conference papers,
and 1 each were from a dissertation and a book chapter. A reference list of
sources included in the meta-analysis is available from Winfred Arthur, Jr.,
upon request.
Description of Variables
This section presents a description of the variables that were coded for
the meta-analysis.
Evaluation criteria.Kirkpatrick’s (1959, 1976, 1996) evaluation cri-
teria (i.e., reaction, learning, behavioral, and results) were coded. Thus, for
each study, the criterion type used as the dependent variable was identified.
The interval (i.e., number of days) between the end of training and
collection of the criterion data was also coded.
Needs assessment.The needs assessment components (i.e., organiza-
tion, task, and person analysis) conducted and reported in each study as
part of the training program were coded. Consistent with our decision to
focus on features over which practitioners and researchers have a reason-
able degree of control, a convincing argument can be made that most
training professionals have some latitude in deciding whether to conduct a
needs assessment and its level of comprehensiveness. However, it is
conceivable, and may even be likely, that some researchers conducted a
needs assessment but did not report doing so in their papers or published
works. On the other hand, we also think that it can be reasonably argued
that if there was no mention of a needs assessment, then it was probably not
a very potent study variable or manipulation. Consequently, if a study did
not mention conducting a needs assessment, this variable was coded as
“missing.” We recognize that this may present a weak test of this research
question, so our analyses and the discussion of our results are limited to
only those studies that reported conducting some needs assessment.
Training method.The specific methods used to deliver training in the
study were coded. Multiple training methods (e.g., lectures and discussion)
were recorded if they were used in the study. Thus, the data reflect the
effect for training methods as reported, whether single (e.g., audiovisual) or
multiple (e.g., audiovisual and lecture) methods were used.
Skill or task characteristics.Three types of training content (i.e.,
cognitive, interpersonal, and psychomotor) were coded. For example, if the
focus of the training program was to train psychomotor skills and tasks,
then the psychomotor characteristic was coded as 1 whereas the other
characteristics (i.e., cognitive and interpersonal) were coded as 0. Skill or
task types were generally nonoverlapping— only 14 (4%) of the 397 data
points in the final data set focused on more than one skill or task.
Coding Accuracy and Interrater Agreement
The coding training process and implementation were as follows. First,
Winston Bennett, Jr., and Pamela S. Edens were furnished with a copy of
a coder training manual and reference guide that had been developed by
Winfred Arthur, Jr., and Winston Bennett, Jr., and used with other meta-
analysis projects (e.g., Arthur et al., 1998; Arthur, Day, McNelly, & Edens,
in press). Each coder used the manual and reference guide to independently
code 1 article. Next, they attended a follow-up training meeting with
Winfred Arthur, Jr., to discuss problems encountered in using the guide and
the coding sheet and to make changes to the guide or the coding sheet as
deemed necessary. They were then assigned the same 5 articles to code.
After coding these 5 articles, the coders attended a second training session
in which the degree of convergence between them was assessed. Discrep-
ancies and disagreements related to the coding of the 5 articles were
resolved by using a consensus discussion and agreement among the au-
thors. After this second meeting, Pamela S. Edens subsequently coded the
articles used in the meta-analysis. As part of this process, Winston Bennett,
Jr., coded a common set of 20 articles that were used to assess the degree
of interrater agreement. The level of agreement was generally high, with a
mean overall agreement of 92.80% (SD /H110055.71).
Calculating the Effect Size Statistic (d) and Analyses
Preliminary analyses.The present study used thed statistic as the
common effect-size metric. Two hundred twenty-one (56%) of the 397 data
points were computed by using means and standard deviations presented in
the primary studies. The remaining 176 data points (44%) were computed
from test statistics (i.e., correlations,tstatistics, or univariate two-groupF
statistics) that were converted tods by using the appropriate conversion
formulas (Arthur et al., 2001; Dunlap, Cortina, Vaslow, & Burke, 1996;
Glass, McGaw, & Smith, 1981; Hunter & Schmidt, 1990; Wolf, 1986).
The data analyses were performed by using Arthur et al.’s (2001) SAS
PROC MEANS meta-analysis program to compute sample-weighted
means. Sample weighting assigns studies with larger sample sizes more
weight and reduces the effect of sampling error because sampling error
generally decreases as the sample size increases (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990).
We also computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the sample-weighted
mean ds. CIs are used to assess the accuracy of the estimate of the mean
effect size (Whitener, 1990). CIs estimate the extent to which sampling
error remains in the sample-size-weighted mean effect size. Thus, CI gives
the range of values that the mean effect size is likely to fall within if other
sets of studies were taken from the population and used in the meta-
analysis. A desirable CI is one that does not include zero if a nonzero
relationship is hypothesized.
Moderator analyses.In the meta-analysis of effect sizes, the presence
of one or more moderator variables is suspected when sufficient variance
237TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS
<<<PAGE=5>>>
remains in the corrected effect size. Alternately, various moderator vari-
ables may be suggested by theory. Thus, the decision to search or test for
moderators may be either theoretically or empirically driven. In the present
study, decisions to test for the presence and effects of moderators were
theoretically based. To assess the relationship between each feature and the
effectiveness of training, studies were categorized into separate subsets
according to the specified level of the feature. An overall, as well as a
subset, mean effect size and associated meta-analytic statistics were then
calculated for each level of the feature.
For the moderator analysis, the meta-analysis was limited to factors
with 2 or more data points. Although there is no magical cutoff as to the
minimum number of studies to include in a meta-analysis, we acknowledge
that using such a small number raises the possibility of second-order
sampling error and concerns about the stability and interpretability of the
obtained meta-analytic estimates (Arthur et al., 2001; Hunter & Schmidt,
1990). However, we chose to use such a low cutoff for the sake of
completeness but emphasize that meta-analytic effect sizes based on less
that 5 data points should be interpreted with caution.
Results
Evaluation Criteria
Our first objective for the present meta-analysis was to assess
whether the effectiveness of training varied systematically as a
function of the evaluation criteria used. Figure 1 presents the
distribution (histogram) ofds included in the meta-analysis. Theds
in the figure are grouped in 0.25 intervals. The histogram shows
that most of theds were positive, only 5.8% (3.8% learning
and 2.0% behavioral criteria) were less than zero. Table 1 presents
the results of the meta-analysis and shows the sample-weighted
mean d, with its associated corrected standard deviation. The
corrected standard deviation provides an index of the variation of
ds across the studies in the data set. The percentage of variance
accounted for by sampling error and 95% CIs are also provided.
Consistent with the histogram, the results presented in Table 1
show medium to large sample-weighted mean effect sizes
(d /H110050.60–0.63) for organizational training effectiveness for the
four evaluation criteria. (Cohen, 1992, describesds of 0.20, 0.50,
and 0.80 as small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.)
The largest effect was obtained for learning criteria. However,
the magnitude of the differences between criterion types was
small;ds ranged from 0.63 for learning criteria to 0.60 for reaction
criteria. To further explore the effect of criterion type, we limited
our analysis to a within-study approach.
1 Specifically, we identi-
fied studies that reported multiple criterion measures and assessed
the differences between the criterion types. Five sets of studies
were available in the data set— those that reported using (a) reac-
tion and learning, (b) learning and behavioral, (c) learning and
results, (d) behavioral and results, and (e) learning, behavioral and
results criteria. For all comparisons of learning with subsequent
criteria (i.e., behavioral and results [with the exception of the
learning and results analysis, which was based on 3 data points]),
a clear trend that can be garnered from these results is that,
consistent with issues of transfer, lack of opportunity to perform,
and skill loss, there was a decrease in effect sizes from learning to
these criteria. For instance, the average decrease in effect sizes for
the learning and behavioral comparisons was 0.77, a fairly large
decrease.
Arising from an interest to describe the methodological state of,
and publication patterns in, the extant organizational training ef-
fectiveness literature, the results presented in Table 1 show that the
smallest number of data points were obtained for reaction criteria
(k /H1100515 [4%]). In contrast, the American Society for Training and
Development 2002 State-of-the-Industry Report(Van Buren &

Erskine, 2002) indicated that 78% of the organizations surveyed
used reaction measures, compared with 32%, 19%, and 7% for
learning, behavioral, and results, respectively. The wider use of
reaction measures in practice may be due primarily to their ease of
collection and proximal nature. This discrepancy between the
frequency of use in practice and the published research literature is
not surprising given that academic and other scholarly and empir-
ical journals are unlikely to publish a training evaluation study that
focuses only or primarily on reaction measures as the criterion for
evaluating the effectiveness of organizational training. In further
support of this, Alliger et al. (1997), who did not limit their
inclusion criteria to organizational training programs like we did,
reported only 25 data points for reaction criteria, compared with 89
for learning and 58 for behavioral criteria.
Like reaction criteria, an equally small number of data points
were obtained for results criteria (k /H1100526 [7%]). This is probably
a function of the distal nature of these criteria, the practical
logistical constraints associated with conducting results-level eval-
uations, and the increased difficulty in controlling for confounding
variables such as the business climate. Finally, substantially more
data points were obtained for learning and behavioral criteria (k /H11005
234 [59%] and 122 [31%], respectively).
We also computed descriptive statistics for the time intervals for
the collection of the four evaluation criteria to empirically describe
the temporal nature of these criteria. The correlation between
interval and criterion type was .41 (p /H11021.001). Reaction criteria
were always collected immediately after training (M /H110050.00 days,
SD /H110050.00), followed by learning criteria, which on average, were

a The overall sample-weighted meand across the four evaluation criteria was 0.62 (k /H11005397, N /H1100533,325,
correctedSD /H110050.46, % variance due to sampling error/H1100519.64, 95% confidence interval/H11005/H110020.27–1.52). It is
important to note that because the four evaluation criteria are argued to be conceptually distinct and focus on
different facets of the criterion space, there is some question about the appropriateness of an“overall
effectiveness” effect size. Accordingly, this information is presented here for the sake of completeness.

collected 26.34 days after training (SD /H1100587.99). Behavioral
criteria were more distal (M /H11005133.59 days,SD /H11005142.24), and
results criteria were the most temporally distal (M /H11005158.88 days,
SD /H11005187.36). We further explored this relationship by computing
the correlation between the evaluation criterion time interval and
the observedd (r /H11005.03,p /H11005.56). In summary, these results
indicate that although the evaluation criteria differed in terms of
the time interval in which they were collected, time intervals were
not related to the observed effect sizes.
Needs Assessment
The next research question focused on the relationship between
needs assessment and training effectiveness. These analyses were
limited to only studies that reported conducting a needs assess-
ment. For these and all other moderator analyses, multiple levels
within each factor were ranked in descending order of the magni-
tude of sample-weightedds. We failed to identify a clear pattern of
results. For instance, a comparison of studies that conducted only
an organizational analysis to those that performed only a task
analysis showed that for learning criteria, studies that conducted
only an organizational analysis obtained larger effect sizes than
those that conducted a task analysis. However, these results were
reversed for the behavioral criteria. Furthermore, contrary to what
may have been expected, studies that implemented multiple needs
assessment components did not necessarily obtain larger effect
sizes. On a cautionary note, we acknowledge that these analyses
were all based on 4 or fewer data points and thus should be
cautiously interpreted. Related to this, it is worth noting that
studies reporting a needs assessment represented a very small
percentage— only 6% (22 of 397)— of the data points in the
meta-analysis.
Match Between Skill or Task Characteristics and Training
Delivery Method
Testing for the effect of skill or task characteristics was intended
to shed light on the“trainability” of skills and tasks. For both
learning and behavioral criteria, the largest effects were obtained
for training that included both cognitive and interpersonal skills or
tasks (meands /H110052.08 and 0.75, respectively), followed by psy-
chomotor skills or tasks (meands /H110050.80 and 0.71, respectively).
Medium effects were obtained for both interpersonal and cognitive
skills or tasks, although their rank order was reversed for learning
and behavioral criteria. Where results criteria were used, the larg-
est effect was obtained for interpersonal skills or tasks (mean
d /H110050.88) and the smallest for psychomotor skills or tasks (mean
d /H110050.43). A medium to large effect was obtained for cognitive
skills or tasks. Finally, the data for reaction criterion were limited.
Specifically, there were only two skill or task types, psychomotor
and cognitive, and for the former, there were only 2 data points.
Nevertheless, a medium to large effect size was obtained for both
skills or tasks, and unlike results for the other three criterion types,
the differences for reaction criteria were minimal.
We next investigated the effectiveness of specified training
delivery methods as a function of the skill or task being trained.
Again, these data were analyzed by criterion type. The results
presented in Table 1 show that very few studies used a single
training method. They also indicate a wide range in the meands
both within and across evaluation criteria. For instance, for cog-
nitive skills or tasks that used learning criteria, the sample-
weighted meands ranged from 1.56 to 0.20. However, overall, the
magnitude of the effect sizes was generally favorable and ranged
from medium to large. As an example of this, it is worth noting
that in contrast to its anecdotal reputation as a boring training
method and the subsequent perception of ineffectiveness, the mean
d for lectures (either by themselves or in conjunction with other
training methods) were generally favorable across skill or task
types and evaluation criteria. In summary, our results suggest that
organizational training is generally effective. Furthermore, they
also suggest that the effectiveness of training appears to vary as
function of the specified training delivery method, the skill or task
being trained, and the criterion used to operationalize
effectiveness.
Discussion
Meta-analytic procedures were applied to the extant published
training effectiveness literature to provide a quantitative“popula-
tion” estimate of the effectiveness of training and also to investi-
gate the relationship between the observed effectiveness of orga-
nizational training and specified training design and evaluation
features. Depending on the criterion type, the sample-weighted
effect size for organizational training was 0.60 to 0.63, a medium
to large effect (Cohen, 1992). This is an encouraging finding,
given the pervasiveness and importance of training to organiza-
tions. Indeed, the magnitude of this effect is comparable to, and in
some instances larger than, those reported for other organizational
interventions. Specifically, Guzzo, Jette, and Katzell (1985) re-
ported a mean effect size of 0.44 for all psychologically based
interventions, 0.35 for appraisal and feedback, 0.12 for manage-
ment by objectives, and 0.75 for goal setting on productivity.
Kluger and DeNisi (1996) reported a mean effect size of 0.41 for
the relationship between feedback and performance. Finally, Neu-
man, Edwards, and Raju (1989) reported a mean effect size of 0.33
between organizational development interventions and attitudes.
The within-study analyses for training evaluation criteria ob-
tained additional noteworthy results. Specifically, they indicated
that comparisons of learning criteria with subsequent criteria (i.e.,
behavioral and results) showed a substantial decrease in effect
sizes from learning to these criteria. This effect may be due to the
fact that the manifestation of training learning outcomes in subse-
quent job behaviors (behavioral criteria) and organizational indi-
cators (results criteria) may be a function of the favorability of the
posttraining environment for the performance of the learned skills.
Environmental favorability is the extent to which the transfer or
work environment is supportive of the application of new skills
and behaviors learned or acquired in training (Noe, 1986; Peters &
O ’Connor, 1980). Trained and learned skills will not be demon-
strated as job-related behaviors or performance if incumbents do
not have the opportunity to perform them (Arthur et al., 1998; Ford
et al., 1992). Thus, for studies using behavioral or results criteria,
the social context and the favorability of the posttraining environ-
ment play an important role in facilitating the transfer of trained
skills to the job and may attenuate the effectiveness of training
(Colquitt et al., 2000; Facteau, Dobbins, Russell, Ladd, & Kudisch,
1992; Tannenbaum, Mathieu, Salas, & Cannon-Bowers, 1991;
Tracey et al., 1995; Williams, Thayer, & Pond, 1991).
242 ARTHUR, BENNETT, EDENS, AND BELL
<<<PAGE=10>>>
In terms of needs assessment, although anecdotal information
suggests that it is prudent to conduct a needs assessment as the first
step in the design and development of training (Ostroff & Ford,
1989; Sleezer, 1993), only 6% of the studies in our data set
reported any needs assessment activities prior to training imple-
mentation. Of course, it is conceivable and even likely that a much
larger percentage conducted a needs assessment but failed to report
it in the published work because it may not have been a variable of
interest. Contrary to what we expected— that implementation of
more comprehensive needs assessments (i.e., the presence of mul-
tiple aspects [i.e., organization, task, and person analysis] of the
process) would result in more effective training— there was no
clear pattern of results for the needs assessment analyses. How-
ever, these analyses were based on a small number of data points.
Concerning the choice of training methods for specified skills
and tasks, our results suggest that the effectiveness of organiza-
tional training appears to vary as a function of the specified
training delivery method, the skill or task being trained, and the
criterion used to operationalize effectiveness. We highlight the
effectiveness of lectures as an example because despite their
widespread use (Van Buren & Erskine, 2002), they have a poor
public image as a boring and ineffective training delivery method
(Carroll, Paine, & Ivancevich, 1972). In contrast, a noteworthy
finding in our meta-analysis was the robust effect obtained for
lectures, which contrary to their poor public image, appeared to be
quite effective in training several types of skills and tasks.
Because our results do not provide information on exactly why
a particular method is more effective than others for specified
skills or tasks, future research should attempt to identify what
instructional attributes of a method impact the effectiveness of that
method for different training content. In addition, studies examin-
ing the differential effectiveness of various training methods for
the same content and a single training method across a variety of
skills and tasks are warranted. Along these lines, future research
might consider the effectiveness and efficacy of high-technology
training methods such as Web-based training.
Limitations and Additional Suggestions for Future
Research
First, we limited our meta-analysis to features over which prac-
titioners and researchers have a reasonable amount of control.
There are obviously several other factors that could also play a role
in the observed effectiveness of organizational training. For in-
stance, because they are rarely manipulated, researched, or re-
ported in the extant literature, two additional steps commonly
listed in the training development and evaluation sequence, namely
(a) developing the training objectives and (b) designing the eval-
uation and the actual presentation of the training content, including
the skill of the trainer, were excluded. Other factors that we did not
investigate include contextual factors such as participation in
training-related decisions, framing of training, and organizational
climate (Quin˜ones, 1995, 1997). Additional variables that could
influence the observed effectiveness of organizational training
include trainer effects (e.g., the skill of the trainer), quality of the
training content, and trainee effects such as motivation (Colquitt et
al., 2000), cognitive ability (e.g., Ree & Earles, 1991; Warr &
Bunce, 1995), self-efficacy (e.g., Christoph, Schoenfeld, & Tan-
sky, 1998; Martocchio & Judge, 1997; Mathieu, Martineau, &
Tannenbaum, 1993), and goal orientation (e.g., Fisher & Ford,
1998). Although we considered them to be beyond the scope of the
present meta-analysis, these factors need to be incorporated into
future comprehensive models and investigations of the effective-
ness of organizational training.
Second, this study focused on fairly broad training design and
evaluation features. Although a number of levels within these
features were identified a priori and examined, given the number
of viable moderators that can be identified (e.g., trainer effects,
contextual factors), it is reasonable to posit that there might be
additional moderators operating here that would be worthy of
future investigation.
Third, our data were limited to individual training interventions
and did not include any team training studies. Thus, for instance,
our training methods did not include any of the burgeoning team
training methods and strategies such as cross-training (Blickens-
derfer, Cannon-Bowers, & Salas, 1998), team coordination train-
ing (Prince & Salas, 1993), and distributed training (Dwyer, Oser,
Salas, & Fowlkes, 1999). Although these methods may use train-
ing methods similar to those included in the present study, it is also
likely that their application and use in team contexts may have
qualitatively different effects and could result in different out-
comes worthy of investigation in a future meta-analysis.
Finally, although it is generally done more for convenience and
ease of explanation than for scientific precision, a commonly used
training method typology in the extant literature is the classifica-
tion of training methods into on-site and off-site methods. It is
striking that out of 397 data points, only 1 was based on the sole
implementation of an on-site training method. A few data points
used an on-site method in combination with an off-site method
(k /H1100512 [3%]), but the remainder used off-site methods only.
Wexley and Latham (1991) noted this lack of formal evaluation for
on-site training methods and called for a“science-based guide” to
help practitioners make informed choices about the most appro-
priate on-site methods. However, our data indicate that after more
than 10 years since Wexley and Latham’s observation, there is still
an extreme paucity of formal evaluation of on-site training meth-
ods in the extant literature. This may be due to the informal nature
of some on-site methods such as on-the-job training, which makes
it less likely that there will be a structured formal evaluation that
is subsequently written up for publication. However, because of
on-site training methods’ ability to minimize costs, facilitate and
enhance training transfer, as well as their frequent use by organi-
zations, we reiterate Wexley and Latham’s call for research on the
effectiveness of these methods.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we identified specified training design and eval-
uation features and then used meta-analytic procedures to empir-
ically assess their relationships to the effectiveness of training in
organizations. Our results suggest that the training method used,
the skill or task characteristic trained, and the choice of training
evaluation criteria are related to the observed effectiveness of
training programs. We hope that both researchers and practitioners
will find the information presented here to be of some value in
making informed choices and decisions in the design, implemen-
tation, and evaluation of organizational training programs.
