Abstract
This article presents a research synthesis of 162 studies focusing on information
use for decision-making in public administration, management, and policy. The
findings reveal that a significant proportion of work is centered around perfor-
mance management and policy implementation. Notably, around one third of the
reviewed studies adopt a behavioral science perspective. The analysis predomi-
nantly includes civil servants and citizens as the subjects, with quantitative studies
outnumbering qualitative investigations by more than twofold. We identify three
distinct components in understanding information use: the objective features of
information architecture; the subjective mechanisms involving cognitive biases
(i.e., over-/under-reaction to irrelevant information features) and decision noise
(i.e., heterogeneity); and the moderating role of information user typology. Context
should also be taken into account. The article explores how these findings relate
to current societal challenges and emphasizes the potential of mixed-methods,
multisample, and/or multisite research in advancing knowledge in this area.
Evidence for practice
 Navigating information use for decision-making in public administration, man-
agement, and policy is pivotal given the pressure to adopt interventions that
work and the rapid growth in computational capacity.
 Going beyond the actual fragmentation in the understanding of information use
in public decision-making requires distinguishing objective features of informa-
tion, subjective mechanisms of information use, and the moderating role of user
characteristics, while also taking context into account.
 If information use is influenced by behavior, we should broaden our concerns to
include information technology, encompassing data collection, analysis systems,
and the transformation of data into usable information.
INTRODUCTION
With increasing emphasis on big data, frequent admoni-
tion to follow the science, and a heightened attention to
evidence-based practice, there is renewed need to ask
how is information used to make decisions in the context
of public administration? What factors shape the kinds of
information individuals seek, and how do they weigh
information from different sources? Thinking ahead, will
we need to reexamine our understanding with the advent
of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that
are capable of aggregating and analyzing vast quantities
of data in a way that will reshape information use in pub-
lic decisions? The literature on information use in public
policy and administration is deeply fragmented, and con-
sequently its application is varied and its meaning
context-dependent. While our adoption of the term
“information use” may carry certain connotations for dif-
ferent subsets of that literature, that is, purposeful infor-
mation use from the performance management literature
(Kroll,
2015a; Mikkelsen et al.,2023), we characterize the
term more broadly in order to capture its role in a variety

of decision architectures and unique conceptualizations
across our field (which is to say, including, but not limited
to, performance management). Further, our research syn-
thesis specifically explores cognitive biases.
Recent studies provide prescriptive approaches to
evidence-based and best practice integration (Hall &
Jennings,
2008;H e a d ,2008; Newcomer et al.,2023); others
have endeavored to produce a descriptive foundation of
differences that exist across geographies and organizations
(Jennings & Hall,
2012). The behavioral movement brings
with it the use of experimental methodologies that exam-
ine the effects of cognitive bias on the presentation, pro-
cessing, and use of information, which have well
established the human capacity to succumb unwittingly to
errors of judgment in making decisions. But the behavioral
perspective has only recently entered the sphere of aca-
demic inquiry related to public decision makers’use of var-
ied types of information. Stated differently, the kinds of
information available to decision makers are now more
varied and considerably more sophisticated. We are begin-
ning to crack open the shell of independent components
in information use, which necessitates we look more
closely at how and when information is used with an eye
toward how behavioral approaches might impact such
decisions (Grimmelikhuijsen et al.,
2017).
This study takes a broad look at information use in
public sector decision-making, including policy making,
administrative choices, management and practice, by
analyzing articles that contain at least one of the follow-
ing keywords in the title: information, decision, use, or
data. By conducting a synthesis of the literature, we
explore the fundamental constructs that underpin the
information use in public administration and policy. Par-
ticularly salient to our understanding of this body of
knowledge is the variety and scope of research methodol-
ogies employed to understand information use. Hendren
et al. (
2018) point out the potential for a positive quantita-
tive bias to crowd out qualitative studies that seek to drill
down to an individual, organizational, or decision-level
understanding of the cognitive factors at work in informa-
tion processing and use. We are particularly attentive to
work that employs a behavioral perspective, utilizing con-
structs related to errors in judgment in the form of cogni-
tive biases (Bellé et al.,
2018). We report on several
characteristics of the state of the art of scholarly under-
standing of information use in public administration and
policy decision-making, so as to pinpoint its main inde-
pendent components and distill three key recommenda-
tions for the advancement of knowledge for theory and
practice alike.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Information is an essential component of decision-
making, and consequentially, an integral component of
public policy implementation and public management.
Simon’s(
1947) work reveals that we curtail information
search by satisficing, rather than optimizing outcomes.
Lindblom’s( 1959) theory of incrementalism, or successive
limited comparisons, builds a framework of policy change
based on limited information seeking, or rather, informa-
tion seeking only at the margin. Fast forward half a cen-
tury, and we find ourselves inundated with new
applications for big data, fueled by rapid growth in tech-
nological capacity and a performance movement that
values collecting data to inform management (Andersen &
Moynihan,
2016; Desmidt & Meyfroodt,2023; Kroll,2015a;
Mikkelsen et al., 2022; Moynihan, 2015; Pandey, 2015;
Vogel & Hattke,2018). Since the turn of the millennium,
the policy making elite have developed a new infatuation
with science, calling for increased use of evidence to
inform policy decisions at nearly every turn. Following the
increasing sophistication of the electorate, and their
attention to science as an answer to difficult questions
from climate change to criminal justice, politicians have
intensified their own admonition to follow the science.
The result is an evidence movement spawned out of
desire to replicate for other areas of policy and practice
what experimental results have been able to achieve
with pharmaceutical schedules. This movement has
been referred to somewhat flippantly as “evidence-
based everything” (Hall,
2021). And finally, a concomi-
tant movement in behavioralism, and behavioral public
administration in particular, has begun to enhance our
focus on the flaws in our information search, processing,
and consequentially our decisions, as a result of cogni-
tive biases and errors in judgment (Battaglio et al.,
2019;
Grimmelikhuijsen et al.,2017).
Information plays a central role in public decisions, both
policy making and management, breaching both realms at
key junctures. In the 75 years since Simon’s( 1947)w o r k ,w e
have come to understand most decisions in terms of
whether or not they are intuitive or rational, and when ratio-
nal, to what extent the information search is attenuated by
satisficing. Information and its use are ubiquitous to public
management, but we have not, as researchers, carved out
an overt focus on information, per se. The advent of
machine learning and artificial intelligence is raising new
concerns about the manner in which information is used to
influence decisions (Grimmelikhuijsen,
2023; Hartmann &
Wenzelburger, 2021). There is growing concern that infor-
mation may be manipulated at various stages of the deci-
sion process to achieve preconceived goals. Evidence itself
has come under attack; President Trump famously forbade
the use of the term “evidence-based” in agency budget
requests (Hall and Battaglio
2018) .T h es y m b o l i cu s eo fe v i -
dence rather than the substantive use for improved out-
comes is a real concern (Hall,
2017). In this environment, the
value of information— valid and reliable information— is at a
premium. We need to take stock of the existing knowledge
in our field through a systematic understanding of how
information is treated in public administration research;
doing so will enable us to identify the gaps and weaknesses

that decision makers will face as they move forward in this
rapidly changing environment.
Attention to information is not new; scholars have
been concerned with how information enters various
decision processes in the public sphere through both pol-
icy and management. If we take these two broad classifi-
cations, we see two distinct sets of theory building
around the use of information in policy design and imple-
mentation. Naturally, such division is myopic and neglects
the central flaws of the politics versus administration
dichotomy. It is impossible to eliminate the effects of poli-
tics on implementation. And, as Pandey and colleagues
note, policy making continues through implementation at
the street level (Pandey, Cheng, and Hall
2022). Nonethe-
less, for conceptual circumspectness and clarity, the two-
pronged approach is the way the field has developed. In
public management, the focus on information grew with
the performance movement, but the prominence of infor-
mation use in that subfield neglects its important roles
throughout other dimensions of practice and research.
We are concerned with collecting information, comparing
information, and from a management perspective, exam-
ining how it has been used (Grossi et al.,
2016;
Kroll, 2015c; Vogel & Hattke,2018).
The literature on information use is scattered and
fragmented, with conceptual attention developing within
unique silos (e.g., performance management, decision sci-
ence, policy formulation, evidence-based practice). For
example, Dimitrijevska-Markoski and Edward French
(
2019) examine the factors that influence managers’ use
of performance information in Florida, finding that institu-
tionalization and adequacy of the system design play
measurably into information use. Li (2023) has shown that
mandatory performance information disclosure has led to
increased environmental inspections. Boer et al. (2018)
show that disclosure of performance information influ-
ences bureaucrats’ enforcement style. Kroll (
2013) sug-
gests that managers explore not only systematic
quantitative information in making decisions, but that
they also receive and process considerable amounts of
nonroutine information, primarily from organizational
insiders and relevant external stakeholders.
Baekgaard and Serritzlew (
2016) prompt us with the
notion that performance information might be examined
for comprehension or interpreted through motivated rea-
soning. They find, in fact, that decision makers systemati-
cally interpret performance information in ways that
conform to their prior beliefs. Relatedly, Mikkelsen et al.
(
2022) find that the internal use of information is higher
when data show a declining performance and the exter-
nal use of information is higher when data show an
improving performance. Belardinelli et al. (
2018) examine
whether the type of performance information use and
the request to justify decisions affect the manner in which
information is processed. Through survey experiments,
their findings reveal that managers process performance
information differently under ex post versus ex ante uses;
managers are more likely to be subject to framing bias
under ex post conditions. A recent literature review on
the use that scholars make of data collected through the
Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey signals that the field
of human resource management is not absent in this
domain (Somers,
2018). These studies only scratch the
surface of the information use literature. What is clear,
however, is that it continues to be a central concern of
management studies; there is a growing behavioral inter-
est in the topic; that information use in this context is
conceptually amorphous; and the science is growing
increasingly sophisticated over time.
On the policy side of the house, the role of informa-
tion in shaping and influencing support for policy pro-
posals has been of keen interest since the beginning of
policy theory itself. Incrementalism or the successive lim-
ited comparisons approach introduced by Lindblom is an
explanation for the limited information seeking that takes
place in making policy decisions. The counterpart, the
rational comprehensive model, is presented as an infeasi-
ble waste of time, digging up information on every possi-
ble alternative, evaluating its likely effectiveness, and
making purely rational decisions. Baumgartner and Jones’
(
1993) punctuated equilibrium theory unifies the
approaches to explain how information is used in a lim-
ited fashion when change is incremental, but more exten-
sively when a problem reaches crisis stage. Workman
et al. (
2009) draw on these advances to lay out a broad
theory of government information processing that inte-
grates the study of agenda setting, policy dynamics, and
information flows in the policy process, and relate it to
core features of American government as inter-
institutional dynamics and delegation within the policy
process. Recent effort to systematize knowledge has
focused on the use of data to foster social equity (Ruijer
et al.,
2023). All this is to say, simply, that agendas are
influenced by information, and subsequent information is
used to evaluate and advocate for different policy alterna-
tives. A desire to know the effects of such policies has
fueled efforts in policy analysis and evaluation, and these
serve as the fodder for the evidence movement.
The recent evidence-based movement is rooted in
rationality, seeking to use scientific information in particu-
lar to guide policy decisions. As Head (
2016) notes, even
though public agencies gather and process tremendous
amounts of information, there has been scant analysis of
how such information is actually utilized for policy and
program improvement. Head (
2016) has previously
pointed out that scientific information, such as evaluation
findings, must compete with other kinds of information,
including political wisdom about what is acceptable and
administrative wisdom about what is technically feasible.
It is important, also, that we seek to better understand
information use so as to disentangle these complexities.
Newcomer et al. (
2023) examine one clearinghouse of
evidence-based approaches and find that the variety of
information considered in making program classifications

and rankings is woefully insufficient in its failure to inte-
grate facts about context, and its failure to break down
impact in ways that promote social equity. In any
evidence-based endeavor, considerable variation will be
observed as there are differences in motivation to seek
information, varying levels of information availability, and
information from professional and other sources about
what works and what does not. Notably for our present
interest, Newcomer et al. (
2023) makes a point of noting
that selection bias may be “limiting our knowledge of
what works and where” (1057).
Information seeking during the policy process does
not take place in a sterile setting; it is not immune from
politics. Hansen (2023), for example, examines whether
performance information affects the political agenda. His
results show that performance shortfalls receive political
attention, regardless of the politicization of the environ-
ment, which counters an extensive literature suggesting
political context alters attention to performance informa-
tion. In other words, political entities use performance
data to focus attention on problem areas. Even budget
policy has revealed that information shapes outcomes in
important ways (Demaj,
2017). Information processing as
part of the policy process has been the subject of consid-
erable theorizing, and information plays prominently into
the framing of issues and policy alternatives.
While information use is clearly important, it is also
clear that its study is, at best, bifurcated, and at worst
deeply fragmented. We seek to bring organization and
understanding to this literature at this crucial time in
order to fuel stronger theorization and conceptual devel-
opment that bridges the policy and management divide,
that reveals the array of methodological approaches to its
study, and that reveals the extent to which behavioral
approaches have begun to influence theories of informa-
tion use and influence.
Engaging a topic as broad and fragmented as this—
information use— for a research focus poses certain haz-
ards. Taking a novel approach to the construct, such as
our explicit examination of behavioral concerns, compli-
cates that considerably. In particular, we lack as a starting
point any clear theoretical framework to guide the formu-
lation of testable hypotheses in a traditional deductive
manner. To that end, our work can be characterized as
both exploratory and inductive, seeking to build theory
and understanding from fragments of seemingly uncon-
nected evidence scattered throughout the literature.
Much like factor analysis seeks to define the dimensional-
ity of a dataset, our efforts here seek to define the con-
ceptual dimensionality of an otherwise broad and
amorphous construct, information use. Our purpose can
be best understood as being derived from an epistemo-
logical foundation tied to a generative purpose, poten-
tially constrained by the application of previous
typologies/frameworks. This effort was inspired largely by
the call to open up new avenues of knowledge and
understanding through a reimagination or rethinking of
the silos into which we have previously divided our work.
As Alvesson and Sandberg (
2020) note in their counter-
point to Elsbach and Van Knippenberg’s argument for inte-
grative reviews, “in contrast to the integrative review,
which regards reviews as a‘building exercise’, the proble-
matizing review regards reviews as an‘opening up exer-
cise’ that enables researchers to imagine how to rethink
existing literature in ways that generate new and‘better’
ways of thinking about specific phenomena ” (1290).
Others have made a strong case for a problematizing
approach to literature synthesis to counter overly narrow
conceptualizations of key phenomena (Strader et al.,2023).
RESEARCH DESIGN
Adopting Breslin and Gatrell ’s( 2023) metaphor of a
miner-prospector continuum focused on the degree to
which a literature review project aspires to develop a new
theory, our research qualifies mostly as a miner-like effort
that reaches the middle of the spectrum and heads
toward being a prospector. In fact, our approach spans
from spotting conceptual gaps, organizing and problema-
tizing findings up to transferring theories across domains.
This last component is trackable in the special focus dedi-
cated to articles that adopt a behavioral science
perspective.
Inspired by searching criteria adopted in recent
research syntheses in public administration scholarship
(Andersen et al.,
2016; Battaglio et al., 2019; George
et al., 2021; Pandey et al., 2023), we defined the set of
journals to search for primary studies by considering
those outlets that are simultaneously ranked among the
top 20 in the ISI Thomson Public Administration list and
in the Public Policy and Administration Google Scholar
Metrics list. At the time of our search (i.e., February 2023),
the most updated rankings corresponded to 2021 and
January 2023, respectively. The rationale behind this jour-
nal selection process is twofold. On the one hand, the fact
that a journal is included simultaneously in two rankings
that are independent one from the other — instead of
being listed in any of the two rankings alone— signals its
general relevance for the discipline. Considering the over-
lap between two independent lists might serve as a
methodological advancement compared with existing
research syntheses in public administration that have
relied on a single ranking (e.g., Andersen et al.,
2016;
Battaglio et al., 2019). On the other hand, as both lists
include blind peer-reviewed journals only, any articles
published in such journals would have gone through
peer-review processes aimed at maximizing theoretical
soundness and empirical rigor. All in all, our procedure for
the selection of journals diminishes the probability that
we are ignoring relevant trends in the literature devoted
to understanding the use of information in public admin-
istration and policy decision-making. Based on these cri-
teria, the journals of reference for our research synthesis

are the following 14 (in alphabetical order): Administra-
tion & Society; Governance; Journal of Public
Administration Research and Theory; Policy & Politics; Pol-
icy and Society; Policy Sciences; Policy Studies Journal;
Public Administration; Public Administration Review; Pub-
lic Management Review; Public Money & Management;
Regulation & Governance; Review of Public Personnel
Administration; and The American Review of Public
Administration. In developing our research string, we
focused our keywords on our core research interest: the
use of information for decision-making. The two funda-
mental components of information use and decision-
making form the heart of our research endeavor. As a
result, keywords like“information,”“ use,” and “decision”
naturally emerged. To minimize the risk of false-negative
instances, we chose to avoid combinations of these key-
words, such as “information use. ” Additionally, we
included the term “data” to complement “information,”
recognizing that these two concepts might sometimes be
used interchangeably. To identify potentially relevant arti-
cles, we used the Scopus website and restricted our
search to manuscripts (i) written in English, (ii) classified
as “article” instead of other typologies of outputs, and
(iii) that contained at least one of the words
“information,”“ decision,”“ use,” or “data” in their title.
Precisely, then, our query was as follows:
(TITLE (information) OR TITLE (decision) OR TITLE (use) OR
TITLE (data)) AND (LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE,“Public Adminis-
tration Review”) OR LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE,“Public Man-
agement Review”) OR LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE,“Journal of
Public AdministrationR e s e a r c ha n dT h e o r y”) OR LIMIT-TO
(EXACTSRCTITLE,“The American Review of Public Administra-
tion”) OR LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE,“Policy and Society”)O R
LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE,“Policy Studies Journal”) OR LIMIT-
TO (EXACTSRCTITLE, “Review of Public Personnel Adminis-
tration”) OR LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE,“Governance”)O R
LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE, “

OR LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE, “Administration & Society”)
OR LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE, “Policy & Politics ”)O R
LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE, “Policy Sciences ”) OR LIMIT-
TO (EXACTSRCTITLE, “Regulation & Governance ”)O R
LIMIT-TO (EXACTSRCTITLE, “Public Money & Manage-
ment”)) AND (LIMIT-TO (LANGUAGE, “English”)) AND
(LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE, “ar”))
This process led to the identification of 413 primary
studies. We retained all articles that focused on the use of
information for making decisions. In other words, any
research that explored the use of information to nurture
decisions would meet our inclusion criteria. Conversely,
studies lacking either an information use component or a
focus on decision-making were excluded from our data-
set. As an illustration, we excluded works solely con-
cerned with information sharing if they were not
relevant to information use and decision-making. To safe-
guard intercoder reliability, we began assigning 10 articles
to two authors, who initially screened and coded studies
independently. Afterwards, the two authors conferred to
ensure consistency in coding and discussed any mis-
matches at length until reaching agreement on the code-
book and coding approaches. The remaining articles were
divided randomly and each coded by one author. Each
author cross-checked the coding of the other on a subset
of articles. At a later stage, to further validate intercoder
reliability, the same two authors jointly analyzed 44 addi-
tional articles. For each of the primary studies included in
our final sample, we documented articles’ DOI, journal of
publication, author(s), year of publication, research
design, type of sample analyzed (if any), and geographic
area of reference. Also, we classified primary studies along
the following dimensions: public administration and pol-
icy topic, main feature of the use of information being
investigated, and behavioral public administration frame-
work (if any) and related psychological mechanism inves-
tigated. Figure
1 summarizes the process used for the
selection of primary studies based on the standard and
widely used PRISMA flow diagram (
http://prisma-
statement.org/prismastatement/flowdiagram.aspx).
RESEARCH FINDINGS
The in-depth analysis of primary studies that were
retrieved based on our search criteria returned 162 articles
on the use of information in public administration and
policy decision-making. Results are reported in a series of
tables, whose order mirrors the dimensions targeted by
our review, namely topic, target feature of information,
behavioral focus, sample, research design, and country.
We further include a segmentation by decade in Tables
4
through 6 to enhance readability and elucidate the
observed trends.
Table 1 provides a breakdown of the 162 articles by
journal of publication and public administration and pol-
icy topic. As to the outlet, the vast majority of primary
articles appear in Public Administration Review, which
published about 28 percent of the entire sample of stud-
ies synthesized. About 16 percent of articles are published
in Public Administration and 14 percent in Public Man-
agement Review. These top-three outlets are followed by
the Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory,
counting the publication of about 10 percent of the pri-
mary studies, Policy Sciences with about 8 percent of
primary articles, and Policy Studies Journal and Gover-
nance with 6 percent each. Of the 14 journals that were
included in our search strategy, two have not published
any articles of interest for our work at this point. Those
are Regulation & Governance and Public Money & Man-
agement. The remaining outlets published articles on the
use of information to make decisions that account for a
maximum of 4 percent and a minimum of 2 percent of
the total.
Moving to the main topic investigated, the top two
areas of research for the use of information in decisions
are related to performance management (among the most

of primary studies, equaling the use of data to design and
implement public policies that also accounts for 28 percent
of the sample. These topics are followed by investigations
of the use of information for stakeholder governance

to be the journal that has taken the lead in publishing
research on the use of information to make decisions for
both the most and least investigated topics.
Table
2 portrays the breakdown of our primary studies
classified by the main feature of information being con-
sidered. A subgroup of studies is focused on one feature
only, whereas other studies simultaneously investigate up
to three features of the use of information. Generally
speaking, the range of aspects that previous studies have
explored to gain a better understanding of information
use in decision-making in public administration and pol-
icy tend to be wide. In other words, the variability of key
aspects of information being considered when data use is
concerned is high, with just a handful of features recur-
ring more frequently. The most frequent features being
studied are: information content (19 studies focused on
that feature alone, and 6 additional articles investigate
content in conjunction with other information features)
(e.g., Bel et al.,
2021; Blom-Hansen et al.,2021; DeLeo &
Duarte, 2022; Harrits, 2019; Hong & Kim,2019; Mizrahi &
Minchuk, 2020; Walker et al.,2018; Wang & Niu,2020)a n d
information purpose (18 studies) (e.g., Choi & Woo,2022;

evidence-based information (16 studies with exclusive
focus and 1 study with an additional focus) (e.g., Hall &

(16 studies) (e.g., George, Baekgaard, et al., 2020;
Holm, 2017; Hong et al.,2020; Petersen et al.,2019; van
der Voet & Lems,2022), information availability (10 stud-
ies) (e.g., Boer et al.,2018; Wit & Bekkers,2020), and fram-
ing of information (10 studies interested on framing alone
and an additional study interested on its framing and pur-
pose) (e.g., Belardinelli et al.,
2018; Mikkelsen et al.,2022;
Porumbescu et al.,2021).
Of the 162 primary studies synthesized in our work,
49 adopt a behavioral public administration approach. In
other words, about 30 percent of the available public
administration research on the use of information to
make decisions applies insights from the broader social
science to study how cognitive biases can impinge on
decisions in public administration contexts. Of these stud-
ies, 16 illuminate our understanding of how the accessibil-
ity of information generates systematic patterns of
deviations from rationality in choices (e.g., Demaj,
2017;
Harrits, 2019;R o b e r t s&W e r n s t e d t ,2019), 8 explore loss
aversion in decision-making (e.g., Bellé et al.,2018; James &
Moseley, 2014), and 7 examine how framing effects have
an impact on information use (e.g., Mikkelsen et al.,2022;
van der Voet & Lems,2022). These areas of behaviorally
inspired inquiry are followed by others that examine
bounded rationality (e.g., Walgrave & Dejaeghere,
2017),
nudge theory (e.g., Esmark, 2019), confirmation bias
(e.g., Christensen, 2018), and sector bias (e.g., Meier
et al., 2022). Table 3 portrays the full range of behavioral
mechanisms currently analyzed by public administration
and policy scholarship devoted to better understand how
information are used to make decisions.
Table
4 reports the distribution of studies by typology of
sample unit analyzed (if any) and by decade in which the
article was published. About 20 percent of the papers
explore the use of information in decision-making among
public managers exclusively (among the most recent
Hansen & Nielsen,
2022; Hong & Kim, 2019;
Lewandowski, 2019; Meyfroodt & Desmidt, 2022), about
14 percent among citizens (among the most recent
Christensen & James,
2022;L i n o se ta l . ,2022;M e i e r
et al., 2022), 13 percent among public employees (among
the most recent Choi & Woo,2022; Dimitrijevska-Markoski &
Edward French, 2019), 10 percent based on documents
(among the most recent DeLeo & Duarte,2022; Jungblut &
Jungblut,2022;T u r n e re ta l . ,2022), 9 percent at an organiza-
tional level (e.g., Chen & Greitens,2022; Phillips et al.,2023),
9 percent among elected officials (e.g., Meyfroodt &
Desmidt, 2021;v a nd e rV o e t&L e m s ,2022), 3 percent
among students (e.g., Christensen, 2018;M a r k s&
Gerrits, 2018), and 2 percent are based on big data
(e.g., Giest,2017; Lavertu,2016). In about 11 percent of the
cases, the classification by sample unit is not applicable
because studies are not empirical (e.g., Giest &
Samuels, 2020;M a o r ,2020). Interestingly, the remainder of
studies employ more than one sample, a trend that seems
to be on the rise in the last decade (e.g., Lerusse & van de
Walle, 2022a; Mosley & Gibson,2017).

As for the cross tabulation of studies by research
design and by decade of publication (Table 5), about
28 percent of the primary studies adopt a quantitative
cross-sectional approach (among the most recent Bel
et al., 2021; Meyfroodt & Desmidt, 2021, 2022; Wagner
et al., 2021), 25 percent experimental designs with ran-
domization procedures to assign participants to groups
(among the most recent Christensen & James, 2022;
Grimmelikhuijsen, 2023; Hansen & Nielsen, 2022;
Lindermüller et al., 2022), 20 percent qualitative analysis
(among the most recent Jungblut & Jungblut, 2022;
Phillips et al.,2023; Solorio et al.,2023; Zhu et al.,2022),
11 percent use a normative approach (e.g., Esmark,2019;
Isett & Hicks,2018), 7 percent employs quantitative longi-
tudinal analyses (e.g., Shafran,2022; Wu et al.,2022), and
5 percent espouses mixed methods (e.g., DeLeo &
Duarte, 2022; Head, 2016; Linos et al.,2022). Quantitative
studies with a panel design (Hondula et al.,2018; Hong
et al., 2020), research syntheses (Ruijer et al., 2023;
Somers, 2018), and quantitative analyses based on admin-
istrative data (Hong & Kim,2019) account for 1 percent
each and appear for the first time in the last decade. The
number of studies using randomized control trials or
qualitative inquiries seems to be increasing for the cur-
rent decade compared with the previous decade,
whereas the adoption of mixed methods does not show
evident patterns of rapid growth yet.
Of the 142 studies that specify the country setting
(Table
6), the majority have been conducted in Europe
(42 percent) (among the most recent Linos et al.,2022;
Phillips et al.,2023) or North America (40 percent) (among
the most recent Brunner et al.,2021; Meier et al.,2022).
These are followed by work conducted in Asia (8 percent)

et al., 2022), multiple countries (6 percent) (among the

Australia (3 percent) (e.g., Head,2016; Head et al.,2014),
Africa (1 percent) (Funke et al.,2021), and South America
(1 percent) (Avellaneda,2013). Studies adopting a multi-
country perspective or set in currently underrepresented
continents seem to be on the rise.
As a robustness test for our methods and analyses, we
applied our search and analysis to the journal Public
Performance & Management Review, which did not meet
the criteria for the inclusion of outlets at the time in
which the research was conducted. Knowing that many
journals consider our selected topics of interest, we strove
to focus on those with the widest impact. Because
research that emphasizes performance and the use of
information in management decisions is not limited to
the journals selected using our methodology, we believed
it is necessary to determine whether expanding the
search would adversely shape our findings. Its inclusion
and possibly the inclusions of similar journals would have
increased the number of analyzed studies without, how-
ever, changing the nature of findings and derivation of
our framework.
1
Overall, our findings suggest that research into the
use of information in public decision-making has focused
on three independent components that can be summa-
rized in one comprehensive framework. The first factor
refers to objective features of the piece of information,
with those features defining the information architecture.
Information architects and users design and edit the con-
text in which the objective information features are set.
Examples of objective features of information, include, for
instance, its content (Bozeman & Pandey,
2004); format—
for instance, whether information is presented in a textual
or visual form (Isett & Hicks,
2018); nature— for instance,
whether it is routine or nonroutine (Tantardini, 2019);
purpose— for instance, whether the aim for the usage is
to assess past performance or make decisions for future
interventions (Belardinelli et al., 2018) or benchmark
(Ammons & Rivenbark, 2008); or source— for instance,
whether the institution providing the information is pub-
lic or private (Lerusse & van de Walle,2022a). In short,
information architecture encompasses objective features
of information, which are inherently numerous and het-
erogeneous in nature.

1As a robustness test for our methods and analyses, we applied our search and
analysis to the journalPublic Performance & Management Review. In other words,
we applied the searching string and inclusion criteria that we previously adopted
for all the other journals to a single journal that, albeit not meeting our outlet
inclusion criteria, is potentially specialized on the study of information use in
decision-making in the context of public administration. This search returned
44 articles published in Public Performance & Management Review. Of those, upon
the screening of abstracts and full papers that two of the authors made jointly,
12 were deemed appropriate for inclusion in the study and were hence coded. As
to the topic that these studies investigate, nine focus on performance
management, two focus on budgeting and finance, and 1 focuses on stakeholder
governance. The main feature(s) of information being studied are as follows:
content (4 studies), format (3), content and source (1), asymmetry (1), availability
(1), purpose (1), and source (1). Among the 12 articles, only 4 adopt a behavioral
perspective, with 2 studies looking at the mechanism of accessibility, 1 of
bounded rationality, and 1 of reference dependence. All in all, the inclusion of
Public Performance & Management Review and possibly similar journals would
have increased the number of analyzed studies without, however, changing the
nature of findings. In fact, the topics, target feature(s) of information, behavioral
focus, sample, research design, and country of the 12 studies published in Public
Performance & Management Review already emerged from the articles published
in outlets that met our inclusion criteria.

The second component of the parsimonious model of
information use in public decision-making that our litera-
ture review isolates is related to the subjective mecha-
nisms of the use of information that might trigger
systematic cognitive biases or nurture variability in the
form of decision noise. For example, keeping the objec-
tive features of information constant, different degrees of
actual understanding, ease of recall, framing effects, or
loss aversion may jump in (Belardinelli et al.,
2018; Bellé
et al.,2018; Olsen,2017). Public administration and policy
decisions are a prime example of mental operations
called judgments (Kahneman et al., 2021). Kahneman
et al. (2021) argue that“some judgments are biased; they
are systematically off target. Other judgments are noisy,
as people who are expected to agree end up at very dif-
ferent points around the target” (2021, 9). According to
their reasoning, bias and noise are two independent com-
ponents of overall error. Specifically, bias is the average of
errors and noise is the variability of errors. When informa-
tion users make decisions based on a given information
architecture with certain objective features, subjective
mechanisms might influence the likelihood that they will
fall prey to systematic bias or that different individuals
will opt for significantly different solutions in identical
cases.
The third component of the framework speaks to the
type of user as a variable that moderates the relationship
between objective information features and subjective
mechanisms of information use. Examples of different
typologies of users include Econs versus Humans,
machines versus humans, individuals with low versus
high field expertise, or decision makers versus decision
recipients. Figure
2 provides a graphical representation of
this framework, in which the three components are mutu-
ally exclusive and should help organize future work for
the advancement of our understanding of information
use in public decision-making. As illustrated in Figure
2,
our framework posits an interaction between objective
features of information (i.e., information architecture) and
type of information user on information use. Moreover,
the interplay and dynamics among the three components
are influenced by contextual factors, such as organiza-
tional culture (Andersen & Moynihan,
2016) or institu-
tional features (George, Baekgaard, et al.,2020).

ing and conceptual development in scholarly and

practical understanding of information use in public
administration and policy decision-making. This is rele-
vant to bridge the policy and management divide,
uncover the array of methodological approaches to its
study, and reveal the extent to which behavioral
approaches might contribute to its advancement from
the microlevel perspective. We did so by standing some-
where in between the miner-prospector continuum with
an inductive and generative goal. Specifically, we spotted
conceptual gaps, organized and problematized insights,
and noted the transfer of theories across domains. This
approach translated into the identification of three inde-
pendent components of information use in public admin-
istration and policy decision-making. These components
are the information architecture that entail objective fea-
tures, the information use where the microlevel subjective
mechanisms jump in, and the type of information users
that can moderate the relationship between the two
other variables. Additionally, contextual factors should be
taken into account to investigate the interplay and
dynamics among such components. These pave the way
to the identification of a parsimonious list of recommen-
dations, which we present and discuss below.
Our literature review indicates that the academic
understanding of information use in core public policy
and administration decision domains is not yet compre-
hensive. For instance, compared with other topics— most
notably performance information (Choi & Woo,
2022;
Christensen & James, 2022; Desmidt & Meyfroodt, 2023;
Grøn & Kristiansen, 2022; Kroll, 2015c; Lerusse & van de
Walle, 2022a, 2022b; Meier et al., 2022; Mikkelsen
et al., 2022; Pandey, 2015; Tantardini, 2022; Vogel &
Hattke, 2018)— scant research has so far focused on infor-
mation use to manage unforeseen public emergencies
(Bel et al.,2021; George, Verschuere, et al.,2020; Phillips
et al.,2023; Wu et al.,2022), to adopt artificial intelligence
and algorithm-determined decisions in a way that take
accounts of its promise and perils, and to reduce adminis-
trative burdens when citizens interact with government
or civil servants interact with their institutions. This seems
especially unfortunate considering Herbert Simon’s recog-
nition that“decision-making is at the heart of administra-
tion” (1947, xi). Our synthesis unveils that information use
for decisions made under public emergencies has been
explored in the context of tornado warning (Robinson
et al.,
2019) and the Covid-19 pandemic (Bel et al.,2021;
George, Baekgaard, et al., 2020; George, Verschuere,
et al., 2020; Phillips et al.,2023;W ue ta l . ,2022) focusing
on consequential individuals’ behaviors or benchmarking
across governments.
As to the opportunity of letting artificial intelligence
instead of human decision makers use information, few top-
notch studies discuss how information produced by algo-
rithms introduce the novel opportunity of statistical predic-
tion for real-life situations (Hartmann & Wenzelburger,
2021)
or whether and how access to and ease of understanding of
automated algorithms have an impact on trust
(Grimmelikhuijsen,2023). We anticipate and encourage an
increase in the count of such studies in the coming years
due to recent trends. To wit, the current accountability lan-
guage of the policy elite emphasizes increased reliance on
information through their admonition to follow the science,
to engage in evidence-based practice, and to implement
proven programs. As to the field of administrative burden, a
randomized controlled trial in Greece demonstrates that rea-
sonably up to date communication technologies may back-
fire and increase — rather than decrease — recipients’
burdens of seeking information about free government ser-
vices. Importantly, the negative impact is larger for the most
disadvantaged segments of the population, that is, those

that the policy targets and aims at helping through a reduc-
tion in administrative burdens. To solicit information for free
dental care services, in fact, participants were more likely to
use traditional communication tools— in the form of a pre-
paid postcard and a postcard requiring postage— than more
modern tools— namely a hotline or email (Linos et al.,
2022).
Based on these elements, we formulate the following rec-
ommendation to advance research and practice into infor-
mation use for public decision-making.
Recommendation 1. Strengthening research
into evidence-based information use in
public decision-making beyond the study of
performance information
Furthermore, our research synthesis reveals a number of
information features that can naturally connect two litera-
ture streams, namely the one that is concentrated on the
use of information for public decision-making (Kroll,
2015a)
to the one devoted to the application of behavioral science
insights to public administration and policy challenges
(Battaglio et al.,
2019). In particular, features such as data
availability, format, framing, purpose, or supporting evi-
dence are variables that behavioral public administration
scholars also study in depth because of their impact on
judgment errors and decision variability (Ballard,
2020;
Belle et al., 2022;O l s e n ,2017). Even more telling for the
establishment of a bridge between the two literature
streams is the fact that about one third of the primary arti-
cles synthesized in our work explicitly employ a behavioral
science lens to address information use issues. Behavioral
public administration was decidedly formalized in our dis-
cipline less than a decade ago as the “interdisciplinary
analysis of public administration from the microlevel per-
spective of individual behavior and attitudes by drawing
on recent advances in our understanding of the underlying
psychology and behavior of individuals and groups ”
(Grimmelikhuijsen et al.,
2017, 46). Afterward, a systematic
review traced the origins of behavioral public administrator
back to its roots (Battaglio et al.,2019)a n dac r i t i c a lr e f l e c -
tion isolated where the behavioral public administration is
currently on track and where route adjustments might be
needed (Bhanot & Linos,
2020). By integrating rational
choice models for decision-making, a few decades of main-
stream behavioral science research have revealed that
decision makers tend to be prone to judgment error in the
form of predictable deviation from rationality, the so-called
cognitive biases (Kahneman,
2011). Alongside bias, the
most recent developments in behavioral science work
have theorized unwanted variability in decisions, the so-
called noise (Kahneman et al.,
2021). When studying judg-
ment errors across fields, it is imperative to consider bias
and noise simultaneously because they do not cancel out
each other but rather add up. When a group of public
managers make estimations that are similar though far
away from the target, decisions are biased. When a group
of public managers make different decisions in the face
of the same information, their judgments are subject to
noise. Interestingly, both bias and noise can sometimes be
reduced through nudges (Kahneman et al.,
2021;T h a l e r
and Sunstein 2021). Furthermore, cognitive biases and
decision noise resonate with very recent research on over-/
under-reaction to irrelevant information features and deci-
sion heterogeneity, respectively (Bordalo et al.,
2023).
Overall, drawing on the full set of perspectives —
which currently range from rational choice approaches to
the study of departures from rationality in the form of
bias and noise — might accelerate our understanding
of information use in public administration and policy
decision-making. The information architecture that deter-
mines objective information features might be informed
by rationality, whereas the study of the use of information
that different individuals make and their subjective mech-
anisms might leverage on predictable irrationality and
unwanted variability. This investment might bring mean-
ingful returns in balancing the import– export ratio of the-
ories among disciplines (Breslin & Gatrell,
2023) and
diminishing the time required to close the science –
practice gap (Perry, 2012). Additionally, such an invest-
ment could easily connect nascent attempts to include
both a microlevel perspective (e.g., Bjørnholt et al.,
2016;
Pfiffner, 2019; Rubin et al.,2023; Tantardini, 2022; Zhang
et al.,2016) and contextual factors— such as social capital
(Tantardini & Kroll,2015)— into the analysis of information
use in making decisions. Based on these insights, we for-
mulate the following recommendation to advance the
theorizing of information use for public decision-making.
Recommendation 2. Theorizing about the
use of information in public decision-making
should distinguish objective features of
information, subjective mechanisms
of information use, and user characteristics,
while also taking context into account
The final reflection goes to the research designs and
methods that, with regard to the state of the art, should
drive future scholarly efforts dedicated to providing an
overarching understanding of information use in public
decision-making. Our synthesis of the literature unveils a
prevalence of primary studies that employs a single
method, sample, and site. Eight studies in our review
adopted a mixed-methods approach, collecting data on a
single sample in a single continent (e.g., Harrits,
2019;
Linos et al.,2022; Newman et al.,2016). Two primary arti-
cles in our synthesis used multiple samples in different
countries with a single method (Bellamy et al.,
2008;
Blom-Hansen et al., 2021). Randomized controlled trials
are the gold standard for establishing the why in cause-
and-effect relationship. In other words, randomized
experiments are the most efficient tool to get an unbi-
ased estimate of the impact of a deliberate treatment.

Compared with other designs and methodologies, they
score higher on the internal validity of inference. Observa-
tional research is better suited to illuminate the micro-
mechanisms behind an observed effect, thus providing
indications about the how an outcome comes about.
Observational research scores higher on external validity
and can have a quantitative or a qualitative nature. In par-
ticular, qualitative methodologies appear to be the best
candidates to get a deeper understanding of the mecha-
nisms through which cause and effect sequences hold. In
the words of Shadish et al. (
2002), randomized controlled
trials have a unique strength in providing a causal
description— aka molar causation, that is, describing the
consequences attributable to deliberately varying a
treatment— and are less suited to giving causal
explanations— aka as molecular causation, that is, clarifying
the chain reactions through which and the conditions
under which those causal relationships hold. The system-
atic triangulation of experimental results with insights from
observational research through mixed methods and stud-
ies across samples and sites hold the promise of creating
rigorous findings at an unprecedented pace (e.g., Hendren
et al.,
2018). Realizing this potential seems to be facilitated
by technological advancements and international networks
of scholars. Based on these considerations, we formulate
the third recommendation below.
Recommendation 3. Time seems ripe to
leverage on a diverse combination of mixed-
methods, multisample, and/or multisite
research designs to sustain the study of
information use in public administration and
policy decision-making
Our research synthesis is not immune to the same limita-
tions that affect work of the same nature. Hence, findings
and recommendations should be understood and used
under this light. Most notably, a number of judgment calls
were necessary to define the search algorithm, isolate the
key variables to be coded, and the coding taxonomies.
The choices were meant to establish a reasonable balance
between relevance and feasibility. In the same vein, the
criteria we adopted to select the top peer-reviewed jour-
nals included in our review may have inherent limitations,
such as the exclusion of potentially relevant general or
specialized publication outlets. At the same time, how-
ever, we are convinced that considering the journals
listed both in the ISI Thomson Public Administration and
in the Public Policy and Administration Google Scholar
Metrics represents a methodological improvement com-
pared with similar research syntheses that rely on a single
list of top peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Andersen
et al.,
2016; Battaglio et al.,2019). Similar concerns may
extend to the selection of keywords for the search of pri-
mary studies. In particular, future research could expand
the scope of our synthesis to include additional
constructs. Another limitation that our synthesis shares
with similar work is the inability of providing a precise
number of disagreements between authors in coding arti-
cles because the review process happened in multiple
stages, and we did not keep track of all disagreements as
we moved from one stage to the next. This concern
might especially apply to the classification of articles by
topic where the breadth and depth of coding taxonomies
is inherently difficult. The disclosure of such choices and
the rule of full agreement among coder to move forward
only work as a partial remedy to each judgment calls. Nat-
urally, our inductive approach also carries inherent limita-
tions, which we explicitly acknowledge. Allowing themes
to emerge from the data without predefined typologies
potentially threatens the ability to pinpoint a set of con-
structs that is collectively exhaustive to understand infor-
mation use in decision-making. However, the adoption of
an inductive rather than a deductive approach is linked to
the absence of comprehensive theoretical frameworks
that have the same focus and scope as our effort and is
tied to the generative purpose of our endeavor. Certainly,
future work that tests the validity of our components of
information use in public administration and policy
decision-making is needed.
CONCLUSION
By integrating information architecture, subjective mecha-
nisms of information use, and a typology of information
users, while also taking context into account, we capture
the essence of the literature on information use in public
policy and management decision-making. Doing so pro-
vides a stronger conceptual framework for those interested
in studying evidence-based policy and practice, or the
potential for inherent bias introduced by an information
orientation. The concomitant rise in artificial intelligence
and other mechanisms for rapidly aggregating and proces-
sing information suggests that developing this conceptual
capacity is due, if not overdue. Collectively, the constructs
shed light on where and why we might expect to encoun-
ter bias or noise in the decision-making process, and con-
sequently offer guidance for developing novel theoretical
and empirical work to study the role of information in
decision-making. Likewise, our recommendations pinpoint
the ongoing importance of inquiry in this area. To confront
existing and emerging challenges requires that we under-
stand how evidence-based information is used in public
decisions. New theory and research on information must
better distinguish and clarify the objective features of infor-
mation, subjective attributes of its use, and the characteris-
tics of its users to develop a full and complete accounting
of information’s role. And finally, we are at a point where
all elements of research designs and methodologies will
benefit from enhanced rigor and diversity.
All of this discussion of information use in decision-
making is important, and it reveals how information use

may be biased, or subject to influence, in important policy
and management decision settings. It is relevant to point
out in conclusion that the application of our findings
requires further broadening in today’s age. Because man-
agers are not just looking at facts on paper, information is
increasingly subject to processing, aggregation, and manip-
ulation. To the extent information use is subject to behav-
ioral influences, our concerns must also be expanded to
incorporate information technology, including the systems
and processes used to collect and analyze data, converting
it into useable information along the way. Information is
power, and learning to better wield it will result in improve-
ments to policy, implementation, and the public good.
