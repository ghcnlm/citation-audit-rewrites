ABSTRACT
Collaborative learning is an extensively used instructional technique by which individuals interact in small
groups to learn to solve academic problems. This study aimed to determine the impact of task-speciﬁc prior
knowledge on individual learners and collaborative groups that were instructed to collaborate. A 2 (individual
vs. collaborative group) × 2 (novice vs. knowledgeable learners) factorial experiment with 228 students was
carried out to examine the eﬀects of these treatments on performance and mental eﬀort in learning and its
outcomes. As expected, knowledgeable individuals and knowledgeable collaborative groups outperformed no-
vice individuals and novice collaborative groups in learning outcomes. Less knowledgeable, collaborating
learners outperformed less knowledgeable, individual learners in learning outcomes. While more knowledgeable
collaborating and individual learners performed equally well in the learning phase and the delayed test, on the
retention test, collaborative groups demonstrated better performance. In general, collaboration bene ﬁted
learning compared to individual learning in complex tasks, but performance depended on the learner task-
speciﬁc prior knowledge.
1. Introduction
Collaborative learning is an extensively used instructional tech-
nique. It refers to the process by which individuals interact in small
groups to learn to solve academic problems (
Slavin, 2014). However,
literature indicates that learning in groups is not always associated with
better learning compared to individual learning (
Clinton & Kohlmeyer,
2005; Morgan & Tindale, 2002; Shibley & Zimmaro, 2002; Tindale,
1993; Weldon, Blair, & Huebsch, 2000).
This article begins with a short discussion of the importance of
developing eﬀective collaborative groups (i.e., team formation) and
reveals that the results of research in this area are inconclusive. That
being said, from an instructional perspective data indicate that pro-
viding explicit guidance on how to collaborate on highly demanding
tasks may help collaborative groups to take advantage of inter-in-
dividual activities for learning. The discussion on developing colla-
borative groups is followed by a review of collaborative learning re-
search from a cognitive load theory (CLT) perspective (
Sweller, Ayres,
& Kalyuga, 2011). The experiment carried out here examined whether,
taking prior knowledge into account, collaborative groups are more
eﬀective than individual learners when they are prepared to learn
collaboratively with highly-complex tasks. Groups were prepared for
collaboration via explicit guidance on how to work together con-
sidering the characteristics of the tasks.
1.1. Promoting successful collaboration
One way to maximize collaborative learning is to develop colla-
borative groups to be eﬀective. Research on team development suggests
that a collaborative group is eﬀective when it develops shared mental
models, mutual performance monitoring, and interpersonal trust
(
Fransen, Kirschner, & Erkens, 2011), positive social interdependence
(D. W. Johnson & Johnson, 2009) or social cohesion (Sharan & Sharan,
1992). This assumes that high-performing groups require extensive
periods of time (Gersick, 1988; S. D. Johnson, Suriya, Won Yoon,
Berrett, & La Fleur, 2002). However, research shows that collaborative
group development is not always associated with higher performance.
For example, concerning cohesion (i.e., the progressive tendency for a
group to stick together in the pursuit of instrumental goals), a meta-
analysis showed that the cohesion-performance relationship was
stronger for tasks requiring high interdependence such as commu-
nication, coordination, and mutual performing monitoring (

Devine, & Whitney, 2012). However, a subsequent meta-analysis re-
examining this relationship found that cohesion had a lower eﬀect size
with increasing performance, decreasing even further when the mea-
sure of cohesion was more general (
Castaño, Watts, & Tekleab, 2013).
From an instructional perspective, there is also evidence that sug-
gests that learners can take advantage of collaborative work when they
receive guidance on how to collaborate rather than waiting for colla-
borative groups to develop naturally. For example,
Buchs, Gilles,
Antonietti, and Butera (2015)used 10 min to instruct group members
on collaborative skills. They found that learning in dyads with in-
structional support on how to work together produces better learning
outcomes compared to learning individually or collaboratively without
instructional support.
Prichard, Bizo, and Stratford (2006)examined
the beneﬁts of guiding collaborative members on how to work in groups
with three cohorts. In general, they found that the cohort that received
instructions on how to collaborate outperformed the cohort that was
not trained and that the beneﬁts of the collaboration guide could be lost
when the collaborative group members split up into new groups.
Group development and instructional approaches have in common
that collaborative groups should have some experience or guidance in
working together. A factor in this might be task complexity as a de-
terminant of the eﬀectiveness of learners who have been prepared to
collaborate compared to individual learners. Task complexity is a
concern that has been extensively studied within a CLT framework.
1.2. Collaboration from a cognitive load theory perspective
CLT is an instructional perspective based on human cognitive ar-
chitecture (
Sweller, Van Merriënboer, & Paas, 2019). It suggests that
when acquiring and automating complex knowledge (e.g., school do-
mains) instructors should provide proper guidance keeping task com-
plexity within working memory capacity which can be as low as two
elements (
Gilchrist & Cowan, 2011) and considering whether long-term
memory structures facilitate or impair learning ( Kalyuga, Ayres,
Chandler, & Sweller, 2003). Cognitive load refers to the load on
working memory when processing information (Sweller et al., 2011).
CLT researchers have presented evidence that students learn better
when they process task information within the boundaries of working
memory (
Sweller et al., 2011). If tasks are complex and little knowledge
is stored in long-term memory, learners experience overload and per-
formance decays.
Collaborative learning is an emerging research topic in CLT. Under
some circumstances group interactions can be a source of cognitive load
associated with a collaborative learning task (P. A. Kirschner, Sweller,
Kirschner, & Zambrano R., 2018). However, evidence of the advantages
of collaborative learning compared with individual learning is not al-
ways consistent. On the one hand, there is evidence that a collabora-
tion-based approach may be more beneﬁcial than individual learning
when problems are highly complex and when information is distributed
among diﬀerent working memories. Investigations by F.
Kirschner,
Paas, and Kirschner (2009, 2011; 2011) suggest that groups may be
more eﬀective and eﬃcient because members can make use of each
other's working memory resources (the collective working memory ef-
fect; F.
Kirschner, Paas, & Kirschner, 2011). The collective working
memory eﬀect holds that collaborative learning is more eﬀective than
individual learning when the complexity of the learning material is high
(F.
Kirschner, Paas, & Kirschner, 2011). Sharing information processing
of learning materials among the collaborative group members who
share working memory resources permits better comprehension and
knowledge acquisition of the to be learned tasks. This eﬀect seems to
occur when the beneﬁts of reducing cognitive load due to information
distribution (i.e., making learners depend on each other's information)
are higher than the cognitive costs incurred in communication and
coordination activities (i.e., transactional activities). F.
Kirschner, Paas,
and Kirschner (2011)also found that for low-complexity tasks, colla-
borative learning was redundant since group members achieved equal
or lower performance and eﬃciency scores than individuals. An inter-
esting result in F.Kirschner, Paas, and Kirschner (2011)is that group
members perceived a higher perception of mental eﬀort in the learning
phase which was related to a higher performance and eﬃciency on the
posttest.
On the other hand, evidence suggests that collaboration does not
improve learning either low- nor high-complexity tasks compared with
individual learning. Investigations by
Retnowati, Ayres, and Sweller
(2010, 2016) investigated the eﬀect of conventional problems and
worked-out examples (worked examples) on individual and collabora-
tive learning. They found that in some high-complexity tasks, in-
dividuals performed better than groups. They also found that working
in collaborative groups was more beneﬁcial than working alone in
problem-solving tasks. In general, Retnowati et al. concluded that at
least under some circumstances, especially when using worked ex-
amples collaborative learning is not better than individual learning
either in high or low complex tasks. Unlike the Kirschner et al. study,
task information was not distributed among members in these studies.
Curiously, in the learning phase of the second experiment (
Retnowati,
Ayres, & Sweller, 2016), individual learners outperformed groups in
high-complexity tasks with a signiﬁcantly higher cognitive load.
When considering prior knowledge, there are also mixed results.
Zhang, Kalyuga, Lee, Lei, and Jiao (2015) explored collaborative
learning when grouping learners by their scores of the previous year.
Learners with lower scores were collaboratively grouped and categor-
ized as less knowledgeable learners (with lower prior knowledge), and
those with higher score as advanced learners (higher prior knowledge).
The latter did not receive instruction on the domain-speciﬁc learning
task. Researchers found that heterogeneous groups (i.e., groups in-
cluding novice and advanced learners) favored lower prior knowledge
learners, whereas for more knowledgeable learners, homogeneity was
redundant. Moreover, individuals with higher prior domain knowledge
marginally outperformed homogeneous and heterogeneous groups.
Zhang, Kalyuga, Lee, and Lei (2016)replicated this study and obtained
similar results. These studies are limited because novice and advanced
students were not grouped using prior knowledge speciﬁcally related to
the learning tasks.
Retnowati, Ayres, and Sweller (2018)performed a study manip-
ulating prior knowledge of learning tasks. Participants had either in-
complete or complete prior knowledge and compared collaborative
groups with individual learning. Interaction analyses revealed that
when learners have gaps in their knowledge base, collaborative
learning is superior to individual learning. However, when learners
have complete prior knowledge, individual learning is superior to col-
laborative learning. They also found that individual learning condition
participants with complete prior knowledge for all learning tasks (in-
dividual-complete knowledge condition) outperformed collaboration
with complete and incomplete knowledge and individual with in-
complete knowledge conditions in transfer tasks. However, the re-
searchers did not compare complex and simple tasks. It is not yet clear
whether these results would vary if the complexity of the tasks is in-
creased to the point that individual learners with complete prior
knowledge still need to rely on other group members’ working memory
resources.
Considering prior knowledge in collaborative learning also can pose
challenges in predicting cognitive load. If group members are advanced,
learning collaboratively may be harmful because transaction activities
demand working memory resources resulting in increases in cognitive
load. However, if the task has a very high level of interactive elements
and peers have partially developed previous knowledge, it can be ex-
pected that the collaboration is beneﬁcial. Thus, demands on working
memory may increase if collaboration is unnecessary and decrease if
collaborating partners have useful knowledge with group members
taking advantage of partially developed schemas to re ﬁne their
knowledge in a learning situation (i.e., reexposure eﬀect;
Rajaram &
Pereira-Pasarin, 2010). These two opposing eﬀects on working memory

demands may counteract each other.
1.3. The present study
Task complexity, information distribution (member inter-
dependence), and prior knowledge are factors that may explain the
advantage of collaborative learning. However, the inconclusive results
seem to suggest that grouping learners to collaborate does not ne-
cessarily promote better learning (
Gillies, 2016). Also, currently there
are no data from CLT-based studies about preparing groups to colla-
borate (see section
1.1).
Instructing students how to work collaboratively on speciﬁc tasks
may be a category of domain-generalized knowledge (Kalyuga, 2013)a t
the group level (P. A. Kirschner, Sweller, Kirschner, & Zambrano,
2018). Knowledge about how to collaborate may work better when it is
built into a domain-speciﬁc task. When this type of knowledge is
learned in task-speciﬁc situations, it may be retrieved from long-term
memory and used in similar tasks through analogical transfer (Gick &
Holyoak, 1980). For example, a group of learners may better learn
problems of linear demand and supply curves in an administration
subject if they previously learned to solve problems of linear equations
in mathematics compared to another group of learners who did not
work on mathematics tasks as a team. Group members may transfer
their experience from one task situation to another byﬁnding corre-
spondences through schema induction (
Gick & Holyoak, 1980). Gen-
eralized domain-knowledge on collaborative work may explain why
learners who are prepared to work together are more eﬀective than
individual learners (
Buchs et al., 2015; Prichard et al., 2006).
This study is aﬁrst step to attempt to close this gap. Accordingly,
this experiment examined the eﬀect of learning in groups instructed to
collaborate vs. learning individually and the eﬀect of prior knowledge
level on performance and mental eﬀort with high-complexity problems.
The hypotheses were:
H1. When learning individually, students with more knowledge will
outperform and invest less mental e ﬀort than students with less
knowledge.
H2. When learning in collaborative groups, students with more
knowledge will outperform students with less knowledge but the
counteractive e ﬀects on mental e ﬀort when more and less
knowledgeable students collaborate cannot be precisely determined.
H3. For learners with less knowledge, collaborative learning groups
will outperform and perceive less mental eﬀort than individual learning
groups.
H4. For learners with more knowledge, learning in collaborative groups
will become detrimental and no advantage to learning in collaborative
groups will be found.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
This study was conducted with 228 students (135 females, 93
males) of a large, public high school in Sangolquí, Ecuador. Their
average age was 15.87 years (SD = 0.745). The study was part of the
mathematics classes and received approval from the local ethical
committee. Participants did not have prior knowledge of the learning
phase tasks because it is not included in the content of the very strict
national curriculum which explicitly prohibits teaching topics not in the
curriculum. Further, teachers at the school conﬁrmed that they had not
previously taught the content of the learning tasks and that all parti-
cipants came from the same school. Finally, participants were randomly
assigned to the conditions to exclude any systematic prior knowledge
diﬀerences. Participants were noti ﬁed of the study and received
academic compensation of 10 points for voluntary participation.
2.2. Design and procedure
A 2 (collaborative learning vs. individual learning) x 2 (less vs. more
knowledgeable learners) factorial design was used. Dependent variables
were performance and mental eﬀort. The study was conducted inﬁve
phases: preparation, prior knowledge instruction, learning, retention
testing, and delayed testing. Each phase consisted of multiple sessions
of 45 min. Three instructors and the experimenter guided participants
throughout all phases of the study. The experimenter supervised the
procedure to guarantee interventionﬁdelity. All instructions were read
aloud.
The ﬁve phases entailed:
1. Preparation: Construct collaboration schemas using the previously
learned domain-speciﬁc task of solving quadratic equations and
emphasizing collaborative work. Half of the participants formed 3-
person collaborative groups (collaborative group condition), and the
other half worked individually (individual condition). This phase
consisted of four sessions over one week.
2. Prior knowledge instruction: Half of each of the collaborative group
and individual conditions received instruction on how to calculate a
break-even point (BEP). This phase comprised one session on the
day following the preparatory phase.
3. Learning: All participants received the same learning tasks to cal-
culate the BEP either as individuals or in teams. This phase com-
prised one session on the day following the prior knowledge in-
struction phase.
4. Retention testing: Similar problems with only the name of the costs
and their values varied from the learning tasks were used to evaluate
the outcomes of the collaborative and individual learning conditions
one day after the learning phase.
5. Delayed testing: Similar retention testing problems but seven days
after the learning phase.
The preparation phase began in the second week of the new school
term, after two months of school vacation, to reduce eﬀects of having
previously worked together. Participants were randomly assigned to
two conditions: individual learning and collaborative groups. All lear-
ners worked on solving quadratic equations. There were no time re-
straints on theﬁrst tasks, but 10 min were allotted to solve theﬁnal two
tasks from the second session onwards (a digital clock was placed in
front of the class); writing was permitted only for theﬁnal answer.
Instructors encouraged members to interact with each other, to share
their values and coordinate calculations among themselves, and dis-
couraged non-task conversations. Participants received the correct an-
swers at the end of each session and were asked to think about how they
may collaborate better on the following tasks.
In theprior knowledge instruction phase, half of the participants were
randomly selected to receive additional instruction. Each learner re-
ceived a booklet with the concepts of the BEP and a worked example on
how to solve a problem (8 min). After studying the booklet, they solved
three conventional problems individually (7 min each) using the
worked example of the booklet as assistance. After solving each pro-
blem, they received the worked example of the three problems and
were asked to compare their results and correct their mistakes.
Moreover, learners were asked if they had questions to clarify any step
for calculating the BEP. Instructors made sure all learners had corrected
the errors to foster problem-solving understanding. The other half of
the participants received a theoretical class about the topic of the new
term, real number properties, which was unrelated to the BEP.
In the learning phase, only individuals and groups that had com-
pleted the previous phases participated. An a priori analysis with a
power of .8 and a medium-size eﬀect (i.e., 0.06;
Cohen, 1998) revealed
that the study required 32 individuals for the individual learning

condition or 11 triadic groups for the collaborative learning condition
to reliably test the hypotheses (see Results section). Collaborative group
members remained in their groups to maintain the previous schemas of
working together (
Prichard et al., 2006 ). Groups and individuals
worked on three tasks to calculate the BEP (9 min for task 1, 8 min for
tasks 2 and 3 = 25 min). As in the preparation phase, the instructors
encouraged group members to share their values and to coordinate the
calculations to solve each problem. If a collaborative group or in-
dividual solved the task before the time assigned, that group or in-
dividual was required to wait to start the next problem. All problems
were solved mentally. Using paper and pencil was only permitted for
recording the ﬁnal answer and indicating the mental eﬀort after com-
pleting each task.
In theretention and delayed test phases, participants were required
to individually solve three conventional problems in 30 min, 10 min per
problem. They were asked to write the calculations for each step of the
problems and scored the amount of mental eﬀort invested in each
problem. If a student was absent from the retention test, s/he was al-
lowed to take the delayed test and vice-versa because each test was
analyzed independently. No case, thus, needed to be deleted.
2.3. Materials
The materials were in the domain of mathematics and economics.
The preparation phase consisted of solving quadratic equations, while
the remaining phases involved calculating BEPs. All materials were
paper-based and presented in booklets.
2.3.1. Preparation phase
Quadratic equations are compulsory in the national curriculum, and
the participants had already received instruction the previous year. All
tasks were designed and assigned with a completion strategy scaf-
folding approach (
Van Merriënboer, 1990) as follows: theﬁrst session
began with an introduction about quadratic equations and two worked
examples showing how to solve them using the factoring method during
prior knowledge activation. Five rules on how to solve the equations
collaboratively were given and explained to the collaborative group
condition, followed by a worked example showing how each group
member should apply them (see supplementary material), and a con-
ventional task with the correct answer. Examples of the rules are: When
it is possible to perform the calculations without the help of others, do it
alone and continually rehearse the results to avoid forgetting them. For
the collaborative group condition, we manipulated the task informa-
tion, unpacking the equation values to distribute them among group
members (e.g., for −45x
2, each member would receive−15x2), re-
quiring each learner to depend on other members to solve the problem.
This manipulation also had the purpose of providing prior experience
for the information distribution of the learning tasks. Each member
received diﬀerent values for solving the same equation and a table in
which they could write down the intermediate steps (see supplementary
material). The individual condition participants received the same va-
lues and the table.
In the second session, both conditions received the rules of colla-
boration, two conventional problems with correct answers, and a con-
ventional problem without the correct answer again. The conventional
problems had six values, two for each group member; individuals re-
ceived all values. In the third and fourth sessions, both collaborative
groups and individuals received three conventional quadratic equation
problems without correct answers, with six to nine values (e.g.,
− + −−+ =− + +xx x x x x10 5 50 50 200 1 50 50 10022 2).
2.3.2. Prior knowledge instruction phase
One way to acquire generalizable domain-speciﬁc collaboration
schemas may be to use diﬀerent tasks but with analogous features.
Calculating the BEP is a problem with similar characteristics to quad-
ratic equations such as: requiring a combination of several numerical
values, using basic mathematical operations, calculating partial an-
swers, holding them in working memory, andﬁnding a single correct
answer. The material included a brief explanation of the BEP and a
worked example (see
Table 1 and steps in Table 2). It also included
three conventional problems that were similar to those used in the
learning phase, and their corresponding resolution process (worked
examples).
2.3.3. Learning phase
Each participant received the concepts of the BEP, two worked ex-
amples, prompt questions, three learning tasks, and a piece of paper
with examples ofﬁxed and variable costs and the BEP in unit's formula
(see step 6,
Table 2). The booklet explained the BEP and the types of
costs (i.e., ﬁxed and variable costs, variable cost per unit, and total
costs), the contribution, and the BEP both in units and sales. The
worked examples contained a 7-step procedure (see
Table 2). Examples
of prompt questions were: What was the diﬀerence between the BEPs in
units and sales? How did you calculate the contribution? Examples of
ﬁxed and variable costs were provided to avoid confusion during the
learning phase.
Participants from the collaborative group and individual conditions
received the same learning tasks. Task complexity level was determined
using the method of
Sweller and Chandler (1994), which counts the
number of items and operations that must be considered and processed
in working memory to solve the task. As presented in
Table 2, the 7-step
procedure to solve each problem comprised nine items that must be
integrated during 8 min to obtain a single correct answer (
Table 2). Like
the equations of the preparation phase, no step could be solved without
all members sharing and working together on their items. Each member
needed to depend on other's information. A group member received a
ﬁxed cost, a variable cost and any of the other three items that were
insuﬃcient to solve each step of the problem. Members had to share all
their items, coordinate how to solve each step, and jointly perform
calculations using basic mathematical operations. Each step varied in
the number of interacting items (column 3 of
Table 2), amounting to a
total of 45 including mathematical signs. Also, in each step, individual
participants and collaborative groups had to perform multiple mental
calculations to ﬁnd many partial answers, hold them temporarily in
working memory (column 4 of
Table 2), and then integrate them with
partial answers computed by others in the group without writing the
calculations (i.e., mental arithmetic;
DeStefano & LeFevre, 2004). Given
these cognitive demands, it was assumed that the tasks were highly
complex.
2.3.4. Retention and delayed test phases
The quality of the task-speciﬁc knowledge of each participant was
assessed using six similar problems with the same level of complexity as
the learning tasks. Participants received worksheets with three tasks
one day after the learning tasks (the retention test) and three other
similar tasks seven days after (the delayed test). Each problem included
a table with seven numbered rows to write the calculations for each
step of the solution process.

2.4. Measurement
2.4.1. Cognitive load
Cognitive load was measured subjectively in the learning, retention
test, and delayed test phases using a 9-point mental eﬀort rating scale
(
Paas, Tuovinen, Tabbers, & Van Gerven, 2003). Mental eﬀort “refers to
the cognitive capacity that is actually allocated to accommodate the
demands imposed by the task; thus, it can be considered to reﬂect the
actual cognitive load” (
Paas et al., 2003, p. 64). The scale is non-in-
trusive, is sensitive to changes in complexity, and is valid, and reliable
for individual learning (
Szulewski, Gegenfurtner, Howes, Sivilotti, &
van Merriënboer, 2017). Participants were asked to‘Please rate the
level of mental eﬀort you invested in this task’ on a Likert scale ranging
from 1 (very, very low mental eﬀort) to 9 (very, very high mental ef-
fort) after each problem to obtain a more precise estimation of the in-
vested load (
Van Gog, Kirschner, Kester, & Paas, 2012). Cognitive load
for each collaborative group for the learning phase was calculated
averaging the scores of the members. Individual scores were used in
subsequent phases.
2.4.2. Performance
Performance was measured in the learning, retention test, and de-
layed test phases. The total number of points for all three learning tasks
was 3: 1 point per correct answer or 0 points if the answer was in-
correct. For the three tasks of the retention test and delayed test, a total
of 7 points could be awarded based on the seven calculations required
to obtain the BEP. Each calculation was scored individually based on
whether correct values and mathematical operations were used. Correct
calculations received 1 point and incorrect calculations 0 points, re-
sulting in a maximum score of 21 points and a minimum of 0. If a step
was partially correct, a proportional score was given (e.g., if in steps 4,
6 or 7 an incorrect value was used, ½ point was given). Performance
scores on the learning, retention test and delayed test phases were
transformed into proportions.
3. Results
The data were analyzed with 2 (collaborative group vs. individual
learning) x 2 (less knowledgeable learners vs. more knowledgeable
learners) analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Dependent variables were
performance and mental eﬀort, which were measured and analyzed
separately for the learning, retention test, and delayed test phases.
There were no activities or analyses carried out between the phases.
Data exploration revealed outliers. However, the outliers were not ex-
cluded because an analysis that excluded outliers showed that they did
not alter the pattern of signiﬁcant results. The results are reported se-
parately, and the means and standard deviations of the dependent
variables for all phases are shown in
Tables 2–4. A summary of all
signiﬁcant results is provided inAppendix A. A signiﬁcance level of
0.05 was used for all analyses. Partial eta-squared was used as a mea-
sure of eﬀect size, with values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14 corresponding to
small, medium, and large eﬀects, respectively (
Cohen et al., 1988).
3.1. Learning phase
Two collaborative groups and two individuals were excluded from
the analysis after not completing the previous phases. In this phase, 17
three-person novice collaborative groups, 19 knowledgeable colla-
borative groups, 66 less knowledgeable individuals, and 46 more
knowledgeable individuals participated.
Table 3 shows descriptive
statistics.
Concerning performance, the ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant main
eﬀect for condition, F(1, 144) = 18.391, MSE = 0.073,p < .001,
ηp
2 = 0.113: collaborative groups (M = 0.69,SD = 0.31) outperformed

For mental eﬀort, the main eﬀect for condition was signiﬁcant, F(1,

2 = 0.027: collaborative
groups (M = 6.65, SD = 1.88) experienced more mental eﬀort than

F(1, 144) = 5.849, MSE = 3.052,p = .017, ηp
2 = 0.039. A post-hoc
Bonferroni test showed that for participants learning individually, more
knowledgeable learners reported less mental eﬀort than less knowl-

p
2 = 0.048). No diﬀerences were found
for participants learning in collaborative groups. The test also showed
no diﬀerence for less knowledgeable learners; however, for more
knowledgeable learners, collaborative groups reported more mental

3.2. Retention test
In this phase, 49 novice collaborative group members, 56 knowl-
edgeable collaborative group members, 61 novice individuals, and 46
knowledgeable individuals participated.
Table 4shows the descriptive

The ANOVA for performance found a signiﬁcant main eﬀect for

2 = 0.184:
collaborative groups (M = 0.70,SD = 0.27) outperformed individuals

(1, 208) = 217.926, MSE = 0.047,p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.512: more
knowledgeable participants (M = 0.81,SD = 0.22) outperformed less

between main e ﬀects was also signi ﬁcant, F(1, 208) = 5.580,
MSE = 0.047,p = .019,ηp
2 = 0.026. The Bonferroni test showed that
for participants learning individually, more knowledgeable learners
outperformed less knowledgeable learners (p < .001, η
p
2 = 0.414);
among participants learning in collaborative groups, more knowl-

(p < .001, η
p
2 = 0.270). It was also found that among more knowl-
edgeable learners, collaborative groups outperformed individual lear-
ners (p < .001, η
p
2 = 0.174) and, for less knowledgeable participants,
collaborative groups outperformed individual learners ( p = .002,
ηp
2 = 0.044). The large diﬀerence in eﬀect sizes explains the signiﬁcant
interaction.
Regarding mental eﬀort, a signiﬁcant main eﬀect for condition was
found, F(1, 208) = 8.524, MSE = 4.443,p = .004,ηp
2 = 0.039: colla-
borative groups (M = 5.83,SD = 2.18) reported more mental eﬀort
than individuals (M = 4.83, SD = 2.31). Knowledge level was also
signiﬁcant, F(1, 208) = 10.698, MSE = 4.443,p = .001,ηp
2 = 0.049:
more knowledgeable learners (M = 5.87, SD = 1.77) reported more
mental eﬀort than less knowledgeable learners (M = 4.82,SD = 2.60).
The interaction between these e ﬀects was also signi ﬁcant, F(1,
208) = 19.908, MSE = 4.443,p < 001, ηp
2 = 0.087. The Bonferroni
test showed that among participants learning individually, more
knowledgeable learners reported more mental eﬀort than less knowl-
edgeable learners (p < .001, η
p
2 = 0.126). There was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between more and less knowledgeable learners on levels of
mental eﬀort when they learned in collaborative groups. In addition,
among novice participants, collaborative groups reported more mental
eﬀort than individual learners (p < .001, η
p
2 = 0.120). However, for
knowledgeable participants, no diﬀerence between individuals and
collaborative groups was found, indicating the cause of the signiﬁcant
interaction.
3.3. Delayed test
In this phase, 49 novice collaborative group members, 57 knowl-
edgeable collaborative group members, 65 novice individuals, and 44
knowledgeable individuals participated. Descriptive statistics are
shown in
Table 5.
For performance, the main eﬀect for condition was signiﬁcant, F
(1, 212) = 4.467, MSE = 0.041,p = .036, ηp
2 = 0.021: collaborative
groups ( M = 0.60, SD = 0.27) outperformed individual learners
(M = 0.48,SD = 0.33). The main eﬀect for knowledge level was also
signiﬁcant, F(1, 212) = 271.491, MSE = 0.041,p < .001,ηp
2 = 0.562:
more knowledgeable learners (M = 0.78,SD = 0.22) achieved better
performance than less knowledgeable learners (M = 0.32,SD = 0.19).
The interaction between e ﬀects was signiﬁcant, F(1, 212) = 6.861,
MSE = 0.041, p = .009, ηp
2 = 0.031. For individual learning
(p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.464) and for collaborative learning (p < .001,
ηp
2 = 0.311), it was found that more knowledgeable learners out-
performed less knowledgeable learners. The Bonferroni test indicated
that less knowledgeable participants performed better in collaborative
groups than those learning individually (p = .001,η
p
2 = 0.053); how-
ever, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between collaborative and
individual groups explaining the signiﬁcant interaction.
Regarding mental eﬀort, the main eﬀect for condition was sig-
niﬁcant, F(1, 212) = 8.553, MSE = 2.682,p = .004,ηp
2 = 0.039: in-
dividual learners reported more mental eﬀort (M = 4.98,SD = 1.70)
than collaborative groups (M = 4.50,SD = 1.88). The main eﬀect for
knowledge level was also signi ﬁcant, F(1, 212) = 42.909,
MSE = 2.682,p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.168: more knowledgeable learners
(M = 5.48,SD = 1.65) reported more mental eﬀort than less knowl-
edgeable learners (M = 4.09, SD = 1.68). The interaction between
these eﬀects was not signiﬁcant F(1, 212) = 1.189, MSE = 2.682,ns.
4. Discussion
The results are discussed following the order of the hypotheses,
starting with condition followed by level of prior knowledge. Regarding
condition, it was expected that for individual learning, more knowl-
edgeable learners would outperform and invest less mental eﬀort than
less knowledgeable learners (
H1). In the learning phase, more knowl-
edgeable individuals reported less mental eﬀort than less knowledge-
able learners as expected but performed equally well. In retention and
delayed tests, more knowledgeable learners outperformed less knowl-
edgeable learners as expected. Knowledgeable learners invested more
mental eﬀort in the retention phase and similar mental eﬀort in the
delayed test. This suggests that for high-complexity tasks, prior
knowledge reduces mental eﬀort during learning without necessarily
improving performance during learning. However, as found by
Retnowati et al. (2018), the beneﬁts of providing prior knowledge for
complex tasks had signiﬁcant beneﬁts in the performance outcomes (1
and 7 days after). Interestingly, in the retention test, novice individuals
experienced a lower cognitive load. One possible explanation may be
their lack of knowledge which may have reduced their judgment of the
complexity of tasks and overestimated their current performance,
which in turn decreased their mental e ﬀort ratings (
Nugteren,
Jarodzka, Kester, & Van Merriënboer, 2018).

We also expected that when students who have prior knowledge
learn in collaborative groups, they will outperform less knowledgeable
learners, but the counteractive eﬀects on mental eﬀort when more and
less knowledgeable students collaborate cannot be precisely determined
(
H2). As expected, we found evidence for performance both in retention
and delayed test phases. Advanced learners could handle the com-
plexity due to their better task-speciﬁc knowledge. This result allows us
to assume that transactional activities were advantageous for advanced
learning groups because the learning tasks had a high level of element
interactivity (
Retnowati et al., 2018; 2016). This advantage was ob-
served in both individual post-tests. For cognitive load, we found
nonsigniﬁcant diﬀerences. Mental eﬀect results suggest that transac-
tional activities could have interfered with prior knowledge (
Retnowati
et al., 2018). Seemingly, collaborative groups of advanced learners
experienced cognitive load caused by the redundancy of interactions
that were unnecessary because group members already had partially
developed task knowledge. This cognitive load may be equivalent to the
low-knowledge groups’ cognitive load. Low-knowledge groups may
have performed irrelevant transactional activities (e.g., randomly
searching activities) because they lack suﬃcient schemas that guide
their operations in high-complexity tasks (
Zhang et al., 2016).
Concerning the eﬀect of prior knowledge, it was expected that when
learners are less knowledgeable, collaborative groups outperform and
perceive less mental eﬀort than individuals (
H3). We found evidence for
this hypothesis on performance both in the retention and delayed tests.
For cognitive load, surprisingly, less knowledgeable learners that
learned in collaborative groups perceived a signiﬁcantly higher load
than individuals in the retention test while no diﬀerence was found in
the other phases. In line with the collective working memory eﬀect (F.
Kirschner, Paas, & Kirschner, 2011), greater cognitive capacity allowed
collaborative groups to acquire better mental representations from the
complex information. These data suggest that when learners are re-
quired to learn from highly demanding problems, collaborative
learning may impose a substantial cognitive load, but is more eﬀective
than in individual learning, and its beneﬁts are observed in the long
term (
Soderstrom & Bjork, 2015). The perception of higher mental ef-
fort in the retention phase of learners who learned in collaborative
groups is interesting (M = 6.01), but even more interesting is the sub-
stantially lower cognitive load perceived by individual students
(M = 3.86). It seems, they did not invest a high mental eﬀort because
they did not have the appropriate task knowledge (
Sweller et al., 2011).
It may be necessary to investigate these cases in depth through the
analysis of think-aloud protocols (
Kalyuga & Plass, 2018).
It was also expected that when learners have prior knowledge,
learning in collaborative groups will become detrimental, with no
collaborative group advantage (
H4). This was conﬁrmed for all phases
and measures except the performance in the retention phase of those
who learned in collaborative groups. This result might be explained by
the activating of prior task schemas when carrying out highly-complex
tasks. During the learning phase, knowledgeable collaborative group
members reported signiﬁcantly higher cognitive load because they may
need to reconcile their own knowledge with externally provided gui-
dance (
Kalyuga et al., 2003). Besides, they may have to deal with the
transactional activities that were inevitable due to the distribution of
information among members which further increased the perception of
mental eﬀort.
Interestingly, despite reporting more mental eﬀort during colla-
borative learning, in the retention phase, more knowledgeable colla-
borative group members were more eﬀective than more knowledgeable
individuals. Seemingly, collaborative learning and prior knowledge for
high-complexity tasks did not seem detrimental as the additionally
acquired collaborative group knowledge allowed collaborators to out-
perform individuals the next day. However, this advantage was not
long-lasting (i.e., in the delayed test).
5. Conclusions
In general, the results seem to suggest that collaborative learning
may be eﬀective for high-complexity tasks compared with individual
learning when learners have domain-generalized knowledge at a col-
laborative group level (
Kalyuga, 2013). Giving learners guidance on
how to work together seems to be associated with better performance
than just bringing students together to learn new problems (
Gillies,
2016; P. A.;Kirschner et al., 2018). Seemingly, learners who are pre-
pared to learn collaboratively build task-based collaboration schemas.
They may be applied through analogical transfer when these colla-
borative groups must learn similar tasks (
Gick & Holyoak, 1980). It may
be reasonable to think that domain-generalizable knowledge for colla-
boration operates as intergroup guides that take advantage of transac-
tional activities to better learn relatively new tasks.
Furthermore, the eﬀectiveness of collaborative learning is aﬀected
by prior task knowledge (
Retnowati et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015,
2016). Providing preliminary instruction to construct partially devel-
oped domain-speciﬁc knowledge before subsequent explicit instruction
may produce higher performance in the retention and delayed tests
than learning individually without such prior knowledge. Similarly,
learning collaboratively with partial knowledge structures yields higher
performance than collaborating among less knowledgeable learners.
However, when individuals and collaborative groups with this prior
knowledge are compared, the advantage of learning in collaborative
groups only decreases the mental eﬀort in the learning phase (i.e., due
to the advantage distribution) and produces higher performance in the
retention test. In the longer term (i.e., delayed test), the performance
between collaborative groups and individuals is equal. However, if
learners have not received preliminary instruction, learning in colla-
borative groups is more e ﬀective with higher performance than
learning individually in the short- and long-term as indicated by the
retention and delayed tests respectively.
5.1. Practical implications
This study has educational implications when the learning goal is to
learn high-complexity problems, and when high performance needs to
be sustained in the longer-term. First, if collaborative learning is used,
learners should be provided preparation in learning in collaborative
groups through practice on tasks previously learned in the same do-
main. Once learners have had a collaborative group experience, they
will then be able to manage the collaborative cognitive load and
transfer this experience to relatively new problems. Also, before giving
explicit or full comprehensive instruction for learning to solve quite
complex problems, novice collaborative group members should receive
preliminary knowledge to guide subsequent acquisition. Instructors can
begin instruction by providing guidance using worked examples toﬁrst
stimulate individual long-term memory elaboration and then promote
the construction of better schemas through collaborative learning.
However, if learners have prior task-speciﬁc knowledge, learning in
collaborative groups may not be more beneﬁcial than learning in-
dividually because collaborative groups experience more cognitive load
during full guidance (i.e., learning phase) and an advantage in perfor-
mance is not durable in the long term.
5.2. Limitations and future directions
Assuming that cognitive load may vary during learning (
Kalyuga &
Plass, 2018), it is important to develop ways of measuring it during
collaboration activities. Making collaborative group activities explicit
along with their respective cognitive loads is fundamental. For this, an
in-depth analysis of the loads related to transactional activities is re-
quired concerning how group members process task information in-
dividually and amongst themselves and how learners support each
other to overcome task-related diﬃculties. An evaluation of the impact
J. Zambrano R., et al.
Learning and Instruction 63 (2019) 101214
7
<<<PAGE=8>>>
of transactional activity patterns on performance and mental eﬀort in
individual long-term post-tests also is required.
Further, the subjective measurement of cognitive load may not be
appropriate for collaborative learning (F.Kirschner, Paas, & Kirschner,
2011; Retnowati et al., 2016). Although the mental eﬀort scale appears
to be robust for individual conditions, it should be determined if it is
valid and reliable for collaborative learning conditions. Other measures
of cognitive load that account for the multiple sources and types of
cognitive load in collaborative conditions may need to be constructed.
Another limitation of this study is that a pretest was not used.
Although the tasks in the learning phase are not easily acquired without
being part of a curricular program, students might acquire this
knowledge outside the school context. Of course, our use of random
allocation to groups should eliminate any systematic biases. A pretest
would test whether this is the case.
This study is aﬁrst step to uncover the cognitive load factors as-
sociated with individual and collaborative learning considering the
prior knowledge eﬀect. Future studies should replicate this study to
conﬁrm these results and examine the eﬀect of prior knowledge be-
tween individual learning, and collaborative learning with and without
collaborative preparation. Also, tasks with higher and lower complexity
should be used to investigate relations between prior knowledge and
complexity.
