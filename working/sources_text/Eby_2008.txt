Abstract
The study of mentoring has generally been conducted within disciplinary silos with a specific type
of mentoring relationship as a focus. The purpose of this article is to quantitatively review the three
major areas of mentoring research (youth, academic, workplace) to determine the overall effect size
associated with mentoring outcomes for protégés. We also explored whether the relationship between
mentoring and protégé outcomes varied by the type of mentoring relationship (youth, academic,
workplace). Results demonstrate that mentoring is associated with a wide range of favorable
behavioral, attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career outcomes, although the
effect size is generally small. Some differences were also found across type of mentoring. Generally,
larger effect sizes were detected for academic and workplace mentoring compared to youth
mentoring. Implications for future research, theory, and applied practice are provided.
Across areas of research, scholars agree that mentoring can be associated with a wide range of
positive outcomes for protégés. Mentoring has been discussed as a strategy for positive youth
development and as a deterrent of risky youth behavior (DuBois & Karcher, 2005), as a way
to improve the academic adjustment, retention, and success of college students (Johnson, in
press), and as a means to facilitate career development among employees (Kram, 1985).
Despite the widespread study of mentoring and its prevalence in community, academic and
organizational contexts, research has progressed within its own disciplinary silos. As a
consequence, there is little cross-disciplinary communication among mentoring scholars.
There are also no quantitative reviews of the mentoring literature as a whole, even though the
same basic assumption applies to all types of mentoring. That is, when a more experienced or
senior individual (the mentor) takes an interest in and encourages a less experienced or
disadvantaged individual (the protégé), the protégé will benefit (Jacobi, 1991; Kram, 1985;
Rhodes, 2005).

To spark mentoring researchers to think more broadly about the potential role of mentoring in
protégés’ lives and to advance mentoring theory, a comprehensive multi-disciplinary meta-
analysis was conducted. Our primary objective was to answer the question, “Looking across
different areas of mentoring scholarship, does mentoring matter, and if so, how much?” This
is an important question because the popular press makes strong claims about the importance
of mentoring and both public and private funds are used to support many different types of
mentoring initiatives (Rhodes, 2005). We were also interested in documenting whether or not
there are differences in how much mentoring matters across protégé outcomes. For example,
does mentoring have a stronger relationship with protégé attitudes (e.g., attitudes toward
school, satisfaction with college, job satisfaction), protégé behaviors (e.g., grades in school,
deviant behavior, job performance), or protégé motivational variables (e.g., aspiration level,
time spent on educational pursuits, career commitment)? This information has implications for
theory development and refinement. It may also alert practitioners as to the protégé outcomes
that may be most likely affected by mentoring when designing formal programs. Finally, we
were interested in examining whether mentoring outcomes vary by the type of relationship
(youth mentoring, workplace mentoring, academic mentoring). This will provide a more fine-
grained assessment of the conditions under which mentoring matters the most.
Overview of the Mentoring Literature
Because individuals may experience mentoring at various life stages, it is not surprising that
there are three distinct streams of mentoring scholarship: youth mentoring, academic
mentoring, and workplace mentoring. Youth mentoring involves a relationship between a
caring, supportive adult and a child or adolescent (Rhodes, 2002). Youth mentoring assumes
that supportive relationships with adults are important for personal, emotional, cognitive, and
psychological growth (Ainsworth, 1989; Rhodes, 2002). Academic mentoring typifies the
apprentice model of education where a faculty member imparts knowledge, provides support,
and offers guidance to a student protégé on academic (e.g., classroom performance) as well as
non-academic (e.g., personal problems, identity issues) issues (Jacobi, 1991). This type of
mentoring may facilitate psychological adjustment and foster a sense of professional identity
(Austin, 2002). Finally, workplace mentoring occurs in an organizational setting and the
purpose is the personal and professional growth of the protégé (Kram, 1985). The mentor may
be a supervisor, someone else within the organization but outside the protégé’s chain of
command, or an individual in another organization (Eby, 1997).
Several narrative reviews of the youth, academic, and workplace mentoring literature exist.
Some narrative reviews summarize research findings associated with youth, academic or
workplace mentoring in a particular area, such as diversity (e.g., Ragins, 2002), formal
mentoring relationships (e.g., Miller, in press), or naturally occurring mentoring relationships
(e.g., Mullen, in press; Zimmerman, Bingenehimer, & Behrendt, 2005). Other reviews focus
on a specific type of mentoring (e.g., academic, workplace) more broadly (e.g., Jacobi, 1991;
Wanberg, Welsh, & Hezlett, 2003). Several quantitative reviews also exist. This includes
quantitative reviews of formal youth mentoring (DuBois, Holloway, Valentine & Cooper,
2002), academic mentoring (Dorsey & Baker, 2004; Sambunjak, Straus, & Marusic, 2006),
and workplace mentoring (Allen, Eby, Poteet, Lentz, & Lima, 2004; Underhill, 2006).
Collectively these represent important efforts to synthesize the literature. However, there are
no reviews that incorporate diverse areas of mentoring scholarship or compare mentoring
outcomes across youth, academic and workplace mentoring. The present study addresses this
issue.

Hypothesized Effects of Mentoring on Outcomes
We expect a wide range of outcomes to be related to mentoring. This includes behavioral,
attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career outcomes.
Behavioral outcomes
Mentoring is often discussed as a means to increase desirable behavior (e.g., academic
performance, job performance) and decrease undesirable behavior (e.g., school drop-out,
substance use). In fact, formal mentoring programs for youth and college students often target
“at risk” individuals (cf. Campbell, in press; Rhodes, 1994). The hope is that mentoring will
deter negative outcomes such as drug use, teen pregnancy, college drop-out, and academic
failure while simultaneously encouraging alternative positive behaviors. Another way that
protégé behavior may be affected is through instrumental assistance provided by mentors (e.g.,
helping to publish articles, complete homework, successfully finish work tasks) (Cohen &
Willis, 1985). This leads us to propose:
Hypothesis 1: Mentoring is associated with positive behavioral outcomes.
Attitudinal outcomes
Mentoring may also have a positive effect on protégé attitudes. For instance, it is presumed
that protégés will develop positive attitudes toward the activity that they engage in with their
mentors. This might include activities associated with school (Blinn-Pike, in press;
Tennenbaum, Crosby, & Gliner, 2001), graduate training (Johnson, Koch, Fallow, & Huwe,
2000), or job assignments (Chao, Walz, & Gardner, 1992). Having a mentor may also foster
psychological attachment to the context in which the relationship is embedded, such as one’s
school, university, or organization (e.g., Payne & Huffman, 2005). Thus, we expect:
Hypothesis 2: Mentoring is associated with positive attitudinal outcomes.
Health-related outcomes
Another facet of the mentoring relationship involves the provision of emotional and other forms
of health-related support to the protégé. A mentor may listen and offer advice during times of
stress or provide counseling on personal or job-related issues (Kram, 1985). Mentors can also
enhance overall well-being by challenging protégés’ negative self views (Rhodes, 2002,
2005) which may enhance protégé self-confidence or self-esteem (Johnson, in press).
Furthermore, mentors may be able to promote protégé physical health by engaging in activities
such as exercise with the protégé or by facilitating protégé access to health services (DuBois
& Silverthorn, 2005). As such we propose:
Hypothesis 3: Mentoring is associated with positive health-related outcomes.
Relational outcomes
Mentoring also may enhance interpersonal relationships with parents, siblings, and peers
(Rhodes, 2002, 2005). For example, mentors may help protégés figure out appropriate
strategies to deal with interpersonal problems at work, home or school. Moreover, the
experience of a trusting, close relationship with a mentor may lead the protégé to develop
positive expectations about interpersonal relationships with others (Rhodes, Grossman, &
Rensch, 2000) which in turn may promote positive relationships. This leads us to propose:
Hypothesis 4: Mentoring is associated with positive relational outcomes.

Motivational outcomes
Protégé motivation and involvement may also be influenced by mentoring. Role modeling can
expose protégés to educational and social opportunities, which may open their eyes to different
possibilities and motivate them to seek out new experiences (Spencer, in press). Motivation
also may be enhanced by helping protégés set achievable goals and realize personally relevant
outcomes (Ramaswami & Dreher, in press). Moreover, mentors may help protégés stay focused
on tasks and steer them away from superfluous activities (Bearman, Blake-Beard, Hunt &
Crosby, in press). Based on this, we propose:
Hypothesis 5: Mentoring is associated with positive motivational outcomes.
Career outcomes
Finally, mentoring relationship may promote career success. Mentors can impart specific
knowledge and expertise which contributes to protégé learning and skill development (Kram,
1985; Johnson, in press; Mullen, in press). Mentors can also facilitate professional networking
by introducing protégés to influential individuals within academic and organizational contexts
(Kram, 1985; Tennenbaum e al., 2001). These important career contacts can in turn lead to
career success in terms of salary, promotions, and job offers. With youth or college students,
mentors also may introduce protégés to different possible careers and help them to explore
those, thus enhancing their development in this area. Thus, we propose:
Hypothesis 6: Mentoring is associated with positive career outcomes.
Differences in Youth, Academic and Workplace Mentoring
Although similar in some respects, youth, academic, and workplace mentoring also differ. One
salient difference is the developmental stage of the protégé. Developmental theories suggest
that people progress through relatively orderly periods of transition marked by unique
challenges (Erikson, 1963; Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & McKee, 1978). These
developmental transitions represent critical turning points and if not navigated successfully
there are psychological and social consequences (Erikson, 1963). From middle childhood to
adolescence the primary developmental issues involve learning how to cultivate healthy peer
relationships, master academic challenges, and develop a sense of personal responsibility
(Erikson, 1963; Spencer, in press). In early adulthood the transitions revolve around
psychological and physical separation from one’s parents, learning to develop close emotional
bonds with non-family members, and identity development (Erikson, 1963; Levinson et al.,
1978). By the time one enters the workforce, the transition generally focuses on developing a
stable occupational self-image and finding a niche for oneself in society (Levinson et al.,
1978).
Mentoring at different developmental stages also tends to serve different functions or purposes.
Youth mentoring is often aimed at reducing risky behavior or improving social and academic
functioning (DuBois & Karcher, 2005). Academic mentoring tends to target student retention,
academic performance, and adjustment to college life (Jacobi, 1991). Finally, workplace
mentoring aims to enhance employees’ personal and career development (Kram, 1985). Based
on the unique developmental transitions individuals face across the lifespan and the varying
purposes of different types of mentoring we propose the following research question:
Are there differences in protégé outcomes when comparing youth, academic, and workplace
mentoring?

Method
Literature Search
A comprehensive search of articles published from 1985–2006 was conducted to identify
articles examining differences between protégés and non-protégés on a wide range of
outcomes. PsycINFO, Business Source Premier, ERIC, Educational Abstracts, Medline,
PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, and Social Sciences Abstracts were searched to identify
relevant articles Search terms included “mentor” and all derivations of this word (e.g.,
mentoring, mentored), “Big Brother”, “Big Sister”, “non-parental adult” and “buddy” in a
relevant search field (i.e., title, abstract, keyword, descriptor, major topic). We also cross-
referenced quantitative reviews (Allen et al., 2004; Dorsey & Baker, 2004; DuBois et al.,
2002; Sambunjak et al., 2006; Underhill, 2006), narrative reviews (e.g., Jacobi, 1991; Wanberg
et al, 2003) and other major compendiums (e.g., Allen & Eby, in press; DuBois & Karcher,
2005) to identify additional articles. Finally, the websites of several nationwide formal
mentoring programs (e.g., Big Brothers/Big Sisters) as well as organizations that routinely
evaluate or fund research in the area of mentoring (Public/Private Ventures) were searched for
articles and reports. Unpublished research such as conference papers, dissertations and theses
were excluded. Because of this we conducted a file drawer analysis. The fail safe N (FSN)
represents the number of missing studies averaging null results that would be needed to reduce
the effect size to a specified level (Rosenthal, 1984). In the present study we used an alpha
level of p = .05.
Eligibility Criteria
The initial search process yielded 15,131 articles and reports. To be considered for inclusion
the study had to compare mentored and non-mentored individuals on an individual-level
outcome (e.g., academic success, drug use, work attitudes). The study also had to be written
in English and quantify the relationship between mentoring and the outcome using a statistic
that could be converted to a product-moment correlation coefficient (e.g., d-statistic, t-statistic,
2×2 contingency table, chi square with 1 df). For studies that met the inclusion criteria but did
not report usable statistics (e.g., multivariate findings only), we attempted to obtain such data
by contacting the study authors. Individual studies also had to meet all of the following criteria:
1. The study had to involve youth, academic, or workplace mentoring.
2. Neither protégés nor mentors suffered from a major physical or psychological
disability (e.g., studies of seriously cognitively impaired individuals were excluded).
3. The study involved a focus on traditional one-on-one non-parental mentoring
relationships. As such, studies focusing exclusively on peer, group/team, or reverse
mentoring were excluded. Also excluded were studies focusing exclusively on parents
as mentors, professional caregivers or specialists as mentors, and social support from
teachers for youth.
4. For intervention studies, mentoring had to be the sole or primary intervention (e.g.,
interventions that included academic counseling, special coursework, financial aid,
and mentoring to improve student retention were excluded).
5. Research on teacher induction programs, on-the-job training, and internship programs
was excluded because these studies do not necessarily involve one-on-one mentoring.
One hundred and twelve studies and reports met all of the eligibility criteria. Three studies
included multiple samples, for a total of 116 independent samples for the meta-analysis. If
authors published different studies from the same dataset or a smaller sub-set of the same
dataset, only the effect size based on the larger sample size was included. A full list of the
studies included in the present meta-analysis is available from the first author.

Operationalization of Constructs
Mentoring— Mentoring was operationalized as non-mentored (coded 1) or mentored (coded
2). As such, positive correlations indicated that being mentored was associated with a higher
level of each criterion variable (e.g., more favorable career attitudes, higher self-esteem).
Outcomes— Similar to other published meta-analyses (Ng, Eby, Sorensen, & Feldman,
2005; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) variables that were conceptually similar were
combined. This was necessary in order to draw general conclusions about the relationship
between mentoring and protégé outcomes across different types of mentoring.
Table 1 lists the six broad categories of outcomes examined. Within each category we list the
specific outcomes examined and examples of how these outcomes were operationalized. Some
of the outcomes listed in Table 1 are applicable across different types of mentoring (e.g.,
withdrawal behavior, motivation/involvement) whereas other outcomes are more specific to a
particular type of mentoring (e.g., deviance was examined exclusively in studies of youth
mentoring). If two (or more) effect sizes from the same study were combined into an outcome
category, the effect sizes were averaged so that each sample only contributed one effect size
(DuBois et al., 2002;Underhill, 2006).
Grouping variable— The type of mentoring relationship was also coded so that it could be
examined so that we could examine whether the relationship between mentoring and protégé
outcomes varied across youth, academic, and workplace mentoring. The 166 independent
samples were coded into one of three categories: youth mentoring (n=40, 34.5%), workplace
mentoring (n=53, 45.7%), academic mentoring (n=23, 19.8%). Youth mentoring was defined
as a naturally occurring (informal) or formally arranged (e.g., Big Brother/Big Sister)
relationship between a non-parental adult and a child, adolescent, or young adult (Blinn-Pike,
in press). Academic mentoring studies were those that examined relationships among
undergraduate or graduate students and teachers or faculty members in community colleges,
four year colleges, and universities (Johnson, in press) (including medical schools and nursing
programs). Studies were coded as workplace mentoring if they focused on formal or informal
mentoring relationships between working adults in an organizational setting (Allen et al.,
2004).
Meta-Analysis Procedure
The 15,131 articles were screened by two of the study authors. The first and second authors
were responsible for coding all studies included in the meta-analysis. These two coders
independently double-coded articles until they reached over 90% agreement. After reaching
over 90% agreement each person single-coded his or her assigned articles. Spot checking
throughout the coding process revealed minimal coding errors. Coding discrepancies were
resolved through re-examination of the data and when necessary, discussion. The effect size
used in the current analysis was the product-moment correlation coefficient.
Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) meta-analysis technique was used. To compute a meta-analytic
correlation at least three studies were required. Each correlation was first corrected for
unreliability in the measurement of the outcome variable. If coefficient alpha was not reported
for a study we used the average coefficient alpha for the other studies in that outcome category,
as is commonly done in meta-analysis (e.g., Ng et al., 2005). Some outcomes did not require
disattenuation (e.g., organizational turnover, number of days skipped). Next, the sample size
weighted correlation was calculated. A corrected correlation was judged to be significant at
alpha=.05 when the 95% confidence interval did not include zero.

Sub-Group Analyses
The Q statistic (Hedges & Olkin, 1985) indicated if there was sufficient variability in each
meta-analytic effect size to warrant a search for sub-group differences. For effect sizes
associated with a significant Q statistic, meta-analytic correlations were computed separately
for studies focusing on youth, academic, and workplace mentoring (Hunter & Schmidt,
2000). As with the primary analyses, a minimum of three studies was necessary to compute
sub-group meta-analytic correlations. To determine if the effect sizes associated with a
particular mentoring-outcome relationship differed significantly across youth, academic, and
workplace mentoring, the 95% confidence intervals for each effect size were examined. Non-
overlapping confidence intervals provides evidence of significant sub-group differences (cf.
Ng et al., 2005).
Results
Table 2 provides the results of the meta-analysis of outcomes associated with mentoring. For
each relationship we report the total sample size cumulated across studies included in the
analysis of that relationship (N), number of studies included in the analysis of that relationship
(k), sample size weighted corrected correlation (rc), standard deviation of the rc (SDc), the
upper and lower 95% confidence interval (95% LCI, 95% UCL), the Q statistic, and the Fail-
Safe N. We used the Cohen’s (1988) conventional standards for interpreting correlation-based
effect sizes as small (absolute value of .10 to .23), medium (absolute value of .24 to .36) and
large (absolute value of .37 or higher). For four outcomes we encountered studies with sample
sizes over 3,000 (Bhatta & Washington, 2003;Brashear, Bellinger, Boles, & Barksdale,
2006;Clotfelter, 2001). We computed effect sizes with and without these large samples.
An important consideration is whether to adopt a fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analytic
model. These methods differ in terms of whether the error term is considered to be
homogeneous or heterogeneous across studies (Hedges & Vevea, 1998). With fixed-effects
methods, the effect sizes in the population are unknown constants but are fixed, presumed to
be the same for all studies included in the meta-analysis. With random-effects methods effect
sizes are assumed to vary randomly from study to study and are therefore only a sample of all
possible studies that exist on a topic (Hunter & Schmidt, 2000). The random-effects method
is generally preferred since it allows generalizations beyond the studies included in a meta-
analysis (Field, 2001). However, when fewer than 30 effect sizes are used in calculating meta-
analytic correlations, random-effects methods have some serious limitations (i.e., low power
to detect small effect sizes, inflated Type I error) (Field, 2001). These problems are exacerbated
with the Hunter and Schmidt technique (Field, 2001). Thus, meta-analytic correlations were
computed using both fixed-effects (see Table 2) and random-effects (see Table 3).
Hypotheses 1–6 were supported. Regardless of the meta-analytic method used (fixed- or
random-effects), mentoring was significantly related to favorable behavioral, attitudinal,
health-related, interpersonal, motivational, and career outcomes (note that negative
correlations with withdrawal behavior, withdrawal intentions, deviance, substance use, and
psychological stress & strain indicate more desirable outcomes). The only exception was the
non-significant effect size associated with psychological stress & strain when estimated using
a random-effects method (see Table 3). The largest effect sizes were between mentoring and
helping others (large sample removed), school attitudes, and career attitudes. The smallest (but
still statistically significant) effect sizes were between mentoring and psychological stress &
strain (when estimated using fixed-effects only), career recognition & success, deviance, and
self-perceptions. All of the effect sizes were small in magnitude. In most cases our Fail-Safe
N analysis indicated that a substantial number of null result studies would need to be added to
bring significance to p = .05. However, in some cases only a small number of studies (e.g.,
school attitudes) or even none (psychological stress & strain) would be required. In such cases,

confidence in the stability of the observed effect is questionable and the results should be
viewed with caution (Rosenthal, 1979).
Sub-Group Difference Results
Examining the Q statistics in Tables 2 and 3 provides mixed evidence with respect to
moderation. When using a fixed-effects method several Q statistics are significant. In contrast,
when using a random-effects method none of the Q statistics are significant. Due to the concern
over using random-effect methods with fewer than 30 ks (Field, 2001), we proceeded with the
sub-group analysis for those outcomes in Table 2 that yielded a significant Q statistic using
the fixed-effect method. There is evidence of sub-group differences for all of the mentoring-
outcome relationships except withdrawal intentions, substance use, and skills/competence
development. Therefore, except for the outcomes just noted, we conducted sub-group analyses
by type of mentoring relationship (youth, academic, workplace) if there was an adequate
number of studies (k ≥ 3) to do so. For some outcomes (e.g., performance) there were adequate
sub-sample sizes to compare all three types of mentoring. In other situations only two of the
three types of mentoring could be examined (e.g., school attitudes). Because the effect sizes
associated with the three large studies was not appreciably different from the total sample and
in all cases the inclusion of the three samples led to more conservative estimates (smaller effect
sizes), these studies were included in the sub-group analyses, where appropriate.
Table 4 reveals several patterns of results across different types of mentoring. First, with regard
to behavioral outcomes, all three types of mentoring demonstrated significant effect sizes for
performance. However, as evidenced by the nonoverlapping confidence intervals, academic
mentoring was more highly related to performance than was youth or workplace mentoring.
Both youth and academic mentoring were significantly associated with withdrawal behavior,
whereas workplace mentoring was not. However, all three types of mentoring shared
overlapping confidence intervals. Workplace and youth mentoring shared overlapping
confidence intervals regarding helping others, but the effect size associated with workplace
mentoring was significant whereas that associated with youth mentoring was not. With regard
to attitudinal outcomes, all of the effect sizes were significant. However, the effect size
associated with attitudes was stronger for academic than for youth mentoring. Regarding the
health outcome of psychological stress & strain, the effect sizes were not significantly different
from each other, but the workplace effect size was significant whereas the youth effect size
was not. With regard to interpersonal relations, both were significant, but the effect size was
stronger for workplace mentoring than for youth mentoring. Finally, with regard to
motivational involvement, all three types of mentoring shared overlapping confidence
intervals. However, whereas the effect sizes were significant for academic and workplace
mentoring, the effect size was not statistically significant for youth mentoring. It is also
noteworthy that when examining the specific types of mentoring, several medium effect sizes
were detected. This pertains to the relationship between workplace mentoring and helping
others (rc = .26, p<.05) and to that between academic mentoring and school attitudes (rc = .36,
p<.05). Finally, for approximately half of the effect sizes list in Table 4 a significant Q statistic
was found, indicating that additional moderators may exist.
Discussion
Four conclusions can be reached from our findings. First, we found that mentoring is
significantly correlated in a favorable direction with a wide range of protégé outcomes. Second,
although the overall effect sizes are small, mentoring appears to be more highly related to some
protégé outcomes (e.g., school attitudes) than to others (e.g., psychological stress & strain).
Third, there is evidence (albeit mixed) that there may be moderators of some mentoring-
outcome relationships. Finally, there is tentative evidence of differences in the extent to which

mentoring is associated with some outcomes across youth, academic, and workplace
relationships.
Overall Findings
Our findings are generally consistent with previous reviews focusing on a specific type of
mentoring (youth, academic, workplace). Both Allen et al. (2004) and Underhill (2006) found
significant relationships between workplace mentoring and career attitudes, work attitudes,
and some career outcomes. Reviews of youth (DuBois et al., 2002) and academic (Sambunjak
et al., 2006) mentoring found an association between mentoring and both career and
employment outcomes. There are also reviews linking youth (DuBois et al., 2002), academic
(Dorsey & Baker, 2004; Sambunjak et al., 2006) and workplace (Underhill, 2006) mentoring
to psychological outcomes such as positive self-image, emotional adjustment, and
psychological well-being, although similar to our findings, several of these reviews found small
effect sizes. Finally, previous research on youth finds that being mentored is related to more
positive social relationships, higher performance, and less problem behavior (DuBois &
Silverthorn, 2005).
Interestingly, our results suggest that mentoring is more strongly related to protégé attitudes
than to behavior, health, and career outcomes. It may be that attitudes are more amenable to
change than are outcomes that are more contextually-dependent or more influenced by stable
person variables. For instance, an individual’s decision to engage in substance use may be
strongly influenced by peer pressure, access to drugs, and parental role modeling, making it
difficult for a mentoring relationship to have substantial impact. Likewise, research shows that
career recognition and success is influenced by factors that may be outside one’s control (e.g.,
gender, race) and by factors not easily malleable (e.g., cognitive ability) (Ng et al., 2005).
Differences by Type of Mentoring
Some interesting differences in effect sizes were found across the three types of mentoring
included in the present review. The absolute value of the effect sizes associated with youth
mentoring ranged from .03 to .14 while those associated with academic mentoring and with
workplace mentoring ranged from .11 to .36 and .03 to .19, respectively. This pattern seems
to suggest that generally speaking academic mentoring has stronger associations with outcomes
than does youth mentoring and that workplace mentoring is somewhere in between. One
possible explanation for these differences centers on the typical context under which these
different types of mentoring occur. Specifically, youth who are mentored are often “at risk”
for behavioral, social, or academic problems due to a poor family and/or socioeconomic
situation. Thus, youth who are mentored commonly face numerous challenges (e.g., academic
problems, parental conflict, unhealthy peer relationships) that may be difficult to overcome
with mentoring alone (DuBois et al., 2002). In fact, there is some evidence that youth mentoring
leads to greater benefits when accompanied by other support services (Kuperminc et al.,
2005).
Given that youth may have many needs it may also be more difficult for mentors to offer
focused and tailored guidance, especially when compared to the typical protégé within an
academic or workplace setting. For example, academic mentoring relationships can generally
be highly focused on a behavioral outcome such as performance because adolescents who have
made it to a higher-level educational context have likely already surmounted or never faced
some of the same obstacles. Thus, they are functioning at a higher level that does not require
mentoring to be more diffuse and focused on multiple issues as may be the case in youth
relationships. Another factor that could favor the effectiveness of academic mentoring is that
this type of mentoring is often considered to be a core component of an institution’s mission
(Sambunjak et al., 2006). Moreover, mentors within the academic context may be better

equipped to provide the functions associated with mentoring as it often part of their own job
training. Often individuals who mentor youth or serve as informal mentors within the
workplace setting do so on a volunteer basis with little or no training.
A final potential explanation for the pattern of effects centers on methodological differences
in typical youth mentoring studies versus studies of other types of mentoring. Youth mentoring
studies are more frequently based on a single mentoring relationship within a specific program
and are often highly controlled in the form of random assignment of youth to receive or not
receive a mentor. In contrast, in studies of academic or workplace mentoring the participant is
often asked to simply report whether or not he or she has had a mentor. Youth mentoring studies
are thus less likely to be influenced by self-selection biases (e.g., healthier individuals attract
mentors) that have the potential to artificially inflate associations between mentoring and
outcomes. In addition, intervention studies by their nature typically involve longitudinal
associations between mentoring and outcomes at a later point in time, a factor that may further
attenuate effect size estimates.
Implications for Multidisciplinary Research on Mentoring and Theory
The finding that mentoring is significantly correlated with a variety of positive protégé
outcomes is consistent with conventional wisdom that close relationships are important for
individuals across the lifespan (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). As Allen and Eby (in press) note,
individuals possess a universal and fundamental “need to belong” (p. 399). This need can be
met through mentoring relationships and it may be an important driver of affective, cognitive,
and behavioral outcomes for protégés. This desire for affiliation and acceptance from others
can be met across the lifespan for those involved in youth, academic, and workplace mentoring
relationships. This suggests that in order to acquire a broader understanding of the full range
of mentoring benefits, researchers may profit from taking a more developmental lifespan
approach to the study of mentoring. Such an approach will require greater cross-disciplinary
dialogue.
The present meta-analytic review also identifies some outcomes of mentoring that deserve
greater attention both across and within specific areas of mentoring scholarship. For example,
it may be useful to further explore the link between mentoring and helping others since
mentoring has been discussed as a form of prosocial behavior (Allen, 2003). Examining helping
behavior as a consequence of mentoring could lead to the further integration of existing research
on altruism and organizational citizenship with mentoring. There also appear to be outcomes
of mentoring that deserve greater attention within particular areas of mentoring scholarship.
For example, career attitudes have been almost exclusively studied in workplace mentoring.
However, a major goal of academic mentoring is career preparation. Therefore, it seems
important to examine the relationship between mentoring received in college and subsequent
career attitudes such as how satisfying one finds his or her career, expectations for career
advancement, and perceived employment opportunities.
Applied Implications
There are several practical implications of our findings. Perhaps most importantly, we caution
scholars, practitioners, and policy makers not to overestimate the potential effect of mentoring.
Consistent with more focused reviews of the literature we found that the overall magnitude of
association between mentoring and outcomes was small in magnitude. Moreover, due to the
cross-sectional, non-experimental nature of many of the studies involved it is unknown whether
significant correlations between mentoring and outcomes reflect a causal effect of mentoring.
We are not suggesting that mentoring does not have value – the evidence presented here
suggests that it may. However, we believe the results underscore the need to temper what are
sometimes seemingly unrealistic expectations about what mentoring can offer to protégés,

institutions, and society at large. We recommend that decision-makers think carefully when
developing policies and programs about how to deal with pressing problems such as gang
violence, teenage drug use, drop-out rates among diverse college students, and the loss of top
talent in organizations. Mentoring may (or may not) be the best (or only) solution to a particular
problem.
Our findings also provide guidance on the types of outcomes we might reasonably expect
mentoring to influence. This could inform policy makers about the types of goals that formal
mentoring programs might aim for with the greatest chance of success. In general, attitudes
(e.g., work satisfaction, attitudes toward school, career expectations), interpersonal relations,
and motivation/involvement may be the most easily influenced by mentoring, whereas health-
related (e.g., substance use, psychological stress & strain) and career outcomes (e.g.,
promotions, salary) may be less influenced by mentoring. Looking at our findings by type of
mentoring, we see that youth mentoring may be most likely to affect school attitudes and least
likely to affect the performance, psychological stress & strain, or the motivation/involvement
of protégés. In the academic arena mentoring may have the most utility in terms of improving
performance and attitudes toward school and decreasing withdrawal behavior. Finally, in terms
of workplace mentoring we find that larger gains may be likely in terms of enhancing helping
behavior, situational satisfaction & attachment, and interpersonal relationships whereas
smaller gains may be likely in terms of enhancing job performance and deterring withdrawal
behavior.
Study Limitations
The current study has several limitations that should be noted. First, and most critically given
the correlational nature of many of the studies included in this review, our findings do not
provide unambiguous evidence that mentoring causes protégé outcomes. Rather, they provide
encouragement to investigate this possibility within future research using more controlled
designs (e.g., experimental) and investigating outcomes over time. The existing literature on
mentoring literature has not widely adopted such designs. Second, we operationalized
mentoring as the presence or absence of a mentor. However, there are other ways to examine
mentoring such as the amount of mentoring received, relationship length, or relationship
quality. The relationship between mentoring and protégé outcomes may differ based on how
mentoring is operationalized. We encourage additional cross-disciplinary research that uses
different conceptualizations of mentoring. Third, there were an insufficient number of studies
to conduct sub-group analyses for all protégé outcomes or to compare all three types of
mentoring. This leaves unexplored questions about the relative importance of mentoring across
youth, academic, and workplace mentoring. Another limitation involves the trade-offs
associated with using fixed-effects versus random-effects meta-analytic methods and the
inconsistent findings these two methods provided with regard to our search for sub-group
differences. Until additional studies become available for analysis, our sub-group analyses
should be viewed tentatively. Likewise, the Fail-Safe N analysis calls into question the stability
of several mentoring-outcome relationships. As such, the results reported in Tables 2 and 3
should be considered in light of the number of unpublished studies estimated as necessary to
obtain a p=.05.
In conclusion, our study represents the first attempt to quantitatively summarize the outcomes
associated with mentoring across the three major areas of research: youth, academic, and
workplace. The results suggest both similarities and differences in the benefits associated with
different types of mentoring relationships, thus setting the stage for new areas of integration
and future inquiry. The many positive benefits that our findings suggest could be associated
with mentoring, albeit the small effect sizes, suggest that continued research that further helps

worthwhile endeavor.
