REVIEW

strengthening for primary health care in low- 
and middle-income countries? A systematic 
scoping review to improve conceptual clarity

Abstract 
Background: Capacity strengthening of primary health care workers is widely used as a means to strengthen health 
service delivery, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the widespread recognition of the impor-
tance of capacity strengthening to improve access to quality health care, how the term ‘capacity strengthening’ is 
both used and measured varies substantially across the literature. This scoping review sought to identify the most 
common domains of individual capacity strengthening, as well as their most common forms of measurement, to gen-
erate a better understanding of what is meant by the term ‘capacity strengthening’ for primary health care workers.
Methods: Six electronic databases were searched for studies published between January 2000 and October 2020. 
A total of 4474 articles were screened at title and abstract phase and 323 full-text articles were reviewed. 55 articles 
were ultimately identified for inclusion, covering various geographic settings and health topics.
Results: Capacity strengthening is predominantly conceptualised in relation to knowledge and skills, as either sole 
domains of capacity, or used in combination with other domains including self-efficacy, practices, ability, and compe-
tencies. Capacity strengthening is primarily measured using pre- and post-tests, practical evaluations, and observa-
tion. These occur along study-specific indicators, though some pre-existing, validated tools are also used.
Conclusion: The concept of capacity strengthening for primary health care workers reflected across a number of 
relevant frameworks and theories differs from what is commonly seen in practice. A framework of individual capac-
ity strengthening across intra-personal, inter-personal, and technical domains is proposed, as an initial step towards 
building a common consensus of individual capacity strengthening for future work.

Introduction
Capacity strengthening for primary health care workers 
is widely relied upon as a strategy for improving health 
worker performance, for strengthening health systems, 
and for overall quality improvement in the delivery 
of health services globally [1–4]. In this way, capac -
ity strengthening interventions for human resources for 
health is considered an important mechanism to achieve 
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) under Workforce 
2030, through the Global Strategy for Human Resources 
for Health [5, 6], and to support the implementation of 
the Sustainable Development Goals, articulated in Goal 
17.9 [7]. In the context of these global frameworks, and

in recognition of the paramount importance of a strong 
workforce to strengthen health systems, there are sub -
stantial investments to build primary health worker 
capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). 
Strengthening health systems, including the workforce 
at primary level, is thus recognised as a vehicle through 
which to enhance quality of care for broader populations, 
particularly those most vulnerable or marginalised [6].
Broadly defined as the ability to carry out stated objec -
tives [8], capacity is a coveted aspect of human capital. 
Capacity strengthening (also commonly referred to as 
capacity building) has been conceptualised as an ongoing 
process by which individuals, groups, organisations, and 
societies increase their ability to perform core functions, 
solve problems, define and achieve objectives, and under-
stand and deal with development needs in a broad con -
text and sustainable manner [9]. This process is reflected 
across a number of prevalent models or frameworks, 
which consider capacity strengthening as taking place 
across individual, organisational, community, societal 
and a broader ‘systems’ components [10, 11].
Capacity strengthening for health interventions tends 
to take place at the level of the individual , ranging from 
training individuals in leadership, strategic thinking, 
supervisory, financial, project, and performance man -
agement skills, to training on more technical subjects, 
including laboratory, clinical and non-clinical, surveil -
lance, monitoring, and research skills [12, 13]. It also 
takes place at the level of the organisation (i.e. through 
improved partnership, leadership, or governance infra -
structure) [2]; and at the level of the community  (i.e. 
community health programming) [14, 15]. A common 
inference however, is that intervening at one level (i.e. at 
the level of the individual primary health care worker) 
will subsequently result in observable changes within 
another level (i.e. organisational) [16, 17].
Despite efforts to map the theoretical underpin -
nings of capacity strengthening approaches [17], assess -
ing or evaluating whether programmes designed to 
strengthen capacity effectively do so remains difficult, 
prompting some to call for the term to be considered 
and understood in more practical terms [15, 18]. Moreo-
ver, the effects of capacity strengthening interventions 
on improved health outcomes are difficult to ascertain. 
According to Crisp et  al. [16], evaluating capacity must 
consider that (i) capacity strengthening is a process and 
therefore evolves over time; (ii) aggregates of individual 
change may be insufficient to assess organisational or 
community level changes, and (iii) capacity strength -
ening may result in unintended consequences across 
other components. Similarly, Aroni [18] notes that the 
complexity and multi-disciplinary nature of capacity 
strengthening in practice poses inherent challenges when 
it comes to measuring changes in capacity. In response to 
the problem of measurement, others have attempted to 
conceptualise capacity strengthening in terms of its indi -
cators, or domains [15]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear 
what domains are most commonly used in the literature 
where studies claim to have demonstrated an increase in 
individual capacity among primary health care workers.
Study objectives
Despite the frequent use of the term ‘capacity strength -
ening’ within the academic and implementation litera -
ture, and the widespread recognition of the importance 
of capacity strengthening in improving access to qual -
ity health care [19], there is substantial variation in how 
capacity strengthening is both interpreted and measured. 
Thus, and informed by the growing emphasis within 
programmes on ‘capacity strengthening’ approaches for 
primary health care workers and by the absence of an 
identified set of domains comprising ‘capacity strength -
ening’ at the level of the individual, the aims of this scop -
ing review are twofold. Firstly, the study aimed to identify 
common domains of capacity strengthening for primary 
health care workers, assessed at the level of the individ -
ual. Specifically, we ask what domains are referred to, and 
in which combinations, in studies that aim to strengthen 
‘capacity’ among primary health care workers? Second, 
we identify the methods used to measure and assess these 
domains. In achieving both of these aims, we offer insight 
into what is commonly understood as individual capacity 
strengthening for primary health care within LMICs.
Methodology
A systematic scoping review of the literature was car -
ried out following procedures described by Arksey and 
O’Malley’s [20] and Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien [21]. 
Scoping review methodology was chosen because of the 
potential wide array of relevant literature, and because of 
the recognised value of scoping reviews in clarifying con -
cepts or to investigate research conduct [22]. The current 
review included articles published from 2000—corre -
sponding to the launch of the Millennium Development 
Goals—to October 2020. An initial search was conducted 
in July 2018, subsequently updated to October 2020. Both 
rounds of searching adhered to the same procedures, 
outlined below.
Identifying relevant studies—inclusion and exclusion 
criteria
The population was restricted to primary health care 
workers, conceptualised as any non-specialist health care 
worker providing health care at the first point of con -
tact to the health system, for individuals and families in 
the community [23, 24]. Included papers were further

required to describe capacity strengthening interven -
tions targeting the primary health care worker. Inter -
ventions specific to research capacity strengthening 
were excluded, as this has been extensively examined 
elsewhere [25]. Lastly, and given that capacity strength -
ening is recognised as a process taking place over time 
[16], only studies that measured changes in capacity were 
included. The review’s full inclusion and exclusion crite -
ria are summarised in Table 1.
Identifying relevant studies—search strategy
The search terminology included four categories: capac -
ity strengthening, health care providers, primary care, 
and low- and middle-income countries. A subject librar -
ian (GS) developed search strings for six electronic data -
bases—CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, ProQuest Social 
Science Premium Collection, PsycINFO, and Scopus—
which were searched using various combinations of 
indexing and key search terms. Additional file  1 contains 
the search strings formatted for MEDLINE. The refer -
ence lists of all articles retrieved for full-text screening 
were also searched.
Study selection
Two researchers (MF, BG or FV) independently assessed 
studies, at both title and abstract and full-text screen -
ing phase. Any discrepancies between the two primary 
screening authors were brought forward to the third 
author for review. If unresolved, all three discussed the 
study together and came to an agreement.
Data management, extraction and synthesis
Returned studies were imported into EndNote, where 
duplicates were removed. Remaining articles were then 
compiled and screened in Covidence, a systematic review 
data management tool. A data extraction template was 
created in Microsoft Excel to capture information includ-
ing the study characteristics, intervention characteristics, 
capacity strengthening domains and outcome measures. 
MF extracted the data for each included study and a sec -
ond author (BG or FV) independently compared extrac -
tions for 20% of the articles for inter-rater reliability. The 
authors also discussed any cases where it was necessary 
to clarify decisions.
Quality assessment
The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) [27] was 
applied to each article. MMAT has been used success -
fully for other systematic literature reviews [28] and was 
chosen for its ability to score studies of varying methodo-
logical traditions in a single coherent manner. Due to the 
nature of this review, the MMAT was not used to inform 
the interpretation of our findings, but is presented as a 
resource to readers who may wish to apply individual 
studies to their own practice.
Results
In total, 6078 articles were returned from the combined 
database searches, of which 1604 were duplicates. Of 
the 4474 screened at title and abstract phase, 323 were 
put through for full-text screening. 269 articles were 
excluded at full-text phase. An additional 21 articles 
were identified through snowballing, of which one was

Article characteristics
Primary health care workers in the sample studies 
included physicians, nurses, midwives, medical officers, 
community health workers, surveillance officers, clinical 
officers, as well as psychiatrists and disease control offic -
ers. Forty-nine capacity strengthening interventions took 
place in one national setting, two were set between two- 
or four-country contexts; and four were set across wider 
regions of the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Inter -
ventions were implemented across a range of settings 
including rural communities, cities, district and primary

health facilities, communities, as well as conferences and 
educational settings. Most studies (n = 46) were pub -
lished after 2010, with 40 published between 2015 and 
2020, aligning to an increased focus on capacity strength-
ening resulting from the commencement of the SDGs.
Capacity strengthening interventions ranged from dis -
ease prevention and surveillance, to clinical, management 
and supervision interventions. Each study contained 
some form of training for primary health care workers 
with the duration of training ranging from 2.5  hours to 
a 4-year ongoing programme. Interventions employed 
an array of educational resources including manuals, 
activities at conferences and workshops, lectures and 
e-learning supports, mentorship, and case studies and 
role plays, overall encompassing both didactic and expe -
riential learning. Additional file  2 contains the full table 
of included studies, their capacity strengthening topics 
and specific details on the approaches, components and 
measurements.
Quality assessment
MMAT resulted in the identification of 19 studies being 
deemed as low quality. The majority of studies complied 
with the quality criteria with 14 studies meeting all five 
and 22 studies meeting four of five. A detailed presenta -
tion of the ratings of each of the included studies, across 
the five criteria, is available in Additional file 3.
Objective 1: domains of capacity strengthening
Domains of capacity strengthening were extracted based 
on the terminology used in each study. Sixteen domains 
of capacity strengthening were identified across the 
sample of 55 studies: knowledge, skills, timeliness, con -
fidence, abilities, leadership, motivation, self-efficacy, 
commitment, resources, attitudes, practices, compe -
tence, awareness, professional satisfaction and profes -
sional quality of life. Table 2 provides a summary of these 
16 domains identified, including where they were used in 
combination with other domains (i.e. co-domains).
Within the sample, 16 studies defined capacity 
strengthening as a single domain. These studies meas -
ured knowledge (n = 13), skills (n = 2) and practice 
(n = 1). Nineteen studies used a combination of two 
domains, 14 used three domains, and the remaining 
used four (n = 5) and five (n = 1). Across the full sam -
ple, the most commonly reported domain of capacity 
strengthening was knowledge (n = 51). Knowledge was 
most frequently strengthened alongside skills (n = 18), 
attitude (n = 10), confidence (n = 8), practice (n = 6) and 
self-efficacy (n = 6). Skills were the second most recorded 
domain (n = 25), similarly most frequently strengthened 
alongside knowledge (n = 18), followed by confidence 
(n = 4). Knowledge or skills were present in 52 of 55 stud-
ies, either alone or in combination with other domains.
Domains of capacity were strengthened across a range 
of aspects of primary health care. Knowledge as a sole 
domain was strengthened primarily on clinical and tech -
nical subjects, with a more limited number of studies 
focusing on management and supervision. For exam -
ple, Citraningtyas et al. [29] built knowledge to enhance 
mental health workers’ understanding of how to pro -
vide assistance to children and adolescents in disaster 
affected areas in Indonesia. Strengthening of skills as 
the sole domain tended towards strengthening leader -
ship and management skills among supervisors [30, 31]. 
In the 18 studies which measured skills alongside knowl -
edge, capacity strengthening was conceptualised as both 
increases in content knowledge and observed practice, 
over a range of topics ranging from health promotion 
[32] to disease surveillance [33], and infection control 
[34]. One study related to ability to coach clinical skills 
and quality improvement [35], and another to the man -
agement of substance use conditions [36], with all other 
studies related to more technical skills, such as breast 
ultrasound interpretation [37], surveillance [33] and neo-
natal continuous positive airway pressure [38].
Thirteen studies assessing the domains of self-efficacy 
or confidence were applied to strengthen leadership, 
managerial or teaching capacity [39–42]; working with 
patients [43–46]; and for the provision of care, such as 
treatment for non-communicable disease [47], anti-ret -
roviral therapy [45], and providing mental health care 
[48–51], a topic which has become prevalent in more 
recent years.
Objective 2: measurements of capacity strengthening
Changes in individual capacity were measured using a 
range of methods including pre-intervention and post-
intervention objective knowledge assessments (n = 37), 
pre- and post-subjective assessments (n = 21), and 
observation or practical assessment (n = 20), among 
others. The various tools used to measure the strength -
ening of capacity are summarised in Table  3, according 
to each domain(s). Many studies contained a combina -
tion of approaches [37, 40, 46–48, 50, 52–64]. Research 
designs included pre- and post-survey measures, quasi-
experimental, prospective and retrospective evaluations, 
cluster randomised trial components, and participatory 
needs assessments.
Capacity strengthening for individual domains was pri -
marily measured via objective measures (n = 57), either 
through testing of percentage increase in knowledge 
(n = 37) or through the direct observation of a specific 
task ( n = 20). Change in knowledge was also assessed 
using subjective, self-report measures (n = 9), most

commonly determined by asking individuals whether 
they had perceived a change in knowledge as a result of 
a capacity strengthening intervention. Two studies meas-
ured skills alone, one using a subjective measure [30] and 
the other using an objective measure [31]. For the most 
part, skills were measured directly through observation 
or practice assessment (n = 11), but in some cases, the 
acquisition of skills through practice was inferred from 
the acquisition of knowledge [58, 65, 66]. Ameme et  al. 
[65] examined the impact of knowledge gained on prac -
tice and Minh et al. [58] recognised that knowledge does 
not always translate into practice.
Attitudes were largely measured through self-eval -
uation (n = 4) and vignettes (n = 3), but also through 
practice [62]. Confidence was always measured through 
pre–post self-report assessments (n = 8).
Twelve studies used multiple methods including a com-
bination of subjective and objective measures of capacity. 
For example, Sennun et al. [67] employed a combination 
of subjective, self-rated assessment and objective obser -
vation to measure the effect of supervision models on 
the knowledge and ability of Health Officers and District 
Level Supervisors. In contrast, Davila et  al. [47] used 
objective measures of knowledge and subjective, partici -
pant self-report measures to assess strengthening in the 
multiple domains of skills and self-efficacy for treating 
non-communicable diseases. Validated scales were used 
in 19 studies, including the Nursing Best Practice Guide -
lines [43]; Objective Structured Clinical Assessment 
(OSCA) [61]; and the mental health Global Action Pro -
gramme (mhGAP) Knowledge Assessment and Attitude 
Scale [49–51, 64]. Full details of these validated tools are 
in Additional file 4.
The majority of studies (n = 36) measured outcomes 
in terms of a percentage change in the domain between 
pre- and post-intervention—whether objective or sub -
jective—and the statistical significance of this change. 
Fourteen studies combined this with observation and six 
relied on observation alone to observe changes in knowl -
edge, skills or practice [31, 38, 68–71]. In some cases, 
strengthened capacity through observation was rated as 
a percentage improvement [31], and in other cases, it was 
simply observed [57].
In terms of the time intervals across which capacity 
was assessed, most of the interventions (n = 28) assessed 
changes in capacity across short intervals, of around 
1 week, ranging from 2.5 hours [57] to 2 days (n = 8) to 
5  days (n = 8), and 6 to 8  days (n = 4); with others hav -
ing intervals of several weeks or months (n = 17). These 
ranged from 1  month [56] up to 6 or 7 (n = 6) months, 
18 months [72] and 4 years [43]. In four cases, domains 
were assessed a third time, after a period of some 
months, in order to assess the longer-term sustainabil -
ity of the capacity strengthening intervention [52, 73]. 
For example, Blignault et  al. [73] measured knowledge, 
attitudes and confidence via a pre- and post-workshop 
test, and measured attitudes and confidence 6  months 
later through a questionnaire on experience of learning 
in day-to-day practice. The degree or amount of capacity 
strengthened was primarily determined through a range 
of comparative and correlational analyses (i.e. t tests/
ANOVAs, Chi-square, and regression analyses), manual 
content analysis, descriptive multi-variate and factor 
analysis, and difference-in-difference. Studies of high 
quality had strong conceptual frameworks and method -
ologies to guide the organisation and analysis of capacity 
strengthening.
Discussion
A common understanding of what is meant by ‘strength -
ening capacity’ for the primary health care workforce is 
needed, given their critical role in providing quality, per -
son-centred health care. The importance of this common 
understanding is further reflected through the substan -
tial investment in and focus on building primary health 
worker capacity in LMICs, as a key component of health 
systems strengthening. This scoping review therefore 
sought to synthesise the existing literature to determine 
how the concept of individual ‘capacity strengthening’ is 
operationalised and measured in practice, as an initial 
step towards building greater consensus around what is 
meant by the term ‘capacity strengthening’ for primary 
health care workers in LMICs.
The most salient domains identified in the sample were 
knowledge—included in all but four studies—and skills, 
followed by attitude, confidence, and practice. Overall,

only 20 studies in the review assessed the active imple -
mentation of objectives, through either observation or 
assessment of practical application. Consequently, our 
results suggest that the definition of capacity as “a meas -
ure of ability and, as most simply defined, capacity is 
the ability to carry out stated objectives” [18] is not sys -
tematically reflected in the operationalisation of capac -
ity strengthening within the extant literature. Rather, 
our results suggest that capacity strengthening, where 
assessed, is largely operationalised as testing knowledge 
for action.
Capacity was predominantly measured using pre- and 
post-tests of knowledge change, with few studies trac -
ing how improved knowledge translates into subsequent 
changes in practice. Of those studies that did assess how 
increased knowledge translates into practice, this was 
largely achieved through observation or practice assess -
ments. Frequently, mechanisms to increase knowledge at 
individual level were simply assumed to lead to organisa -
tional-level capacity strengthening. For example, Muru -
gesan et  al. [74] built knowledge of doctors on diabetes 
care assuming this would lead to changes in their attitude 
and approach to chronic care of diseases and increase the 
national capacity for management of diabetes.
In addition to being deemed of higher quality, stud -
ies with more developed conceptual frameworks tended 
to frame capacity strengthening in broader and more 
comprehensive terms, that is, incorporating more than 
one domain and often across categories. Studies concep -
tualising capacity in this wider sense also tended to be 
informed by frameworks of capacity as broader develop -
ment and aimed to strengthen each domain in a cohe -
sive and stepwise manner. As an example, Chaoniyom 
et al. [53] strengthened the domain of motivation along -
side knowledge, abilities and leadership. Other studies 
that employed broader frameworks of capacity included 
Davila et  al. [47], who relied on experiential learning 
theory to inform their study design. Additionally, and 
while a 2017 systematic review of theoretical approaches 
to capacity strengthening [17] identified various theories 
related to capacity strengthening, we found no overlap 
between the review’s sample and the present sample. 
Overall, very few studies identified in the current study 
cited specific theories underpinning their approach.
Given the range of domains and measurements found 
in the literature, the common use of the term ‘capac -
ity’ , and the focus on strengthening health care sys -
tems within global health, we identify a need for a more 
defined description of what is, and what is not, consid -
ered ‘capacity strengthening’ . Notably, we argue that one 
domain is insufficient to be considered ‘capacity strength-
ening’ and encourage that going forward, the use of the 
term ‘capacity strengthening’ be reserved for broader, 
multi-faceted, interventions working across more than 
one domain. In this way, we recommend interventions 
addressing a single domain to simply use the terminology 
ascribed to the specific activity (i.e. increasing skills or 
improving knowledge, etc.) as a more accurate reflection 
of an intervention’s impact, rather than using the broader 
term ‘capacity strengthening’ .
In light of our findings, we propose that individual 
capacity be better conceptualised in terms of a combi -
nation of domains that span technical ability, such as 
knowledge and skills; intra-personal domains, as domains 
internal to the individual, such as motivation and confi -
dence; and inter-personal domains, such as leadership 
and management. These combinations can overlap in dif-
ferent ways, specific to each context, to offer a more com-
prehensive framework. Applying this framework to the 
current review, all 55 studies measured technical or clini-
cal aspects of health care, 19 measured intra-personal 
aspects such as confidence, self-efficacy and attitude, and 
two measured inter-personal aspects of leadership and 
resources. Figure  2 offers a summary of this framework, 
whereby individual capacity building is conceptualised as 
a broader, more comprehensive and strategic model.
The domains identified in this review therefore 
reflect the three domains of learning, as identified 
within the educational literature (i.e. cognitive, affec -
tive and psychomotor) [75– 77], whereby ability, 
practices and skills related to a technical capacity to 
perform a task or set of tasks (psychomotor); moti -
vation, self-efficacy, confidence and commitment all 
related to an intra-personal capacity (affective); and

leadership and management related to  an inter-per -
sonal capacity (cognitive). This new conceptualisation 
thus aligns with the literature on educational theo -
ries and other models and frameworks underpinning 
capacity strengthening interventions relevant to pub -
lic health, for example, theories such as Diffusion of 
Innovations and Transformational Learning, and mod -
els such as Ecological and Interactive Systems Frame -
work for Dissemination and Implementation [17]. We 
propose that initiatives to strengthen individual-level 
capacity and truly embed change within organisations 
and environments must therefore take into consid -
eration the need to build capacity across these three 
spheres.
Limitations
The current study is not without limitations. Firstly, 
the study was limited by having one principal data 
extractor, though there was discussion of any cases, 
where necessary. Second, while we extracted domains 
in terms of how they were named in the articles, we 
acknowledge that these different terminologies may 
overlap in terms of their meaning. Third, and though 
we did include some search terms in French and Por -
tuguese, studies were restricted only to the English 
language. Fourth, setting the cut-off year at 2000 
might have resulted in the exclusion of studies that 
demonstrate earlier conceptualisations of capacity. 
Finally, while this review advances our understanding 
of what is meant by capacity strengthening within the 
literature, further research is required to test the valid -
ity of our proposed framework.
Conclusion
In the era of the Agenda 2030, Workforce 2030 and 
Universal Health Coverage, there is strong focus on 
strengthening capacities at individual, organisational and 
environmental levels. This study reviewed the evidence-
base to identify salient domains of capacity at individual 
level, including how they are measured. The concept of 
capacity strengthening for primary health care reflected 
in a number of relevant frameworks and theories differs 
from what is commonly seen in practice, where capacity 
building is largely seen as knowledge increase and skills 
development. Conceptually however, capacity strength -
ening is more than knowledge acquisition. A concep -
tualisation of individual capacity strengthening across 
technical, intra-personal and inter-personal  domains 
is proposed as a way to offer greater conceptual clarity 
and a more practical application of this concept in future 
work.
