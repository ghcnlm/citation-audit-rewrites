ABSTRACT  
This study examines policymakers’ perceptions of the nature and hierarchy of evidence used 
in the development of public polici es in Nigeria. Specifically, it explores the kind of 
information, data, and ideas that policymakers in Nigeria utilise in policymaking, the relative 
importance that the policymakers attach to the different kinds of evidence, and the contextual 
political factors that influence not only the utilisation of evidence but the policy process. A 
major justification for this study is that while significant progress has been recorded in the use 
of evidence in policymaking in developed Western nations, there is a noti ceable paucity of 
such literature in Africa . The situation is, however, gradually improving and there is an 
increasing awareness of the concept of evidence -based policymaking (EBP) leading to a rise 
in scholarly attention. Nevertheless, a significant numbe r of the burgeoning Afrocentric 
literature focuses on the relationship between research and policy, with only a few empirical 
research dealing with the notion of evidence. In Nigeria, studies on the use of evidence in 
policymaking focus largely on health p olicies and the use of evidence in the development of 
non-health policies is an under-researched area. 
This study seeks to answer the main question: “What is the nature and hierarchy of evidence 
used in the development of public policies in Nigeria?” The study adopts an exploratory, 
inductive, multiple-case study design to examine the development of four federal government 
policies. Data collection was based on triangulation. First, 36 respondents (nine for each policy) 
were purposively selected and in terviewed using a semi -structured interview method. A total 
of 20 of the interviews were conducted face-to-face while 16 were done through the telephone. 
Second, online questionnaires were administered to the 36 respondents after the completion of 
all the interviews. Third, policy documents, including reports on policy successes, failures, and 
remedial actions were analysed.  
Findings showed that contrary to the dominant view, a wide range of evidence is used in the 
development of public policies in Nigeria. This study identified nine kinds of evidence used in 
policy formulation: research evidence, previous policies evidence, media evidence, internet 
evidence, residual knowledge of policymakers’ evidence, MDA (Ministries, Departments, and 
Agencies) evidence, local consultants’ evidence, ideology evidence, and external stakeholders’ 
evidence. Interestingly, the last four types of evidence were identified for the first time by this 
study as substantive types of evidence used in policymaking in Nigeria. A hierar chy of

evidence, showing the relative priority the policymakers attach to the nine kinds of evidence 
was developed based on data. The findings further identified three venues where the different 
kinds of evidence were integrated - advisory/technical committees, stakeholders’ 
meetings/workshops, and the legislature.  
Findings also showed that the government did not only play a central role in policymaking, but 
it also controlled the process. And even where the government decided to allow non-state actors 
to ‘lead’ the policy process, it still control led the process from the shadows. Consequently, 
while different kinds of evidence are a vailable to policymakers, the utilisation of evidence in 
the policy process largely depends on political considerations. So, although evidence-based 
policymaking is often contrasted with policymaking based on “ideology”, the true picture 
appears to be considerably more nuanced. The study concludes by suggesting that stakeholders 
desirous of impacting policies should be aware of the nuances of policymaking  and leverage 
the policymaking venues to provide relevant evidence.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  
PhD is a journey of a lifetime, and for me, it has been an arduous but unbelievably rewarding 
journey. Yet, I could not have achieved such an accomplishment without the support of so 
many people to whom I am deeply indebted.  
I would like to express my gratitude to my wonderful supervis ory team: Professor Jonathan 
Portes, and Dr Ismail Wale. To Professor Portes, you are not only a fantastic scholar but an 
amazing human being. Throughout the supervisory period, you showed erudition and 
compassion, and you trusted me. I hope in the end, I was able to justify the trust. Dr Wale 
Ismail’s understanding of policymaking in Nigeria, and his guidance on Nigerian literature, 
case selection, and how to conduct the research, were invaluable. Thank you both for bringing 
out the best in me. 
I appreciate the Faculty of Social Science and Public Policy and the Department of Political 
Economy for their support; and my friends at KCL for their friendship. I also appreciate all my 
participants for taking part in the study. I had at least two engagements with  each of the 
participants and they demonstrated a great attitude throughout the period.  
I’m extremely grateful to my employer, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for funding my 
study. Special mention to Hajiya Umma Aminu Dutse, my former director, who recommended 
me for this programme and who remained a pillar of support throughout the journey. To Hajiya 
Khadija Kasim, Alhaji Ibrahim Umar Hassan, Dr Thompson Asalu, Alhaji Haruna Bala 
Mustafa, Mrs. Mercy Lar, and Dr Obot Udofia, I will always be thankful.    
Grateful thanks to Irfan Salahuddin and Salaudeen Olajide for helping with the formatting; Dr 
Mustafa Abba for ‘luring’ me to Milton Keynes and for the continuous support; Dr Usman 
Alkali, for sharing the PhD ‘secret s’; Dr Fati Jika, for the moral support; Dr Lydia Nerat 
Chundusu Suleh for having your brother’s back, and Dr Michael Erhabor (E wogboka) for the 
scholarly and brotherly support. Our discussions at Tarragindi, Penrose Street, King George 
Square, and during our numerous ‘waka about’ in the beautiful city of Brisbane, Australia 
served a further fillip to my PhD dream.  
My deepest gratitude to my large and wonderful ‘families’: the Dalhatu Iyan Bida family, the 
Mallam Habibu family, the ‘Kaduna’ family; and the Yahaya Kandi family . My sincere 
gratitude to my uncles, Alhaji Haruna Dalhatu Iya (the Iyan Nupe ) and Dr Bala Muhammad 
Dalhatu (Ya Bala) for their support over the years. Special thanks to my mother-in-law and late 
father-in-law for their incredible kindness  and relentless prayers. A huge thank you to my 
siblings for always being there (late Ya Nana, Ya Ciroma, Ya Dan’Asabe, Ya Danladi, late Ya 
Danjuma, Ya Maikudi, Lami, Mama, Sagi, and Yaya  Jummai). You have each supported me 
uniquely. May Allah forgive all the departed in my large family on the day when the account 
is established. 
At the apex of the familial gratitude pyramid are my parents! To my mum, Hajiya Gogo Waziri, 
I can never express in words the impact of your love, support, and prayers. To my dad and 
hero, late Alhaji Muhammad Bako Habibu (Bako Dzuru) you left when I was roughly a toddler,

yet I remember you every day with great fondness. “My Lord, have mercy upon them (my 
parents) as they nurtured me when I was small” (Qur’an 17: 24).  
To our amazing families in the UK - the Karami family, the Akpokiniovo family, the Kabbah 
family, and the Johnson family , you made our stay in the UK memorable and a home away 
from home. Thanks, mates!   
Grateful thanks to numerous relatives and friends for regularly checking on me and asking: 
“How far?”: Ibrahim Mahmud, Muhammad Danlami Saidu, Dr Omeize (Talba), Ahmed 
Haruna, Ibrahim Umar Faruk, and Mohammed Badamasi Ndagi, to mention a few. Many 
thanks to my colleagues and friends in the CBN: Ibrahim Yahaya, Aminu Muhammad, Stephen 
Tamanuwa, Ahmed Maidawa, Buhari Isah, Ramadan Garba Aliyu, Sule Mahmud Mundi, 
Ibrahim Aliyu Yerima, Martin Nwedi, Abubakar Albasu, Banon David Fada, Abubakar 
Nata’ala, Chikezie Isiguzo, Duncan Akoma, Umar Sani, Usman Musa, Isah Yusuff Yusuff 
(Massaro). Apologies for leaving out so many. Rest assured I appreciate you greatly. 
And now…how do I say this? You have been everything I ever wanted and even more. Hamy, 
thank you most profoundly for the unbelievable love, understanding and sacrifice! And to the 
apples of our eyes – Muhammad, Salma, and Halima - you have been awesome even though 
you often desecrated the quietude of my ‘library’. Now, you guys will be happy to ‘harass’ me 
more, a reward for waiting so patiently.   
Finally, and most importantly, I give ultimate thanks and praises to Almighty Allah, the Most 
Beneficent, the Most Merciful. “Then which of the favours of your Lord will you deny?” 
(Qur’an 55: 13).

CHAPTER 1 
1.0. INTRODUCTION  
Democratic governments all over the world strive to improve the lives of their citizens through 
the development and implementation of appropriate public policies. Policymaking is, however, 
a complex process. As a result, seas of inks have been expended and  a great deal of effort is 
ongoing to improve policymaking. One of the most contemporary efforts of public sector 
reformers in the past half-century to promote the effectiveness of policymaking is the birth of 
evidence-based policymaking (EBP) (Howlett, 20 09). The central objective of the concept is 
to determine what government policies or interventions work, and why they work (Blunkett, 
2000). This thinking is in response to the hitherto ideologically driven policymaking style that 
dominated the 1980s and the early parts of the 1990s (Banks, 2009; Davies et al., 2000a; Kay, 
2011). The dominant conception of EBP involves the use of research knowledge to improve 
policymaking ( Boaz, et al., 2008; Clarence, 2002; Head 2008; Nutley et al.,  2007). A 
burgeoning mi nority view, however, argues that in addition to research knowledge, EBP 
encompasses other forms of ‘evidence’ including expert knowledge, stakeholder inputs, and 
politics (Banks, 2009; Head 2008; 2010; Kay 2011; Maddison 2012).  
Notwithstanding the forego ing definitional debate, interest in EBP and its popularity has 
continued to grow among scholars and practitioners. Yet, while the EBP  is relatively well -
entrenched in developed countries (Head, 2010; Marston and Watts 2003), it remains an 
evolving field in developing countries (Onwujekwe et al., 2015). 
1.1. Background and Rationale 
My desire to undertake this study was inspired by my professional experience. Before I 
commenced the study, I worked in three policymaking departments at the Central Bank of 
Nigeria (CBN) for 14 years, cumulatively. Across these departments, I was involved  in the 
development of numerous policies designed to regulate, and influence the behaviours of, 
financial institutions under the regulatory purview of the CBN in furtherance of its mandates.  
In my last department, the Consumer Protection Department, I was  the acting head of the 
Standards Development Office (SDO), responsible for the development of consumer 
protection policies, which are regarded as technical financial policies. In the development of 
policies, we typically obtained “particular sets of information…from relatively narrow circles
<<<PAGE=16>>>
2 
 
of actors” (Head, 2008, p.4) suggesting a fairly “closed” policy arena. To illustrate, in the 
development of the “Consumer Protection Regulations” (CPR) we obtained consumer 
protection inputs from a few sources: the in ternet, financial institutions, other departments in 
the CBN, consumer protection associations, and the World Bank. As the acting head of the 
SDO, I was directly involved in the entire policymaking process, including the generation and 
integration of the few forms of evidence obtained. Beyond my department, I was also involved 
in the development of other financial policies in the CBN. Based on my experiences, I have 
wondered how evidence generation and integration are undertaken in the development of social 
policies since the arena is markedly different and involves a broad range of policy actors 
operating in an “open” policy arena. Young et al. (2002, p.288) tell us that this arena is “messy, 
uncertain, unstable and essentially political”. Consequently, I w anted to find answers to the 
following important questions: What kinds of evidence do policymakers use in the 
development of social policies in Nigeria? What level of priority do the policymakers attach to 
the different kinds of evidence they use and why? What influence do governments exert in the 
policy process?  
To gain insights into the concept of evidence within the broader discourse of EBP, I studied 
relevant literature and explored previous empirical research. This enhanced my understanding 
of the phe nomenon and exposed me to the interesting scholarly discussions and debates 
surrounding it (O’Leary, 2014) some of which I present in subsequent paragraphs.  
The idea that evidence should be the basis of public policy has become a popular refrain around 
the world and many scholars (for example Harding, 2008; Head, 2010, 2008; Kay, 2011; 
Maddison, 2012; Marston and Watts 2003) have affirmed that evidence enriches policymaking. 
As emphasised by Marston and Watts (2003, p.144), “It is difficult to imagine anyone arguing 
that policy should be based on anything but the best available evidence.” 
Unpacking the concept of evidence, however, highlights deep tension and contradictions. The 
determination of what is considered evidence is highly contentious (Dobrow et al., 2004; Head, 
2008; Kay, 2011; Maddison, 2012). Thus, while it is settled that the use of evidence improves 
policy, there are fundamental disagreements among scholars regarding what is considered 
evidence.  
The dominant view in the literature is that evidence is information acquired through systematic 
research (Greenhalgh and Russell, 2009; Kay, 2011). This position is, however, criticised by
<<<PAGE=17>>>
3 
 
other scholars (e.g., Gray, 2004; Head, 2008; Kay, 2011; Maddison, 2012) who argued that 
stakeholder inputs, expert knowledge, and political considerations are all part of evidence. This 
demonstrates that within the EBP discourse, the concept of evidence is ‘both useful and 
problematic’ (Tenbensel, 2008, p.2).  
In addition to the debate about what is considered evidence, there is an equally important debate 
about the relative value of the different kinds of evidence. Of particular interest is the fact that 
policymakers are considered rational and as such, they prioritise certain forms of evidence over 
others (Cairney a nd Oliver, 2017). Yet, “the most fiercely debated notion in EBP is the 
claim…that there is an ‘evidence-hierarchy’” (Head, 2010, p.82). Consequently, scholars differ 
on the weight policymakers (should) accord research evidence (Marston and Watts 2003; 
Tenbensel, 2008), stakeholder evidence (Onwujekwe et al., 2021), expert knowledge 
(Lawrence et al., 2017), and ideology (Head, 2010). Indeed, there is rarely any consensus 
among scholars and practitioners on the value of any particular evidence (Alliance for U seful 
Evidence, 2015; Boruch and Rui, 2008; Hansen, 2014; Haynes et al., 2012; Leigh, 2009; Nutley 
et al., 2013). Notwithstanding, studies on the relative importance policymakers give to the 
different kinds of evidence are limited (Onwujekwe et al., 2015). 
Beyond the nature of evidence, the other related key element of the EBP is the way policies 
are developed (Young et al., 2002). It is, therefore, useful to determine “the ‘venues’ in which 
policymaking takes place” (Cairney and Oliver, 2017, p.5) and the way the different players, 
especially governments, impact the process (Banks, 2009; Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Head 
2008; 2010; Kay 2011; Maddison 2012). It has been long established that policymaking is 
inherently political, making Nutley et al. (2002), rec ommend the use of ‘evidence aware’ or 
‘evidence influenced’ to reflect the dominance of government in the policy process and to 
moderate expectation of what can be achieved. Indeed, governmental authority is critical in the 
determination of policy problems and their solutions (Marston and Watts 2003). A number of 
scholars, however, argue that in the last few decades, private -sector policy players have 
marginalised governments in policymaking (Bevir and Rhodes, 2003; Rhodes, 2017; Ryser et 
al., 2021).  
In all, the continuous debates highlighted above deserved to be looked at from a completely 
different perspective to enhance understanding of the evidence phenomenon and to address 
gaps in the literature.

1.2. Addressing Gaps in the Literature 
The extensive literature review I undertook revealed the following gaps in the literature. First, 
previous studies on the nature of evidence used for the development of public policies have 
largely focussed on developed OECD countries such as Australia, Ca nada, the USA, and the 
United Kingdom, and could be termed as predominantly Western in outlook (See for example 
Bennett and Holloway, 2010; Boswell, 2014; Head 2008, 2010, 2014; Lester 2018; Maddison 
2012; Marston and Watts 2003; Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021;  Nutley et al., 2002). Therefore, 
there was a noticeable paucity of evidence literature on Africa, particularly on Nigeria, which 
was the focus of this research. Indeed, there has been a striking difference between the level of 
EBP adoption and EBP capacities between the developed OECD countries and their developing 
countries counterparts (Head, 2010). Thus, there was a need for a study located in developing 
countries to address the identified gap and enhance understanding of evidence and EBP. In that 
regard, research organisations like the Africa Evidence Network (AEN) and the Africa Centre 
for Evidence (ACE) were established in the last decade to promote the use of evidence in both 
public and private sectors in Africa. These organisations continue to inter vene in significant 
ways to address existing gap in evidence knowledge. For instance, i n 2021, the South Africa-
based Africa Centre for Evidence (ACE) contributed evidence to tackle Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) 1 - 17 in the continent (Africa Centre for Evidence, 2021). During 
the same period, the Africa Evidence Network organised the Africa Evidence Week (AfEW) 
which brought together 600 delegates that participated in over 100 activities tailored to promote 
the adoption of evidence-based policymaking (Rajagopal, 2021).  
Quite surprisingly, research efforts to address the gap in evidence knowledge and promote the 
use of evidence in the continent fail to focus much on Nigeria despite it being a leading country 
in terms of economy, population, and hist ory. For example, an influential book on the use of 
evidence in Africa titled “Using Evidence in Policy and Practice: Lessons from Africa”, edited 
by Ian Goldman and Mine Pabari (2020) examines the use of evidence in five African countries 
(Benin, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa , Uganda, and West Africa ) excluding Nigeria . Thus, 
empirical studies on the use of evidence in policymaking in Nigeria remain significantly 
inadequate (Akinbinu and Tiamiyu, 2016; Onwujekwe, et al., 2015).    
Second, although Nig eria is gradually embracing EBP leading to increasing awareness and 
scholarly attention, most of the Afrocentric studies located in the country have predominantly 
explored the relationship between research evidence and policy (Uzochukwu et al., 2016) with
<<<PAGE=19>>>
5 
 
only a relatively small amount dealing with other forms of evidence. Furthermore, many of the 
few studies that examined other forms of evidence focussed on health policies (Onwujekwe et 
al., 2015; Uneke et al., 2018) resulting in much less attention being paid to non-health policies. 
This situation has presented me with an opportunity to contribute to a burgeoning body of 
knowledge by examining four non-health policies.    
Third, research on the EBP has largely focused on the nature and role of evidence in 
policymaking with scant attention given to where and how different forms of evidence are 
integrated into the policy process. Another related under -researched aspect of EBP is the 
influence of governments in the policy process. Drawing from Young et al. (20 02), it means 
scholarly attention has been concentrated on one key element of the EBP (the nature of 
evidence) at the expense of the other key element (the way policies are developed). It is clear, 
therefore, that an empirical study to bridge the identified gap and contribute more insights into 
the EBP discourse is due.  
1.3. Research Aims 
This exploratory study aimed to critically interrogate the nature and hierarchy of evidence used 
in the development of public policies in Nigeria. It also aimed to explore the  influence of 
governments in the policy process. 
1.4. Research Objectives 
To achieve the aims of the study, I will: 
1. Identify the types of evidence policymakers use in the development of public policies.  
2. Analyse policymakers’ perceptions of the relative usefulness of the types of evidence they 
use in policy development and develop an empirical hierarchy of evidence. 
3. Ascertain the sites where the different kinds of evidence are integrated into the policy 
process. 
4. Identify the meta-governance practices employed by governments in the policy process.
<<<PAGE=20>>>

1.5. Research Questions 
The study was guided by the following research questions:  
1. What is the nature and hierarchy of evidence used by policymakers in the development of 
public policies in Nigeria? 
2. Where are the different kinds of evidence integrated into the policy process? 
3. How do governments influence the policy process? 
1.6. Significance of the Study 
This qualitative study is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, it will contribute to the 
body of evidence-based knowledge and provide empirical insights into the progress (or lack of 
progress) Nigeria has recorded in EBP. In this sense, the study becomes part of the growing 
literature on evidence-based policymaking in Nigeria and Africa.  
Secondly, the study will evaluate policymakers’ perceptions of the relative usefulness of the 
types of evidence they use in policy development and develop an empirical hierarchy of 
evidence based on the fieldwork data to serve as a contribution to existing  knowledge in the 
area. This study will, therefore, provide respondents an opportunity to reflect on, and better 
understand, the policymaking process, especially the under -discussed area of evidence 
utilization.  
Thirdly, it is hoped that the study would p rovide a strong incentive for increased citizen 
participation in policymaking in tandem with the democratic ideals of plurality and 
accountability. In that regard, the study could potentially assist policymakers to develop more 
inclusive, effective, and implementable policies considering relevant socio-political factors.  
Fourthly, by elucidating the benefits of EBP, it is also hoped that the study would engender the 
use of evidence as an imperative in policy development, enhance policy implementation, and 
promote good governance.  
Finally, the study will provide relevant information to future researchers who wish to study 
EBP, either within the Nigerian policymaking environment or in similar contexts.

1.7. Research Context 
The study was undertaken as an explor atory, inductive, multiple case study approach and 
examined four federal policies developed from 2015 to 2019 in Nigeria. A wide range of 
policymakers, representing different interests within the public and private sectors participated 
in the development of the policies. This research is, therefore, an inquiry into the perspectives 
of the respondents regarding the nature and hierarchy of evidence used in the development of 
public policy in Nigeria. The research also inquired into the respondents’ perspectives on how 
different kinds of evidence are integrated into the policy process and the influence of 
government in the process.    
1.8. Identity Positioning 
My interest in evidence and EBP is based on my personal experience as a policymaker. Having 
participated in the development of numerous policies, and the conception of some of them, it 
is natural that I have one or two biases. 
My major bias is that I am an advocate of the use of multiple evidence in policy development. 
I have a strong belief that each form of evidence offers something different to the policy process 
and synthesising these disparate forms of evidence promotes inclusion, flexibility, efficiency, 
and effectiveness. Notably, of all the different forms of evidence, my personal priority is the 
inputs of those who would be directly affected by a policy - whom I refer to as direct 
stakeholders - because they provide remarkable value to the policy process on account of their 
lived experiences, which the policymakers rarely possess. My support for obtaining the inputs 
of direct stakeholders extends into the development of ‘financial regulations’ which are seen 
as technical policies. It is worth stressing that technical policies are developed to address 
bounded problems (Head, 2008). Notwithstanding, I have consistently advocated that for any 
policy, all stakeholders should be invited to the table to the extent practically possible, and their 
views should be considered. Also as explained in section 1.1, I have reasonable experience in 
policymaking. 
Taken together, these biases are both an asset and a challenge (Glesne, 2006). They are an asset 
because I was familiar with the policy process and could ask relevant questions. They, however, 
represented a challenge because they could influence interpretation and a nalysis of data. To 
address that I ensured that I remained aware of these biases and framed questions in a neutral

way and listening carefully so that I allowed the data to speak. I also triangulated my data 
(Noble and Heale, 2019).

CHAPTER 2 
PUBLIC POLICY: CONCEPTUALISING  EVIDENCE -BASED 
POLICYMAKING  
2.0. INTRODUCTION  
The previous chapter introduced the study in terms of its background, aims, objectives, and 
significance. This chapter, which is one of two literature review chapters, critically reviews 
relevant extant literature and is structured into six sections. Section one introduces the concept 
of public policy highlighting some definitions, typologies, prospects and constraints. Section 
two covers selected policymaking models and theories, and highlights some of their strengths 
and weaknesses. Section three g ives an overview of evidence -based policymaking (EBP), 
focusing on its history, successes, and failures. Section four contextualises the concept of 
evidence and examines the hierarchy of evidence. Drawing from the literature, especially the 
iron triangle m odel, section five conceptualises policymaking venues. Finally, section six 
evaluates the governance approaches to highlight the metagovernance functions in the policy 
process. 
2.1. PUBLIC POLICY: SOME DEFINITIONS  
Like any concept in social and political s cience, public policy is without a generally accepted 
definition. Scholars and practitioners view the term from the prism of their experiences, 
orientation, or biases. The attempt to define it has only been partly successful as the concept is 
still regarde d as elusive and vague (Colebatch, 2009; Hill, 2013). Thus, there still exists 
confusion regarding what it is and what kind of evidence is used in policy development. 
Interestingly, despite the difficulty in understanding it, people expect their government s to 
employ policies to solve their personal and collective problems.  
In defining public policy, Althaus et al., (2007, p.5) state that the term is used in reference to 
“an authoritative statement by a government about its intentions.” This definition cov ers only 
the articulated plans of governments which makes it narrow and simplistic. Meanwhile, 
Richards and Smith (2002, p.1) define the term as “a formal decision or a plan of action that 
has been taken by, or has involved, a state organization.” This def inition, like the one by 
Althaus et al., (2007) emphasizes the formal articulation of governments’ decisions, in addition 
to actions of governments in furtherance of those decisions. The foregoing definitions are,
<<<PAGE=25>>>
11 
 
therefore, overtly state -centric and presu me that evidence from non -state actors may not be 
necessary in policymaking.   
In terms of governments’ actions to implement their intentions or decisions, majority of 
scholars concur with Richards and Smith and believe public policy is not just about intentions 
or decisions, but crucially, also about actions designed to implement the intentions or decisions 
of governments. In one of the earliest definitions of policy, Easton (1953, p.130) describes it 
as “a web of decisions and actions that allocates values.” Easton affirms that decisions are mere 
expression of intention and as such should be recognised as the first phase of a policy while 
the actions to implement the decisions represent the second and more important phase of a 
policy. Elaborating on this d efinition, Hill (2013) observes that it raises some interesting 
perspectives including a notion that a policy involves a series of micro decisions which 
culminate into a macro decision; and that an action taken overtime invariably qualifies to be 
called a policy even if such action was not based on any formally prescribed decision. 
Easton’s perspective is a pragmatic one in that it stresses the need to situate the twin elements 
of authority and action in the policy frame. Expressing similar sentiment, Dearlove (2011, p.2) 
views public policy to mean “the substance of what government does; to the pattern of 
resources, they actually commit as a response to what they see as public problems or challenges 
warranting public action for their solution or attainment.” On why he disregards governments’ 
decisions or intentions in his definition, he explains: 
“…I do not consider that goals, intentions, principles, decisions, wishes, objectives or anything 
else that has been seen as constituting a public policy represents an appropriate usage of the 
term.” 
Notwithstanding, the use of evidence in policymaking remains a debatable issue in the 
literature.     
Returning to the definition of policy, Considine (1994, p.3), offers two interesting definitions. 
The first one, which he calls the ‘standard view’ refers to “an action which employs 
governmental authority to commit resources in support of a preferred value” while the 
‘alternative definition’ involves “the continuing work done by group of policy actors who use 
available public institutions to articulate and express the things they value” (Considine, 1994, 
p.4). The standard view is state -centric in nature as it views policy as a manifestation of 
governmental power in the allocation of  resources to achieve specified goals - a top-bottom
<<<PAGE=26>>>
12 
 
approach in which governments could undertake policymaking without evidence from non -
state actors.  
This approach, according to Maddison and Denniss (2009) has the following four major 
characteristics: 
a. It is designed to achieve a specific outcome. 
b. It considers both the end and the means to achieve it. 
c. It may comprise action or inaction either of which is based on knowledge derived from 
experience. 
d. Efforts should have been devoted to implementation regardless of the outcome.    
Indeed, the standard definition bears some resemblance with the definitions offered by Althaus, 
et al., (2007) and Richards and Smith (2002); both state that policies are made by governments, 
who may wish not to obtain evidence from non-state actors.   
In contrast, the alternative definition stipulates that policy is arrived at through interactions 
among different players within the policy environment and involves cooperation and 
compromise (Maddison and Denniss, 2009). This view, according to Richard and Smith (2002, 
p.2):   
“…sensitises us to the ever-increasing variety of terrains and actors involved in the making of 
public policy. Thus, it demands that we consider all the actors and locations beyond the ‘core 
executive’ involved in the policy-making process.” 
Richard and Smiths’ reminder is timely. The literature of governance is replete with debates 
about the centrality of states in governance. Whereas the dominant view is that government has 
been ‘hollowed out’, there is a growing school of thought that rejects that notion claiming that 
the hierarchical authority of governments is alive and well. Even the most ardent advocates of 
states’ hierarchical power, however, agree that governments now adopt partnership with the 
private sector to undertake public policy using what Bell and Hindmoor (2009, p.2) refer to as 
a “state -centric relational” approach to governance. The main argument of the alternative 
definition is that in the development of policies, different kinds of evidence, provided by both 
state and non-state actors, are used. Nevertheless, governments still maintain exclusive right in 
the development of policies on national defence, foreign affairs (Hogwood and Gum, 1984) 
and monetary policy (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009). This means the use of evidence varies based
<<<PAGE=27>>>
13 
 
on the type of policy in question. For instance, where a policy is statutorily the exclusive reserve 
of governments (like monetary policy) or borders on national security or the sovereignty of the 
governments, the use of evidence may be restricted to those provided by the state actors who 
have specialist knowledge and experience. However, where a policy is meant to address social 
problems like education and health, the search for evidence is usually extended to a wide range 
of non-state actors.   
From a broad perspective, all the foregoing definitions of public policy focused, one way or 
another, on “what governments do, why they do it, and what difference it makes” (Dye, 2017, 
p.1). There are some theorists, nonetheless, who, in addition, consider what governments refuse 
to do as part of public policy. In this category, we have Heclo (1972, p.85) who suggests that 
a policy should “be considered as a course of action or inaction rather than specific decisions 
or actions.” Thus, public policy is “what government, acting on our behalf, chooses to do or 
not to do” (Birkland, 2016, p.242).  
Explaining the inaction dimension, Hill (2013) states that often there is an incentive for political 
leadership to maintain the existing sit uation, thereby making inaction a preferred course of 
action. Inaction is therefore an “implicit” policy since it involves the refusal of governments to 
recognize a problem in contrast to an “explicit” policy where governments make decisions or 
undertake actions (Birkland, 2016, p.10). Inaction may also arise when governments decide 
not to use their resources to address identified problems, believing that either the problem 
would run its course or non-state actors may eventually address them. The inaction perspective 
therefore suggests that public policy should be viewed from a broad standpoint, including both 
actions and inactions of governments.  
According to Maddison and Denniss (2009, p.4), the numerous definitions of public policy can 
generally be group ed into two complementary viewpoints; firstly, policy arises from an 
“authoritative choice” – government making policy based on its hierarchical powers; and 
secondly, policy results from “structured interaction” – whereby different participants come 
together to make policy through cooperation and concession. Colebatch (2009, p.120) adds 
another dimension, “social construction”, to the two strands identified by Maddison and 
Denniss to form what he referred to as the “three accounts of the policy process.” He explained 
that the social construction strand deals with the development and framing of a convincing 
narrative to support the development or change of an existing policy.
<<<PAGE=28>>>
14 
 
Whereas the “authoritative choice” views policymaking from a top -bottom perspective, the 
“structured interaction” and “social construction” viewpoints see policymaking as an intricate 
phenomenon involving interactions among different actors within the policy environment. 
Based on its hierarchical nature, the “authoritative choice” viewpoi nt generally advocates the 
use of evidence sourced by the government often without contributions from non -state actors. 
Yet, policymaking from this perspective may sometimes be characterized with some degree of 
incoherence because, even within a government , there may be interplays among different 
actors, who may have different views and pursue different interests (Sabatier, 1999; Weible, 
2017). Owing to their society -centred paradigm, the “structured interaction” and “social 
construction” viewpoints, provid e policy location for disparate perceptions, knowledge and 
interests leading to multiple inputs and a significant degree of incoherence (Maddison and 
Denniss, 2009).  
So, in effect, my use of the word “government” in this discourse, and the entire study, is not in 
reference to a monolithic unit but rather a complex system of individuals and institutions, often 
with different perspectives. The assumption that government is a unified system is false as 
different actors within government or within a government agency are involved in “pulling and 
hauling” to reflect their standpoints and interests (Colebatch, 1997, p.11). This development 
mirrors the argument that “conflicts may take an organizational form…higher officials vs. 
lower officials, departments vs. de partments, ministers vs. ministers, and so on.” (Minogue, 
1997, p.15). 
Generally, policy actors, whether within or outside governments interact both formally and 
informally, generating conflicts in the process as each actor attempts to promote their policy  
preferences (Howlett et al., 2009; Maddison and Denniss 2009; Sabatier 1999). The ensuing 
policy debate provides a platform for contestation of ideas and values which are harmonized 
one way or another. Thus, notwithstanding the viewpoint in operation, the  policy making 
process is predominated by “diversity and constraint” and what is ultimately produced is a 
“bargained outcome.” (Gordon et al., 1997, p.7).   
To sum up, while there are significant similarities in the different definitions of public policy, 
there are considerable areas of differences. One view is that in the development of public 
policy, governments decide what is to be done and how to do it using its hierarchical power 
and resources. The other view, however, suggests that public policy is a result of participation 
of various stakeholders including the private sector. In terms of the use of evidence, while the
<<<PAGE=29>>>
15 
 
first view involves the use of limited kinds of evidence from the governments, the second view 
deals with evidence from multiple sources.  
Considering that the policy domain is not value -neutral, coupled with the need to allow 
participants some room for manoeuvre to articulate their inputs, it is not possible to arrive at a 
generally acceptable definition for the term. What is important is the recognition of nuances of 
public policy, including the tension created by disparate stakeholder interests, to assist in 
improving policy formulation and implementation. Consequently, I would provide the next 
stream of literature, the typologies of public policy, to deepen theoretical understanding. 
2.2. TYPOLOGIES OF PUBLIC POLICY 
Policies are organized into different classes to enable policy makers predict stakeholder 
interests and influence, potential conflicts in policy making and how to address them (Birkland, 
2016; Parsons, 1995). Contemporary policy classification began with Theodore Lowi’s policy 
typology in 1964 (Birkland, 2016; Parsons, 1995). 
In his seminal work, Lowi (1964) classified policy into three broad categories as follows:  
• Distributive policy, dealing with allocation of resources across particular interest 
groups or identified demographics. For example, policies on land, subsidies and road 
construction are distributive in nature.   
• Regulative policy, focusing on the control of individuals and businesses to influence 
their behaviours. This includes standardization policy, consumer protection policy and 
competition policy.   
• Redistributive policy, concerned with changing the pattern of prevailing resource 
allocation. Examples are policies on income tax, social security, and grants.  
A fourth category was later introduced by Lowi in 1972 which he labeled “Constituent” policy, 
dealing with the creation or reorganization of government agencies. The abolishment of the 
Financial Services Authority (UK) and the splitting of its responsibilities between two agencies 
- the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority - is a classic 
example of a constituent policy.  
A central argument of the Lowi classification is t hat “policies determine politics” and not the 
other way round (Lowi, 1972, p.299) meaning the kind of policy being contemplated gives rise
<<<PAGE=30>>>
16 
 
to the resulting political relationships, conflicts, and choices. Thus, it is policy type that, for 
instance, determines whether government applies its coercive authority or not (Simon, 2007). 
Thus, it is the policy type that determines the kind of evidence to be sought and utilised. For 
instance, while distributive and redistributive policies, on account of their impact on the whole 
society, may require obtaining evidence from a wider range of sources, regulative policies tend 
to do the opposite: obtaining evidence from limited sources. This is because as regards 
regulative policies, governments often apply their coerciv e authority (Simon, 2007). 
Consequently, policymakers tend to obtain and utilise soft evidence for distributive and 
redistributive policies while hard evidence types are more suitable for regulative policies. 
Lowi’s pioneering typology has been acclaimed a s revolutionary. “No single theoretical 
construct has been more important to the development of public policy studies than Lowi’s 
categorization scheme” (Greenberg, et al., 1977, p.1534). Reinforcing the impact of Lowi’s 
scheme, Sabatier (1991, p.149) affirms that “of all the work in public policy over the last two 
decades, Lowi’s (1964, 1972) argument that political behaviour varies across policy types - 
distributive, redistributive, regulatory - has probably had the greatest effect on the discipline of 
political science.”  
However, Lowi’s typology has come under attack (Heclo, 1972; May, 1986; Steinberger, 
1980). His central argument has been criticized as “over -simplistic and methodologically 
suspect” (Parsons, 1995, p.132). In addition, the classificatio n of policies into categories has 
been questioned on the grounds that some policies have overlapping attributes (Birkland, 2016; 
Steinberger, 1980). Moreover, by Lowi’s admission, in the long run, every policy possesses 
redistributive and regulatory attrib utes. This is easy to see as at the core of every policy, no 
matter how named, is an intention to alter existing resource allocation or to control behaviour. 
Flowing from such premise, the claim by Lowi (1964, pp.689 -90) that each policy develops 
“its own characteristic political structure…and group relations” suddenly makes his typology, 
to borrow the words of Heclo (1972, p.105), “very difficult to operationalize and use.” 
Similarly, the testability of the typologies has been criticized (Parsons, 1995) su ggesting that 
the different policy types contemplated by Lowi were not empirically derived but subjectively 
constructed.  
In addressing the limitations identified in Lowi’s typology, Wilson (1995) established a 
typology that takes into account the extent t o which costs and benefits of a particular policy
<<<PAGE=31>>>
17 
 
affect either one interest group or many interest groups. To clarify, where an issue promises 
benefit to a particular interest group, the interest group would push for the formulation of an 
appropriate policy, but there is a likelihood of conflict where the cost of that policy is to be 
borne by a different interest group. This explains why redistributive policies are highly 
contentious because a gain by one group is associated with a loss by another (Birklan d, 2016; 
Howlett et al., 2009).  
On his part, Steinberger (1980) developed an alternative scheme using a phenomenological 
approach. Considering the complex nature of public policy, Steinberger argued that the policy 
types contemplated by Lowi are subjectiv ely derived by groups based on their understanding 
of the objective and potential impact of such policy, which may be totally different from the 
understanding, hence definition of another group. In this regard, he concludes that the typology 
advanced by Lowi should not be considered as an “objective” policy characterization but as a 
“plausible” policy guide (1980, p.189). The merit is to afford participants the freedom to define 
policy types based on their socially constructed worldviews. 
Meanwhile, Anderson (2003) outlines a broad categorization of policies adopted by scholars 
with relevant examples as follows: 
• Substantive and Procedural policies. Substantive policies, he explained, deal with 
what government is required to do for good governance which confers advantages or 
disadvantages on the citizens, like building roads, paying subsidies, or prohibiting 
smoking in designated areas. Procedural policies on the other hand, focus on how 
substantive policies are going to be enforced and who is responsible to a ct. An 
example of an important procedural policy, according to Anderson is the US federal 
Administrative Procedure Act of 1964 which stipulated the procedures to be used by 
agencies in informal rulemaking.    
• Distributive, Regulatory, Self -regulatory and R edistributive policies. These are 
explained earlier except for self -regulatory policies which are described as policies 
formulated by groups to protect the interest of the group, for example a code of 
conduct by a peak body to regulate the behaviour of its members.  
• Material and Symbolic policies. Material policies provide either tangible benefits to 
the citizens or impose obvious disadvantages on citizens that are adversely affected. 
Examples are minimum wage policies or policies to augment farmers’ income .
<<<PAGE=32>>>
18 
 
Symbolic policies, in contrast, do not provide any material advantage or disadvantage 
to the citizens but rather appeal to their sense of values. All anti -drug campaigns fall 
under the symbolic policies category. 
• Collective Goods and Private Goods policies. Collective goods policies are concerned 
with the provision of goods beneficial to the society and the consumption of such good 
by an individual would not preclude it to others. Examples include policies on national 
defence, public safety, and clean air . Private goods policies on the other hand, are 
policies formulated to deal with goods provided in the marketplace by the private 
sector and as such only individuals that purchase them benefit. Examples include 
policies on the provision of social services by the government like postal services, 
entrance into parks and museums, which have some attributes of private goods.    
A key message of policy typologies is that they play an important role in the determination of 
the use of evidence in policymaking. Whi le governments exclusively source for evidence 
themselves in the development of some policies, they allow non -state actors to contribute 
inputs in the development of others. Notwithstanding, policymakers are advised to be flexible 
in view of the changing or overlapping nature of most policy types. As eloquently averred by 
Birkland (2016, p.265), each typology should be understood as “a continuum and not as 
separate absolute.”  
2.3. PROSPECTS OF PUBLIC POLICY 
Citizens believe the function of governments is e ssentially to identify and solve problems 
through policies (Colebatch, 1997) but the story of public policies is a mixture of success and 
failure. Unlike the phenomenon of policy failure, policy success has received little interest in 
the public policy lit erature (Birkland, 2011; Howlett et al., 2009; McConnell, 2015). And to 
confound the issue, the determination of which policy is successful, and which is not is 
inherently subjective (Howlett et al., 2009; McConnell, 2015). Nevertheless, there are some 
documented examples of policy success. 
To illustrate, the free basic education policy in the UK has generally been considered 
successful. Prior to the mid-1970s, the UK education policy is regarded as ‘a good thing’ and 
it can be argued that the reforms during the Thatcher regime were genuine attempts to improve 
the sector (McVicar, 1990, p.131). Indeed, state education in the UK since after the Second 
World War has been successful (Chitty, 2005).
<<<PAGE=33>>>
19 
 
The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is another exampl e of what is adjudged as a 
policy success. The NHS regarded as the flagship of the health policy (Dorey, 2005) has largely 
lived to its founding philosophy of efficient service delivery and cost containment (Kendall 
and Moon, 1990). And although there stil l exists recurring challenges including funding the 
programme, the policy has received “public admiration and electoral support” (Jones, 2005, 
p.92). Overall, the policy has made UK citizens healthier with an improved life expectancy 
(Jones, 2005). 
In Nigeria, since after the banking crisis in 2009, the government has succeeded in ensuring 
that no bank is allowed to fail (Sanusi, 2009). To achieve this, the Nigerian government, 
through the Central Bank of Nigeria, provides financial support to bailout banks  experiencing 
illiquidity or insolvency and replaces the leadership of such banks to engender public 
confidence in the system (Sanusi, 2010). So, what are the drivers of policy success? 
Firstly, the use of evidence in public policy has been recognized to enrich policymaking (Head, 
2010; Kay, 2011; Maddison, 2012). Although what is recognised as evidence is contentious 
(Dobrow et al., 2004; Head, 2008; Kay, 2011), it is inconceivable that policies would be 
developed without the use of the best evidence policymakers could obtain. (Marston and Watts 
2003). The use of evidence is, therefore, critical to effective public policy.  
Secondly, political commitment and partisan consensus also significantly contribute to policy 
success (Dorey, 2005). Whereas political commitment mobilises the resources required for the 
success of a policy, partisan consensus reduces inter-party wrangling around a policy area and 
as such improves the chances of achieving set policy objectives. In the UK, both the 
Conservative and Labour parties have long agreed that the state should play a key role in the 
provision of education and health (Savage and Robins 1990).  
Thirdly, the level of consensus among the policy actors is an important determinant of policy 
success. Across many policy areas in the UK, major interest groups play key roles “either on a 
consultative or participatory basis” (Savage and Robins, 1990, p.1). For instance, in the UK 
education policy domain, a policy community comprising Ministry of Education, National 
Union of Teachers, LEAs and the Association of Education Committees are discernible akin 
to what you have in the health policy community where British Medical Association (BMA) 
and the Department of Health working very closely (Dorey, 2005). Thus, the extent of 
democratization of the policy process (Hendriks, 2015; Howlett et al., 2009) improves trust
<<<PAGE=34>>>
20 
 
(Lane, 1997), the capacity of governments to solve problems (Hendriks, 2015) and as such 
improves public policy (Dorey, 2005). 
Lastly, policy learning provides policy actors a platform to learn and improve. A high level of 
learning culture within a particular policy domain, therefore, promotes policy development 
skills with a potential for effective policies. Given the chaotic nature of the policy process, the 
need for policy learning is most crucial in of implementation (Birkland, 2011), evaluation and 
generally improves the chances for policy success (Howlett et al., 2009; Marier, 2015). 
Specifically, the policy environment serves as a laboratory from which policy makers could 
learn lessons from successful policies to improve the effectiveness of their policies (Volden, 
2006). Within the context of the use of evidence in policymaking, the more receptive of 
learning a policy environment is, the more likely is the use of mul tiple kinds of evidence, and 
vice versa if the opposite is the case.    
2.4. CONSTRAINTS TO PUBLIC POLICY 
In contrast to the scant attention to policy success in scholarly literature, policy failure is the 
holy grail. This is probably because policy scientist, like journalists, love bad news (Birkland, 
2011). Consequently, the story of public policy we hear is often “a story about constraints” 
(Goodin et al., 2006, p.24). In this regard, Dye (2017) identifies eight limits of public policy as 
follows: 
1. Problems that are defined in relative instead of absolute terms may not be solved by 
public policy. As an example, he stated that if poverty line is benchmarked against, say, 
one-fifth of a population then the problem will perpetually exist. This kind of problem 
definition normalizes an unwanted end and as such makes it impossible to address 
(Rein, 2006). 
  
2. Public expectation is often higher than government capability and as such there would 
always be unmet expectations. Public policy makers continuously fa ce complex, at 
times, intractable challenges (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Considine, 2005), yet 
institutional capacities are often organized to “produce standard responses to non -
standard problems” (Bovens et al., 1998, p.206).
<<<PAGE=35>>>
21 
 
3. Policies are often a zero-sum game i.e. by solving problems of one group, they may 
create problems for another group. A classic example is redistributive policies which 
take resources from one group and give to another group. Often, governments deal with 
mutually exclusive interests from various groups and as such impossible to satisfy every 
interest group (Bovens et al., 1998; Howlett et al., 2009). 
  
4. In some instances, governments may be incapable of engendering social change no 
matter their efforts. For example, Dye reasoned  that governments may not be able to 
address settlement patterns of whites and blacks regardless of policies to engender 
integration. In this case, the government may only embark on a symbolic policy to give 
the impression of doing something (Parsons, 1995). 
  
5. People rationally adopt adaptive behaviours in response to some public policies in a 
manner that compromises the efficacy of public policy. For example, paying welfare 
support to people may create a dependency mentality thereby frustrating the policy 
(Sefton, 2006). A significant constraint of policy is the unwillingness of people to do 
what the policy encourages them to do. 
  
6. Some problems may have several causes and a particular policy may be ineffective to 
address them. Most of what is described in the literature as ‘wicked problems’ belongs 
to this category. They are called wicked problems because they are deeply entrenched 
on the social fabrics of the society with multiple underlying causes, and a lack of 
consensus on how to solve them. It is diffi cult to solve problems which do not have 
specificity of definition, with many causes and whose solution cannot be reasonably 
quantified (Nair, 2018).  
  
7. The cost of solving some problems may be costlier than the problem. As an example, 
Dye suggested that the cost of eradicating a public disorder may involve both financial 
resources and repressive policies which a democratic government may consider too 
high a cost. In this case, governments may likely either refuse to act or engage in 
symbolic public policy to appease the citizens.  
  
8. The political system is not value -neutral and as such is incapable of rational public 
policy. The most significant constraint to public policy is the “sheer selfishness of
<<<PAGE=36>>>
22 
 
entrenched interests” to promote particular viewpoints ( Goodin et al., 2006, p.23). 
Thus, the sum effect of the often -divergent interests may produce ineffective policies 
or policies that may only satisfy sectional interest at the expense of other interests.  
Meanwhile, Hogwood and Gunn (1984, p.197) identify t hree broad reasons why policies fail: 
“bad execution, bad policy, or bad luck.” Likewise, Bovens and ‘t Hart (1996) remind us that 
the reason for policy failure could be either programme-related or political. Programme-related 
failure, they say, occurs bec ause of technocratic, informational or strategic deficits in 
implementation. Political failure, on the other hand, is caused by the inability of a policy to 
engender the required political support for its sustenance.  
Quite instructively, the causes of policy failure discussed above permeate the whole spectrum 
of governments at all levels thereby engendering a precautionary approach to the virtues of 
public policy.  
2.5. POLICY THEORIES AND MODELS  
2.5.1. The Stages Approach 
The stages approach to policymaking, referred to as a theory by some, and a model by others, 
consists of sequential stages that delineate the policy process into distinct phases (Howlett et 
al., 2009; Knill and Tosun 2012; Weible, 2017). The importance and use of evidence within 
the different stages vary based on the nature of the stages.  
In his path-breaking treatise, Lasswell (1956), decomposed policy -making process into seven 
distinct stages (Knill and Tosun 2012). Lasswell’s seven stage approach comprised: 
intelligence, promotion, prescription, invocation, application, termination, and appraisal.  
The policy stages serve as a heuristic tool that simplifies an otherwise complex process (Hill, 
2013). Since, the policy-making process is complex and chaotic, the degree of order provided 
by the stages model engender comprehension of the polic y process (John, 2013). The model 
also provides a structure within which much policy research could be situated (Howlett et al., 
2016).  
Although it is considered by many as the best in illuminating the policy process, it is largely 
an inadequate framework  as it lacks causal relationships within the different policymaking
<<<PAGE=37>>>
23 
 
stages (Gultekin, 2014). It fails to explain complex interactions among policy actors and within 
the different policy phases, affecting its ability to adequately explain the policy process . It is 
also accused of practical incompatibility as only a few policies align with its sequential 
prescription in real life (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; John, 2012). In other words, it erroneously 
views all policies from the same standpoint and sequential log ic. It is also considered 
misleading as it disregards the political tension within the policy -making process (Anderson 
2015; Howlett et al., 2009; Knill and Tosun, 2012; Smith and May, 1997). 
Overall, despite its weaknesses, the stage model is one of the most popular models in explaining 
the policy process. As a heuristic device , the model provides a very practical and 
insightful/compelling account that simplifies a complex and abstract process.  
Since the emergence of policy process as a field of political science in the 1950s (Howllett and 
Geist, 2015; Weible, 2017), the policy stages, has become enduring (Deleon, 1999; Knill and 
Tosun, 2012;). Consequently, Lasswell’s model has inspired a number of other rational models 
including Brewer (1974), Bridgman and Davis (2000), Anderson (1983), Simmons et al. 
(1974), and Hogwood and Gunn (1984). Yet, the five -stage model has been embraced by a 
number of scholars including Howlett (2011), Howlett ,et al., (2009), Anderson (2015), and 
Hill and Hupe (2014). The model consists of five stages: 
1. Agenda-Setting 
2. Policy formulation 
3. Decision-making 
4. Policy Implementation 
5. Policy Evaluation 
The depiction of the policy process within a five-stage model has become popular and widely 
adopted (Howlett 2011; Howlett and Geist. 2015). The policy-making stages above reflect the 
key milestones a successful issue goes through in its life. An important stage that is omitted 
from the five-stage model is the Policy Maintenance,  Succession, and Termination (Cairney, 
2019).  
In what follows, I will discuss the five policy stages model, plus the maintenance, succession, 
and termination stage.
<<<PAGE=38>>>
24 
 
2.5.2. Agenda Setting 
Agenda setting is a very crucial theme in public policy as at one ti me or another, one would 
have wondered how issues become worthy of government attention leading to efforts at 
addressing them. Corollary to this is the question of why some problems get government 
attention while others do not (Anderson, 2015; Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Majone, 2008; Knill 
and Tosun, 2012).  
The first stage in the policy making process is agenda setting which deals with the identification 
of problems by policy actors (Anderson, 2015). Put differently, it involves how problems 
attract or fail t o attract the interest of governments (Birkland, 2011). The mere attraction of 
government to a problem does not, however, guarantee that a problem will be solved; it only 
means it has gained entrance into the agenda for consideration among many other probl ems 
(Howlett et al., 2009).  
The classic model of agenda setting in a democracy is through discussion which starts with 
expression of worries by policy actors (Majone, 2008). Early literature in agenda setting 
assume that objectivity shapes the problem ide ntification exercise in agenda setting, but later 
works acknowledge that problems are socially constructed (Howlett et al., 2009). Often, 
agendas are set through “systematic distortion, misrepresentation, or selective presentation of 
information” (Zahariadis 2003, p.18). This development blurs the line “between manipulating 
and shaping the agenda” Majone, (2008, p.230).   
Kingdon (1984, 2014) developed a framework to examine agenda setting in the real world. He 
theorized that three streams – problem, policy, and politics – interact to produce the “greatest 
agenda change” (Kingdon 2014, p.87). The problem stream describes the identification of 
undesirable situations requiring government attention. The policy stream refers to the experts 
that examine the nature of problems and recommend solutions. The political stream deals with 
realities in the political environment that facilitate or engender the need for a policy such as 
pressure from an influential interest group. This means that the presence of evidence an d the 
use of such evidence for policymaking is more prevalent in the policy stage of Kingdon’s 
framework where policymakers generate feasible solutions to address identified policy 
problems.
<<<PAGE=39>>>
25 
 
He contends that an issue finds its way on the agenda where the  streams intersect or where 
policy entrepreneurs assembled the three streams. Crucially, policy window – ‘the 
opportunities for action’ opens rarely and for a short time; policy entrepreneurs must, therefore, 
recognize when a window opens and couple the st reams together else, they must wait for 
another opening (Kingdon, 2014, p.166).  
Kingdon’s work has attracted significant plaudits. It has been described as a ‘path -breaking’ 
framework (Howlett et al., 2009, p.92) ‘that has captivated many political scientists’ (Anderson 
2015, 98). It has, nevertheless, been criticized for situating agenda -setting entirely on “timing 
and luck” which ignores the salient element of predictability and order (Anderson, 2105, p.99).  
On their part, Hogwood and Gunn (1984), state  that an issue gets on the agenda if it satisfies 
one or more of the following conditions: one, the issue has attained a crisis level and as such 
cannot be ignored. A good example is the bailout the US government offered troubled private 
institutions including banks which demonstrates how a crisis can make government undertake 
what is hitherto considered unacceptable (Birkland, 2011); two, the issue has achieved 
distinctiveness in exemplifying larger governance issues. This could take a peculiar form like 
street protests by antiabortionists, gays, and lesbians (Anderson 2015); three, the issue has a 
‘human interest angle’ and thus attracts the attention of the media; four, the issue is considered 
to likely impact on a wide audience. As an example, the French  government, in 1998, halted 
the administration of hepatitis B vaccination on school children based on public outcry that the 
vaccine could lead to other diseases like multiple sclerosis (Knill and Tosun, 2012); and finally, 
the issue has become very popul ar or politically salient. Invariably, the more of the above 
conditions an issue satisfies, the more likely it is to get on the agenda.      
Similarly, Birkland (2011) presents four different levels problems pass through to merit 
government consideration. He explains that the first level, agenda universe, is the largest level, 
and consists of all items that could be discussed within a political system or in the society. 
From the agenda universe some items graduate into the systemic level, which contains items 
that the stakeholders in the policy process view as deserving the authoritative attention of 
governments. Thereafter, items that are successful move to the institutional agenda, which 
comprises items that are for the serious consideration of policy makers. Any item in this level 
guarantees government action and as such only a small percentage of the items reached the 
institutional level (Howlett et al., 2009). Finally, a select few items move to decision agenda, 
the level consisting of items that the policy makers will act upon.
<<<PAGE=40>>>
26 
 
Movement within the levels do not however occur automatically. They are deliberately enabled 
by policy actors using persuasion, advocacy, and manipulation. The policy actors use different 
kinds of evidence to advance their policy  preferences, depending on a number of factors 
including the nature of the policy and the prevailing governance arrangement. Then clearly, 
policy-makers actors occupy an influential position in the policy -making equation. But who 
are the key policy actors at this stage of the policy process? Knill and Tosun (2012) identified 
four major actors: 
1. Elected public officials and judges: Based on their position, they place issues on the 
policy agenda depending on the type of government in operation. In a presidential 
system of government, elected public officials provide a significant amount of evidence 
to influence the movement of items within the different levels, whereas in a 
parliamentary system, it is the parliamentarians, relying on their law -making powers 
that largely undertake such responsibility. In a number of countries, the judiciary 
possesses agenda -setting powers as they decide on contentious political issues or 
stimulate political debates with the possibility of policy change. 
2. Bureaucracy: In addition to its traditional role in formulation and implementation of 
policies, the bureaucracy also plays a key role in agenda setting. This is possible on 
account of the wide -ranging evidence (information and technical skills) within the 
bureaucracy which enables it to initiate a policy or frame policy options to the 
legislature, which often relies on the former for information.      
3. Mass media: The media impacts the agenda -setting process through the level of 
coverage it accords issues which instigates both interest and concern. Usually, political 
actors react to sustained media coverage to demonstrate to the electorates that they are 
working hard, hence improve their electoral value. 
4. Interest groups: Like the mass media, interest groups g enerate awareness and frame 
issues to attract the attention of governments. Interest groups employ lobbying as a key 
agenda-setting tool but their ability to influence agenda-setting depends on some factors 
including resource availability and access to bureaucrats and politicians.  
To ensure that their preferred items are on the agenda, or their perspective on an item triumph 
over that of others, these actors compete and in some few instances collaborate. Consequently, 
in what advocates of broad-based agenda setting would find depressing, Birkland (2011) states
<<<PAGE=41>>>
27 
 
that often the agenda setting battle is not won by stakeholders that make the most theoretically 
or technically convincing arguments but by groups that have more resources or better rhetoric. 
2.5.3. Policy Formulation 
Upon the recognition of a problem at the agenda -setting stage, the next stage is the 
determination of appropriate solutions to address the problem (Howlett, 2011). Owing in part 
to the unclear and unpredictable nature of the agenda setting stage, problems may still be hazy, 
inchoate, or loosely identified at that stage and as such requires further fine -tuning. Problems 
identified at the agenda -setting stage are, therefore, refined and streamlined at the policy 
formulation stage (Howlett et al., 2009). Based on the close relationship between agenda setting 
and policy formulation, they are, together, called pre -decision phase of the policy process 
(Anderson, 2015; Majone, 2008). 
Basically, policy formulation deals with the development of prop osals designed to address 
public problems (Anderson, 2015; Hill and Hupe, 2014). At this stage, various policy options 
are generated and assessed. Usually, stakeholders, including bureaucrats and private sector 
players, offer contending proposals resulting in competition against one another to ensure that 
their options are favourably ranked (Anderson, 2015; Howlett and Giest 2015). As far as the 
use of evidence is concerned, this stage is the most significant since this is the stage where 
feasible options are generated for consideration.    
Policy formulation does not, however, always end in a new or a reviewed policy as policy 
makers may decide not to take any action or may disagree on how to proceed (Anderson, 2015). 
Policy makers during the Reagan administration failed to agree on how an executive order on 
affirmative action relating to hiring by government contractors should be revised, and the 
prevailing order was maintained (Anderson, 2015). Thus, policy formulation is primarily 
concerned with a determi nation of what is to be done in the face of a problem, including a 
decision as to whether the status quo should be maintained.  
Anderson (2015) examines those involved in policy formulation at the federal level in the US 
and posits that the president, his advisers and chief aides lead in the use of evidence to initiate 
policy proposals, with the governors playing similar role at the state level. In addition to the 
office of the Executive President, Anderson (2015) enumerates other actors that participate in  
the policy formulation stage.
<<<PAGE=42>>>
28 
 
• Governmental agencies, covering civil servants and appointed officials: By virtue of 
their technical expertise and continuous working with numerous programmes and 
projects of government, these officials identify weaknesses in  existing policies and 
offer proposals to address them. Depending on the nature of the proposals, some 
proposals are concluded by the executive arm, while some have to be transmitted to 
the Congress for approval. 
• Presidential organisations: These are tempo rary bodies, sometimes called ‘ad hoc 
committees’ or ‘adhocracies’ created by the president to develop proposals on 
particular policy areas. They include presidential commissions, inter -agency 
committees, task force, and other similar arrangements.  
• Legislators: On account of their personal or ideological interests coupled with their 
legislative duties, which includes receiving suggestions and inputs from stakeholders, 
legislators formulate policy proposals. The congress has done much of the formulation 
in specific policy areas – agriculture, welfare reform, environmental protection and 
energy conservation.  
• Interest groups: Interest groups play a key role in policy formulation, often providing 
the executive or legislature with specific proposals. A well -known example is the 
Israeli lobby, which has been influential in shaping America’s financial support to 
Israel.  
Thus, the main location for policy formulation is dependent on the system of government in 
operation. Yet, owing to the range of disparate actors  and locations involved, policy 
formulation in a democracy encompasses a series of activities including stakeholder 
engagements, lobbying and other similar actions to build support around respective proposals.  
Tracing the policy formulation process in the  Lithuanian higher education domain, Thomas 
(2001) identified four phases - appraisal, dialogue, formulation and consolidation. 
1. Appraisal dealt with stakeholder seminars and meetings for the identification of critical 
policy issues. These meetings provided context and created a shared understanding of the issues 
that need government attention. They also created an opportunity for the consideration of 
stakeholder inputs and evidence. 
2. Dialogue was concerned with the facilitation of communication between stake holders with 
different viewpoints regarding the issue in question and possible solutions. Like in the appraisal
<<<PAGE=43>>>
29 
 
phase, dialogue also involved seminars where representatives of stakeholder groups or experts 
were invited to provide evidence and discuss their preferred solutions. Position papers prepared 
by select committees, discussions from previous stakeholder meetings were fed into the first 
draft policy.     
3. Formulation involved strengthening the draft policy with additional evidence and more 
awareness of political imperatives. Being a legislative policy, a draft law was developed and 
circulated to relevant stakeholders for comments. The feedback from the stakeholders was, 
however, negative, indicating disenchantment with the draft law. This led to the establishment 
of a nine -man committee, comprising public and private stakeholders, and chaired by the 
deputy minister responsible for higher education. Consequently, a revised draft law was issued 
inviting response from stakeholders.    
4. Consolidation involved another seminar to consider responses from the consultation process. 
It emerged that there were still outstanding issues which necessitated another meeting, after 
which an advisory team was established for comments on a number of provisions in the draft 
law. The team found the draft law was fit for purpose. Thereafter, a national conference was 
held which endorsed the draft law, highlighting that the policy formulation process assisted to 
involve a wide range of stakeholders in the policy process. 
In the a ssessment of proposals, policy formulators consider many factors including the 
soundness of proposals, costs, political acceptability, legality, and compliance with extant laws 
and regulations (Anderson, 2015). Perhaps, the most important consideration is the political 
and technical limitations - “substantive or procedural constraints” - on the policy makers 
(Howlett et al., 2009, p.112). The authors described substantive constraints as constraints that 
are inherent in the problem being addressed which limi ts options of policy makers. For 
instance, to reduce poverty, policy makers can not consider printing of money to distribute to 
the poor as that will cause inflation and offset the impact of the distribution. On the other hand, 
they defined procedural constraints as the processes required to carry out a policy option. They 
gave an example of procedural constraint as the constitutional right of US citizens to bear arms 
which imperils handguns control efforts.

 2.5.4. Decision Making 
Decision making involves the adoption of a particular recommendation by government upon 
analysis of proposals (Howlett and Giest 2015). It is simply concerned with choosing a solution 
to address identified problems (Hill and Hupe, 2014). 
Decisions can however be either ‘positive’,  where they are intended to impact the status quo, 
or ‘negative’, in which case governments resolve not to do anything to maintain the status quo 
(Howlett et al., 2009). 
At the stage of decision-making, the number of policy actors reduces significantly because the 
task involved is substantially that of governments (Knill and Tosun, 2013). Unlike the agenda 
setting and policy formulation stages, which permit more diverse participation, the decision -
making stage is for a select few. This is because only those  who have authority to make valid 
decisions participate (Knill and Tosun, 2013).  
Whereas Howlett, et al., (2009) argue that private actors are essentially excluded from 
participating in this stage except as lobbyist, Anderson (2015) posits that private stakeholders 
do participate in decision -making, even though the recognized authority for decision -making 
lies with four classes of public officials: executives, legislators, judges, and administrators. Bell 
and Hindmoor (2009) agree with Anderson ( 2015) that private stakeholders participate in 
decision-making, and policymaking in general even though governments still retain the 
authority to take upturn the decisions or even alter prevailing governance arrangement (Bell 
and Hindmoor, 2009).  Thus, the decision-making stage is concerned with the selection of a 
solution from the usually numerous forms of evidence and options presented at the policy 
formulation stage.  
In democracies, public decision -making authority is largely dependent on the type of 
government in practice. In most countries, the authority is concentrated on the legislature, on 
account of their designation as the representatives of the people (Anderson, 2015). The 
executive and to some degree, the judiciary however play far more dominant  role in the 
decision-making of other countries (Howlett et al., 2009). 
Knill and Tosun (2012) provide an illustration of public decision -making in the four main 
English-speaking countries: UK, Canada, Australia, and the US.
<<<PAGE=45>>>
31 
 
The UK practices a parliament ary democracy and as such the responsibility for public 
policymaking resides with the prime minister and Cabinet members (drawn from the members 
of the parliament), supported by bureaucrats who provide guidance on policy decisions. The 
UK parliament has two Houses: The House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, which 
“fulfils the ‘classical’ parliamentary tasks” of law -making (Knill and Tosun 2012, p.139). 
Although the House of Common proposes new laws, only few bills of private members get to 
become legislation. This is attributable to the strong party cohesion in the House of Commons 
which makes members of parliament to vote with their party even when they disagree with the 
position of their party leadership. The prime minister, as the leader of the ruling party, 
therefore, greatly influences public decision -making, restricting the parliament to a marginal 
role in decision -making. More importantly, the government (when it has a majority in 
parliament) frames and controls the policy agenda. 
Like its UK counterpart, in Australia, the prime minister and cabinet members are drawn from 
the same source which causes the executive to dominate the workings of the parliament. But 
unlike in the UK, public decision -making is done at three major locations, namely: the 
parliament, which makes laws; the state and federal governments, having powers to make 
policies on specific issues; and the judiciary, which undertakes judicial review to appraise the 
actions or policies of the executive or legislature. 
Canada practice s a Westminster system alongside federalism. The prime minister forms a 
Cabinet, comprising ministers, which makes public decisions, for which the whole cabinet 
bears collective responsibility. Like the UK, the Canadian parliament consists of the elected 
members of the House of Commons while the governor general (representing the Canadian 
monarch) appoints members of the senate. Although the senate has a veto power, it hardly 
rejects bills passed by the House of Commons due to its democratic deficit. 
The US  operates a federal structure which consists of the executive, the judiciary, and the 
legislature (congress and senate). Legislative decision making is remarkably influenced by 
federal character of the US and the relationship between the president and the Congress. It 
should be noted that many of the decisions of the president require the approval of both the 
senate and the congress. Also worthy of note is that the cabinet, which assists the president in 
decision making, is an informal body. Thus, the polic y preferences of the president and the 
partisan composition of the two Houses are critical in decision making. In this regard, interest 
groups lobby the congress and not the president or his cabinet.
<<<PAGE=46>>>
32 
 
Generally, the parliamentary system of government concentrates decision-making power in the 
hands of the executive and the existing bureaucracy, while in the presidential system, the power 
is extended to the legislature and judiciary (Howlett et al., 2009). Thus, in Australia, Canada, 
the UK and other parliam entary democracies, the executive and bureaucracy are usually 
responsible for making decisions on public policies. Whereas in the US, and a host of other 
presidential systems, the cabinet and bureaucracy are often responsible for policy decision -
making even though some decisions require legislative approval (Knill and Tosun 2012). 
In all, collective decision-making can take three forms (Anderson, 2015). They are:  
• Bargaining: This relies on discussion, negotiation and compromise to achieve a 
generally acceptable decision. 
• Persuasion: This involves the use of arguments and logic to build support for a preferred 
course of action. 
• Command: This deals with the deployment of hierarchical authority to make decisions 
and may involve the use of sanctions and penalties.   
An important point to note is that in democracies, even though the authority and procedure for 
public decision -making is provided by law, regulations or convention, most decisions are 
negotiated. This applies to even situations where a  party dominates, because there may exist 
factions within the party that need to be pacified for consensus building (Anderson, 2015). 
Notwithstanding the kind of government in place, it is worth mentioning that there has been a 
shift in the governance land scape and decisions are generally made  by policy communities 
comprising the government, and the private sector (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Pierre and 
Peters, 2000; Rhodes 1994; Stoker 1998). 
 2.5.5. Policy Implementation 
The fourth stage of the policy process is implementation, where governments administer their 
chosen decisions. It is concerned with the application of the selected solution to achieve 
specified outcomes (Hill and Hupe, 2014; Knill and Tosun). Specifically, it attempts to 
reinforce or alter the distribution of resources in a way that is consistent with the expectations 
of policymakers (Howlett and Giest 2015). 
To a casual observer, implementation is a lot easier than the other stages because, as the 
thinking goes, the hard work has been done and implementation is just to administer what has
<<<PAGE=47>>>
33 
 
been agreed. This, of course, is naïve and misleading. Policy implementation is one of the most 
difficult and problematic stages in the policy cycle (Birkland, 2015; Knill and Tosun, 2012). 
Unsurprisingly, implementation also has the distinction of being the most impactful stage of 
the policy process because it is the essence of policymaking. As Madisson and Denniss, (2009) 
rightly noted, a policy is nothing unless it is implemented. 
As a result, governments commit significant resources - funding, personnel, rules, procedures 
and crucially, a combination of policy tools – for the implementation of policies. Policy tools, 
also referred to as governing instruments or policy instruments, are devices or mechanisms 
used by governments to implement policies (Howlett, et al., 2009).  
There exists a rich list of policy instruments in the policy implementation literature and scholars 
have attempted to group them for clarity and analysis. Consequently, Howlett (2011) provided 
the following classification of policy instruments: 
• Organizational Implementation Tools: These are concerned with the use of public 
institutions and personnel to implement policies. This involves the creation or 
reorganization of government department s or agencies and their processes as well as 
the use of employees of governments in policy implementation.   
• Authoritative Implementation Tools: They involve the use of coercive power of 
governments to control behaviours. Laws (including law enforcement ag encies) and 
regulations are the major sub-instruments used in this category.  
• Financial Implementation Tools: These techniques are used by governments to transfer 
financial resources or treasures to or from other players to either encourage or 
discourage them from acting in a particular way. Examples include grants, subsidies, 
excise taxes, provision of seed money, etc.  
• Information-based Implementation Tools: These are efforts of government to use 
knowledge and information to influence the behaviour of con sumers and service 
providers in line with governments’ aspirations. They include the use of the mass 
media, statistical agencies, judicial inquiries, and moral suasion.  
In most jurisdictions, policy implementation is formally undertaken by different level s of 
bureaucracy (Anderson, 2015; Knill and Tosun, 2012). In other words, policies are usually 
implemented in ministries and departments within government with the “salaried civil 
servants” being the most significant actors (Howlett et al., 2009, p.161). O ften, the civil
<<<PAGE=48>>>
34 
 
servants are statutorily responsible for policy implementation and the day -to-day 
administration of service delivery. The civil service represents the administrative laboratory 
for the conversion of precepts into service.   
Sometimes, autonomous agencies are created outside the mainstream bureaucracy to carry out 
specialised policies. In 1970, the US, established the Environmental Protection Agency to 
implement environmental policy (Knill and Tosun, 2012). Other countries like the UK and 
Nigeria had since followed suit. At other times, the courts function as policy implementers. A 
key example of the court’s policy implementation function is in bankruptcy and naturalization 
proceedings (Anderson, 2015).  
Policies may also be implemented by mul tiple entities within a government. For instance, 
policies on drugs usually require collaboration of different ministries owing to its cross-cutting 
nature, which involves such fields as finance, education, trade, and criminal justice (Knill and 
Tosun).  
The multiplicity of policy implementation sites and personnel demonstrates that unlike the 
shrinking of participants during the decision -making stage, the implementation stage often 
witnesses an expansion of policy actors (Howlett et al., 2009). But like i n the other stages of 
the policy process, different actors within the implementation stage may have different 
preferences concerning how the policies are to be implemented which may cause conflicts and 
tension along the implementation chain as individuals within an organization or agencies may 
operate at cross-purposes. (Knill and Tosun, 2012). Where the preferred options of actors in 
the policy implementation stage were not selected during the formulation stage, they may see 
the implementation stage as an opportunity to settle score thereby frustrating the 
implementation process. In the same vein, influential groups affected by policies can support 
or oppose the implementation of those policies (Howlett, Ramesh and Perl, 2009).      
The policy implementatio n literature indicates that there are various ways of implementing 
policies. Scholars have, however, made efforts to identify and classify them based on certain 
salient characteristics. On this note, Knill and Tosun (2012), Birkland (2011) clarify on three  
approaches to policy implementation:  
• Top-down approach which deals with the extent of compliance between policy 
objectives and actual outputs.
<<<PAGE=49>>>
35 
 
• Bottom-up approach, where the effectiveness of a policy is no longer based on set 
objectives but based on the preferences of policy actors.  
• The hybrid approach, seeking to blend advantages of the top -down and bottom -up 
approaches for improved effectiveness.  
Although the literature generally views the policy stages approach as a sequential process with 
distinct s tages, some scholars, including Colebatch (1997), and Hill and Hupe (2014) have 
separately called for caution in delineating decision making and implementation. Colebatch 
states that it is wrong to see the two as distinctively sequential activities because  
implementation is not a stage that comes at some point in the cycle but rather as “an awareness 
which pervades every part of” the stages (1997, p.134).  
In their analysis, Hill and Hupe (2014) argue that empirical observation on policy 
implementation does not support the normative description of the stages policy approach as a 
set of activities including implementation. They reason that in practice, policy is treated as a 
final output while implementation is seen as a different activity employed to adminis ter the 
output.  
While the two arguments proffered by the scholars go against the grain of dominant thought 
about the stages policy approach, they, nevertheless, have merit. The first assists policymakers 
to constantly keep their eyes on the impact -value o f policymaking whereas the second 
reinforces the importance of implementation in the policy process.  
2.5.6. Policy Evaluation 
Once a policy has been implemented, the next activity is to determine whether it achieves its 
goal. Policy evaluation is the stage in the policy process in which the impact of public policies 
is examined to ascertain their effectiveness (Howlett and Giest, 2015; Knill and Tosun, 2012). 
In a nutshell, it is about ‘monitoring results’ (Hill and Hupe, 2014, p.119). 
Policy evaluation ca n be carried out by both state and non -state actors (Howlett and Giest, 
2015). Traditionally, the responsibility for policy evaluation rests with governments (Howlett, 
et al., 2009) but non-state actors - the media, university scholars, private research institutions, 
and the public - are now undertaking most of the policy evaluation (Anderson, 2015) thereby 
increasing the number of participants.
<<<PAGE=50>>>
36 
 
However, although policy evaluation is primarily intended to assess the effectiveness of 
policies and to usher in learning, evaluation is sometimes employed to achieve other ends. This 
may include to strengthen a particular ideology (Bovens and T’Hart, 1996), improve or tarnish 
the image of governments (Knill and Tosun, 2012), or in response to political pressure (K nill 
and Tosun, 2012). Then, clearly, like the other stages, policy evaluation is a political activity 
although with a technical element (Howlett et al., 2009).  
Like the broader policy process, evaluation is viewed from two diametrically opposed points 
of view (Knill and Tosun, 2012). The positivists view it as a systematic and neutral exercise to 
ascertain the effectiveness of policies (Howlett et al., 2009; Knill and Tosun, 2012). The post-
positivists, also called social constructivists, argue that evaluation is entirely subjective (Knill 
and Tosun, 2012). This age -long debate  is analogous to that between positivism and 
interpretivism in social research; the former prescribing technical and quantitative methods to 
solve problems, and the latter favouring humanistic, practical, and qualitative methods. But as 
I have demonstrated earlier, the debate is purely an academic one and instead of mounting any 
academic high ground, what is important is to be aware of the two approaches and to learn 
from each one. 
Meanwhile, Howlett et al., (2009) identified 3 broad types of policy evaluation: 
a. Administrative evaluation: This is usually undertaken by governments, specialized 
agencies of government or consultants appointed by the governments to determine 
efficiency of s ervice delivery. Specifically, the main objective of the evaluation is to 
reach a judgment as to whether “value for money” has been achieved. 
b.  Judicial evaluation: This deals with the legality of how policies are formulated and 
implemented. It also deals with whether procedures or standards of operations are being 
complied with. It is carried out by the judiciary either on its own volition or based on a 
complaint against a particular policy. 
c. Political evaluation: This is undertaken by individuals or groups interested in 
governance and politics. Consequently, in contrast to the two other evaluations, 
political evaluations are neither scientific nor systematic. Owing to their political 
nature, they are often elastic and biased.  
In addition, Knill and Tosun (2 012) identified a fourth type of policy evaluation – scientific 
evaluation – conducted by neutral experts to determine the effectiveness of a public policy.
<<<PAGE=51>>>
37 
 
Based on its focus, scientific evaluation requires resources including time, research skills and 
subject expertise. In this category is university scholars who conduct policy research, mostly 
to make contributions to policy knowledge (Anderson, 2015).  
A further classification, developed by Scriven (1967), was provided by Knill and Tosun (2012) 
which distinguishes two types of evaluation, namely:       
• Formative evaluation, which takes place during the lifespan of a policy and seeks to 
offer advice to implementing actors to foster internal improvement; and 
• Summative evaluation, which is conducted at the end of a policy implementation to 
ascertain whether a policy has achieved its objectives. 
The implication of the formative evaluation is that evaluation can take place at any point during 
the life of a policy, and not only after implementation (Anderson, 2015). Regardless of the type 
in focus, evaluation is a complex activity. According to Knill and Tosun (2012), some of the 
factors that make it complex are: 
1. identification of goals.  
2. definition of performance measures. 
3. isolation of effects of policies from other factors. 
4. political environment.  
They suggested that while addressing the first three factors would require a well -crafted 
research design, the last factor cannot be fully addressed. This, they argue, is because whereas 
policymakers often need immediate information regarding effects of a policy, such effects take 
time to manifest. Thus, evaluators or researchers may be constrained to forecast effects rather 
than measure them. They may also be influenced by their own biases. 
In all, evaluation is a critical component of evidence -based policymaking as it assists 
policymakers understand “what works out and what does not.” (Knill and Tosun, 2012, p.193). 
Perhaps, the most important benefit of evaluation is not the judgment on the l evel of success 
or failure of policies but the learning it provides to policymakers for improvement (Howlett, et 
al., 2009). This way, evaluation provides policymakers and other stakeholders with evidential 
resources to support or oppose prevailing policie s. In this regard, the nature of the evaluation
<<<PAGE=52>>>
38 
 
and the motives of the evaluators significantly determines the kinds of post-evaluation evidence 
on offer and the importance policymakers may attach to them.       
2.5.7. Policy Maintenance, Succession, and Termination 
At the end of an evaluation exercise, policy makers determine the relationship between planned 
target and actual target. The outcome of that enquiry will assist policy makers in determining 
whether to maintain the status quo, review the policy process, or bring it to an end (Howlett, et 
al., 2009). Thus, this stage is considered notionally as the final stage in the policy process 
(Cairney, 2019).  
2.6. POLICY PROCESS : ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS  
As we have seen demonstrated with the policy stages, it provides a rich explanatory account of 
how policies are made and how the utilisation of evidence could vary based on a number of 
factors including the type of policy in question, the stage of policymaking, and the kind of 
government or governance arrangement in place. The public policy literature is, however, rich 
in terms of alternative explanations. John (2012) identifies five broad explanations approaches 
of how policies are made. 
1. Institutional approaches, which holds that political organisations like  bureaucracies, legal 
systems, and parliaments develop public policies. 
2. Group and network approaches, where informal relationships both within and outside 
government, influence policy outputs and outcomes. 
3. Exogenous approaches, which view that policy outpu ts and outcomes are determined by 
factors outside the political system. 
4. Rational actor approaches (also known as rational choice), which holds that the policy 
preferences of actors and their bargaining capacity shape policy decisions. 
5. Ideas-based approaches, in which ideas on how to solve policy problems gain influence on 
account of their own merit, leading to policy decisions and outcome.      
John argues that although each of these approaches offers a strong explanation of the policy 
process, the explanat ion of each approach is contextualised and thus fails to provide an 
adequate explanation of policy development. He, therefore, proposes that a better way to
<<<PAGE=53>>>
39 
 
explain the policy process is through “a theory that integrates the ﬁve approaches in such a way 
that the causal relationships between them are clear” (John 2012, p.14). Consequently, the 
advocacy coalition framework, the policy streams, and punctuated equilibrium represent 
powerful alternatives on account of their ability to view the political system as one whole unit 
(John 2012). These three theories focus on policymaking in multiple sites and emphasise the 
impact of bounded rationality and subsystems (Cairney, 2019).  
2.6.1. Advocacy Coalition Framework 
Sabatier (1988) developed the Advocacy Coalition Framework that integrated many features 
of public policy, such as the interaction of policy coalitions, changes in socioeconomic 
conditions, and institutional rational choice. Notably, the framework has three theoretical foci: 
advocacy coalitions within a policy subsystem, policy -oriented learning, and policy change 
(Pierre et al., 2017). 
Central to ACF is the assumption that policy actors from within and outside government share 
some basic beliefs, principally policy goals, and that they attempt to manipulate governmental 
rules to achieve the goals (Sabatier, 1991). The framework stresses that relationships within 
policy sectors are critical to understanding how policies are developed (John, 2012). To 
operationalise the ACF, policy actors, form co alitions with like -minded actors who share 
similar beliefs within a subsystem to influence the attainment of their preferred policy 
outcomes (Cairney, 2019). This means the generation of evidence under the framework is 
undertaken by the coalition by way of presenting their preferred views and positions. However, 
evidence is only useful if it has the power to change the beliefs of policymakers (Ritter, et al., 
2018). 
  
The framework is a response to the stages heuristic which has become ineffective in explaining 
the policy process because it is not a “causal theory” (Sabatier, 1991, p.147). Policy scholars 
have determined that effective policy theories need to integrate some critical knowledge 
including those of institutions, political behaviour, and policy c ommunities (Sabatier, 1991). 
He argues that understanding the policy process requires looking at the entire policy 
community, comprised of bureaucrats, interest groups, legislature, researchers, journalists, and 
not a single institution or unit. The framew ork suggests a minimum period of 10 years to 
understand a policy change. Although the ACF bears some resemblance to the policy network
<<<PAGE=54>>>
40 
 
paradigm, the ACF involves more policy actors than the former and even more than the 
traditional policy triangle (John, 2012). 
  
The ACF has been hailed on account of its contribution to the understanding of the policy 
process. The ACF synthesizes several insights from different accounts the policy process, such 
as policy subsystems, institutions, policy actors, and policy analysis (Cairney, 2019; John, 
2012). According to Cairney (2019), the ACF provides new insights into four important aspects 
of the policy process. One, it rejects the notion of an ‘iron triangle’ where a few policy actors 
control the policy process. Instead, it id entifies a wider range of actors, including academics 
and journalists to underscore their value. Two, it also rejects the policy stages model and the 
distinctions between the stages. Three, it builds on models that emphasise the value of 
structural or external factors and their impact on the attitudes of coalition members. Lastly, it 
emphasises the significance of beliefs.    
Yet, the ACF has been accused of a number of flaws. First, it is incapable of fully explaining 
policy change (John, 2012). A key assu mption of the framework is that relationships within 
subsystems are largely stable, which means the framework explains only policy stability. In 
that regard, its power to demonstrate how different kinds of evidence are used or who uses the 
evidence is limited (Ritter, et al., 2018). 
  
Second, the framework does not adequately explain the decision -making process and 
“decisions simply emerge from the contestation of advocacy positions” (Howlett et al., 2016, 
p.69).  Third, it has also been accused of not been  as integrative as it its advocates claim as it 
largely neglects individual choices and institutions (John, 2012). Fourth, the policy style 
advocated by the ACF with a wider range of disparate actors is rarely applicable outside the 
US, considering that in  majority of Western European countries, closed policy communities 
are the order of the day (John, 2012). 
2.6.2. Multiple Stream Theory 
The multiple streams theory is another influential theory within the policy field and many 
studies of policy development have been examined using it. The theory was developed by John 
Kingdon (1984) and focuses predominantly on how some issues gain the attention of 
policymakers while others fail.
<<<PAGE=55>>>
41 
 
According to Kingdon, the policy process involves three streams: problem, policy and politics. 
The problem stream deals with identification of unpleasant issues and their framing with a view 
to attracting the attention of policymakers. It involves a change in the perception of the public 
or the elite regarding an existing problem which requires government action (Gultekin, 2014). 
Three factors determine whether a problem gets the attention of policymakers – rising 
unfavourable statistical indicators; emergence of a prominent event; and feedback on existing 
policies (Gultekin, 2014). T he Policy stream deals with a range of possible solutions to 
problems identified in the first stream. It provides a platform for the emergence of policy ideas 
from the policy community including researchers, bureaucrats, politicians, and interest groups 
(Gultekin, 2014). Lastly, the politics stream considers the existing democratic arrangement, 
pressure group, public mood, and other political interests within which the policy environment 
is located (Quirk, 1986). Within this stream, three elements are criti cal: national mood, 
indicating the general sentiments existing at the time; pressure groups, in terms of whether they 
support or oppose the development of policies; and legislative and administrative turnovers, 
which speaks to the emergence of a new govern ment or a major shift in the legislative arm of 
government (Gultekin, 2014). The importance of evidence across the different stream, 
however, varies. Policymakers do not view the different kinds of evidence as useful in the 
problem and political streams as in the policy stream since that is where policy alternatives are 
identified (Apollonio and Bero, 2017). 
According to Kingdon, only when these three streams happen at the same time or are coupled 
together by policy entrepreneurs, within a policy window (op portunity for a policy change) 
does a particular policy proposal stand a good chance of being adopted. 
The most important quality of the multiple streams theory is its capacity to predict policy 
change where the three streams come together (John, 2012). It s ability to explain causal 
relationships in policy development is also an important quality of the theory (Gultekin, 2014). 
The theory, therefore, allows for the interrogation of the interrelationships within and across 
the three streams. For instance, it enables asking relevant policy questions such as: how does a 
problem get accepted as a problem? How do policy proposals emerge? How do existing 
political arrangements affect the policy process? These questions are at the heart of much 
policy research and the ability of the theory to provide a persuasive explanation on these issues 
is largely responsible for its wide application in different policy settings.
<<<PAGE=56>>>
42 
 
However, while the multiple streams theory provides a sound theoretical lens to understand the 
complex interactions in the policymaking endeavour, scholars have been critical of it for a 
number of reasons. A key criticism is that the framework views policymaking as based on luck 
thereby detracting from the mostly deliberate actions that policymaking is ( Anderson, 2105). 
This suggests that the theory is weak in articulating who provides evidence, and how evidence 
is used. The theory is also not suitable to explain policy variations and differences in policy 
development across national boundaries (John, 201 2). Additionally, it does not represent all 
the stages policies go through as it focused on only the agenda setting stage of the policymaking 
process, making its application on other policy dimensions suspect (Gultekin, 2014).  
In defence of the theory on its alleged limitation to only the agenda setting stage, John (2012) 
argues that it is inappropriate to differentiate factors that shape agenda setting from those that 
shape other stages of policy including implementation and evaluation. He states that the same 
factors are at play at each stage of the policy process suggesting that the three streams are useful 
not only in shaping the agenda setting stage but are equally useful in influencing the other 
policy stages.  
Consequently, the theory offers a useful structure that allows for the investigation of 
policymakers’ perception of problems and the contributions (and importance) of different 
evidence sources to the policymaking process. The framework is also strong in explaining th e 
importance of institutions and the complex political interactions in the policymaking process 
and how the interactions influence evidence and policies.  
2.6.3. Punctuated Equilibrium Theory 
The policy process is generally composed of two distinct periods  - a period of stability and a 
period of change. While a vast majority of policy theories explain policymaking in the former, 
the Punctuated Equilibrium Theory captures the twin dynamics of policy stability and policy 
change (John, 2012; Kuhlmann and van d er Heijden, 2018). The theory, developed by 
Baumgartner and Jones (1993), argues that policymaking comprised of long periods of policy 
stability punctuated by intermittent periods of policy instability. In a way, the long periods of 
stability denote bounde d rationality, while the periods of instability relate to agenda setting 
(Cairney, 2019). This implies that the generation and utilisation of evidence is more feasible in 
the latter period than in the former because while the latter period throws up proble m(s) 
requiring government attention, the latter is a period of equilibrium where no policy action is
<<<PAGE=57>>>
43 
 
needed. However, Baumgartner and Jones (1993) explain that the so -called stability does not 
denote perfect equilibrium but instead it means a relatively lo ng period of stability in which 
policy change can occur incrementally.  
Policy stability is achieved when policy actors with vested interests maintain a monopoly on a 
given policy domain which invariably limits entrance into the policy subsystem (Cairney, 
2019). Thus, during periods of stability, entrenched interests control and dominate particular 
policy domains. This dominance is threatened when new interests seek to exert influence in the 
policy domain in question, upsetting the prevailing stability and leading to instability (Cairney, 
2019). Since the theory explains the interactions of interests, institutions, ideas, and policy 
actors (John, 2012), the ensuing instability is exacerbated when other policy players, 
particularly the media, and policy entrepreneurs join the fray. Indeed, intense attention to some 
policy problems may engender new ways to address the problems (Baumgartner and Jones 
1993; Cairney, 2019). This development expands the range of interested policy players, 
potentially resulting in t he alteration of the balance of power (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; 
John, 2012). Interestingly, “the forces that create stability during some periods are the same 
that combine during critical periods to force dramatic and long -lasting changes during other 
periods” (Baumgartner and Jones 1993, p.237). This means that the same structure that limits 
policy change during stability is the same structure that “ disassembles, reconfigures, and 
enforces wholesale transformation during revolutionary punctuations” (Gersick, 1991, p.2). 
Clearly, one of the greatest contributions of the PET to the policy literature is its ability to 
challenge the dominant account of policymaking that focuses on the stability of policy. By 
integrating the two broad policy periods into a single theory, the PET is seen as one of the best 
ways of analysing public policy (John, 2012). Consequently, PET has been used to examine 
different policymaking situations across different contexts (Flink, 2017; Purcell et al., 2022; 
Wordliczek, 2021). 
Nonetheless, the theory has some limitations. Chiefly, by the admission of the authors, the 
theory is largely descriptive (John, 2012). Also, the theory, harbours ambiguity regarding how 
evidence is generated and used (Cairney, 2014). Further, the theory is based on the questionable 
claim that public opinion and media debates influence outputs and outcomes (John, 2012).

2.7. TWO APPROACHES TO POLICYMAKING : RATIONAL AND INCREMENTAL   
As we have seen, there is a rich collection of theories to illuminate the policy process. Indeed, 
the literature is replete with a wide array of interesting policymaking stories to strengthen the 
value of different theories. Remarkably, some scholars have taken a helicopter view of the 
policy process and came up with a useful class ification. Broadly speaking, the policy-making 
process is viewed from two approaches: rational and incremental (Knill and Tosun, 2012; 
Smith and May, 1980). The policy stages is an example of the rational approach. As we have 
seen, the approach consists of sequential stages that stipulate how policies should be formulated 
(Knill and Tosun 2012; Weible, 2017; Smith and May, 1980). The approach favours a 
standardized prescription for policy development. Based on its instrumentalist dimension, it is 
presented as scientific and problem-solving (Knill and Tosun, 2012) and is consistent with the 
policy science orientation, invented and promoted by Harold D. Lasswell (Torgerson, 2015). 
Thus, the approach privileges scientific evidence and generally advocates a dire ct nexus 
between evidence and policy. Invariably, not all kinds of “evidence” are used in policymaking 
using this approach. In addition, the use of evidence differs across the different stages of the 
approach with some stages more amenable to the use of evidence than others.  
A key virtue of the rational approach is that it transforms policy making from an abstract 
construct into a coherent exercise. This way, the approach opens the “black box” of policy 
making thereby improving the comprehension and analys is of the policy process (Birkland, 
2011, p.27). Indeed, the approach is considered as the best way to explain the policy process 
(Cairney, 2019). 
However, inherent in these virtues are the criticisms of the approach. Two of the criticisms are 
fundamental. One, the approach has been criticized as being too narrow as it disregards the fact 
that policymaking is inherently a political process (Anderson 2015; Howlett, Ramesh and Perl 
2009; Knill and Tosun, 2012; Smith and May, 1997). Policymakers work in a poli tically 
contested environment which limits their capacity for rationality. Second, the approach is silent 
on the issue of causality and does not offer an explanation on who drives a policy through the 
stages (Gultekin, 2014).  
The incremental approach, on the other hand, views policy making from the point of gradual 
improvement of existing policies (Anderson, 2015; Kingdon, 2014; Lindblom, 1959).
<<<PAGE=59>>>
45 
 
Originated by Lindblom (1959), the approach holds that policymaking entails only incremental 
or marginal changes. The author provides the essence of the incremental approach as follows: 
“Policy is not made once and for all; it is made and re -made endlessly. Policymaking is a 
process of successive approximation to some desired objectives in which what is desired itself 
continues to change under consideration…A wise policymaker consequently expects that his 
policy will achieve only part of what he hopes and at the same time will produce unanticipated 
consequences he would have preferred to avoid”(Lindblom 1959, p.86). 
Lindblom calls the improvement of policy over time “succession of incremental changes” 
(1959, p.86). This means the approach is consistent with the path -dependence theory whose 
central argument is that history matters (David, 2001). The approa ch involves series of 
engagements by various stakeholders in the policy environment each having different 
information, time availability, and technical capacity (Knill and Tosun, 2012). An example of 
the approach is the multiple stream theory. The approach  is considered more realistic 
(Anderson, 2015) as it recognises the bounded nature of policymakers’ rationality (Lindblom 
1959; Smith and May, 1989). This means the approach appreciates the chaotic nature of the 
policy environment, especially in pluralist and democratic settings where there is routine 
pressure on policymakers amidst resource deficits. It is concerned with what is politically 
possible and not what is desirable (Howlett et al., 2009); and emphasises that in policy 
development, policymakers start with “the policies currently in force” (Smith and May, 1989, 
p.150) because the hard work has been done (Lindblom, 1959).  
In a nutshell, based on the messy policy environment coupled with the bounded rationality 
regarding policymakers, multiple kinds of evidence are utilised in this approach. This means 
different stakeholders try to influence policy decisions by providing the kinds of evidence that 
strengthen their preferences. The immediate implication of this scenario is that values, and 
more broadly politics, play a far greater role in policymaking than scientific evidence.    
However, like its rational approach forerunner, the incremental approach has been subjected to 
criticism. The approach has been accused of being restrictive as it involves only  short-range 
changes in existing policies thereby discouraging innovation (Anderson, 2015; Smith and May, 
1997). Related to this is that the approach assumes the existence of a policy, which may not be 
the case. It, therefore, does not explain how to proce ed regarding the development of new 
policies. Further, based on its iterative orientation and the absence of a technical bias, the 
approach is accused of lacking clearly set goals (Howlett et al., 2009). Finally, and
<<<PAGE=60>>>
46 
 
paradoxically, it is argued that the approach may be more expensive than the rational approach 
it seeks to supplant (Smith and May, 1997). Explaining this point, Smith and May points out 
that the costliness of the incremental approach is hidden in its reluctance to allow policymakers 
to explore radical choices, which may be the better choices. Thus, the rational approach is 
predominantly prescriptive, stipulating how policies should be made, whereas the incremental 
approach is descriptive, explaining how policies are made (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984 ; Knill 
and Tosun, 2012).    
However, despite the well -documented debate between advocates of the rational and 
incremental approaches, in more ways than one, the “debate is an artificial one” because the 
two approaches are not mutually exclusive but complementary (Smith and May, 1997, p.172). 
What is important is to develop an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach 
to guide policy makers leading to improved policy making. As lucidly put by Sabatier (1999, 
p.6): “knowledge of several diff erent perspectives forces the analyst to clarify differences in 
assumptions across frameworks, rather than implicitly assuming a given set”.  
The foregoing discussion on different kinds of policy theories and models has highlighted the 
concept of evidence and its use in the policy process.  Over the years, evidence -based policy 
(EBP) has continued to dominate discourse in the public policy discipline regarding what it 
means, its feasibility, and importantly, questions are being asked about how evidence is u sed 
in the policy process. In the next section, the concept of EBP is examined.   
2.8. EVIDENCE -BASED POLICY 
2.8.1. Evidence-based Policymaking as a Concept 
Evidence-based policymaking is not an easy concept to define. Scholars and practitioners have 
defined it differently, often based on their ideological leaning and orientation. The term can be 
defined from either a narrow or broad perspective (Nutley  et al., 2007). From a narrow 
perspective, EBP is viewed as the use of systematic reviews and experimental research in the 
development and implementation of public policies (Boaz et al., 2008; Slavin, 2004). It is also 
concerned with ascertaining the effectiveness of policy interventions using scientific methods 
(Nutley et al., 2007). The foregoing, which privileges scientific evidence, is the dominant view 
of EBP (Ferrandino, 2014), and ignores values, beliefs, and politics (Greenhalgh and Russell, 
2009). Thus, it involves “the depoliticisation of the policy process” and policy decisions are
<<<PAGE=61>>>
47 
 
seen to be based o n scientific research and not politics and values (Clarence, 2002, p.5). It is 
argued that within this tradition, methods for the generation of evidence are required to be 
“accountable, replicable, and updateable” (Oakley, 2002, p.280). This suggests a standard way 
of acquiring research evidence that could be translated into quantitative data, and policy 
outcome are expected to be predictable. Taken together, EBP is seen as a rational and technical 
exercise involving the systematic acquisition of particular  kind of evidence to address 
identified public problems. 
A broad definition, however, considers EBP as an approach that facilitates development of 
policies using a wide range of information sources including scientific research and evaluation, 
expert knowledge, stakeholder input, values, and politics (Banks, 2009; Head 2008; 2010; Kay 
2011; Maddison 2012). In this regard, Head (2008) argues that evidence is obtained from three 
sources namely: political evidence comprising information obtained from lobbying,  
negotiation, and values; scientific evidence from experiments, systematic research and inter -
disciplinary knowledge; and practical evidence from practitioner knowledge and skills. In 
addition to these three types of evidence, Kay (2011) posits that transactional evidence, dealing 
with issues of distributive and redistributive functions of policy are also critical. This broad 
definition invites policymakers to look beyond the confines of scientific research and instead 
obtain the best available evidence fro m multiple relevant sources. It also shows that EBP is 
neither neutral nor objective (Clarence, 2002; Head 2008; 2010; Kay 2011).  
The preceding definitional debate has shown that what counts as evidence is contentious (Head, 
2008; Kay, 2011; Maddison, 201 2). Fundamentally, it indicates that the status of evidence in 
the policy process is contested as what is recognised as an evidence in the two schools of 
thought differs. The debate is consistent with the long -standing conflict in social research 
between t he positivist and interpretivist approaches to research (Greenhalgh and Russell, 
2009). Situated within the EBP discourse, the positivists favour the narrow definition, while 
the interpretivists advocate the broad one. This thesis adopts the broad definition for two main 
reasons. Firstly, the broad definition is more feasible as it recognizes the influence of politics 
on the policy process. Whereas scientific evidence is useful, its utilization is a political 
decision. Ultimately, “no matter how strong the evidence is”, it is very unlikely to solely 
influence adoption as other factors have to be favourable (Nutley and Davies, 2000a, p.328). 
Secondly, the limit of scientific research is well documented in the literature, and as such the 
multiplicity of eviden ce accepted in the broad definition potentially improves the quality of
<<<PAGE=62>>>
48 
 
policy decisions. Indeed, policymaking should be driven by the best available evidence 
regardless of source (Head, 2008, 2010; Kay, 2011; Maddison, 2012; Marston and Watts, 
2003).  
 Meanwhile, (Pawson, 2006) argues that EBP has become a buzz word and many phenomena 
are wrongly perceived as EBP. He, thus, explains that the following do not qualify as EBP -
making: 
• Positioning: where former politicians transmute to providers of evidence con sidering 
the high likelihood that the ‘evidence’ they offer may be based not on objectivity but 
ideology. 
• Portals: which is not intended to obtain evidence but to harnesses information within 
the context of knowledge management. 
• Polling: comprising information obtained from opinion poll and other similar 
arrangements like focus group. 
• Partnership: where researchers and practitioners agree to work together to figure out a 
solution to a practical problem as in co-participatory research. 
• Partisanship: which recognizes and prioritizes solutions in favour of those oppressed 
by the system. 
• Punditry: involving policy analysts, special advisers, think -tanks and other similar 
arrangements designed to provide data and information in “support of polit ically 
favoured and pre-established policy lines” (Pawson, 2006, p.7). 
On their part, Davies  et al., (2000b) argue that EBP may not be suitable in certain 
circumstances, including where: 
• Generating evidence is costlier than the likely benefits derivable fr om the use of such 
evidence. 
• There is only one realistic way to proceed or there is a consensus on how to proceed. 
• Political expediency overrides the use of evidence. 
• There is unavailability of the research capacity required for the creation of relevant 
evidence. 
• The issue under investigation is not researchable, perhaps owing to unclear objectives, 
immeasurability of outcomes or rapid technological change.
<<<PAGE=63>>>
49 
 
• It is impossible to assemble relevant evidence based on fundamental constraints like 
ethical considerations. 
The view of Davies  et al., (2000b) above suggests they subscribe to the narrow definition of 
EBP – idealistic and devoid of politics. But as we have seen, the policy making process is 
ultimately political and policy decisions should be a rrived at not from the use of a particular 
type of evidence but rather from the utilisation of the best available evidence. In recognition of 
this view, Nutley  et al., (2007) reviewed their stance and endorsed the broad definition. In 
support, they argued that EBP does not only deal with what works, but also interrogates the 
problem, why it happened and how it could be solved. 
2.8.2. A Brief History of EBP  
EBP is generally believed to have originated from evidence -based medicine which involves 
searching for, and incorporating, clinical evidence into medical interventions (Larkin, 2006). 
Subsequently, it was adopted in other fields like education, criminal justice, healthcare, 
transport, urban renewal, housing, welfare and social care (Nutley and Davies, 200 0a) and, 
lately, accounting (Leuz, 2018).  
There are, however, other accounts that suggest that EBP existed in some ways much earlier 
than its connection to the field of medicine. The Royal Commission of the Poor Law (1832 -
34) which was founded in England and developed a framework to enhance the relationship 
between research and policymaking is an example of EBP in action (Nutley and Webb 2000). 
Citing Finch (1986), Nutley and Webb (2000), summarise the key aspects of the framework as 
follows:  
• The need to collect and use accurate facts as a basis for policy making. 
• A recognition of quantitative data as important components of such facts. 
• A preference for a model that provides for a direct interface between knowledge and 
reform.  
Consequently, the framework adopted a simplified, uncomplicated approach where scientific 
evidence is seen to have a direct impact on policy.    
On his part, Parson (1995) traced the origin of EBP to the 1930s when social scientists 
advocated the use of better information to address public problems. After the Second World
<<<PAGE=64>>>
50 
 
War, the notion that research should influence policy objectives of governmen ts gained 
prominence until the 1970s and 1980s when social research was considered ineffective (Nutley 
and Webb, 2000; Nutley et al., 2007). The attendant discontent, therefore, gave rise to EBP’s 
“second coming” reinforced by the need to ascertain what wo rks in public service delivery 
(Pawson, 2006, p.8). 
The renewed prominence of EBP, and its refinement is attributable to the Labour government 
of Tony Blair which won a general election in the UK in 1997 (Davies et al., 2000a). The 
government had popularised the ‘what matters is what works’ slogan. The key message in the 
slogan is that public problems would be defined and resolved using empirical evidence. This 
is a rejection of the previous ideologically driven governments of the 1980s and the early parts 
of the 1990s (Banks, 2009; Davies, et al., 2000a; Kay, 2011). These governments particularly 
that of Margaret Thatcher distanced themselves from, or even dismissed, research in 
policymaking (Nutley and Webb, 2000). The new Labour government, therefore, ple dged to 
make evidence the cornerstone of its policymaking as disclosed by one of Blair’s ministers:   
“Social science should be at heart of policy making. We need a revolution in relations between 
government and the social research community – we need social scientists to help to determine 
what works and why, and what types of policy initiatives are likely to be most effective” 
(Blunkett, 2000 in Nutley et al., 2007, p.10). 
To operationalize its vision, the new Labour government issued a number of documents which 
included: Modernising Government, Professional Policy Making for the Twenty First Century, 
Better Policy Making, and Adding It Up (Clarence, 2002). The common denominator of these 
documents is that public policies should be based on evidence. In fur therance to this, a 
Professional Skills for Government  (PSG) framework was developed which required civil 
servants to have EBP knowledge (Boaz, Grayson, Levitt and Solesbury, 2008). Consequently, 
various initiatives were launched by the government to promote the generation and utilization 
of evidence in public service delivery (Nutley and Webb, 2000).  
Globally, EBP has become part of a bourgeoning movement aimed at improving service 
delivery in the public sector. As a result, developed nations have overtim e developed 
significant institutional capacities for the promotion of EBP (Head, 2010). In this regard, the 
Anglophone countries, e.g., the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand lead the way 
(Boaz, Grayson, Levitt and Solesbury, 2008) but Sub -Saharan A frica, Latin America, 
Southeast and East Asia have also embraced it in varying degrees (Datta and Jones, 2011).
<<<PAGE=65>>>
51 
 
The increasing use of evidence in policymaking and practice is attributable to many factors. 
Davies et al., (2000a) itemized some of the reasons as: the rise in the number of well-educated 
publics; the availability of different kinds of data; the improving capacities of researchers and 
research organisations; an increasing importance of the concepts of efficiency, competitiveness 
and accountability in government; and public scepticism of the public servants (Pawson, 2006).  
2.8.3. Successes and Failures of EBP 
The increasing prominence of the EBP has motivated a debate about the extent to which it has 
achieved its goal. The determination of the success and failure of EBP is, nevertheless, a 
difficult exercise. This is because the literature to answer the question of whether EBP works 
is limited and because of difficulty in ascertaining research impact (Nutley et al., 2007). Indeed, 
outcome of evaluation of government policies are often mixed (Bryson et al., 2012). 
Nevertheless, the impact of EBP can be ascertained either by the level of “changes to the 
business of government and public services” (Boaz, et al., 2008, p.234) or by policy outcomes 
(Nutley et al., 2007). These two parameters would be used  to highlight instances of the 
successes and failures of EBP in the literature.   
The EBP has had a significant impact in the UK, influencing fundamental changes in the 
funding, provision, and delivery of public services in the UK (Nutley et al., 2007). Budgets for 
analytical purposes of departments and agencies have increased and allocation for research and 
development enhanced (Boaz, et al., 2008). The outcomes of such policy changes have in turn 
been evaluated leading to newer research to find better way s of doing things (Nutley et al., 
2007). For instance, the Cross -cutting review of science and research and the Science and 
innovation investment framework introduced important changes in the UK civil service. 
Specifically, the latter introduced the requir ement for “scientific advisers and strategic 
innovation reviews in each department” with a view to improving the impact of science and 
evidence in governance (Boaz, et al., 2008, p.234). 
Furthermore, social researchers have been organized as an official ca dre within the UK 
government in the same manner as economists (Boaz, et al., 2008). At the employee level, the 
Professional Skills for Government (PSG) initiative has emphasized the need for EBP 
knowledge for civil servants to improve their effectiveness ( Boaz, et al., 2008). Based on the 
foregoing, it is safe to conclude that EBP has changed the face of the UK civil service.
<<<PAGE=66>>>
52 
 
Outside the UK, EBP has impacted governance in different countries. In Australia, tariff 
making was, for many years, informed by evid ence contained in reports produced by the 
country’s Tariff Board and thereafter, its successors (Banks, 2009). These reports, Bank 
explains, had changed overtime from reporting the impacts of the tariff on selected industries 
to expanding the scope to cover other industries and the economy at large. Other key policies 
that were based on evidence include, the inflation targeting policy in 1993; the National 
Competition Policy reforms of the 1990s; the financial market liberalisation of the 1980s; the 
Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and the provisions of ‘Lifetime Community 
Rating’ in private health insurance regulation (Banks, 2009, p.109).   
Also, the tariff reform and the regulation of the gambling industry in Australia owed their 
success to the use of evidence (Banks, 2009). In the former, Banks explains, evidence provided 
by a government agency was used by potential beneficiaries to vigorou sly push for a reform. 
In the latter, the deregulation of the gambling industry was based on the myth that doing so 
would create numerous jobs with tolerable adverse social impacts. Using evidence, it was soon 
revealed that in the long run, gambling did no t generate significant jobs but instead increased 
adverse social impacts, leading to the regulation of the regulation. Thus, the evidence 
ameliorated political impediments and made the reform and regulation possible (Banks, 2009). 
Often, changes in stakeho lders’ thinking could strengthen their position and feed into policy 
debates (Nutley et al., 2007). 
In the US, the Pew Charitable Trusts and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, 
in 2010, launched Results First, an initiative designed to assist states and local governments to 
promote the use of evidence in their policymaking (Lester, 2018). This is bolstered by the fact 
that policymakers in the US are more interested in the practice of public policy as against 
political theory (Leigh, 2003). By the end of 2016, Pew-MacArthur reported that policies in all 
the fifty states in the US were, in varying degrees, guided by evidence (Lester, 2018). By all 
standards, this is a significant achievement because considering the pre-eminence of the US in 
the field of public policy, it is highly probable that such initiative would be adopted elsewhere. 
The notion of diffusion of innovation is that ideas and practices that are considered beneficial 
are often adopted elsewhere (Nutley et al., 2007). Thus, it is h ighly probable that this type of 
partnership would be replicated in other jurisdictions, thereby deepening EBP.  
Notwithstanding the relative success of EBP, there have been numerous instances where the 
adoption or implementation of EBP has failed to achie ve its goal. For instance, in 1999, the
<<<PAGE=67>>>
53 
 
UK government committed £400 million to the Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) to 
consistently reduce crime rate (Maguire, 2004). The programme represented “the biggest single 
investment in an evidence -based approach to  crime reduction which has ever taken place in 
any country” (Home Office, 1999 in Nutley et al., 2007, p.18). In addition, the government 
allocated £250 million for external evaluations of the programme (Maguire, 2004). The CRP 
soon became enmeshed in a nu mber of problems including unrealistic timelines, bureaucratic 
lethargy and capacity issues (Maguire, 2004). Upon review, the programme was adjudged to 
have failed to achieve its goal (Hope, 2004; Maguire, 2004) which explained its termination in 
2002 (Maguire, 2004; Nutley et al., 2007). 
On a larger scale, Nutley and Davies (2000a) reviewed findings of a multi-sectoral research on 
the role of evidence in seven policy areas in the UK: education, healthcare, transport, urban 
renewal, housing, criminal justice, welfare and social care. Although, the different policy areas 
recorded varying levels of adoption of EBP, the review generally indicated disappointing 
impact on both policy and practice across the different policy areas.  
The failure of EBP is also repo rted within the US criminal system. The evidence -based 
Sentencing Guidelines designed to guide judges’ sentencing decisions in the state’s courts was 
adjudged as a failure (Stuart and Sykora, 2011). The Guidelines, developed by a Guidelines 
Commission, car efully articulated sentences for identified offences to substantially reduce 
growing disparities and to impose sentences consistent with offender’s crime. Thirty years 
later, disparity still thrived largely because elected officials applied pressure for stiffer penalties 
and judges amended the sentences to suit their whims (Stuart and Sykora, 2011).         
Similarly, an EBP research commissioned by the World Bank in 2008/09 to influence policy 
in the Ethiopian tourism industry was reviewed and considered a  failure (Mitchell and Font, 
2017). According to them, failure of researchers to consider the political dynamics of the 
environment and a lack of engagement with the local policy makers accounted for rejection of 
their recommendations. They concluded that for research and evidence to impact policy 
making:  
 “...researchers should be alive to the fact that they are operating in a politically contested 
space. Failing to take the political economy of policymaking into account, and allowing this 
knowledge to influence the shape of the research process itself, risks generating research and 
policy recommendations which will not resonate with local decision -makers and may have 
damaging implications if implemented.” (2017, p.134).
<<<PAGE=68>>>

In conclusion, the literature of EBP implementation is an interesting mix of successes and 
failures. But why did some EBP succeed while others failed? Empirical studies have 
demonstrated that the use of evidence in policymaking is not as strai ghtforward as it is often 
presented. Usually, it is “a subtle and complex process…resulting in equally subtle and 
complex outcomes” (Nutley et al., 2007, p.33). In addition to the fact that what is considered 
acceptable evidence is contested and differs across different domains, evidence may be flawed, 
fundamentally modified, or even rejected by policymakers, leading to unanticipated outcomes 
(Head, 2010). Thus, while a consideration of prevailing contextual political economy is 
important to enhance the chances of EBP success, it is impossible to guarantee any particular 
outcome considering the messy policy environment.   
2.8.4. Evidence: Definition, Hierarchy and Utilisation  
2.8.4.1.  What is Evidence? 
A key presumption in the EBP discourse is that evidenc e is important in the policymaking 
process and contributes to the development of more effective policies (Clarence, 2002; Head, 
2008; Kay, 2011; Maddison, 2012; Marston and Watts, 2003). What counts as evidence is, 
however, contentious and contested (Allia nce for Useful Evidence, 2015; Bennett and 
Holloway, 2010; Freiberg and Carson, 2010; Head, 2008; Head 2014; Kay, 2011; La Caze and 
Colyvan, 2017; Maddison, 2012) in part because evidence is fluid and is interpreted based on 
an individual’s understanding a nd biases (Clarence, 2002). Like the definition of the broader 
EBP, the term ‘evidence’ can mean different things to different people ranging from personal 
knowledge and experience to scientific research findings (Nutley et al., 2007). Thus, the term 
can be viewed from a narrow or broad viewpoint (Hansen, 2014) leading to a growing debate 
among scholars and practitioners. 
Conventionally, evidence refers to knowledge obtained through systematic research, conducted 
by either governments or non-government organisations (Greenhalgh and Russell, 2009; Head, 
2010; Kay, 2011). The mainstream EBP movement favours “scientific evidence (arising from 
research) as the form best suited to inform policymaking” (Parkhurst, 2017, p.16). In this 
regard, only a particular type of evidence - research-based knowledge - is considered evidence, 
thereby narrowing its scope and depth. This narrow definition is the dominant view of evidence 
and is invariably the preference of EBP champions (Hansen, 2014). To corroborate, the US 
National Research Council (2012) advocates scientific research evidence stating that:
<<<PAGE=69>>>
55 
 
“Science identifies problems – endangered specifies, obesity, unemployment, and vulnerability 
to natural disasters or bioterrorism or cyber-attacks or bullying. It measures their magnitude 
or seriousness. Science offers solutions to problem, in some instances extending to policy 
design and implementation, from improved weapons systems to public health to school reform. 
Science also predicts the likely outcomes of particular policy actions and then evaluates those 
outcomes, intended and unintended, wanted and unwanted. In these multiple ways, science is 
of value to policy, if used” (Parkhurst, 2017, pp.16-17). 
Providing further clarification, Hansen (2014) suggested that within the evidence movement, 
two factors are critical in the determination of evidence: 
1. Synthesised knowledge derived from reviews. 
2. Continuous update of reviews to reflect results from new primary studies.  
The movement, thus, embodies the notion that evi dence is derived from research knowledge 
and comprises “streams rather than individual study results” (2014, p.12). Similarly, Nutley, et 
al., (2013) argue for the use of evidence exclusively derived from research rather than from 
other sources like expert  knowledge or stakeholder inputs. They justified their choice on the 
basis that the systematic way of conducting research, including methodology, peer review and 
external assessment enhances the trustworthiness and validity of findings.       
The foregoing characterization of evidence has, however, been criticized as being too narrow 
and unrealistic and several scholars including Greenhalgh and Russell (2009), Head (2008), 
Maddison (2012) have argued that evidence comes not from a single source but from a variety 
of sources. (Rutter, 2012). Echoing this sentiment, the Cabinet Office Strategic Policy Making 
Team (SPMT) defined evidence as: 
“Expert knowledge; published research; existing statistics; stakeholder consultations; 
previous policy evaluations; the I nternet; outcomes from consultations; costings of policy 
options; output from economic and statistical modelling” (cited in Nutley et al., 2002, p.2).  
The above definition is comprehensive and encompasses a wide range of information sources. 
This leads to the democratisation of the policy process as different kinds of evidence are 
considered and utilised for policymaking. However, while the comprehensive ness of the 
definition has merits, particularly the consideration of stakeholders’ inputs, it also has its share 
of demerits. A key challenge of adopting the definition is the determination of how the different 
kinds of evidence can be prioritized (Nutley et al., 2002). This is in addition to the fact that it 
is expensive and time-consuming to collect, synthesise and eventually utilize evidence owing
<<<PAGE=70>>>
56 
 
to the plurality of information sources. That is why despite its avowal for a wide evidence base, 
in practic e, the UK public sector utilizes a narrow evidence -base, particularly, systematic 
research, statistics, economic modelling, policy evaluation and expert knowledge (Nutley et 
al., 2002). 
Meanwhile, Head (2008) posits that three kinds of evidence and knowled ge are important in 
the development and implementation of policies. They are:  
• Political know-how. 
• Rigorous scientific and technical analysis. 
• Practical and professional field experience.  
He explained that political know -how deals with the knowledge and judgement of relevant 
political actors and the major activities undertaken in this area include agenda setting, setting 
priorities, persuasion, communication and trade -offs. This evidence -base is, therefore, 
anchored on persuasion, stakeholder engagement, and a consideration for fairness and equity 
as opposed to rationality. Scientific and technical analysis, he argues, involves the use of 
systematic research and analysis to generate valuable policy -relevant information. The 
randomized controlled trial and systematic review are often used in this regard, with the latter, 
considered the ‘gold standard’ in medical intervention, gradually being adopted in social policy 
(2008, 6). Practical knowledge, on the other hand, comprises the practical expe rtise of 
professionals and managers who directly impact policy or provide support services. Their 
training and actions are often related to best practices for improved efficiency. Head (2008, 
p.9) therefore argues that these evidence sources represent the ‘three lenses’ that are especially 
important in informing and influencing policy. 
 Similarly, Kay (2011) argues that policy ‘evidence’ emanates not from a single rationality but 
from four rationalities, that often differ on account of varying contexts. She  identified the 
rationalities as: political rationality wherein evidence is arrived at through democratic 
consensus-building, equity, stakeholder engagement and communication; technical knowledge 
in which evidence is obtained from scientific research and a nalysis; practical rationality 
concerned with the pragmatic manifestation of what has been proven to work or have worked 
in the past instead of relying only on experts’ recommendations; and transactional rationality 
which deals with the intervention of pol icymakers to ensure that policies perform their
<<<PAGE=71>>>
57 
 
functions. The implication of these multiple rationalities, she concludes, is that no evidence is 
superior to the other as each one represents a critical element in the policymaking process.  
 The ensuing div ergence about evidence is not new in the literature. It corresponds with the 
age-long debate in social science broadly between the positivists and the interpretivists 
(Greenhalgh and Russell, 2009) with each camp underpinned by assumptions on knowledge 
generation. The debate can be viewed as a continuum with the positivists at one end advocating 
that research plays a key role in policy development and the interpretivists at the other end 
insisting that research plays a minor role (Cook, 2001 cited in Martson and Watts, 2003). The 
debate tells us that the two schools of thought have significantly different conceptualisations 
of evidence, further demonstrating that evidence is contested in the policymaking environment. 
To emphasise, whereas advocates of the majority view of evidence would only place evidential 
value on research evidence, their opponents would insist that in addition to that, evidence also 
comes from other sources like stakeholders, the internet, and political values. This corroborates 
the view that evidence means a different thing to different people leading to a remarkable 
difference in the way it is used.      
However, some scholars have argued that the research -politics divide is unfeasible as 
policymakers and practitioners recognize and util ize the strength of each camp (Nutley et al., 
2013; Parkhurst, 2017). Thus, majority of policymakers and practitioners are found 
“somewhere near the middle of this continuum”  (Martson and Watts, 2003, p.145). In this 
regard, Parkhurst (2017, p.107) recomme nds “an improved use of evidence” which “ensures 
fidelity to scientific good practices, that applies evidence to achieve social goals and also 
ensures that evidence -informed policy decisions remain democratically representative of the 
public’s values.” This sounds not only theoretically appealing but also practicable and aligns 
with Boswell’s (2014) views that the debate about evidence is not to be seen as negative but as 
a critical part of deliberative democracy in decision -making. “The centrality of evidence, and 
willingness of proponents of competing narratives to justify their claims in these terms, 
legitimates the decision -making process and provides a basis for ongoing contestation” 
(Boswell, 2014, p.363). 
2.8.4.2 Hierarchy of Evidence   
EBP originated from evidence-based medicine which, according to Marston and Watts (2003, 
146), is “the process of systematically finding, appraising, and using research findings as the
<<<PAGE=72>>>
58 
 
basis for clinical decisions”. Contemporary evidence-based medicine (EBM) came to limelight 
in the early 1970s even though its origin is traceable to 1662 when Jan B aptista van Helmont 
used randomized controlled trial (RCT) to treat people with fever (Doherty, 2005 cited in Gugiu 
2015).The major objective of EBM was to address the growing unscientific trend in medicine 
at the time when medical decisions were based on experience and instinct (La Caze and 
Colyvan, 2017). 
In this regard a hierarchy of evidence was developed to enhance medical intervention by 
ranking selected evidence based on their strength because, as the argument goes, not all types 
of evidence have equ al validity (Evans, 2003; Milano, 2015; Murad et al., 2016; Shaneyfelt, 
2016; Tomlin and Borgetto, 2011). T he hierarchy of evidence was first promoted in 1979 by 
the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (Evans, 2003) but became more 
prominent in the early 1990s (Murad et al., 2016).  
Thereafter, scholars have developed numerous hierarchies of evidence most of which show 
systematic reviews and meta -analysis at the top of the hierarchy; followed by RCTs, cohort 
studies, case control studies,  and finally studies with weak design (like case control and case 
series) at the bottom (Murad, et al., 2016; Rosner, 2012) as indicated in Figure 1 below.
<<<PAGE=73>>>
59 
 
 
FIGURE 1: A SAMPLE HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE 
Source: Murad et al., (2016, p.125) 
The main purpose of the hierarchy is to underline the importance and preference of some 
evidence above others with the lower ranked evidence invariably requiring more time and 
expertise to apply (Murad et al., 2016). This means the search for a solution to a medical issue 
starts from the top, coming down to lower levels until the best solution is obtained (Shaneyfelt, 
2016). Thus, the hierarchy is intended to provide medical practitioners with high quality 
information for taking medical decisions. 
The validity of the hierarchy has, however, been questioned. A major limitation of hierarchies 
is that they are exclusively concerned with effectiveness – the capacity to achieve set target - 
at the expense of other important considerations (Marston and Watts 2003), particularly 
consumer’s value (Evans, 2003; Rosner, 2012). In this regard, Evans (2003, p.79) proposed 
that hierarchies should focus not just on effectiveness but on appropriateness, including client’s 
value, because regardless of how effective an intervention is, “its value is questionable” if it is 
“unacceptable to the consumer”. Rosner (2012, 42) also notes:

“…the canonical pyramid of EBM excludes numerous sources of research information, such 
as basic research, epidemiology, and health services research. Models of EBM commonly used 
by third party payers have ignored clinical judgement and patient values and expectations, 
which together form a tripartite and more realistic guidelines to effective clinical care.”   
The scholar, therefore, advocated a more “ecumenical approach” with more elements in the 
hierarchy and which recognizes the need of users (Rosner, 2012, p.48).  
On his part, Milano (2015) observes that the graphic representation of evidence in a hierarchy 
has unconsciously created not just a ranking of output but also of producers of the outputs such 
that researchers whose work qualifies to be at the top are considered better researchers whereas 
those whose work are placed at the bottom are viewed  as mediocre researchers. The scholar 
cautions that the hierarchy should not be viewed as “a ranking of the best and the worst” but 
rather as a framework comprising complementary components with each level being a critical 
prerequisite for the level above (2015, p.101). What the hierarchy does is simply to provide 
practitioners an indication of the progression of research efforts and the current state of research 
in a particular area. 
Questions are also being asked about the primacy of RTCs in the hierarchy (Murad et al., 2016). 
The RTCs are generally regarded as the ‘gold standard’ in the (traditional) hierarchy of 
evidence (Bennett and Holloway, 2010; Evans, 2003; Marston and Watts, 2003) based on their 
ability to drastically reduce error (Evans, 2003; Gug ui, 2015; La Caze and Colyvan, 2017). 
Being the settled gold standard, one question that seems compelling is what happens when 
RTCs are poorly carried out? Or put another way, is a poorly conducted RCT better evidence 
than a well-conducted cohort study or case control study on the same issue? (Shaneyfelt, 2016). 
Considering these weaknesses, particularly the RCTs, researchers have called for their 
modification (Rosner, 2012) recommending various proposals among which are: 
• Pragmatic Clinical Trials (PCTs) which deals with the practical questions about costs, 
benefits and risks. 
•  Whole System Research (WSR) which makes use of observational knowledge 
including quantitative and qualitative research. 
• Patient-oriented evidence th at matters (POEM) which focusses only on what is 
considered important and encouraging practitioners to disregard what is not (Rosner, 
2012).
<<<PAGE=75>>>
61 
 
Meanwhile, based on the legacy relationship between EBM and EBP, the latter is often viewed 
through the lenses of the former. EBM serves as the precursor of EBP and historically, the two 
concepts owe their development and popularity to the goal of dislodging the use of ideology 
and intuition in medical and social policy intervention. This relationship has instigated a call 
for the adoption of the hierarchy of evidence in the social policy domain (Head, 2010; Hansen, 
2014; Parkhurst, 2017). To justify the call, reference was made to the overarching idea behind 
the concepts – the attempt to improve outcomes by answering the question of what works under 
what context (La Caze and Colyvan, 2017). Reference was also made to the perceived triumph 
of the EBM in improving the quality of intervention in the medical domain thereby making the 
‘medical model’ attractive to social policy (Parkhurst, 2017, p.15). The call for such adoption 
cuts across various policy domains including education (Davies, 1999), crime prevention 
(Welsh and Farrington, 2001) and social work (Kazi et al., 2011).  
 At another level, some scholars promote the use of particular methods within the traditional 
hierarchy of evidence for social policy intervention. Young et al., (2002) for instance, advocate 
the use of systematic review because it undertakes a wide -ranging approach to search for 
evidence. Specifically, it identifies “all the relevant research, not just the best known, well 
promoted and successful” (Young, et al., 2002, p.220).  In the same vein, Haynes et al., (2012) 
strongly support the use of RCTs in social policy. The say: 
“Randomised controlled t rials (RCTs) are the best way of determining whether a policy is 
working. They are now used extensively in international development, medicine, and business 
to identify which policy, drug or sales method is most effective” (Haynes et al., 2012, p.4) 
Subsequently, they proposed a “test, learn and adapt” approach has follows: 
• Test: to ensure that robust measures are put in place to ascertain the effectiveness of an 
intervention. 
• Learn: to analyse the outcome of interventions to identify ‘what works’. 
• Adapting: to adjust interventions based on the learnings from the previous stage. 
Generally, several organisations have developed various kinds of hierarchies to suit their 
operations (Hansen, 2014). The objective is to provide guidance to decision makers on the 
strength to be attached to the types of evidence at their disposal. It helps decision makers not 
only to avoid biases (Boruch and Rui, 2008) but also enables them to decide the value of 
different kinds of evidence (Alliance for Useful Evidence, 2015). For instance, the UK Cabinet
<<<PAGE=76>>>
62 
 
Office developed a hierarchy (below) for policymakers’ intervention in respect of vulnerable 
individuals (Leigh, 2009). 
1. Systematic review — Synthesis of results from several studies   
2. Randomised controlled trial — Population allocated randomly to groups  
3. Quasi-experimental study — Similar populations compared  
4. Pre-post study — Results compared before and after intervention 
FIGURE 2: THE UK GOVERNMENT'S EVIDENCE HIERARCHY FOR POLICYMAKERS 
Source: Leigh (2009, 31) 
The search for evidence begins from level 4 (the least reliable evidence) where baseline results 
are compared with results after an intervention, then the search moves up to Quasi -
experimental study (level 3), RCTs (level 2), and finally systematic review (level 1) which is 
the most reliable evidence. 
Whereas medical practitioners generally conform to the guidance espo used in the EBM 
hierarchy, policymakers in the social policy domain often view the EBP hierarchy inversely 
with scant recognition accorded to research evidence (see the view of a former deputy Chief 
Social Researcher in the UK central government below.

1. Expert evidence (including consultants and think tanks). 
2. opinion–based evidence (including lobbyists/pressure groups). 
3. Ideological evidence (party think tanks, manifestos).

6. Lay evidence (constituents’ or citizens’ experiences). 
7. Street evidence (urban myths, conventional wisdom). 
8. Cabbies’ evidence. 
9. Research evidence. 
FIGURE 3: AN INSIDER’S VIEW OF POLICYMAKERS’ HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE 
Source: Phil Davies, Former Deputy Chief Social Researcher, 2007 In Nutley et al., (2013, p.21) 
The call for the adoption of hierarchy of evidence in social policy has elicited a sustained 
debate. The claim that in EBP, like in medical research, there is a hierarchy which ranks 
evidence based on their validity is the most debatable notion in the EBP discourse (Head, 
2010). It is widely believed that unlike the medical sciences, the answer to the question of 
‘what works’ in social policy is contextual (Nutley et al., 2002). 
So, despite the similarities between the two, La Caze and Colyvan (2017, p.6) argue that there 
are “two main areas of disanalogy” that make the two markedly dissimilar, especially in RCT. 
First is the science behind medicine and policy. They argue that whi le medicine possesses 
adequate “causal knowledge” required for the design, analysis and application of RCTs, the 
social sciences have significant limitation in that regard. Thus, it is easier to generate causality 
in life sciences than in social sciences a nd considering the place of causality in RCTs, one 
understands the difficulty in conducting RCT for policy issues. Second, RCT and indeed the 
entire EBM are concerned with comparing two or more sufficiently understood interventions, 
whereas EBP is interest ed in policy outcomes for which policymakers often do not have 
adequate knowledge and as such difficult to assess.
<<<PAGE=78>>>
64 
 
Drawing from three closely related fields of policy studies (where policies involves politics); 
sociology (where ideology and social norms influence knowledge creation) and philosophy of 
sciences (dealing with causality and generalisability), Parkhurst (2017) argues that hierarchies 
of evidence should not be used as an exclusive source of evidence but rather as part of a tripod 
with the two other legs being values and context.  
Head (2010) itemized the challenges confronting the adoption of a hierarchy especially the 
RCTs in social policy development as: 
1. The difficulty of applying RCTS in the social policy, especially sensitive areas. 
2. The difficulty of transferring experimental results to intricate large-scale programmes. 
3. The tendency that hierarchies would downplay the specialized and contextual 
experience of professionals.      
Based on these challenges, Head (2010) argues that the main area o f contention is the 
importance of ‘qualitative’ evidence – reflecting the values and perception of stakeholders. He 
observes that unlike the medical sciences, the premium attached to qualitative evidence vary 
across the different disciplines in the social sciences and as such disciplines like history and 
anthropology assign greater importance to qualitative evidence than disciplines like economics 
that privilege behavioural generalisations. Thus, in the social policy domain, understanding the 
prevailing context is critical and as such the search for evidence should not be based on some 
rigid construct but rather on different methods that best provides answers to policy challenges 
(Head, 2010). 
To summarise, the disparate hierarchies highlighted in the foregoing paragraphs clearly 
reiterate that the status of evidence is contentious to policymakers and practitioners even where 
they belong to the same camp. The differences in the hierarchies show that despite the growing 
commitments of governments and non -state EBP champions in the social policy domain, the 
status of the different forms of evidence is far from settled as policymakers attach values to 
evidence based on their subjective world views and orientations.    
2.8.4.3 The Use of Evidence in Policymaking  
The way evidence influences policy has received significant scholarly attention. Consistently, 
social scientists and policymakers are becoming more interested in the place of evidence in 
policy and practice. The two demographics, however, differ in their basic orientation. While
<<<PAGE=79>>>
65 
 
social scientists are interested in making their research more impactful to policy development, 
policymakers are concerned with making more effective policies in the f ace of the resource 
limitations they face.  
Interestingly, despite the generally held view that evidence enriches policymaking, and the 
continuous commitments of promoters of the use of evidence in policymaking, instances of full 
utilization of evidence in  policymaking are rare. Rather, the literature is replete with 
commentaries of how evidence is either partially used or fully ignored sometimes to the dismay 
of the producers of such evidence (Head, 2010). In some cases, evidence is only partially used 
in the development of policies even after such policies are designated as evidence based. The 
statement of Michael Howard at the conference of the Conservative Party in 1993 that “‘prison 
works’ was based on flimsy evidence at best” is seen in this light (Nut ley and Davies, 2000a, 
p.105).  
In other cases, evidence is used to legitimize an idea or a proposal, or to provide political 
support to an already decided issue (Clarence, 2002). This reality is responsible for the 
pejorative term ‘policy-based evidence’ (Banks, 2009, p.114), the idea that often evidence is 
used for political or symbolic purposes to support a pre-selected policy decision or action. Also, 
many at times, policies are developed in direct conflict with available evidence. For instance, 
in the education sector, the UK government in an attempt to improve learning outcomes, 
specified minutes to be spent per evening on homework by pupils/students of primary and 
secondary respectively even though the trials conducted did not show benefits for primar y 
school pupils (Fitz -Gibbon, 2000). The conclusion of Jonathan Breckon, Director of the 
Alliance for Useful Evidence, that despite having a world -class social research base, research 
evidence plays a minor role in the development of UK policies reflects these realities (Dunton, 
2016). 
However, while disappointments about the inability of EBP to fulfil the promises of its 
promoters are real and useful in interrogating the factual value of EBP in policymaking, some 
of the disappointments often arise from an exaggerated expectation of the benefits of evidence, 
and more specifically, research evidence, in the policymaking process. A key lesson for all 
those involved in EBP is that while evidence is a key factor in the policy-making process, alone 
it is incapabl e of determining policy outcomes (Beerkens, 2018;  Freiberg and Carson, 2010; 
Nutley and Davies, 2000b). Evidence is, therefore, employed by policymakers with due regard 
to the prevailing circumstances which outsiders, including researchers, may not be priv y to.
<<<PAGE=80>>>
66 
 
Nutley, et al., (2007, p.303) brilliantly echo this thinking when they remarked that available 
forms of evidence are not adopted but instead “adapted to fit local concerns and needs.” 
Commenting in a similar way, the intervention of Geoff Mulgan and Jill Rutter is apt:  
“Democratically elected politicians have the right to ignore evidence, and it may be wise to 
disagree with the experts. It is Parliament, not professors, that is sovereign. But we think it 
would be healthy to cultivate a climate in which politicians should have to say why they ignore 
evidence, or decide to go against it. The key is that although decision makers are entitled to 
ignore evidence, they are not entitled to be ignorant of it.” (Alliance for Useful Evidence, 2015, 
p.5) 
As we have stressed so far, the policymaking environment is inherently contested and messy, 
precluding linear evidence – policy equation. The policymaking environment is for most part 
in a state of flux, involving a mixture of objectivity, rationality, politics,  and values. 
Policymaking often involves advocacy and compromises with only a negligible part of 
decisions based on technical evidence (Weiss, 1979). C onsequently, “the study of the use of 
evidence in policy varies from negative to positive advocacy, from simplistic to complex 
understandings of the processes involved, from uncritical technical approaches to highly 
cynical commentary” (Oliver et al., 2014, p.2). 
Meanwhile, Nutley et al., (2002) argue that four requirements are necessary for evidence to 
impact policy and practice:   
1. Shared understanding on what is considered evidence. 
2. A robust approach for the creation and preservation of evidence.   
3. Effective evidence transfer and the development of mechanism to provide wide access 
to evidence knowledge.  
4. Initiatives to promote the utilization of evidence.    
The extent to which evidence contributes to policy largely depends on the policy domain in 
question (Head, 2008; 2014). Where a policy issue is ‘technical’, it is most likely that evidence 
would play a more contributory role than where the issue is general (Beerkens, 2018). In such 
technical areas, evidence is provided and used by the core policymakers and the integrity of 
the information largely depends on judgements arrived at on the basis of specialised knowledge 
and experience (Head, 2014). These ‘closed’ areas include national defence and foreign affairs 
(Head, 2014; Hogwood and Gum, 1984) and monetary policy (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009).
<<<PAGE=81>>>
67 
 
Other related areas are science and technology, information technol ogy, medicine, and 
pharmaceuticals (Head, 2014).  
In contrast, some policy domains are considered less technical, such as education, social 
security, citizenship, and community health, where there are multiple sources of evidence 
including the public (Head, 2014). Most of the evidence-based social research conducted in the 
UK, US, Australia, and New Zealand falls within these socially and politically contested areas 
where values are often more influential than research evidence (Head, 2014). These problems 
are sometimes called ‘wicked’ problems in the literature partly because stakeholders view them 
differently in terms of causes and possible solutions (Johns, 2008) and partly because they have 
a relatively long history (Ferlie et.al., 2011). As a result, the use of limited evidence to address 
wicked problems has proved unsuccessful and recognition of broad stakeholder input is seen 
as a more viable alternative (Turnpenny et al., 2009). Generally, “our ideas about ‘evidence -
based’ policy may change character as we move from a technical approach towards a more 
relational approach” (Head, 2008, p.2). This means the more technical a policy domain is, the 
less open and amenable it is to multiple stakeholder participation, and the reverse is the case 
where a policy area is less technical.  
2.8.4.4 Typology of Research Utilisation 
So far, this thesis has demonstrated that various factors influence the use of evidence in 
policymaking and the entire policy process in general. One of the most discussed topic in the 
literature is the influence of research on policy. Indeed, it has long been established that the 
notion that research influences policy in a linear manner is naïve and as such inadequate to 
explain the relationship between research and policy (Freiberg and  Carson, 2010). In this 
regard, a number of scholars have rejected the notion that research should be the cornerstone 
of policy and practice. One of the most prominent scholars in this class is Martin Hammersley 
(2005a, 2005b). He argued that policymaking and practice cannot realistically be based on 
research, in part because researchers and policymakers possess contrasting orientation. 
Explaining further, he states that what the two parties consider as useful knowledge are often 
sharply different which mak es EBP unattainable.  This limitation has been recognized in the 
literature (Head, 2010) and can be addressed through the adoption of consensual research 
approach where policymakers and researchers agree on what the issue is and how it can be 
tackled (Nutle y et al., 2007). Nevertheless, Hammersley (2005b) further argued that 
researchers do not have the capacity to provide all the information policymakers need while
<<<PAGE=82>>>
68 
 
policymakers do not have the luxury of time required for rigorous research, thereby creating a 
fundamental mismatch. Central to Hammersley’s caution is the concept of bounded rationality 
which emphasizes that often policymakers are restricted to obtain only limited information 
before they make policies or decisions. Thus, it is questionable whether  EBP minimizes the 
formulation of wrong policies or improves decision making (Hammersley, 2005a). 
He further cautioned that while making policy research -based provides some benefits to both 
the research community and up takers of research, it risks distort ing research in the following 
ways: 
• The abuse of research to support preferred policies.  
• Reduction of funds for research not related to policy priority areas. 
• Increase in the number of research that attempt to answer unrealistic questions. 
• Reduction of turn-around times for research with the associated decline in research 
quality (Hammersley, 2005b) 
He, therefore, concludes that: 
“…the notion of research-based policymaking and practice is a myth. Of course, it may be a 
myth that many researc hers feel it is in their interests to preserve. But they are wrong. The 
medium term, and perhaps even the short term, consequences of this myth are likely to be 
damaging, not only for research but also for policy and practice” (Hammersley, 2005b, 
p.328). 
For Atkinson (2000) as for Elliott (2001) a focus on ‘what works’ ignores the role theories play 
to shape policy and practice. Elliott (2001) argues that the ‘positivistic assumptions’ inherent 
in the EBP is an attempt to substitute the ‘enlightenment model ’ of research with the 
‘engineering model’ with a potentially negative implication on socialization, which is a critical 
success factor in social policy and practice. In the educational sector, what the ‘engineering 
model’ does is to disregard the socio -cultural peculiarities in the teacher -student relationship 
which closes “the door that leads to new possibilities” (Atkinson, 2000, p.328). He further 
argues that contrary to the assumptions of EBP advocates, it is not evidence but theory that 
influences pedagogy and teachers’ actions.   
Atkinson (2000) maintains that most of the notable educational theorists did not conduct 
empirical research neither can their research be classified as a search for ‘what works’, yet their 
work continues to shape educational policy and practice. Yet, for all its rhetoric, EBP, is
<<<PAGE=83>>>
69 
 
incapable of generating research evidence that is “decisive and conclusive” in the future 
(Elliott, 2001, p.556). 
Generally, many empirical studies have demonstrated that the use of research and evidence in 
policymaking is not as straightforward as it is presented. Often, policies are impacted in subtle 
and delicate ways (Nutley  et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the main goal is to provide a more 
informed and a more reliable information for the use of policymakers and practitioners (Head, 
2010). Consequently, Nutley et al., (2007, p.36) highlight the distinction between instrumental 
and conceptual research utilization. They argue that instrumental utilization “refers to the direct 
impact of research on policy and practice decisions”. They explained that this way, it attempts 
to isolate the impact of a specific research in shaping a specific policy or practice. This notion 
of direct research -policy nexus is the dominant view in the l iterature (Freiberg and Car son, 
2010; Weiss, 1979). Conceptual utilization on the other hand is a far -reaching description of 
research use, covering a variety of indirect ways through which research impacts the attitude 
and aptitude of policymakers and practitioners ( Nutley et al., 2007). This is generally a 
“consciousness-raising” research role which is nevertheless as important as, and empirically 
more feasible than, the role played by the instrumental research utilization in policy 
development (Nutley et al., 2007). Inter estingly, policymakers have emphasized the 
“conceptual value of evidence” by way of improving their understanding of critical issues, 
challenging accepted knowledge, promoting informed debate, and engendering more effective 
policies (Nutley et al., 2007, p.37).  
Weiss (1979) has developed a highly influential and sophisticated typology of research 
utilization which offers links between research and policy as follows: 
1. The knowledge-driven model: In this model, research is conducted in anticipation of 
utilization in the policy community. The notion is that research leads policy (Freiberg 
and Carson, 2010; Young et al., 2002) meaning research generates knowledge that 
motivates uptake in the development of policy and practice. An “element of scientific 
inevitability” exists with the expert ‘on top’ driving the transformation of research into 
policies or practice (Young, et al., 2002, p.216). This model is thought to be more 
suitable for research into science and technology innovations (Nutley et al., 2007; 
Young, et al., 2002). 
2. The problem-solving model: Under this model, research provides the knowledge to 
solve an identified problem. R esearch in this model follows policy and as such it is
<<<PAGE=84>>>
70 
 
policy that informs research priorities (Freiberg and Carson, 2010; Young, et al., 2002). 
Unlike the knowledge-driven model, here, experts are ‘on tap’, contributing to policy 
development and practice (Young, et al., 2002). Policymakers and researchers agree on 
the expected outcome and research provides ideas to achieve that outcome.  
3. The interactive model: This involves a complex kind of interconnectedness among 
numerous participants in the policy community. Policymakers search for knowledge 
from multiple sources including researchers, politicians, planners, friends, journalists,  
and interest groups. The process is not linear but consultative, iterative, and chaotic 
with progress expectedly gradual ( Nutley et al., 2007). Any member of the policy 
community can be influential, depending on the value they are bringing to the table, 
and often it is difficult to identify who is more influential (Young, et al., 2002). 
4. The political model: In this model, research is used by policymakers to strengthen 
decisions already taken, or in some cases, to falsify the position of the opposition. Thus, 
research “becomes ammunition for the side that finds its conclusions congenial and 
supportive” (Weiss, 1979, p.429). This politically motivated use of research is in part 
responsible for the evolution of the pejorative term “policy-based evidence” (Marmot, 
2004, 906). 
5. The tactical model: Unlike other models, the goal of this model is only to show that 
research is being conducted. For instance, where a government is inundated with calls 
for a particular action, it may respond by saying: “We're doing research on it right now” 
(Weiss, 1979, p.429). By conducting research or funding one, government may avoid 
taking any action on an issue (Nutley et al., 2007). This model, therefore, bears some 
resemblance with the political model as both are used one way or another to strengthen 
position of governments or their inaction (Young et al., 2002). 
6. The enlightenment model: For this model, research findings are not meant to directly 
influence policymaking but to, overtime, provide conceptual and theoretical 
perspectives which policymakers imbibe and use to shape their thinking of policy 
problems and solutions. “It seems to promise that, without any special effort, truth will 
triumph” (Weiss, 1979, p.430). For this reason, this model is more aligned with the 
notion of ` evidence informed', than `evidence -based', policy making (Young, et al., 
2002, p.217). 
7. Research as part of the intellectual enterprise of the society:  The final model of research 
utilization is where governments provide funds for research into new issues of societal 
interest, particularly those that become fashionable. Researchers are, therefore, invited
<<<PAGE=85>>>
71 
 
to “develop and reconceptualise the issue” (Nutley et al., 2007, p.40). This way, 
research and policy are mutually influencing with each being influenced by the larger 
social context (Weiss, 1979). 
The typology has demonstrated that the extent to which research, and more generally evidence, 
influences policy varies based on the nature of the policy in reference and the attitude of the 
policymakers. Thus, contrary to the widely held notion that research (and evidence) influence 
policy in a linear way, many studies have found that they do so indirectly (Nutley et al., 2007). 
Indeed, research evidence is deployed based on the need of policymakers which invariably 
means it is used in different ways. To illustrate, the value of research evidence in the problem-
solving model is remarkably different from its value in the po litical model. As explained by 
Nutley et al., (2007, p.59), translating research evidence into policy or practice often requires 
“refinement and adaptation.”  
2.9 POLICYMAKING VENUE 
2.9.1. An Overview of the Iron Triangle Model 
The iron triangle model, dev eloped in the USA in the 1950s and 1960s tells a story of how a 
triumvirate of legislators, bureaucrats, and interests groups cooperate to develop public policies 
(Gais et al., 1984; Jordan, 1981). The group secure mutual benefits from the arrangement and 
as such is incentivised to maintain the status quo which means dominating and controlling the 
policy process (Gais et al., 1984). As a result, gaining access into the triangle is difficult even 
by a president (Jordan, 1981). For instance, the perceived inc ompetence of president Carter 
was largely based on his inability as an “outsider” to access the established iron triangle in 
Washington; the same triangular relationship “came as a rude shock” to President Nixon (Gais 
et al., 1984, p.161). Under the iron triangle arrangement, policies are segmented into different 
domains suggesting that policies are made in “subsystems” (Jordan, 1981, p.99). The triangle, 
therefore, highlights those who generate and utilise evidence in policymaking.    
According to Freeman (1955), the model illustrates mutually beneficial relationships: the 
legislators cultivate a good relationship with the interest groups to gain electoral support; the 
bureaucrats provide information and expertise to politicians in retu rn for increased budgetary 
allocations; interest groups are appeased by bureaucrats in exchange for improvement in the
<<<PAGE=86>>>
72 
 
provision of public goods. In all, the “triangle” is responsible for problem definition and 
collation as well as the analysis of evidence (Hayden, 2002). 
In the event of a disagreement among the members of the triangle, they try to arrive at a 
compromise to avoid attracting external intervention.   
2.9.2. Bureaucracy  
The bureaucracy is an integral part of modern government all over the world. It has become “a 
widespread, almost universal, phenomenon covering democracies as well as communist and 
right-wing authoritarian regimes” (Subramaniam, 1985, p.199). The importance of the 
bureaucracy to the policymaking process has increased over the y ears because of the role it 
plays in policymaking and implementation. The unprecedented rise in governmental 
obligations and the inadequate capacity of elected politicians to fulfil those obligation has 
invariably led to the growing involvement of the bureaucracy in policymaking (Rowat, 1985). 
Whereas the poor demand more governmental responsibility in the provision of housing, 
education, health, and employment, the rich require more state subsidization and other forms 
of interventions (Subramaniam, 1985). Although bureaucrats are formally considered as 
subservient to the elected politicians, the question is often asked as to whether they are “on top 
rather than on tap” because of the significant influence they wield in policymaking (Rowat, 
1985, p.89).     
This has led to tension and an ongoing debate about whether the rise and expansion of the 
bureaucracy is a good thing (Rashid, 2014). It has been argued that the rise is antithetical to 
representative democracy since bureaucrats develop policies instead o f elected politicians 
(Lowi, 1969). Supporters of big governments, however, argue that the increasing demand of 
public goods by the citizens have necessitated the need for a large bureaucracy (Bell and 
Hindmoor, 2019). Regardless of the ideological debate,  what is not in doubt is that the 
bureaucracy has become a central figure in the generation of evidence for policy development 
and implementation on account of superior expertise and the inability of elected officials to 
meet the growing demands of the cit izens. Yet, the bureaucracy and the legislature may use 
the same evidence differently owing to the difference in their orientation and goals.
<<<PAGE=87>>>
73 
 
2.9.3. Legislature 
The legislature is one of the components of the iron triangle model. In a democracy, the 
constitution bestows important policymaking functions on the legislature as the direct 
representatives of the people. The legislature has over time developed its policymaking 
mechanisms, one of which is the committee system. Committees reflect what legislatures 
consider as strategic policy domains and are responsible for the detailed consideration of policy 
alternatives. A committee can be either a standing (permanent) one with ongoing 
responsibilities or a non -standing (ad hoc) one created to address a specific matter (Mattson 
and Strøm, 1995) 
Although committees are answerable to the larger legislature and do not have the final authority 
on Bills, they are very influential in deciding whether a Bill is ultimately passed or not. They 
are responsible for drafting proposals and fine-tuning them to fit available evidence and reality; 
and undertake oversight on the executive arm of government (Halligan, 2008).   
Using specific comparative time series datasets from the US (1956 to 2011) and the UK (1997 
to 2014), Bevan  et al., (2019) demonstrate that the committees respond to problems across 
various policy domains. They also found that the committees are not encumbered by the 
constraints obtainable in other policymaking venues. The emergence and expansion of 
organised interest groups, however, weakens the influence of the legislature on policymaking 
as the legislators are compelled to yield to some of their policy preferences (Hendriks and Kay, 
2019). 
2.9.4. Interest Groups                 
According to Gilens and Page (2 014), the theories of interest groups originated from James 
Madison’s argument that struggles among the different groups in a republic would ultimately 
lead to policies that represent the interests of the whole citizenry and defeat oppressive policies. 
The importance of interest groups in policymaking has continued to rise in the last few decades 
with governments granting more access to well-organised interest groups (Lowi, 1969; Gilens 
and Page, 2014; Jordan, 1981). In their policymaking responsibilities, the bureaucracy obtains 
expertise and feedbacks from interest groups to improve policymaking. Usually, interest 
groups are ‘experts’ in their traditional areas of concern and the bureaucrats and the legislature 
tend to depend on this expertise since it is costly for them acquire such expertise ( Culpepper,
<<<PAGE=88>>>
74 
 
2010). In addition, legislators tend to be amenable to interest groups for electoral support 
(Freeman, 1955). 
In a loose sense, there are two types of interest groups: the public interest group which 
represents the interests of all citizens, and the sectional interest group, where the interests of a 
specific group of people dominate (Gilens and Page, 2014). Interest groups could also be 
classified along other characteristics such as profession, location, an d sex. It is worth noting, 
however, that both the bureaucracy and particularly the legislature reserves the right to accept, 
amend, or even reject the evidence provided by the interest groups since the ultimate 
responsibility for policymaking rests with them.   
2.9.5. Criticisms of the Iron Triangle 
Although the iron triangle presents a simple and insightful story about how three influential 
policy actors shape the policy process and outcome within a rigidly controlled environment, it 
has come under intense  criticism. One major criticism is that it oversimplifies the policy 
process to the point of trivialising it (Browne, 1995). It has been argued that even earlier 
literature acknowledged more complexity in policymaking than described by the iron triangle 
model (Jordan, 1981). Commenting on the model, Heclo attacked the model as being 
“disastrously incomplete” ( Gais et al., 1984, p.162). He argued that “…Looking for closed 
triangles of control, we tend to miss the fairly open networks of people that increasin gly 
impinge upon government”, suggesting networks theories as alternative explanation to how 
policies are made. Of course, other theories have sprung up to illustrate the waning influence 
of the iron triangle and to offer convincing alternatives. To be sure, theories like the ACF, PET, 
and the multiple streams (discussed in earlier parts of this section), have all offered credible 
alternative explanations to the policy process. The key message of these alternatives is that 
policies are developed not by the triad of legislators, bureaucrats, and interest groups but rather 
by a wider and more variegated policy actors in a complex political environment.        
2.10. EVIDENCE INTEGRATION SITES  
The concept of evidence integration sites is not common in the EBP li terature. However, 
literature suggests a number of “‘venues’ in which policymaking takes place” (Cairney and 
Oliver, 2017, p.5). For instance, Bevan, et al. (2019, p.1562) tell us that the legislative 
committees “gather and assimilate evidence on issues that are currently on the decision-making
<<<PAGE=89>>>
75 
 
agenda”. Other scholars who view legislative committees as policymaking venues are 
Hendriks and Kay (2019) and Goodin (2005, p.188) with the latter mentioning that legislative 
committees undertake “creative, cooperat ive work”. In addition, some scholars point to 
stakeholder meetings as policymaking venues. Fraussen et al. (2020) and Onwujekwe et.al 
(2021) agree with Nabatchi (2012, p.704), that stakeholder meetings give “voice to multiple 
perspectives and different in terests, allowing for more thoughtful decisions (Beierle and 
Cayford 2002; Sirianni 2009)". Advisory committees have also been identified as 
policymaking venues. Groux et al., (2018, 1) assert that “in the era of evidence -informed 
decision making, policymakers increasingly seek scientific advice via scientific advisory 
committees (SACs)”. Onwujekwe et.al (2021) and Lavertu and Weimer (2011) have also 
expressed similar sentiments.   
On the strength of the foregoing, coupled with some insights from the various models and the 
theories we have examined so far in the literature review (for instance, iron gate triangle 
identifies legislative committees as a key site for evidence integration; punctuated equilibrium 
theory sees ideas as important in bringing about policy change; advocacy coalition framework 
is a multi-stakeholders approach to policymaking), I tease out the following sites of evidence 
integration for further analysis: advisory committees, l egislative committees, s takeholder 
meetings. These sites are some of the important places “where the action is” (Cairney and 
Oliver, 2017, p.5).  
2.10.1. Advisory Committees 
Governance and policy literature indicates that go vernments adopt different strategies, 
mechanisms, and tools to govern (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009). One of the fastest-growing tools 
of modern policymaking is the use of advisory committees (Lavertu and Weimer 2011). 
Advisory committees are established to pro vide policy advise and evidence to government in 
particular policy domains. They are classified based on different characteristics such as 
functions and composition and are generally divided into scientific advisory committees 
(SACs) and hybrid advisory committees (HACs).  
The SACs, which are the more popular of the two, comprised solely of academics who offer 
research-based advice to policymakers (Krick 2015). Groux et al., (2018), however, expand the 
personnel for the SACs to include non-academics provided they possess the required expertise,
<<<PAGE=90>>>
76 
 
and their advice is based on research evidence. Non-academics can also be members of SACs 
if in addition to their expertise, they are non-partisan (McComas at al., 2015). 
  
It has been argued that SACs are an offshoot  of the ongoing push for the entrenchment of 
evidence in policymaking. The main function of the SACs is, therefore, to provide expertise 
and research-based evidence to improve policymaking. To enhance understanding, Groux et 
al., (2018) developed a typology of SACs that categorises them along six main dimensions as 
follows: 
  
⚫ The sectoral dimension differentiates SACs based on the different fields they operate in 
such as food, health, and environment. Other field include education, trade, human rights 
etc. 
⚫ Level of operation: This identifies the jurisdiction: subnational, national, or international. 
⚫ Permanence: This highlights variation in terms of longevity, for example whether the 
SACs are established as ad hoc committees or as standing committees. 
⚫ Target audience, which deals with whether the final user of the committees’ advice is the 
commissioning institution or another external institution. 
⚫ Degree of independence, which categorises SACs based on their level of autonomy. Are 
they influenced by non-scientific considerations or external influence?       
⚫ Nature of advice, distinguishing SACs that offer prescriptive advice from those that offer 
descriptive advice. 
  
Generally, SACs offer scientific and technical evidence to governments based on research.  
Considering the expertise and experience of SACs, which governments lack, their evidence are 
respected and often utilised by governments in policy development. It is important to point out 
that beyond giving advice, SACs also develop and issue policies on  behalf of governments or 
the commissioning institution (Burda, et al., 2014). 
  
The HACs, on the other hand are established by government and comprises scholars, societal 
representatives, and government representatives (Lavertu and Weimer, 2011). Unlike t he 
SACs, the HACs give policy -making guidance and advice based on experience, reasoning, 
discussions, debates, and political considerations (Ashford, 1984; Brown, 2008). Two main 
versions of hybrid advisory committees are identified in the literature: full  hybrid advisory
<<<PAGE=91>>>
77 
 
committees comprising public and private sector players, and quasi -hybrid advisory 
committees, composed of public sector players from different departments (Krick, 2015).  
  
The use of both the hybrid and quasi -hybrid advisory committees h ave increased in the last 
decade. Krick (2015) analysed four empirical case studies from Germany to demonstrate the 
growing influence and dynamics of HACs. They are also becoming widely used in developing 
countries. Onwujekwe et.al., (2021) reviewed the development of 25 policy documents relating 
to urban development in Nigeria and found that HACs were used in the development of some 
of the policies.    
  
Like the SACs, the HACs are established essentially to give value-adding advice and evidence 
to policymakers. Unlike the SACs, however, the advice and evidence offered by HACs are not 
entirely based on research or technical knowledge as political considerations and inputs from 
interested stakeholders are considered by SAC members. In that regard, the y provide the 
government or the commissioning institution with multiple forms of evidence with a view to 
selecting appropriate options (Ashford, 1984; Brown 2008). Consequently, hybrid committees, 
on account of the different interests of members, contribut e to improving the legitimacy and 
acceptability of policies (Ashford 1984; Brown 2008; Rowe and Frewer, 2000). It has been 
observed that to improve the quality of their advice and input in the policy process, advisory 
committees create sub-committees within them to either serve as working groups or engender 
better focus (Krick 2015; Onwujekwe et.al., 2021). While the sub -committees have the 
autonomy to work independent of the larger committee, final decisions are arrived at by 
consensus (Coleman, 1994; The LSE GV314 Group, 2018). 
  
To summarise, the SACs and the HACs, regardless of whether they are hybrid or quasi-hybrid, 
are established to give advice and evidence in respect of policymaking, or to develop policies 
themselves (Burda, et al., 2014; Krick, 2015; Winickoff and Brown, 2013). Also, while SACs 
offer scientific evidence to governments based on research, HACs provide more generic and 
politically sensitive evidence. Since governments lack the expertise of SACs, their evidence is 
often accepted as the “gospel truth” by the government to reduce cost and to escape liability if 
something goes wrong.
<<<PAGE=92>>>
78 
 
 2.10.2. Legislative Committees   
A settled notion in legislative literature is that the legislators play a key role in the development 
of policies (Geys, 2013; Phadnis 2021; Wonka, 2017). Elected legislators play three crucial 
roles: policymaking, legislative oversight, and performing constituency service (Piscopo and 
Franceschet, 2022). Part of the legislators’ tasks is to be responsive to the demands and 
aspirations of their constituencies. As enunciated by Fenno (2013, p.8), “representing a 
constituency requires work by each elected politician in identifying problems and in 
negotiating relationships that are attentive to, and supportive of, constituent ha bits, 
expectations, and preferences”. 
In doing this, legislators obtain and utilise a large amount of variegated evidence for their 
policymaking duties. Whereas they personally obtain some evidence by themselves, a large 
amount of the evidence is provided by interested stakeholders or organisations commissioned 
by the legislators to do so.    
For example, Sanni et al.’s (2016) research shows that both federal and state lawmakers in 
Nigeria personally obtained and harmonised numerous types of evidence in the  production of 
their desired policies. Similarly, an empirical study by Mosley and Gibson (2017) found that 
an influential stakeholder organisation provided an array of scientific and non -scientific 
evidence to legislators in the development of foster care  laws policies in California in 2010. 
With such abundant information, limited time and scarce financial resources, the legislators 
need to prioritise some problems over others (Bevan et al., 2019). Committees play an 
important role in this regard hence the y have become a central topic in the study of political 
economy (Berry and Fowler, 2018; Bevan, et al., 2019).    
Also, committees are responsible for drafting proposals and fine -tuning them in a meticulous 
manner (Halligan, 2008). Although the committees constitute “a site of formal elite 
deliberation”, they consider the voices of those who are neither experts nor influential in their 
deliberations and as such work with different kinds of contradictory evidence (Hendriks and 
Kay 2019, p.28). The complexities and uncertainties surrounding policymaking (Ravetz 1999) 
and the absence of any formal process for committees to determine what is valid evidence and 
what is not (Turnpenny et al., 2013) make their work challenging but impactful (Goodin, 2005). 
This means the committees play a critical role in not only obtaining evidence from a variety of
<<<PAGE=93>>>
79 
 
sources but also in the determination of which evidence and proposals are to be accepted or 
rejected (Goodin, 2005).  
Notwithstanding the highlighted importance of the legislature, particularly the committees in 
policymaking, a large tranche of literature argues that political parties are the most influential 
institutions in shaping legislative outcomes in what is general ly known as partisan theories 
(Patterson 1963; Peabody, 1967). The overarching thesis of the theories is that political parties 
have a significant hold on their legislators’ behaviour in relation to policymaking (Owens, 
2003).  
In this regard, the legislat ors are seen as purposive - they uphold the preferences of the party 
as “part of an explicit exchange process that trades off individual preferences against the 
organizational goal of greater unity” (Crowe,1986, p.165). Party leaders are recognised to have 
the power to reward acceptable conduct of legislators and punish unacceptable conducts (Cox 
and McCubbins 1993, 2005; Crowe 1986). The implication of this is that legislators vote along 
party lines regardless of what the evidence says to them. This impact s the legislators’ 
behaviours in the evidence generation and integration process which invariably affects policy 
outcomes.  
A number of empirical studies support the purposive thesis. They include Opello’s (1986) 
study of the Portuguese national legislatur e and Crowe’s (1986) examination of the British 
House of Commons. The common finding of these studies is that parties are the major 
determinants of legislative outcomes. For emphasise, Opello (1986, 313) argued that political 
parties “have gradually conque red more and more of its terrain and have come to control its 
every operation”. For Crowe, (1986, p.181), “party loyalty remains the most important norm” 
within the legislature. Similarly, Cox and McCubbins (2005) noted that parties are tools for re-
election and have the power to persuade or coerce legislators into submission. A counter 
argument to the notion of purposiveness is contained in the pivotal politics theory (PPT) which 
presumes that policymakers vote sincerely (Dziuda and Loeper, 2018) and presents the parties 
as weak (Cox and McCubbins, 2005). Thus, the texture of legislators’ behaviours as regards 
the generation of evidence changes as we move from the partisan theories to the pivotal politics 
theories.    
Another insightful explanation of the factors that shape lawmakers’ behaviour in policymaking 
can be found in the assumptions of the public choice theory. The theory ‘applies the techniques
<<<PAGE=94>>>
80 
 
and analytic apparatus of modern economics to the study of political processes’ (Brennan and 
Buchanan, 1985, pp. x–xi). Its central argument is that the political person, whether legislator, 
voter or bureaucrat, behave in a self -centred manner, hence Buchanan’s description of the 
theory as “politics without romance” (Buchanan, 2003, p.16). This means the legi slators, 
voters, and bureaucrats, are typically not driven by noble ideals but the pursuit of their self -
interest (Oudenampsen and Mellink, 2022). This suggests that these players attach less 
importance to evidence and more to their self-interest. It also suggests that they are more likely 
to accept an evidence that suits their self -interest even if it goes against the public good. As 
such it may not be surprising if they discountenance a piece of evidence that the majority views 
as useful once it conflicts with their self-interest.    
Thus, at the base of the theory is the notion that people acting politically behave in the same 
way they do when they act economically - they are concerned about rational self-interest. The 
major motivation of legislators, the  argument goes, is not to develop policies for the good of 
the electorates but to achieve their self -interested objectives (Buchanan, 2003; Immergut, 
2008; Leeson and Thompson 2021; Karadimas, 2022; Phadnis 2021). As Mccarthy (2021, 
p.113) points out, what the legislators do is to “formulate policies to gain office” and not the 
other way round.  
Like other theories, the public choice theory has received its fair share of criticisms. A 
recurring criticism is that it disregards the power relationship in both the markets and politics 
in defence of prevailing societal injustice (Meadowcroft, 2014). It has also been criticised for 
been ideologically biased (Buchanan, 2003). Some scholars have also argued that contrary to 
the public choice arguments, there exist other assumptions that privilege human rationality in 
policymaking leading to the development of polices for the good of society. To these scholars, 
self-interest “is not the only ‘rationality’ available to human beings ” (Mamman, et al., 2022, 
p.7). In all,  the public choice theory has remained enduring, and its assumptions have 
engendered a rethink in respect of the factors that drive political persons. 
2.10.3. Stakeholder Meetings 
Contemporary policymaking is increasingly anchored on the consultation of va rious 
stakeholders from both the public and private sectors (Anderson, 2015; Birkland, 2011; Head 
2008; 2010; Howlett et al., 2009; John 2013; Kay 2011; Knill and Tosun, 2012; Maddison 
2012; Thomas 2001; Fraussen et al., 2020; Onwujekwe et al., 2021; Sen, 2001). The rise in
<<<PAGE=95>>>
81 
 
popularity and usage of stakeholder consultations in policymaking is as a result of a recent 
development model which proposes a new cooperative role for governments to enhance 
inclusiveness, consensus, and legitimacy (Sen, 2001). Stakeho lder consultation is also 
regarded as a key feature of good governance (Fraussen et al., 2020). Beyond these, it embodies 
instrumental advantages. As explained by Nabatchi (2012), the practice gives opportunity for 
robust discussions which encourages more effective policymaking. In summary, stakeholder 
involvement is envisaged to contribute to the generation of more information, different 
perspectives, and more extensive buy -in leading to more effective development and 
implementation of policies (Sen, 2001). 
A key concern about stakeholder consultation is the risk of elite capture, especially by business 
interests (Yackee and Yackee, 2006; Hanegraaff and Berkhout, 2019). This concern becomes 
even more worrisome since bureaucrats tend to largely require techn ical knowledge which 
businesses are more capable to provide (Fraussen et al., 2020).   
Fraussen et al. (2020) identify three types of consultation approaches: open, closed and hybrid. 
The scholars explain that in an open approach, every person or organisat ion that wishes to 
participate in the consultation process is given the opportunity to do so. The close approach 
focuses on the selection of desirable players and involves the use of tools such as workshops, 
meetings, seminars, and expert groups. Hybrid ap proach, as the name indicates, involves the 
use of both open and close consultation tools. The scholars further explained that the open 
approach tends to attract a more diverse group of stakeholders compared with the closed 
approach, yet even in the closed  approach, policymakers could involve a wide range of 
stakeholders to ensure that different interests are recognised, and relevant concerns are 
addressed.  
Like Fraussen et al. (2020), Nabatchi (2012) differentiate two types of participant selection. 
Stakeholder selection, where participation is restricted to only those who have a legitimate 
interest in a policy issue on account of their professional status or involvement in a formal 
organization. Public selection, on the other hand, offers open participation to all residents of a 
particular community. For Fraussen et al. (2020), as for Nabatchi (2012), the recognition of 
different perspectives and concerns, in part, speak to the value of stakeholder consultation in 
the policy process, regardless of the type.
<<<PAGE=96>>>

However, while the consultation approach seems more desirable, the closed one is more 
focused (Fraussen et al., 2020). A recurring tool in the closed stakeholder consultation 
approach is the stakeholder meetings, including workshops, seminars, and exper t groups. An 
important rationale for advocating these meetings is that they offer policymakers opportunities 
to process various evidence types and consider different policy options (Onwujekwe et al., 
2021; Thomas, 2001). Further, such meetings represent avenues to refine policy proposals and 
arrive at consensus (Fiest, et.al., 2022). The implication of the foregoing is that in addition to 
being consistent with the notion of good governance, and offering stakeholders a platform to 
ventilate their views, stak eholder meetings serve as venues where evidence from different 
sources is integrated into the policy process (Turnpenny et al., 2013). Yet, as we have seen, the 
way evidence is generated and utilised varies significantly across the different consultation 
approaches. While the open consultation potentially produces more evidence than the close 
consultation, governments often attach more value to the evidence that emanates from the close 
consultation based on the expertise and experiences of members. Particip ants in the close 
consultation are also more organised and influential.  
  
Although stakeholder consultation generally enriches the policy process, governments often 
tend to ignore its pronounced benefits (Rhodes, 2011). There are many instances when the UK 
government ignored the input of interest groups or even excluded them from policymaking 
(King and Crewe, 2014; Richardson, 2018). Consequently, it is appropriate to describe the UK 
policy style as “impositional” (Leiren et al., 2021, p.35). The “Westminster Model” or “British 
Political Tradition” where policies are typically developed in a hierarchical manner is, 
however, a myth and represent “what does not happen in British politics” (Cairney, 2012, 
p.231).  
 
Notwithstanding Cairney’s (2012) caution, the disregard for stakeholder views is not peculiar 
to the UK. Yadav and Bhaduri (2021) discover the absence of any interactive forum for 
government consultation with stakeholders when the government of India developed a rare new 
disease policy. Many scholars have expressed similar sentiments regarding the development of 
policies in Nigeria (see for example Ibrahim, 2004; Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021; Ajakaiye, 
2007). It has been argued that the reason for poor or lack of consultation is that the exercise is 
costly, time-consuming, and conflictual (Irwin, 2006).
<<<PAGE=97>>>
83 
 
In contrast, a tranche of the stakeholder literature document instances of extensive stakeholder 
consultation in the policy process. Marais et al., (2020) reported that the South African Mental 
Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan was approved in 201 3 after wide consultation 
with stakeholders without any government influence on either the method or use of consultation 
inputs. In a related vein, Solorio et al., (2022) shows ample evidence of indigenous consultation 
in the development of two clean energ y policies in Mexico and identified the government, 
indigenous communities, and corporations as the three main stakeholders. Similarly, Mah and 
Hills (2014) analysed the 2007 nuclear consultation exercise in the UK and observed that 
although the exercise was large in scale, it involved an extensive consultation process.  
  
Overall, the policy literature has mixed evidence of stakeholder consultation which requires us 
to be circumspect in our conclusion. In this respect, it is appropriate to moderate “extrem e 
pictures of policymaking” and instead pay more attention to the factors that facilitate or 
constrain policy development (Cairney, 2012, p.231). It is important to recognise the politics 
behind the consultation process especially governments’ power to invite or select stakeholders 
that would participate in the process. Also worthy of recognition is that governments maintain 
the responsibility to decide which evidence to project and which to mute.    
 2.11. GOVERNANCE APPROACHES  
The term ‘governance’ is bei ng used in various ways to describe a number of circumstances 
and activities. In the last few decades, scholars have focussed on the transformation from 
“government to governance” to denote the claim that governments have been “hollowed out” 
or “decentred” in public policymaking and implementation (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009, p.xiii). 
Flowing from this claim, Rhodes (2017, p.158) defines governance as “self-organizing, inter-
organizational networks”. Koch (2013, p.398) describes it as “modes of political steering and 
integration dominated by networks, overlapping roles of political and societal actors, low 
institutionalization, and a general blurring of bureaucratic demarcations”. These two 
definitions are emphasising the role of the society in governance. Othe r scholars view the 
concept differently. Bell and Hindmoor (2009, p.2) see governance as “the tools, strategies, 
and relationships used by governments to help govern”. The authors identify three approaches 
to governance: society-centred, state-centric, and state-centric relational.
<<<PAGE=98>>>
84 
 
The society -centred approach is the dominant approach and proclaims that in the last few 
decades, non-state actors have substantially marginalised governments in policymaking and 
implementation (Bevir and Rhodes, 2003; Rhodes, 20 17; Ryser et al., 2021). In the words of 
Salamon (2002, p.1): “the heart of this revolution has been a fundamental transformation not 
just in the scope and scale of government action but in its basic forms”. Under this arrangement, 
the state loses it steer ing capacity which is replaced by “ pluricentric negotiations among 
relevant and affected actors” (Sorensen and Torfing 2009, p.236). R hodes (2017, p.168) 
famously describes the development as “the hollowing out of the state” and stresses that policy 
networks make policy decisions autonomously, indicative of the move from government to 
governance. In this arrangement, the bulk of the evidence comes from non -state actors who 
dominate the governance process. Thus, while the state provides the governance platfo rm, 
participating non-state actors control and direct the process.   
The second approach which is in stark contrast to the first one is called the state-centric view 
in which governments is said to govern in a hierarchical manner, imposing their policy 
preferences on society (Hysing, 2009). Although, there are different shades to this account, the 
common denominator is that governments “operate in splendid isolation from the society they 
govern” (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009, p.xiii). Advocates of this view argue that policymaking is 
embedded in the political environment and controlled by a largely impervious government 
hierarchy (Beer, 2014; Ryser et al., 2021). Some scholars have described this kind of 
government as the “strong state” in which policies are made  in a traditional command and 
control manner (Pierre and Peters, 2000, p.25). Therefore, the state, which is insensitive to the 
views of non-state actors, serves as the only provider of evidence in policy development.  
The third approach is the state -centric relational, which is recently gaining more scholarly 
attention (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009). The main argument here is that although governments 
still undertake policy development and implementation through in a hierarc hical way, they 
have developed strategic partnerships with non -state actors to enhance their capacity and 
achieve their goals (Hysing 2009; Pierre and Peters 2000). This means the approach endorses 
the hierarchical control of the state -centric approach but also accepts the relational aspects of 
the society-centred account which focuses on a mutually beneficial relationship between the 
state non-state actors. Therefore, this view is a “portmanteau” of the state-centric and society-
centred views and asserts t hat the choice between the two is a false one (Bell and Hindmoor, 
2009). A major feature of this approach is that governments create opportunities for stakeholder
<<<PAGE=99>>>
85 
 
consultations: open, closed or hybrid to improve policy outputs and outcomes (Fraussen et al., 
2020). As a result, evidence is provided by both state and non-state actors with the state having 
more influence in the relationship.  
  
In sum, the key area of contestation among the different governance approaches is the extent 
of governments’ steering  capacity. Demonstrably, while a large body of literature holds that 
the state has been “decentred” or “hollowed out” (Sorensen and Torfing 2009; Rhodes, 2017; 
Salamon, 2002), an opposing view has been advanced by other scholars (Marinetto, 2003; 
Pierre an d Peters, 2000; Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; and Davies, 2011) who argue that the 
steering capacity of the government is alive, and in some instances expanding. This means that 
governments possess the capacity to steer and row (Osborne and Gaebler, 1992). 
  
2.11.1.  Metagovernance 
Like the term governance before it, governance scholars differ on what metagovernance means 
and what it says about the balance of power between governments and non-state actors (Stark, 
2015). According to Sørensen and Torfing (2009, p .245), “metagovernance refers to higher -
order governance transcending the concrete forms of governance through which social and 
economic life is shaped, regulated, and transformed”. They explained that it is a pragmatic 
mechanism by which policy players co ntrol various socio -economic practices to achieve 
predefined goals. Whitehead (2003, p.8) views it as “practices and procedures that secure 
governmental influence, command and control within governance regimes”.  
  
To be clear, metagovernance means the way disparate policy actors are coordinated to achieve 
set goals of policy networks or partnerships. Yet, policy scholars differ on who should 
undertake metagovernance. Whereas state -centric, and state -centric relational scholars assert 
that metagovernance is  an exclusive responsibility of governments, interactive governance 
scholars argue that metagovernance must not necessarily be performed by governments but 
instead any actor that possesses the right resources can perform metagovernance (Stark, 2015). 
Because of this conceptual divergence, the former sees metagoverance as the “government of 
governance” (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009 p.46), while to the latter, it is the “governance of 
governance” (Sørensen and Torfing, 2009, p.245).
<<<PAGE=100>>>
86 
 
2.11.2. Core Elements of Metagovernance 
 Bell and Hindmoor (2009) identify six core elements of metagovernance - the functions 
performed by governments in governance arrangements: steering, effectiveness, resourcing, 
democracy, accountability, and legitimacy. 
2.11.3. Steering 
The steer ing function involves the general strategic management of the governance 
arrangement especially as it relates to goal and rule setting, selection of participating actors, 
allocation of tasks, organisation, and coordination (Bell and Hindmoor 2009; Kjaer 20 11). 
Within any governance arrangement, governments can change the power dynamics to reflect 
their preference (Doberstein, 2013; Jessop 1997). 
2.11.4. Effectiveness 
The effectiveness of any governance arrangement to achieve its desired policy goal and 
requires two key related tasks. The first is the establishment or approval of the said goal. The 
second involves monitoring, including identifying instances of policy drift and taking 
necessary remedial actions where and when necessary (Bell and Hindmoor 2009) . Indeed, 
“network effectiveness is most likely in a resource -rich environment and is least likely in a 
resource-scarce environment” (Milward and Provan, 2000, p.368). 
2.11.5. Resourcing 
The provision of adequate resources, both financial and non -financial, is a key element of 
metagovernance. Notably, not all the required resources are expected to come from 
governments, considering that lack of adequate resources is the main reason for the 
establishment of policy partnerships (Bell and Hindmoor 2009). The g oal of metagovernance 
is best achieved through a powerful and well -resourced player (Milward and Provan, 2000). 
Governments’ relatively huge financial resources and access to an extensive professional 
bureaucracy suggest that governments supply most of the  governance resources (Bell and 
Hindmoor 2009; Rysera, et al., 2021).  
2.11.6. Democracy 
Compliance with democratic norms is a fundamental aspect of metagovernance. Although 
including non -state actors in governance is viewed by some as undemocratic (Bell a nd
<<<PAGE=101>>>
87 
 
Hindmoor, 2009), an alternative understanding indicates that such practice can strengthen 
democracy since it encourages broader public participation in policymaking, enhances the 
quality of policies, and checks potential abuse by centralised power (Fung  and Wright 2003; 
Sørensen and Torfing, 2009).  
2.11.7.  Accountability 
Accountability is a crucial feature of metagovernance since it embodies responsibility and 
control. This need becomes more compelling when non -state actors participate in governance 
arrangements (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009). Notwithstanding the horizontal nature of 
policymaking in the network arrangements, governments are held accountable by the 
electorates which in turn empowers governments to hold others within the governance 
arrangement accountable (Doberstein, 2013; Bell and Hindmoor, 2009). 
2.11.8. Legitimacy 
The legitimacy element deals with public perception of the degree of fairness of both the policy 
processes and the outcomes (Doberstein, 2013). In that regard, governance arrangem ents that 
are seen as fair, gain more support, than those that are viewed as unfair. Indeed, governments 
can enhance the input legitimacy by ensuring that political choices reflect the wishes of the 
people while the output legitimacy requires that the gove rnance arrangement performs 
creditably (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009).  
2.12. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
 
This chapter has attempted to conceptualise public policy, examining the difficulty in defining 
it. Broadly speaking, public policy was defined from two perspectives, the narrow one and the 
broad one. The narrow one involves government s making policies in a hierarchical manner, 
oblivious of societal interests . T he broad one, on the other hand, deals with government s 
making policies through  cooperation with non-state actors. The chapter also highlighted the 
lack of consensus regarding the typologies of public policy, and how scholars view them from 
the lenses of their orientations and biases. Although the theoretical debate around both concepts 
(public policy  and typologies of public policy ) complicates efforts to illuminate them, the 
debate serves an important instrumental purpose as it provides a leeway to capture a wide range 
of salient issues relating to policy and policymaking.
<<<PAGE=102>>>
88 
 
The chap ter also examined four models and theories of public policy (the policy stages, 
advocacy coalition framework, multiple streams theory, and punctuated equilibrium theory), 
and discussed some of their notable strengths and weaknesses. Importantly, the chapte r 
highlighted how evidence is generated and utilised under the models and theories. The 
discourse showed that the generation and utilisation of evidence could vary based on a number 
of factors including the type of policy in question, the politics of evide nce, and the stage of 
policymaking. To illustrate, evidence plays a more influential role in technical policies (closed 
policies) than in policies that are regarded as general (open) owing to the need for more 
specialised knowledge in the former. Thus, onl y core policymakers provide evidence for 
technical policies with a wider range of players providing evidence for non-technical policies. 
As per the politics of evidence, the chapter demonstrated that governments largely reserve the 
power to select or invit e the stakeholders they wish to participate in the stakeholder 
consultation process, which gives them a measure of control in respect of the provision and use 
of evidence. Regarding the stages, the policy formulation stage is where the highest number of 
evidence is generated in the policy process since it is the stage where policy options are 
considered while the decision-making stage is only concerned with the selection of solutions 
presented at the policy formulation stage.  
In addition, the chapter offered an overview of the EBP movement and critically examined the 
concept of evidence. Indeed, central to any analysis of EBP is understanding the term 
‘evidence’ which has remained highly contentious despite numerous scholarly attempts to 
define it. The term  ‘evidence’, like ‘public policy’ was also viewed from narrow and broad 
perspectives. The narrow perspective, which is the dominant view, considers evidence as 
research-based knowledge obtained by either governments or non-governmental organisations 
for po licymaking. In the broad perspective, evidence is viewed as a wide spectrum of 
knowledge and information obtained from both scientific and non-scientific sources including 
expert knowledge, media, and stakeholders’ inputs  for policymaking. This thesis adopts the 
broad definition not only in recognition of the limit of scientific evidence but also because of 
the belief that values, and politics play a key role in the policy process. 
The hierarchy of evidence, a notion that advocates ranking of evidence based on their perceived 
importance, was also examined in the chapter. From its beginning in the medical field, 
hierarchies of evidence have extended into the social policy domain. Several scholars have 
established one kind of hierarchy or the other. Yet, glaring differences exist in the hierarchies 
showing that the status of the different forms of evidence is contested as policymakers attach
<<<PAGE=103>>>
89 
 
values to evidence based on their subjective worldviews, orientations, and prevailing 
circumstances.    
Further, the chapter conceptualised evidence integration sites drawing from reviewed models 
and theories. It identified three sites : advisory committees, legislative committees, and 
stakeholder meetings. These sites play a critical role in generating and synthesizing different 
forms of evidence with a view to determining which evidence is to be accepted, refined, or 
rejected.  
Finally, the chapter highlighted the use of evidence in  three governance approaches: society -
centred, state -centric, and state -centric relational. Under the first approach, much of  the 
evidence is obtained from non-state actors who control and dominate the governance process. 
For the state -centric approach, the state monopolises the responsibility for the generation of 
evidence, and p olicies are developed in a hierarchical manner. Lastly, in the state -centric 
relational approach, evidence is provided by both state and non -state actors. The state is, 
however, significantly more influential than non-state actors in the relationship. 
In all, the chapter examined public policy, policy models and theories, EBP, and attempted to 
demonstrate the contested nature of evidence in the policymaking environment. It also 
attempted to show how the use of evidence varies based on a number of factors an d 
circumstances.  
The next chapter focuses on policymaking in Nigeria.

CHAPTER 3 
POLICYMAKING  IN NIGERIA 
“Nigeria is so peculiar and dramatic. Even talking about the potentials before we talk 
about the negativities, Nigeria is a nation for perpetual study. I think in Nigeria, it is 
the potential which hits people and makes them believe in Nigeria. It tends to  make 
them react when they see  potentials being wasted and it is a tragedy to see potentials 
wasted. But paradoxically, it is a realization of the existence, that positive, that keeps 
many Nigerians and even foreign people going.” 
- Wole Soyinka 
3.0. INTRODUCTION 
The previous chapter presented an overview of policymaking, and particularly the twin 
concepts of evidence and EBP. It also examined salient themes in the EBP literature for 
elucidation. This chapter focuses on policymaking in Nigeria, which typifie s a black box 
(Birkland, 2011). This chapter interrogates the dynamics of policymaking in Nigeria starting 
firstly with a brief history of the country. It then discusses policymaking in Nigeria under 
military and democratic dispensations. Next, evidence-based policymaking within the Nigerian 
context is examined. Finally, the prospects of the evidence -based movement in Nigeria is 
analysed.   
3.1. A BRIEF HISTORY OF NIGERIA 
Before the advent of British colonial rule at the turn of the twentieth century, the area referred 
to as Nigeria today was a collection of about 300 diverse communities, with different levels of 
centralization (Awe, 1999). These pre -colonial communities had their distinct systems of 
governance including economic management and conflict -resolution mechanisms. In 1900, 
Britain placed the area under its control. The control involved the unification of the Niger Coast 
Protectorate with territories controlled by the Royal Niger Company to establish the 
Protectorate of Southern Nigeria (Usman, 199 6). Six years later, the protectorate and the 
Colony of Lagos were united to form the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria 
(Umoden, 1992; Usman, 1996). At this time, the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria was a distinct 
British protectorate that cover ed the northern part of the future Nigeria (Umoden, 1992). In
<<<PAGE=105>>>
91 
 
1914, the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria were 
amalgamated to establish a single colonial entity called Nigeria. 
So, technically, there were three diffe rent amalgamations, in 1900, 1906 and 1914, with the 
last being the most prominent because it was the last administrative step to create Nigeria 
(Usman, 1996). These amalgamations were situated within the larger colonial objectives of 
Britain to exploit th e resources of its colonies. The main aim of the amalgamations was 
therefore economic exploitation (Awe, 1999) and administrative convenience (Umoden, 1992). 
Explaining further, Usman (1996) argued that the amalgamations were predicated on the need 
to secure cheap and stable source of raw materials, a market for British industries, capital for 
investment in Britain, and cheap human resources for economic and military purposes. He 
further explained that the British colonialists observed that it was more efficient to amalgamate 
the disparate colonial entities than to administer them separately.         
Nigeria got her independence from Britain in 1960 sequel to sustained liberation struggle by 
the country’s political elite. The struggle was part of a wider ind ependence movement across 
Africa at that time and the British colonialists realized that they risked forcing Nigerians to 
take arms, as some Africans had done, if the country was not granted independence as quickly 
as possible (Usman, 1996). After Independ ence, Nigeria adopted a parliamentary system of 
government with Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa becoming the first prime minister. The country 
transformed into a republic in 1963 and D r Nnamdi Azikiwe became the country’s first 
president. Amidst sundry allegati ons against the political leadership of the country, the First 
Republic was truncated by a bloody military coup in January 1966 resulting in General Johnson 
Aguyi-Ironsi becoming the country’s first military head of state (Ojo, 2006).  
The action of the co up plotters was to open a floodgate of many coups and coup attempts in 
Nigeria with significant impact on the country’s growth and development. It heralded the 
politicization of the Nigerian military and the bastardisation of governance. Ojo (2006, p.262) 
captured the foregoing sentiment rather succinctly:  
“Their coup, apart from sounding the death knell of the First Republic (1960-1966), effectively 
brought the men in “khaki” into the murky waters of Nigerian politics, thus desecrating their 
neutrality an d professionalism inherited from colonial days. Having tasted what a 
newsmagazine called the “forbidden fruit,” the military lost its innocence, and treachery, 
ethnic loyalty, and power mongering became its hallmark.”
<<<PAGE=106>>>
92 
 
Six months after the first coup, a co unter coup was staged by Northern military officers who 
felt the first coup largely targeted and killed Northern politicians. Aguyi -Ironsi, the military 
head of state and a Southerner was killed in the coup and Yakubu Gowon, a Northerner, 
emerged military head of state. Gowon ruled Nigeria from 1966 to 1975. Thereafter, Nigeria 
had six military rulers: Murtala Mohammed (1975 - 1976); Olusegun Obasanjo (1976 – 1979); 
Muhammadu Buhari (1983 – 1985); Ibrahim Babangida (1985 – 1993); Sani Abacha (1993 – 
1998) and Abdulsalami Abubakar (1998 - 1999). This means since after the ill -fated January 
1966 coup, the country was in the shackles of military dictatorship for about 29 years with a 
brief period of democracy in the Second Republic from 1979 to 1983 and a short-lived interim 
government headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan that lasted 82 days (Ojo, 2006). 
Abdulsalam Abubakar midwifed the country’s return to democracy and in 1999, he handed 
over power to Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, the winner of the country’s presidential  election. 
Subsequently, Nigeria has achieved significant mileage in its democratic journey and for the 
first time in its chequered history, the country had successive civilian to civilian transfer of 
power with Umar Musa Yar’adua (2007 – 2010); Goodluck J onathan (2010 - 2015) and 
Muhammadu Buhari (2015 – 2023). Indeed, each of these successful civilian transfers had 
strengthened belief about the survival of democracy in the country. The emergence of 
Muhammadu Buhari as the president of Nigeria in 2015 was instructive and reinforced this 
belief. Buhari was a member of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) and defeated 
the incumbent at the time, Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), the 
party that had been in power since the retur n of democracy in 1999. So, the victory of Buhari 
demystified the ‘power of incumbency’ argument in Nigeria. The term is a pejorative one 
which suggests that incumbents will not lose elections because they use their power, influence, 
and every trick in the book, including all manner of illegalities, to retain power or to make their 
anointed candidate to win an election.       
3.2. POLICYMAKING IN NIGERIA 
Nigeria operates a three-tier government structure – federal, state and local governments. The 
federal government comprises a bicameral legislature, a federal judiciary and an executive 
organ encompassing the presidency, federal ministries, departments and agencies. The country 
has 36 states and a centrally located capital. Each state is divided into local governments for 
administrative convenience (Sanni, et al., 2016) with 774 constitutionally recognized local 
governments. The three tiers have power to ma ke laws or policies as specifically provided in
<<<PAGE=107>>>
93 
 
the constitution, depending on whether the subject is on the exclusive, concurrent, or residual 
list. The focus of my research is policies developed by the federal government, otherwise 
known as national policies. 
Following Nigeria’s independence in 1960, the country designed and implemented various 
policies to improve socioeconomic growth and development (Yagboyaju, 2019). Like in other 
parts of Africa, majority of these strategies and policies were inspired by, and in many cases, 
developed by the international community especially United Nations agencies, the World 
Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the donor community (Ajakaiye, 2007; Ayuk and 
Marouani, 2007). One of the most notable examples of such externally dictated policies is the 
World Bank/IMF prescribed structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) which many African 
countries implemented during the 1980s and 1990s. In Nigeria, SAP was adopted in 1986 as a 
free-market tool aimed at improving the coun try’s resource allocation and economic 
competitiveness (Umoden, 1992). Thus, the generation and utilisation of evidence for the 
development of SAP and other national policies that were inspired by the international 
community were done with little or no input from Nigerian policymakers.   
To strengthen the point about foreign influence on African countries, El -Rufai (2013) stated 
that in the late 1980s and in the 1990s, letters of intent of Nigeria and other African countries 
seeking IMF debts were drafted b y the IMF itself indicating that the process was more of an 
imposition than cooperation. It could then be argued that countries that benefitted from the 
financial or technical support of these supranational bodies were forced to design their sundry 
national policies to conform with the conditions attached to the support given to them by their 
benefactors. The undue influence of the international community had resulted in some adverse 
policy outcomes. In many instances, the conditionalities were unfeasible, largely because they 
did not recognize local peculiarities and as such benefitting countries failed or refused to 
implement the conditions or the reform they promised (El-Rufai, 2013).  
There was the notion, however, that the unavailability of local capability was a key reason for 
the imposing disposition of the international community. Consequently, the international 
stakeholders became unwilling to accept views that were inconsistent with their criteria for 
technical or financial support to the African co untries (Ayuk and Marouani, 2007). This 
development did not go unchallenged. While some skeptics argued that the international 
community’s lack of, or limited knowledge of the country’s peculiarities considerably
<<<PAGE=108>>>
94 
 
undermined policy outcomes, others accused them of harbouring some hidden agenda (Sesan 
and Siyanbola, 2021).  
In response, the international community has begun to accord more priority to local 
peculiarities by recognizing the inputs of local interest groups. For instance, a collaborative 
effort b etween the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) and Nigeria’s Federal 
Ministry of Water Resources led to the development of Nigeria’s National Water Resource 
Master Plan in 1995 (Doro, Ehosioke and Aizebeokhai, 2020). In the same vein, the 
International Fertilizer Development Centre (IFDC) and Nigeria’s Ministry of Agriculture and 
Water Resources spearheaded the development of the country’s National Fertilizer Policy in 
2006, after an initial draft by a team of technocrats and researchers, with inp uts from a broad 
spectrum of civil society stakeholders (Aberman et al., 2009). These two examples suggest that 
the policy space is opening, and the international community is beginning to welcome more 
evidence in the development of policies they are interested in.    
Notwithstanding, the literature on policymaking shows a disconnect between research findings 
produced in Nigeria and policies developed in the country to improve service delivery 
(Ajakaiye, 2007). This indicates that research evidence produced  by local researchers are not 
duly utilised despite the convincing dictum that local peculiarities should be considered in 
policy development. The asymmetry between research and policy in Nigeria is curious because 
the country ostensibly has a significant capacity for research. With more than 80 institutions 
dedicated to policy research and training (Yagboyaju, 2019), Nigeria had one of the highest 
numbers of such institutions in Africa (Aberman, et al., 2010).  A number of reasons have been 
advanced for the disconnect between research and policy in Nigeria, notably unhealthy rivalry 
between statutory research institutions and ‘in -house’ research outfits; inadequate funding; 
policy initiation gap following presentation of research findings; and poor policy environment 
(Olomola, 2007). 
On his part, Ibrahim (2004) viewed public policymaking in Nigeria mainly within the confines 
of the Nigerian civil service. He observed that prior to independence and up till the 1980s, 
public policymaking in Nigeria was done by  a civil service that acted professionally and 
independently. Indeed, the country inherited an effective and a non-political civil service from 
Britain which remained so for a long time (El -Rufa’i, 2013). Some scholars, however, argued 
that the Nigerian ci vil service was created by the British colonialists not for service delivery 
but to facilitate the exploitation of the Nigerian colony and to maintain law and order (Fatileet

al., 2015). This suggests that the Nigerian civil service was not attuned to policymaking and its 
transformation into one anchored on service delivery was in response to the developmental 
challenges of post-independent Nigeria.  
Notwithstanding, policymaking in Nigeria can be broadly divided into two epochs: the military 
era and the democratic one.  
3.2.1. Policymaking During Military Dictatorship 
One of the most telling features of the military era is the suspension of the constitution and the 
formal structures of democratic governance, and their policymaking functions. Notably, 
successive military governments established a powerful body whose name  was altered from 
time to time with the responsibility for policymaking and implementation (Ibrahim, 2004).  
Overtime, the military rulers, using the self -reinforcing elements Joseph (1991) described as 
clientelism and prebendalism, accumulated and consolidated vast powers which they used for 
their selfish purposes. Policies were, therefore, based on the whims of military rulers instead 
of evidence. In that regard, the rulers and their acolytes became the sole providers of “evidence” 
with no one challenging or even interrogating their choices. In some instances, “evidence” was 
provided by interest groups sympathetic to the rulers or by organisations commissioned by 
them. This way, the resultant policies were ostensibly arrived at after a consideration of 
“evidence” from critical stakeholders.     
Worthy of note is the concentration of government responsibilities, particularly policy 
formulation and implementation, under the Presidency and newly created parallel public 
organisations by the military regimes (Ibrahim, 2004). Economic crisis and socio -political 
tension were, however, also considered as the reasons for the creation of the parallel 
organisations (Bangura, 1994). By and large, the practice under military regimes in Nigeria 
was to create ne w organisations and appoint loyal technocrats to head them. Invariably, the 
heads of these organisations remained subservient to the rulers with the concomitant outcome 
that all policy decisions had to be sanctioned by the rulers. Doubtless, the civil serv ice during 
this period was made pliable with its policy development and implementation function 
threatened or taken over by appointees of the military rulers. As a result , the military rulers, 
their appointees, and even their families were exclusively resp onsible for policymaking in 
Nigeria (Bangura, 1994).
<<<PAGE=110>>>
96 
 
A notable instance of such personalization of governance was during the regime of Sani 
Abacha when formal meetings for policymaking were gradually stopped and instead ministers 
and top government officials sought personal audience with Abacha, his wife, or his children 
to discuss state matters and take decisions (Ibrahim, 2004).  
Viewed within the context of the use and interpretation of evidence in policymaking, it can be 
said that those responsible for policymaking during that period viewed (or were forced to view) 
the value of ‘evidence’ from similar standpoint as the military rulers. Also, the process of using 
the ‘evidence’ w as hierarchical since only one form of ‘evidence’ - the one favoured by the  
military was used in policymaking.  
The personalisation of governance, thus, largely contributed to the weakening of institutional 
capabilities including the mainstream civil service along with its policymaking function 
interventions (Jerome, 2007). Altho ugh, Ibrahim (2004) traced the weakening in the civil 
service to the military regime of Babangida which superintended a fundamental transformation 
of Nigeria’s public administration, the weakening in the civil service, the ineffectiveness of the 
country’s civil service predated that regime. As an example, the Murtala regime had attempted 
to reform the public service in the mid -1970s, resulting in the sack of over 11,000 public 
servants (Joseph, 1991) whereas the military regime of Obasanjo had a policy to r eform the 
local government administration in the country (Shehu Musa Yar’adua Foundation, 2004).  
The need to improve the civil service in part or in whole has been a recurring decimal in Nigeria 
from pre-independence era up until the demise of military rule in Nigeria as can be seen from 
the following reform commissions: Tudor Davis Commission (1945 -1946); Morgan 
Commission (1963); Simeon Adebo (1971); Jerome Udoji (1972); Dotun Phillips (1986); and 
Allison Ayida Panel (1995). In 1999, the new civilian government inherited a civil service that 
was largely driven by personal interests rather than national interests, “short -term in vision, 
self-centred in policy formulation and corrupt in programme implementation” (El -Rufa’i, 
2013, p.323).  
Expectedly, the personalization of governance and the weakening of the civil service had an 
increasingly considerable impact on the generation of evidence and policy making generally. 
Critical policy requirements such as the provision of multiple forms of evidence, intellec tual 
rigour in synthesising them, and stakeholder consultations were either missing or significantly 
insufficient in the policymaking process. Consequently, the policies developed were neither
<<<PAGE=111>>>
97 
 
based on evidence nor developed to cater for the need of many b ut rather to satisfy the greed 
of a few, and in many cases, to perpetuate the status quo. Consequently, the country 
experienced the rise of a patrimonial state, wide-spread corruption, a burgeoning deterioration 
of institutional governance, an inefficient civil service with a cumulative adverse impact on 
public policy and allocation of public goods (Ibrahim, 2004; Lewis, 1996).  
3.2.2. The Return of Democracy 
The return of democracy in 1999 offered a new hope that policymaking would be accorded a 
place of p ride in the Nigerian public administration. During Obasanjo’s first tenure (1999 – 
2003), there were deliberate efforts to improve the policymaking process by making research 
more influential, incorporating various stakeholders particularly policy experts and academics 
into the process (Aberman et al., 2009) and strengthening democratic structures to engender 
“efficacious policymaking and policy implementation” (Ibrahim, 2004, 11). The government 
also established the Bureau of Public Service Reform in 2003 to undertake an overhaul of the 
service for optimal performance. From 1999 up to the creation of the bureau, the government 
was so serious about the reform that a cabinet minister for civil service was created (El-Rufai, 
2013). The government’s attempt was designed to improve the civil service and the bureacracy 
for effective service delivery. This is quite significant given that historical evidence shows that 
bureaucrats and the civil service were important policy players even when the policy 
environment was hostile (Fatile et al., 2015).   
With the return of democracy, three organs are largely responsible for national policymaking 
namely, the Federal Executive Council, the National Council of State and the National 
Assembly (Jerome, 2007). The Federal Exec utive Council (FEC) comprises the President, 
Vice-President, and all ministers while the National Council of State (NCS) consists of the 
President, Vice-President, all former Presidents and Heads of Government, all former Chief 
Justices of the country, hea ds of the two federal legislative houses, all the Governors of the 
states and the Attorney -General of the Federation. The National Assembly on the other hand 
comprised the senators and the House of Representative member. Policies can also be 
developed by individual ministries with inputs from other MDAs and other organised interest 
groups. FEC approval is, however, required where a policy is beyond the authority of a minister 
with selected standing committees within the FEC ensuring that relevant MDAs are consulted 
(Cabinet Affairs Office, 2014).
<<<PAGE=112>>>
98 
 
Notwithstanding these formal policymaking processes, the development of some national 
policies was still largely dictated by foreign experts with scant knowledge of the Nigeria’s 
aspirations and peculiarities resulting in a disempowerment of local expertise. Thus, contrary 
to the expectation that the return of democracy with the formal policymaking structure would 
usher in a robust policymaking arrangement, the international community still controls the 
process, including the generation of evidence. 
“The process of policy review is also more formal than real and a questionable cyclical 
trajectory has emerged. The process starts with supporters of the “new” policy from the 
international partner community paying f or foreign experts to write the new policy for the 
MDA. Government then approves the new policy and then gets the international partner to pay 
for a stakeholder’s conference to obtain “local ownership” by stakeholders. The stakeholder 
Conference is presented the new policy in the morning and is usually required to give its seal 
of approval the same day, in a context in which the stakeholders have not really had an 
opportunity to study and debate the document. Having secured “stakeholder support”, the new 
policy document is then published and circulated. The process ends with presentation of the 
policy paper to the President in front of blazing lights and television cameras with the anti -
climax being deposing the copies in the store of the Office of the Secretary of the Government 
- a funeral rite”. (Ibrahim, 2004, p.12). 
This position, as scathing as it is, has been strengthened by the views of other scholars. Sesan 
and Siyanbola (2021) for example, mentioned an instance when an individual consultant was 
contracted by the Ministry of Power to produce a draft energy policy which was then given to 
an inter-ministerial committee for review with a stakeholder suggesting that the policy was 
probably a mimicry of a similar policy in another countr y. Commenting on the same policy, 
another stakeholder was reported to have stated that: 
 “…We got an almost — 70 percent —ready document…Consensus building is one of the 
biggest challenges, across ministries, within ministries. Very difficult. If you can bui ld 
consensus across several parameters, half the battle is done” (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021, p.5). 
Both Ibrahim (2004) and Sesan and Siyanbola (2021) spoke to a growing trend in policymaking 
in Nigeria which discourages the generation of evidence from mult iple sources. In fact, more 
often than not, ideological conflicts, debate and intellectual rigour are viewed as unnecessary 
distractions that should be avoided. The justification for adopting the “fast track” approach 
seems to be the desire to circumvent the normative chaos inherent in policymaking by blunting 
conflicting perspectives. In other word, quality is sacrificed for speed. Perhaps, more disturbing
<<<PAGE=113>>>

is Ibrahim’s (2004) description of the end of the policy process as “a funeral rite” presupposing 
that policies developed were not intended to be implemented.  
Another key concern regarding policymaking in Nigeria is the notion of policy discontinuation. 
It is commonplace for a new government to discard policies of its predecessor notwithstanding 
the impact of such policies. Indeed, it does not matter whether the successive governments 
belong to the same political party. For example, the National Economic Empowerment and 
Development Strategy (NEEDS) initiated by the Obasanjo administration to run from 2004 to 
2011 was jettisoned by Yar’adua when he became president in 2007; in its stead, he introduced 
the 7-point agenda which suffered the same fate when he died in office in 2010 as the new 
president, Goodluck Jonathan, discontinued the programme and announced a new programme, 
the Transformation Agenda (Yagboyaju, 2019). Interestingly, the three presidents belonged to 
the same party, the Peoples’ Democratic Party, and one would have expected that they were 
united by the party ideology and manifesto.  
Policymaking and allocation of public goods in Nigeria since independence have considerably 
been affected by a lack of evidence (Ibrahim, 2004), deceit (Ajakaiye, 2007) clientelism and 
prebendalism (Joseph 1991), resulting in the personalization of the policy process and elevation 
of ad hoc interventions (Jerome, 2007).  
Culture has also been identified as a contributory factor in shaping Nigerian policymakers’ 
perspectives (Osemeke and Osemeke, 2017). As elucidated by Chuka (2012, 272), “ one’s 
actions, altitude towards things and indeed the whole of one’s world view is measured by how 
much the culture of the person is able to influence him”. The way culture influences the 
perspectives of policymakers, however, varies depending on a number of factors. One key 
factor is the degree of humanness inherent in the policymakers. In this regard, a burgeoning 
tribe of scholars argues that Nigerian policymakers are culturally predisposed to develop 
altruistic policies for the betterment of society, inspired by the Ubuntu philosophy (Mamman 
et al., 2023). This means that the policymakers are, based on the dictates of their culture and 
morals, motivated to develop and implement effective policies. In contrast, culture has 
instigated the development and implementation of unconventional policies as was seen during 
the Goodluck Jonathan’s administration when huge sums of money were allocated to prayers 
to fight the Boko Haram insurgency. Being very religious, Nigerian policymakers have “a 
tendency to place every existential authority to God” (Chuka 2012, 273). The other side of the 
coin, however, is that on many occasions, they supplicate to God without sufficient application
<<<PAGE=114>>>
100 
 
on their part. Hofsted’s (1984) thesis provides an interesting dimension suggesting that the 
high-power distance prevailing in Nigeria, breeds a docile citizenry that disincentivises 
stakeholder consultation in policymaking.       
In addition to the cultural constraint highlighted above, other constraints militating effective 
policy formulation in Nigeria ar e structural and ideological (Thomas et. al., 2008). Structural 
constraints relate to poor development capacity, financial challenges, and conflicting 
institutional mandates (Thomas et. al., 2008). Poor development capacity means policymakers 
lack the requ isite policymaking knowledge which hampers their ability to develop effective 
policies. Financial challenge is concerned with a government not able to mobilise funds to 
develop or implement policies. C onflicting institutional mandates relates to different MDAs 
having overlapping functions, thereby causing policy chaos.  
 
Ideological constraints in Nigeria occur when government disregards evidence  from 
stakeholders to pursue its policy preferences (Agbazuere, 2020). In that regard, the government 
devotes its resources on what it has promised to deliver or what is ideologically associated with 
it even if the evidence suggests otherwise. The ability of a government to do so is, however, 
reduced where the evidence from the stakeholders relates to a politically s alient issue. Also, 
sometimes, state governments refuse to key into the development objectives of the federal 
government based on differences in ideology (Agbazuere, 2020). Ideological constraints may, 
therefore, make policymakers use evidence in different  ways. These challenges make the 
generation of evidence, and the development of policies, more difficult in Nigeria, and Africa.  
 
For Ibrahim (2004), Nigeria’s policy problem started when the country discarded the policy 
process it inherited from Britain without developing a new one. The process, his argument 
goes, involved four stages:   
1) GREEN PAPER:  This dealt with extensive consul tations involving ministries, 
departments and agencies intended to analyse the need for a policy, including the 
weaknesses of existing policy or policies, as well as resource availability. At the end 
of the consultations, a Green Paper, articulating the ne w policy direction would 
emerge.     
2) STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS : At this stage, the Green Paper would be 
widely circulated to stakeholders including research centres, universities, the media 
and other interested parties for inputs.
<<<PAGE=115>>>
101 
 
3) WHITE PAPER : This encompa ssed a review session by government to consider 
stakeholders’ inputs with a view to enhancing the Green Paper which would be 
adopted and issued as a White Paper. 
4) ACT: The final stage comprised the conversion of the White Paper into an executive 
bill, which would be transmitted to the parliament for enactment as a law including 
implementation modalities and financing.    
3.3. POLICY CLASSIFICATION IN NIGERIA  
In Nigeria, whereas some policies are subject to legislative input or approval, others are not 
and are instead developed at ministry levels with inputs from other government institutions and 
other stakeholders (Cabinet Affairs Office, 2014; Jerome, 2007). So, in effect, there are two 
major types of policies in Nigeria:   
1. Policies that do not require legislative input/approval (Administrative policies); and 
  
2. Policies that require legislative input/approval (Legislative policies).  
To clarify, policies in the first category are mostly policies that are developed in ministries and 
other non -regulatory arenas in furtherance to their mandates. Culpepper (2011, p.180) 
described these arenas as “sites of informal institutionalisation.”  Such policies often do not 
need budgetary provision from the legislature for their implementation. In contrast, policies in 
the second category receive the intervention of the legislature either in the form of inputs to the 
policies or in passing a Bill to become a law (Ibrahim, 2004). The two types of policies require 
the inputs of stakeholders to make them evidence-based (Cabinet Affairs Office, 2014). 
Considering their status, legally sanctioned policies are laws that should be implemented. 
Democratic governments in Nigeria have, in many instances, however, weakened the role of 
the legislature in policymaking by not carrying  it along even though it ought to be the most 
important policymaking body in a democracy (Ibrahim, 2004).   
It should be noted, however, that strengthening a policy with the force of law does not guarantee 
implementation as it may suffer what Ajakaiye (200 7, p.24) calls “official announcement 
illusion”, referring to making an announcement to pacify stakeholders even though the 
government does not intend to implement the policy. It is a symbolic gesture governments  
frequently use for politically salient issu es they are neither willing nor capable to address
<<<PAGE=116>>>
102 
 
(Parsons, 1995). Unsurprisingly, one of the biggest challenges of policy making in Nigeria is 
government’s abysmal policy implementation level, which is well -documented (Alinno and 
Ikwegbe, 2012; Ibrahim 2004; Phillip and Peter, 2013).  This creates a problem for advocates 
of EBP in Nigeria: of what use is a policy, no matter how much its grounded in evidence if it 
will not be implemented? (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021).    
3.4. EVIDENCE -BASED POLICYMAKING IN NIGERIA 
 There is a compelling need for Nigerian policymakers to formulate policies based on evidence 
to enhance the country’s socio -economic development. Documentary evidence from around 
the world, whether from developed or developing econ omies buttress the need for evidence -
based policymaking (Yagboyaju, 2019). To recall, EBP is a Western concept and while 
developed economies have over the years developed robust frameworks to promote it (Head, 
2010), the concept is only beginning to be embraced by developing economies.  
In Nigeria, the dominant view is that public policies are neither driven by evidence, nor is there 
a substantial demand for evidence (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). The poor data culture in the 
country is considered as one of t he main reasons for the low adoption of EBP (Sanni et al., 
2016). It is important to note that an exhaustive amount of quantitative data exists in the 
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), a government agency that generates and maintains official 
macrolevel data on a wide range of subjects (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). Equally important is 
the presence of numerous research institutions in Nigeria created to improve the link between 
policy and research and to promote the use of evidence in policymaking. With 66 government 
research institutions, many university -based research institutes and numerous research -
generating NGOs, Nigeria has the highest number of research institutions in Africa (Aberman 
et al., 2009). 
Yet, it has been posited that the link between po licymaking and research in Nigeria is 
considerably weak and as a result, research knowledge seldom influences policymaking 
(Ajakaiye, 2007; Ayuk and Marouani, 2007; Olomola, 2007; Yagboyaju, 2019). Requests for 
data from the NBS are almost exclusively stat istical and in few areas: agriculture, banking, 
economics and petroleum, indicating a limited utilization of evidence (Sesan and Siyanbola, 
2021). Paradoxically, the notion of the limited influence of research evidence in policymaking 
is not peculiar to Ni geria but is rather a universally acknowledged  weakness of the EBP 
movement (Beerkens, 2018; Head, 2014; Turnpenny et al., 2009; Weiss, 1979).
<<<PAGE=117>>>
103 
 
Notwithstanding this weakness, the popularity of the use of research evidence in policymaking 
continues to grow (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). In fact, many scholars have argued that the 
non-utilisation of research evidence has adversely affected policy outcomes. It is widely 
believed, for instance, that one of the key reasons why SAP failed in Nigeria was because the  
programme was not based on national research evidence (Ayuk and Marouani, 2007; El-Rufai, 
2013). The relegation of research (and other forms of) evidence in the policy process every so 
often leads to “policy inconsistencies, confusion and instability whic h are the bane of 
development in the country” (Olomola, 2007, p.183). The sentiment expressed in this quotation 
finds concurrence with the views of four past Directors General of the Nigerian Institute for 
Social and Economic Research (NISER), one of the foremost policy think tanks in Nigeria. In 
2010, during the 60th anniversary celebrations of the institute, three past Directors General and 
the current one at the time, were interviewed on policymaking in Nigeria. They all lamented 
the poor or non -utilisation of research evidence in public policymaking in Nigeria. For 
emphasis, “the commonest point of convergence in their responses is that policies in the 
country are hardly research based, while many research outputs are merely ‘hit and run’ as they 
lack strong evidence of rigour” (Yagboyaju, 2019, p.5). Such remarks from successive heads 
of government’s top policy institution do not offer encouragement regarding the use of research 
evidence in the development of public policies in Nigeria. 
Poor funding has been identified as the main factor militating the achievement of the 
institution’s mandate. To elucidate, although the NISER was responsible for the “policy side” 
of the 2017 Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) of the country, owing to poor 
funding and the attendant inadequate institutional capacity, the task was undertaken by few 
influential individuals (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). This indicates that limited evidence, 
produced by a few elites, was used for the development of the ERGP because of the r eported 
lack of funding. In addition to the funding challenge, poor research quality was identified as 
another major reason for the low uptake of research in Nigeria (Aberman, et al., 2009). It is 
important to stress that although these challenges are not peculiar to Nigeria, they are not at a 
worrisome level in Western countries. Investments in research constitute a significantly high 
expenditure item for virtually all Western countries engendering innovation and growth (World 
Economic Forum, 2021). Also, the quality of research produced in the West has consistently 
been ranked among the best in the world. Relatedly, OECD countries possess considerably 
higher EBP capacities (Head, 2010) unlike Nigeria. EBP studies conducted in the West are, 
therefore, incapable of explaining Nigeria’s policy story.
<<<PAGE=118>>>
104 
 
The disregard of research in the policy process is causing significant disillusionment among 
Nigerian researchers. Consequently, many have changed their focus from impacting policy to 
self-satisfaction and pursuing their personal interests (Yagboyaju, 2019 ). In this regard, 
researchers conduct research either to fulfil academic requirements for career growth or just 
for the pride of concluding research.  
Beyond research evidence, other forms of evidence are also either ignored or suppressed by 
policymakers. Ajakaiye (2007) enumerated three main sources of evidence during the policy 
process in Nigeria: political office holders and bureaucrats; sundry interest groups, including 
labour unions and business groups; and the international community. Yet, national 
policymakers defer to the international community for fear of repercussion such as withholding 
financial and technical support. It has also been argued that Small and Medium -Scale 
Enterprises (SMEs) policies in Africa are developed “ on the foundation of policies and 
theoretical assumptions of the Western developed countries ” (Mamman, at al., 2019 , p.305). 
To confer respectability on externally inspired policies, affected governments in concert with 
the international community describe such p olicies as “home grown” (Ajakaiye, 2007, p.25). 
This label, the argument goes, is therefore meant to hide the reality that the governments have 
surrendered their policy sovereignty to the international community in exchange for continued 
funding of selected government activities or programmes. This means that in the development 
of the policies in question, the international community remained the sole or major provider of 
evidence.    
  
International stakeholders are not the only culprits accused of dominating the policy process in 
Nigeria thereby diminishing the evidence content of policies. Take the case of the National 
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) which is one of the most 
ambitious policies in Nigeria since the return of democracy in 1999, aimed to address the socio-
economic decline in the country. The development of such historic document was undertaken 
by five technocrats, “The Dream Team”, complemented by a few academics without consulting 
ministries who had earlier produced policy positions on the issues covered in NEEDS (Ibrahim, 
2004). The NEEDS policy was developed by a few individuals, but the government deceived 
the world into believing that it was a product of a rigorous process (Usman, 2004). Importantly, 
the limited stak eholder consultation conducted was not to obtain diverse inputs but to “sell 
(the) policy decided by the dream team to a wider audience” (Ibrahim, 2004, p.19).
<<<PAGE=119>>>
105 
 
Likewise, the universal basic education policy (UBE) was developed by the executive without 
the input of the legislature and the various state governments even though the implementation 
of basic education in Nigeria is statutorily the responsibility of the state governments (Ibrahim, 
2004). The NEEDS and UBE policies, thus, provide fitting descripti on of policies that were 
based mainly on the beliefs and opinions of a few (Doro, Ehosioke and Aizebeokhai, 2020) 
which privileged individual positions over institutional ones (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). 
Thus, “The Dream Team”, complemented by a few acade mics and the executives were 
responsible for producing and synthesising evidence for the development of the NEEDS and 
UBE policies, respectively. By and large, the disregard for critical evidence in the development 
of social policies potentially affect both the quality and implementation of policies. Afterall, a 
good social policy utilizes evidence from a variety of sources including primary and secondary 
sources (Akinbinu and Tiamiyu, 2016).   
There exists a counter argument to the notion that policies in Nigeria are not based on evidence. 
At a casual level, some military regimes were credited with engaging critical stakeholders to 
develop policies. Babangida regime’s decision to invite Nigerians of all walks of life, through 
a national ‘IMF debate,’ to decide whether the government should accept an IMF loan to bolster 
the foundering economy was considered by some analysts as an indication of government’s 
deference to different sources of evidence. Following Nigerians’ rejection of the loan, a 
position which the government accepted, one analyst remarked, “… history will acknowledge 
the courage and honourableness of a military leader who has not allowed the authoritarian 
attitude of his office to subvert the will and judgement of the majority of the citizens o n an 
issue dear to their heart” (Ogunbanjo, quoted in Umoden, 1992, pp.72-73). The rejection of the 
IMF loan by the regime was, however, a facade as the president unveiled an economic 
adjustment package that contained the conditionalities attached to the rejected loan a few weeks 
after the public repudiation of the loan in what Lewis (1996, p.83) described as “a deft policy 
turnaround.”  
The point needs to be stressed that notwithstanding the charge of using guile against Babangida, 
his regime did not take the loan as generally favoured by majority of Nigerians. Though a 
military regime, it adopted a relatively extensive public consultation in its policymaking 
(Umoden, 1992). Likewise, the military regime of Obasanjo obtained inputs from various 
stakeholders including the military governors of states, traditional rulers and other interested 
parties which formed the nucleus of the regime’s local government reform (Shehu Musa
<<<PAGE=120>>>
106 
 
Yar’adua Foundation, 2004). This means that some policies during the military regimes in 
Nigeria, had limited stakeholder consultation. 
The decades following the return of democracy in the country have engendered a more diverse 
and rigorous stakeholder consultation. Examples of such consultations abound in several policy 
domains such as agr iculture (Aberman, et al., 2009) poverty reduction (Taylor, 2012) and 
energy (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). Critical stakeholders were therefore consulted for the 
development of these and many other national policies in Nigeria. Whether the consultation 
process was robust enough is, however, an area that needs to be further interrogated. But suffice 
to say that research on EBP including the use of evidence in policymaking has increased in 
Nigeria since the return of democracy.  
For example, Sanni, et al. (201 6), conducted an empirical study to examine Nigerian 
lawmakers’ access and utilization of science, technology, and innovation (STI) advice and the 
impact of such advice on their legislative and policymaking responsibilities. Noting that 
scientific evidence  was only one source of evidence, the study identified eight kinds of 
evidence employed by the lawmakers comprising expert opinion, internet, evidence from 
seminars, newsletter, policy brief, academic journals, public opinion polls and legislative 
resolutions in that order. 
Similarly, Akinbinu, and Tiamiyu (2016) conducted research on 166 civil servants responsible 
for policymaking in seven ministries of Lagos State and found out that civil servants obtained 
evidence from many sources including: government publications, internet, newspapers, 
ministry’s expert knowledge, academic research, previous policies. The research further 
showed that participants perceived previous policies, internet, government publications and 
ministry’s expert knowledge as the most frequently used sources of evidence in policymaking 
largely due to ease of access.  
 To sum up, these two studies (Sanni et al., 2016 and Akinbinu, and Tiamiyu, 2016) alongside 
the stakeholder engagements in different policy domains highlighted above offer  an insight 
into the range of evidence used in the development of public policies in Nigeria.    
3.5. PROSPECTS OF EBP IN NIGERIA   
Nigeria has come a long way regarding public policymaking and the use of evidence in 
policymaking. The nature and depth of ev idence used in policymaking in Nigeria, especially
<<<PAGE=121>>>
107 
 
since the return of democracy in 1999, can be described as chequered, alternating between hope 
and despair. Taken together the divergent views aforesaid, particularly the growing awareness 
and adoption of EBP, it would appear the country has a significant potential to deepen the 
adoption leading to improved public service delivery and democratic governance.   I situate the 
discourse on the prospects of EBP in Nigeria within the iron triangle schema of legis lature, 
bureaucrats, and interest groups, for analytical clarity (Gais et al., 1984; John 2012).     
Firstly, the return of democracy in Nigeria has undoubtedly freed the once constricted 
governance space and the demand for accountability and inclusiveness. Of particular 
importance is the return of the parliament, which is “the highest expression of polic y 
formulation in a democracy” (Ibrahim 2004, p.20). The parliament in Nigeria is functional and 
serves as the medium through which the disparate voices of the people are ventilated by their 
representatives, strengthening the presumption of national ownersh ip of government policies. 
As we have seen, federal parliaments in Nigeria consult a wide variety of sources in their 
policymaking activities (Sanni, et al., 2016). In addition, as the representatives of the people, 
they obtain evidence from their constitu ent members and conduct public hearing to enhance 
inclusiveness and the quality of laws and policies. The return of democracy and legislative arm 
of government would therefore potentially improve robust policymaking and make 
development of policies based on the whims of policymakers more difficult.  
Secondly, the civil service is projected to reclaim its key role in policy formulation and 
implementation. Although it is still bedevilled by corruption and poor service delivery, the 
government continues to att empt its reform. To be clear, several reforms have been 
implemented with relatively poor outcomes (Anazodo et al., 2012; El-Rufai, 2013; Mark and 
Zainuddin 2018). Nevertheless, the civil service reform and implementation strategy launched 
in 2017 by the fe deral government of Nigeria represented the first time that government had 
come up with a detailed plan of how to revive the service and make it a result -oriented one 
(Abdullahi, 2019). The 3-year strategy ended in December 2020 and the government has begun 
the development of a successor 5 -year strategy plan to cover the period 2021 – 2025 
(Independent, 2021). The overarching goal of the strategy is to reposition the civil service by 
building the capacity of bureaucrats and enhancing their welfare (The News, 2021). 
Thirdly, interest groups have, historically, played significant roles in policymaking in Nigeria 
as demonstrated by the studies of Sesan and Siyanbola (2021), Taylor (2012), and Aberman et 
al., (2009). Nigeria is a relatively open society and diff erent interest groups covering diverse
<<<PAGE=122>>>
108 
 
areas such as agriculture, health, business, and education are exerting pressure on policymakers 
to influence policies (Ajakaiye, 2007; Bangura 1994). For instance, the Nigerian Labour 
Congress (NLC) is a critical player in all negotiations for the review of civil servants’ salaries 
in Nigeria. Also, the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industries, Mines and 
Agriculture (NACCIMA), is an influential group that contributes policy ideas to promote the 
country’s private sector.  
Supplementary to the foregoing, the existence of many research institutions in Nigeria is 
envisioned to support the adoption of EBP in the country. Although this has not been the case 
for a long time, interest in the use of evidence in policymaking in the Nigerian public service 
is gradually increasing (Sanni, et al., 2016). It is expected that this interest would galvanise a 
rise in the demand and utilization of evidence in policymaking. Indeed, there is a growing 
interest in knowledge co-production within the policymaking space in Nigeria, which if 
sustained, can improve policymakers’ understanding and utilization of variety of evidence in 
policymaking (Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). It is important that these initiatives are sustained 
so that EBP would become the norm rather than the exception in the Nigerian public service.   
3.6. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This chapter has demonstrated that policymaking in Nigeria, like in other countries, can take 
different forms and shapes and it i s difficult to depict it in a definite predictable pattern. In 
other words, the exercise is characterized by uncertainties and a lot of muddling through. 
The chapter showed that Nigeria’s policymaking story can be told in two epochs, the military, 
and the democratic periods, each with different dynamics. Policymaking under the military 
regimes were patrimonial, swift, uncomplicated albeit suboptimal. This is understandable 
considering that the legislature, a critical policymaking institution was suspended d uring 
successive military regimes. The civil service, another important policymaking organ, was 
made ineffective as its policymaking function was routinely taken over by new organisations 
created by the military who installed their acolytes as heads of the organisations. Consequently, 
the development of policies during these times was largely based on the whims of the military 
rulers, their families, or based on “the evidence” provided by those who the military rulers had 
hand-picked to head new organisatio ns. Invariably, the value of ‘evidence’ was uncontested, 
and ‘evidence’ was used in a hierarchical manner consistent with the preferences of the military
<<<PAGE=123>>>
109 
 
juntas. Instances of public consultations under military rule were few, far in -between and 
generally tangential, as illustrated in the chapter. 
Another interesting feature of policymaking under the military regimes was that the generation 
and use of evidence for the development a number of national policies was largely influenced 
by the international community with little or no input from Nigerian policymakers.   
As regards policymaking in a democracy, the chapter identified two types of policies in 
Nigeria. The first one is the administrative policy, developed by MDAs and which does not 
require legislative input/approval. The second one is the legislative policy which requires 
legislative input/approval. To be effective, the two types of policies require the generation and 
use of multiple kinds of evidence to enhance their effectiveness. Relatedly, the chapter showed 
that the return of democracy in 1999 heralded the return of formal democratic institutions like 
the legislature, which has assumed its policymaking responsibilities. The chapter also showed 
that Nigeria’s democratic governments have u ndertaken measures to make national policies 
more evidence -based including incorporating various stakeholders into the policy process, 
making research more influential, encouraging policy debates, and reforming the civil service. 
Notwithstanding these measures, the chapter revealed that the development of some national 
policies was still largely influenced by the international community which provided significant 
evidence even though in many cases it demonstrated insufficient knowl edge of the country’s 
peculiarities. Also, contrary to expectations that the return of democracy would signal the end 
the personalisation of policymaking, incidences of few elites such as the famed “Dream Team” 
developing national policies without the required inputs from critical stakeholders still subsists.   
Generally, two schools of thought have emerged regarding the use of evidence in policymaking 
in democratic Nigeria. The dominant school, the cynics, argue that policies are not developed 
based on research or multiple kinds of evidence but are rather based on either the whims of a 
dominant president using the expertise of a few technocrats, or the opinions of a small clique 
of influential bureaucrats. Those who make this argument are not short of examp les with the 
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) being a prominent 
one.  
The second school of thought, the optimists, holds that policymaking in Nigeria is not 
fundamentally different from what obtains in developed countries to the extent that it is based
<<<PAGE=124>>>
110 
 
on a process that involves a careful selection of a course of action based on a plethora of 
evidence. Advocates of this school draw attention to the continuous demand and supply of 
evidence within the policy environment in Nigeri a and some empirical studies in support of 
their argument (eg. Akinbinu and Tiamiyu, 2016; Sanni, et al., 2016).  
The chapter argued that policy constraints shape and limit policymaking and implementation 
in Nigeria, and Africa, highlighting three major co nstraints: structural, i deological, and 
cultural. The way these constraints influence policymaking, however, vary across settings. For 
instance, while culture may engender a sense of altruism in policymakers leading to the 
development of effective policy, culture could also induce the development and 
implementation of unconventional , suboptimal policies as demonstrat ed during Jonathan’s 
government when humongous amounts of money were allocated to prayers to fight the Boko 
Haram insurgency.   
In terms of the prospect of EBP in Nigeria, the chapter adopted an optimistic stance. Firstly, 
the return of the legislature, ri ghtly seen as the “the highest expression of policy formulation 
in a democracy” (Ibrahim 2004, p.20) is expected to improve the generation of evidence from 
a wider source, especially from legislators’ constituencies, to make national policies more 
evidence-based. Secondly, it is anticipated that the civil service reform undertaken by the 
government will make it more professional in policymaking including obtaining evidence from 
multiple sources. Finally, considering that democratic Nigeria is a relatively o pen society, 
coupled with the fact that interest groups have assumed a more influential role since the return 
of democracy, they are projected to continue on that trajectory and add their voices to the policy 
discussions pertaining to their domains of interest. 
The next chapter examines the research methodology used for this study to empirically 
interrogate the validity of the claims of the two schools of thought discussed in this chapter.

CHAPTER 4 
 RESEARCH  METHODOLOGY  
4.0. INTRODUCTION  
The previous chapter covers policymaking in Nigeria within the context of its history and 
institutions. This chapter presents the philosophical and methodological framework adopted 
for the collection and analysis of data. It also presents the justification s for adopting the 
framework and the key activities undertaken by the researcher in conducting the research. 
4.1. THE RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY : ONTOLOGY , EPISTEMOLOGY AND METHODOLOGY  
In addition to the literature reviewed in the preceding chapter, a key factor that influences social 
research is an understanding of the philosophical orientation guiding research (Bryman and 
Bell, 2015; O’Leary, 2014; Snape and Spencer, 2003) . Essentially, the idea is for every 
researcher to articulate their conception of reality, what they view as acceptable knowledge, 
and how these two impact research. The philosophical discourse primarily deals with ontology, 
epistemology, and methodology (Bryman and Bell, 2015).  
4.1.1. Ontology 
Ontology deals with the study of reality – assumptions researchers make about things that exist 
and how such things are understood and categorized by the researchers ( Bryman and Bell, 
2015; O’Leary, 2014). The central question ontology seeks to address is “What type of things 
actually exists?” (O’Leary, 2014, p.5). Thus, the main concern of ontology is whether social 
phenomenon exists objectively and independent of human interpretation or whether they are 
based on the subjective construction of observers (Bryman and Bell, 2015; Snape and Spencer, 
2003). Technically, ontology comprises two opposite themes: Objectivism and constructionism 
(Bryman and Bell, 2015). Objectivism as an ontological position postulates that so cial 
phenomena exist independent of social actors’ perceptions (Bryman and Bell, 2015). Put 
another way, it asserts that reality is out there regardless of the ability (or lack therefrom) of 
social actors to see and recognize it (O’Leary, 2014). Constructionism on the other hand holds 
the view that social reality is socially constructed and as such they are created by the 
perceptions and interpretations of social actors (Bryman and Bell, 2015).
<<<PAGE=126>>>
112 
 
4.1.2. Epistemology 
Logically following ontology is epistemolog y, which is concerned with the nature of 
knowledge, specifically, what should be considered as sound knowledge (Bryman and Bell, 
2015). It focuses fundamentally on how research should be conducted and interrogates 
researchers’ assumptions about procedures for the generation of knowledge. Within the social 
sciences, epistemology asks important questions including: “How can we know about reality 
and what is the basis of our knowledge?” (Snape and Spencer 2003, p.13), “What are the rules 
for discovering what exists?” (O’Leary 2014, p.5). Epistemology like ontology comprises two 
contrasting themes: positivism and interpretivism (Bryman and Bell, 2015).  
Positivism as an epistemological position advocates the use of scientific methods to study 
social phenomena and as such is rooted in an objectivist ontology (Bryman and Bell, 2015). 
The assumption under the positivist epistemology is that results from a research endeavour 
should be value-free, objective, and replicable (Snape and Spencer, 2003). As a result, numbers 
are a key part of the positivist epistemological positioning.     
As the name implies, interpretivism is an alternate epistemology that views knowledge as 
resulting from the meanings and interpretations attached to phenomena by human actions 
(Bryman and Bell, 2015). This perspective is therefore informed by a constructionist ontology 
(Bryman and Bell, 2015) and researchers’ subjective interpretation of the phenomenon is 
considered as the source of factual knowledge (O’Leary, 2014). 
Gradually, a hybrid epistemology, mixing positivism and interpretivism in a single study is  
emerging. Some researchers are advocating greater pragmatism in using an appropriate mix of 
qualitative and quantitative methods as part of a “toolkit” ( Snape and Spencer 2003, p.15) 
rather than a “slavish attachment and devotion to methods” (Janesick as quoted in O’Leary, 
2014, p.9).  
4.1.3 Methodology 
The term methodology is used in reference to a systematic way to conduct research (Bryman 
and Bell, 2015; Kothari, 2004). Generally, two research methodologies are discernible, the 
quantitative and qualitat ive, each based on peculiar philosophical underpinnings and 
assumptions.
<<<PAGE=127>>>
113 
 
The quantitative methodology is a research tradition rooted in the belief that the study of social 
phenomena should be undertaken in the same way as the study of the natural sciences (O’Leary, 
2014). It is influenced by scientific methods, deductive reasoning, hypothesis testing, and 
quantification of data which forces researchers to embrace objective standards while discarding 
personal whims ( O’Leary, 2014).  Quantitative methodology is generally underpinned by 
positivist epistemology and a rejection of interpretivist epistemology (Bryman and Bell, 2015).  
In contrast, the qualitative methodology is a research tradition, focussed on the generation of 
an in-depth knowledge of the social world through the interpretation of the experiences and 
perspectives of participants ( Snape and Spencer, 2003). Qualitative methodology privileges 
theory building and recognition of values (Bryman and Bell, 2015).  This kind of re search 
therefore “appreciates subjectivities, accepts multiple perspectives and realities, recognizes the 
power of research over both participants and researchers; and does not necessarily shy away 
from political agendas” (O’Leary, 2014, p.130). This eclecticism of qualitative research, 
therefore, stands as a critique of the positivist epistemology (Bryman and Bell, 2015; O’Leary, 
2014).   
From the foregoing, the is clear that the two dominant methodologies owe a commitment to 
different epistemological and methodological positions. Flowing from this, researchers for the 
most part stick to the quantitative -qualitative divide in conducting investigations with some 
traditionalists arguing that the two cannot be mixed ( O’Leary, 2014 ). There is, however, a 
growing advocacy for a mixed methodology - the employment of the two traditions in one 
study based on the belief that such an endeavour could potentially enhance research (O’Leary, 
2014; Snape and Spencer, 2003). This line of argument is instructive considering that both 
qualitative and quantitative methods can be either inductive or deductive. 
In particular, (O’Leary, 2014) argues that the key argument for the adoption of a mixed 
methodology is because it: 
• Helps researchers obtain the best of the two traditional methodologies. 
• Allows the use of deductive and inductive logic. 
• Enables researchers to develop phased research protocols. 
• Facilitates multiple perspectives. 
• Allows for triangulation.
<<<PAGE=128>>>
114 
 
Taken together, this research is an inquiry into the perspectives of policymakers regarding the 
nature and hierarchy of evidence used in policymaking and the impact of politics on evidence 
and policies. Implicit in this inquiry is the need to understand the policymaking process. On 
account of its focus on the perspectives of participants in terms of “what they see as important 
and significant”, this study is characterized as largely qualitative research underpinned by an 
interpretivist epistemology (Bryman and Bell, 2015, p.376). Importantly, there is a quantitative 
element in the research in the sense that participants would provide their perspectives, through 
numerical ranking, on the priority attached to the different kinds of evidence used in the 
development of the policies under investigation. The quantification of data is to answer a key 
research question and lends the study to a pragmatic paradigm that utilizes numbers while 
maintaining the “underlying assumptions of the qualitative tradition” (O’Leary, 2014, p.148).  
This means the philosophical underpinnings of the study  and its methodology are inspired by 
the research questions. In all, the qualitative part of the research assumes an interpretivist 
epistemology, whereas the quantitative element assumes a contrasting positivist epistemology 
(Yin, 2014). For emphasis, thre e of the research objectives in this study are qualitative while 
one is quantitative, making the study a predominantly qualitative one with a complementary 
component of quantitative data (Bryman and Bell, 2015; Hussein, 2009; Jick, 1979; O’Leary, 
2014).   
4.2. RESEARCH DESIGN  
Defined as a framework for empirical investigation, Bryman and Bell (2015) argue that a 
research design drives the entire process of data collection and analysis to answer research 
questions. For this study, the case study research design was used as the empirical framework 
to guide the execution of the research. A case study is a comprehensive investigation of an 
event in a real -life context (Yin, 2014). Case studies are a very popular research design and 
they have been used for all kinds of studies, whether quantitative or qualitative. The wide usage 
of case studies especially in social inquiry is predicated on their unique characteristics and the 
value they add to empirical investigations. Consequently, the case study research design was 
adopted for this research for three major reasons. 
One, the case study offers important in -depth insights into many aspects of the subject of 
investigation (O’Leary, 2014; Thomas, 2011). By looking at the phenomenon from different 
directions, digging deeper, and hearing from different people, each with their personal, often
<<<PAGE=129>>>
115 
 
different perspectives, a richer understanding will emerge. The key question at each point of 
the inquiry will be: “What is going on here?” (Chadderton and Torrance, 2011, p.53). As Yin 
(2014, p.4) rightly states, “…the distinctive need for case study research arises out of the desire 
to understand the complex social phenomenon.”  
Second, a case study allows the use of multiple methods (Chadderton and Torrance, 2011; 
O’Leary, 2014) an d diverse epistemological orientation (Yin, 2014) to facilitate answering 
research questions. Bearing in mind that multiple methods, interviews, and surveys, each with 
different epistemological assumptions will be used for data collection in this research, the case 
study represents an appropriate research design for the study. 
Finally, adopting the definition of a theory as “an explanatory model”, the case study design is 
strong in generating a theory to illuminate what is being researched. This means it enables the 
development of theoretical arguments and ideas from findings in tandem with the inductive 
tradition of research. A necessary caveat is apt at this point: the findings, conclusions, and 
theories generated from a single case study can only be parti cularized and not generalized 
(Chadderton and Torrance, 2011; Thomas, 2011) meaning they can only be applicable to the 
case in question and not to the universe (Yin, 2014). To improve generalizations, however, 
multiple case studies are becoming more widely used within the social sciences.   
4.3. MULTIPLE -CASE DESIGN  
The multiple -case research design has become increasingly popular in social inquiry. The 
paucity of knowledge around my research question necessitates the adoption of an exploratory 
multiple case study design. Specifically, four policies were examined in this research. Bryman 
and Bell (2015) believe the key merit of multiple case study is in its ability to improve the 
theory-building process through engagement with more cases and obtaining more evidence 
than in a single case study.  
Moreover, the adoption o f multiple case study enables researchers to develop deeper subject 
knowledge and engender more conceptual generalizations (O’Leary, 2014; Yin, 2014). As a 
consequence, findings from multiple case studies are potentially more robust and more likely 
to be u seful in settings other than those in which the study is conducted. Generally, the 
theoretical conclusions offered by multiple case study are more authoritative than those from a 
single case study (Yin, 2014).
<<<PAGE=130>>>
116 
 
Also, the multiple case study allows for compa rison between cases such that similarities and 
differences are identified and critically examined (Chadderton and Torrance, 2011; Thomas, 
2011) which also contributes to theory building (Bryman and Bell, 2015).       
4.4. CASE SELECTION  
In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressive Party (APC) assumed office as 
the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria following a historic election where an 
incumbent president lost an election for the first time in the country’s democratic history. The 
new government subsequently singled out public sector reform as a major policy issue, 
promising a radical shift in governance and service delivery. Many policies were formulated 
and implemented during the first tenure of the Buhari’s gove rnment (2015 -2019) spanning 
education, economy, social security, energy, water resources and so on.  
The aim of this study is to understand the nature and hierarchy of evidence used by policy 
makers in Nigeria in formulating public policies during the peri od 2015 – 2019. In doing so, 
four policies were examined:  
1. National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) 
2. Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) 
3. National Tax Policy (NTP) 
4. National Water Resources Policy and Strategy (NWRP) 
These policies represent the two broad types of policies in Nigeria: Policies that require 
legislative input or approval, referred to as legislative policies, and policies that do not require 
legislative input or approval, termed as administrative policies. Two policies were selected for 
each policy type as shown in Table 1 below.

1. National Social Investment Programmes 
2. Nigerians in Diaspora Commission

2. National Water Resources Strategy and 
Policy
<<<PAGE=131>>>
117 
 
The selection of the policies was done in line with O’Leary’s (2014) guidance: 
1. Pragmatics: I had a contact person in all the cases, directly known by me or introduced 
by someone I knew, which facilitated ac cess that would have otherwise been difficult 
(Thomas, 2011; Yin, 2014). 
2. Purposiveness: There was a variation in the cases to increase understanding, improve 
making generalization and enhance theory generation (Bryman and Bell, 2015). The 
selected policies required different kinds of approvals. The first two policies required the 
approval or involvement of federal legislators, while the last two did not. Consequently, in 
this study, the former is called legislative policies, while the latter is called ad ministrative 
policies.     
3. Intrinsic Interest: The cases are strategic policies that were part of a public sector reform 
of the Buhari government. For instance, the NWRP was developed to address the historic 
misuse of water resources in Nigeria and the failure of the “top -down and supply -side 
approach” of previous water resources policies (Federal Ministry of Water Resources, 2016, 
p.1). The NTP aimed to diversify the revenue generation capacity of the government, by 
widening the country’s tax base in the face of high dependence on crude oil (and a decline 
in its price) and poor fiscal buffers (Ministry of Budget and National Planning, 2017). At 
N500,000,000,000 funding, the third case study, the NSIP is Nigeria’s most ambitious social 
welfare programme (ActionAid Nigeria, 2018) and impacted 57 million direct and indirect 
poor beneficiaries in Nigeria (National Social Investment Office, 2019). Finally, the NDC 
was chosen because, with one of the largest African diaspora populations in the world 
(Akinrinade and Ogen, 2011), the Nigerian Diaspora presents huge opportunities for 
national development (Wapmuk et al., 2014).   
Additionally, a coverage period of 2015-2019, the first tenure of Buhari, was chosen to allow 
comparison of policies developed within a single government considering that different policy 
styles are often adopted by different governments, even from the same political party.

4.5. CONDUCTING THE RESEARCH  
This section presents the manner the study was conducted and the factors that shaped the study. 
It, therefore, deals with issues such as the sampling technique used, the categories of 
respondents, and the data collection methods. It is important at this po int to state that the 
location of the study was Nigeria, which required travelling from the UK to Nigeria to conduct 
face-to-face interviews. This study was, however, caught up in the Covid -19 pandemic. The 
first set of face -to-face interviews (10) was con ducted shortly before the outbreak of the 
pandemic, and the consequent travel restrictions informed the use of the telephone to continue 
the data collection phase of the study. Towards the end of 2021, with 16 telephone interviews 
conducted, it became clear that the telephone interviews were not proceeding at the expected 
pace in part because of respondents’ fatigue (Carr and Worth, 2001). Specifically, inadequacy 
of time to get the right information during a call was repeatedly observed which required 
multiple calls to individual respondents with the attendant costs to me, and inconvenience to 
the respondents. Related to this was the fact that the subject of the study, policymaking, was a 
complex phenomenon that required iterative, and detailed explanations (Howard, et al., 1988; 
Colombotos, 1969). Subsequently, in January 2022, I travelled to Nigeria and conducted the 
remaining 10 interviews, face-to-face.  
In generating data from respondents, interviews and on-line questionnaires were used. Prior to 
the commencement of interviews, I had six types of evidence that emerged from the reviewed 
literature which shaped the interview questions. During the interviews, respondents were asked 
to confirm whether those evidence were used in the development of the policy they participated 
in and to mention any additional kinds of evidence used. In all, they identified three additional 
types of evidence, making a total of nine types of evidence. Having obtained the nine types of 
evidence, an online questionnaire was developed and sent to the same respondents requesting 
them to rank the nine types of evidence in terms of how useful they thought they were in the 
policy-making process with 1 being the most useful and nine the least useful. It means that in 
this research, the interview served as a precursor to the questionnaire. 
4.6. SAMPLING OF PARTICIPANTS  
For this study, purposive (non -probability) sampling was used in the data collection stage to 
identify individuals who were involved in the development of the policies under investigation. 
Purposive sampling is where the researcher deliberately selects items in the population that will 
constitute a sample (Kothari, 2004).  This kind of sampling method was chosen because it
<<<PAGE=133>>>
119 
 
allowed me to select respondents that possessed the skills and knowledge required to answer 
the research questions. This kind of sampling has two other advantages. One is to ensure that 
major components of a research topic are covered and two, it encourage s deliberate diversity 
in research participants (Ritchie, Lewis, and Elam, 2003).  
To operationalize the sampling, a mapping of individuals that participated in the development 
of the policies was conducted. For the legislative policies, respondents were selected from three 
categories – bureaucrats, legislators, and interest groups – described as iron triangle on account 
of their influence on power and policymaking (Gais et al., 1984; John 2012). For the 
administrative policies, owing to the absence of legi slators in the policy process, bureaucrats 
were divided into top-level and middle-level bureaucrats to give recognition to the latter group 
which does a lot of policy making (Stevens, 2011). Indeed, ‘there is a great deal of critical 
evidence held in the m inds of … front -line staff’ (SPMT, 1999, cited in Nutley  et al., 2002, 
p.2).  
A categorisation of the respondents who participated in the study is provided in table 2 below.

4.7. DATA COLLECTION  
To gather data for each case study, nine respondents were interviewed with the respondents 
later completing on-line questionnaires. Policy documents were also analysed.  
Respondents were generally anonymised for ethical reasons and to protect their identit y. In a 
few instances, I provided the job designations of respondents for elucidation and context, where
<<<PAGE=134>>>
120 
 
such disclosure would not reveal the identity of participants. I, however, deliberately avoided 
providing any detail if that could lead to their identi fication. To answer the questions of this 
research, a triangulation was adopted using the three complementary approaches:  s emi-
structured interview, on-line questionnaires, and policy documents. 
4.8. SEMI-STRUCTURED , FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW  
The interview is a very popular method of data collection in social research as it allows a useful 
interaction between the researcher and the participant (Yin, 2009). In total, 20 of the 36 
interviews were conducted face-to-face while 16 were carried out by telephone. Al though the 
initial plan was to conduct all the interviews face -to-face, the outbreak of the 2020/21 Covid -
19 pandemic and the attendant travel restrictions informed the use of telephone to conduct 16 
interviews.  
Interviews can be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. In a structured interview, the 
researcher asks standardised pre-determined questions; the unstructured interview, on the other 
hand, is more of a conversation, while the semi -structured interview is a mix of the two, 
combining order and flexibility, and enjoying “the best of both worlds” (Thomas, 2011, p.163). 
The semi-structured interview therefore requires a written schedule to guide the researchers on 
areas to cover with the guide being flexible enough to allow the researcher to dire ct the 
interview (Legard, Keegan and Ward, 2003). A major appeal of the semi -structured interview 
is that it allows participants the freedom to express themselves in their own words which may 
enable the evolution of unanticipated responses (Yin, 2009). Sem i-structured interviews are 
particularly useful in interrogating complex phenomena (Ritchie, 2003). 
A semi-structured interview can either be face -to-face or using telephone. In addition to the 
advantages listed above, the face -to-face interview elicits non -verbal cues (O’Leary, 2014; 
Novick, 2007). it has been argued that respondents tend to be more cooperative in face-to-face 
than where they do not see the interviewer (Howard, Meade, Booth and Whall, 1988) Face-to-
face interview remains the gold  standard for qualitative research interview and is generally 
considered superior to telephone interviews (Novick, 2007; Burke and Miller, 2001). 
Semi-structured interviews, however, have some challenges. Access to respondents may be 
difficult which impact s data collection (Kothari, 2004). To address this, I secured the 
commitment of contact persons in all the cases, who intervened when I had some access

121 
 
challenges. Another challenge is that semi -structured interview generates a large set of data 
which makes processing not only labourious but increases the potential for error (Bryman and 
Bell, 2015). In response to this, I received adequate training on qualitative research and the use 
of the Nvivo software which helped in conceptualizing data and in simplify ing qualitative 
analysis.    
4.9. TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS  
As stated earlier, a total of 16 of the 38 interviews were conducted by telephone occasioned by 
the Covid-19 pandemic, which made face-to-face interviews impossible.  
A telephone interview is an approach used for obtaining research data using the telephone and 
without meeting face -to-face. There has been an appreciable rise in the use of telephone 
interviews in the last few decades owing to its flexibility and convenience (Burke and Miller, 
2001). Another advantage of telephone interviews is that they may r elax participants and 
encourage them to reveal sensitive information (Novick, 2007). Compared with face -to-face 
interviews, telephone interviews are reputed to have good response rate (Howard, Meade, 
Booth and Whall, 1988), save cost and facilitate a wider geographical coverage (Colombotos, 
1969). Fundamentally, the issue of researcher safety, and the need to avoid dangerous or unsafe 
settings, have also been emphasized as key merits of telephone interviews (Sturges and 
Hanrahan 2004). This last point stood out as regards the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Telephone interviews do have some limitations. They are seen as suitable only for shorter 
(Howard et al., 1988) and straightforward issues (Colombotos, 1969). Fundamentally, there 
exist legitimate concerns that teleph one interviews sacrifice visual cues which may 
compromise data quality (Carr and Worth, 2001; Novick, 2007). Telephone interviews thus 
deny researchers non-verbal and contextual insights.  Relatedly, it has also been reported that 
where a telephone intervi ewer is unknown, a lack of cooperation from participants has been 
observed (Howard et al., 1988). Limitation on the length of time for telephone interviews 
before participants’ fatigue sets in is yet another disadvantage of telephone interview (Carr and 
Worth, 2001). 
Findings on the comparison of the impact of telephone interviews with face-to-face interviews 
are mixed (Novick, 2007; Sturges and Hanrahan, 2004). Jordan et al., (1980, pp.218-19) found 
instances of “missing data on family income, more acquiescence, evasiveness, and extremeness
<<<PAGE=136>>>
122 
 
response bias, and more and somewhat contradictory answers to checklist questions” in 
telephone interviews. In contrast, Sturges and Hanrahan (2004) conducted research whose 
original design was for face-to-face interviews, but due to some data collection exigencies, half 
of the interviews were eventually by phone. They reported no significant difference between 
the two kinds of interviews.    
Several scholars have posited that the two can successfully substitute each othe r without 
reducing the quality of participants’ responses (Carr and Worth, 2001; Novick, 2007; Sturges 
and Hanrahan 2004). Key limitations, however, need to be accounted for and mitigated. To 
counter the concern of absence of visual cues, I devised appropr iate techniques to establish 
rapport and elicit rich responses (Novick, 2007). Information and consent forms, alongside key 
interview questions, were communicated to the participants in good time to facilitate rapport 
(Burke and Miller, 2001). To avoid participants’ fatigue, I ensured that length of the telephone 
interview did not exceed 45 minutes (Lavrakas, 1987 as cited in Carr and Worth, 2001).      
Irrespective of the mode of the interview, I developed relevant information documents before 
the fieldwor k, which helped respondents for the interviews (Saunders et al., 2012). 
Respondents were initially contacted by phone or email and upon receipt of an affirmative 
response, an information pack, comprised of a letter of invitation, a Consent Form, and an 
Information Sheet was sent to them. The Information Sheet provided key details of the research 
including, the research topic, sponsors of the study, confidentiality issue, the importance of 
participants’ participation, how the data will be saved and used, and  the duration of the 
interview (Burke and Miller, 2001). Upon receipt of the completed Consent Form, the 
interview venue (for the face-to-face interview), date, and time were agreed. During interviews, 
I made use of a tape recorder with the consent of the participants. The interviews lasted between 
25 minutes and 55 minutes. 
4.10. QUESTIONNAIRE  
In addition to semi-structured interviews, questionnaires formed part of the tools used for data 
collection. Questionnaires are data collection instruments that req uest research participants to 
answer a set of pre-determined questions in a particular order (Kothari, 2004). For this study, 
online questionnaires were administered to participants that had earlier been interviewed to 
collect quantitative data on the rank ing of evidence. Online questionnaires offer certain
<<<PAGE=137>>>
123 
 
advantages including computational and economic advantages (Merten and Ruch, 1996) and 
the ability to measure the length of time it takes to complete it (Furnham, et al., 2013). 
As mentioned earlier, the questionnaires were developed and administered after the completion 
of all 36 interviews. The questionnaires were administered to the same respondents who were 
interviewed. They were informed they were free to decide the number of evidence they felt 
were used and as such they were not obligated to rank all the evidence available. Two reasons 
accounted for the use of the on -line questionnaires. The first was to allow the respondents to 
first identify the types of evidence used in the development of the four  policies under 
examination before they were asked to rank them. Secondly, asking respondents to rank the 
different kinds of evidence in an interview would have denied them time to reflect considering 
the analytical thinking required for such a task (Burke  and Miller, 2001). In this regard, the 
questionnaires were designed to generate empirical quantifiable data which the interviews were 
ill-suited for (O’Leary, 2014).  
One of the key limitations of using the questionnaire is lower rate of response which potentially 
increases bias (Bryman and Bell, 2015; Kothari, 2004). The inability of a researcher to probe 
participants either to clarify an answer or to follow an interesting line of conversation in the 
respondent’s answer is another limitation of the questi onnaire instrument (Bryman and Bell, 
2015). The first limitation was countered by the fact that the interviews earlier conducted 
helped in creating a good rapport between me and the respondents. On the second limitation, I 
had pre-informed and obtained all the respondents’ consent to complete the questionnaires after 
the interviews, and I explained to them in detail what they were expected to do. Nevertheless, 
they were encouraged to contact me should they need further clarification. At the end of the 
exercise, only one respondent called for that purpose. 
4.11. REVIEW OF POLICY DOCUMENTS  
The third data collection approach was document analysis, described as a “systematic 
procedure for reviewing or evaluating documents - both printed and electronic (computer-based 
and Internet-transmitted) material” (Bowen, 2009, p.27). In this regard, a systematic review of 
relevant policy documents was conducted to provide information on the policymaking 
processes for the development of the policies under examination. The re view educated me on 
the policymaking trajectory of each policy and enabled me to know the specific questions to
<<<PAGE=138>>>
124 
 
ask. The review also served to corroborate data from other sources (Yin, 2009). As Bowen 
(2009, pp.30-31) aptly remarks: 
“In sum, documents prov ide background and context, additional questions to be asked, 
supplementary data, a means of tracking change and development, and verification of findings 
from other data sources.” 
Like other approaches, however, document analysis has limitations. O’Leary (2014) and Yin 
(2009) note that documents used for analysis are printed for purposes other than the research 
at hand exposing them to inherent bias. Researchers should therefore proceed with care. While 
it may be appealing to view policy documents as conta ining the truth, “if you do, you need to 
ask whose truth.” (Yin,2009, p.251). Also, Bowen (2009) notes that online documents 
sometimes suffer from low retrievability, where document retrieval is difficult or where access 
is blocked by document producers. 
To address the first limitation, I employed interviews and questionnaires as the two key data 
collection approaches with document analysis playing a supportive, corroborative role. As per 
the second limitation, I obtained physical policy development documen ts from the 
organisations that developed the documents. Luckily for me, none of the online policy 
development document was irretrievable.  
4.12. TRIANGULATION  
Triangulation is the combination of different theories, data collection methods or data sources 
in single research to improve the credibility of research findings (Noble and Heale, 2019). Four 
kinds of triangulation are proposed by Patton in Yin (2014, 120) namely: (1) data triangulation, 
which deals with multiple sources of data; (2) theory triangula tion, which is concerned with 
the use of different theoretical perspectives to interpret the same data set; (3) investigator 
triangulation, which involves the use of many researchers in a study; and (4) methodological 
triangulation, which encourages the use of many data collection approaches. 
Some scholars (e.g., Thomas, 2011; Yin, 2014;) claim that the use of a single data collection 
approach is inconsistent with the principles of a case study research design as triangulation is 
a key strength of the case study design. The use of triangulation offers certain advantages to 
social research. The most important merit is the evolution of “converging lines of inquiry” 
which makes a finding “more convincing and accurate” (Yin, 2014, p.120). This strengthens
<<<PAGE=139>>>
125 
 
the validity and credibility of the findings (Ritchie, 2003). Secondly, which is related to the 
first point, triangulation assists researchers to validate or falsify findings or conclusions 
(Hussein, 2009; Noble and Heale, 2019; Thomas, 2011). This leads to the review of old theories 
or the development of new ones (Jick, 1979). 
Thirdly, researchers use triangulation for completeness purposes to show a fuller picture of a 
phenomenon (Hussein, 2009). This is akin to the “multiple realities” referred to by Yin (2014, 
p.122) but it goes beyond that and speaks more of the capacity of triangulation to resolve the 
difficulty of one method’s inability to provide perspectives that are critical to answering a 
research question (Noble and Heale, 2019). This point is of great importance to this study in 
that whereas semi-structured, in-depth interviews is my major data collection method, it was 
inappropriate for the generation of data on respondents’ perception of the relative importance 
of the different kinds of evidence used in policy development, hence the use of questionnaires.  
Despite its numerous advantages, triangulation is not without some criticisms. First, there is a 
philosophical criticism of the validating function of triangulation (Noble and Heale, 2019; 
Ritchie, 2003). Ontologically, the argument goes, there are different conceptions of reality and 
as such attempting to unify the conceptions is fruitless; on the other hand, the received wisdom 
of epistemology is that different methods yield different kinds of data making it improbable to 
generate complementary data sets (Ritchie, 2003). Furthermore, triangulation imposes a greater 
need for both time and cost (Hussein, 2009; Jick, 1979; Yin 2014) which impacts its use by 
researchers.   
The first limitation is countered by the pragmatic epistemological position adopted in this 
research. Predominantly underpinned by interpretivist epistemology, recognition is accorded 
the positivism inherent in the quantitative element of the research. Like Yin (2014), Jick (1979), 
and other scholars, I believe it is possible for the two epistemologica l positions to work in a 
complementary way. Essentially, my attitude is that triangulation is more important in assisting 
to create the whole picture rather than a more definite one (Ritchie, 2003). On the second 
limitation, I was satisfied that I would be  able to shoulder the additional cost to improve the 
credibility of this study.      
4.13. DATA ANALYSIS  
Described as the “most difficult phase in case study research” (Rahman et al., 2003, p.34), data 
analysis is surprisingly one of the least discussed in the research literature (Thorne, 2000; Yin,
<<<PAGE=140>>>
126 
 
2014). Surely, making sense of the rich data that emerged from the 36 interviews, 36 completed 
questionnaires, and document analysis was a huge challenge to me. Considering the mixed 
nature of this study, both qualitative and quantitative data analysis approaches were used.      
4.14. QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS  
Thematic analysis was used to uncover relevant and significant themes at different levels of 
textual data to facilitate interpretation and understanding (Attride -Stirling, 2001). I chose this 
method of analysis based on its recognition as the “foundational  method for qualitative 
analysis” (Braun and Clarke, 2006, p.78).  
There are no generally agreed procedures for the conduct of thematic analysis (Spencer, 
Ritchie, and O’connor, 2003) making it flexible and applicable to a variety of research 
paradigms (Br aun and Clarke, 2006; Clarke and Braun 2017; Nowell, et al., 2017). This 
flexibility is important to this study as it agreed with its epistemological and methodological 
commitment as predominantly qualitative research with complementary quantitative elements.  
Before the commencement of interviews, I had a list of themes that emerged from the reviewed 
literature which shaped the interview questions. I was guided by the reflections of Braun and 
Clarke (2006, p.82) who posit that “a theme captures something i mportant about the data in 
relation to the research question and represents some level of patterned response or meaning 
within the data set.” This guidance ran through the data collection process. I, therefore, had an 
idea of what I was searching for in th e data. Notably, other themes emerged, which alongside 
the themes from the literature, undergird my data collection. Regarding the kinds of evidence 
used in policy development as per the literature, six types stood out for me as follows: research 
evidence, previous policies evidence , media evidence, ideology evidence, internet evidence, 
and r esidual knowledge of policymakers’ evidence . My interviews with the respondents  
unearthed three more types of evidence, namely, MDA evidence, local consultants’ evidence, 
and external stakeholders’ evidence, making nine types of evidence in total.   
 
For clarity and context, I provide below the nine types of evidence and how they were used in 
this thesis. 
 
1. Research evidence : This means data, informati on, knowledge, or ideas obtained from 
research conducted purposely to aid the development of a particular policy.
<<<PAGE=141>>>
127 
 
 
2. Previous policies evidence : These are existing or erstwhile government policies, laws, 
regulations, guidelines, plans, and ideas issued by the government. These resources need 
to be documented to qualify as evidence. 
 
3. MDA evidence: This is the written submission of MDAs aimed to contribute to policy 
development. It also includes the verbal contributions of representatives of the MDA s 
during policy deliberations, or stakeholder engagements.   
 
4. Media evidence : This encompasses news items, articles, interviews or any material or 
resource obtained from the electronic or print media. 
 
5. External stakeholders’ evidence: This comprises inputs and views of foreign stakeholders 
including multilateral organisations located either in Nigeria or outside Nigeria. It also 
includes the inputs and views of Nigerians or Nigerian organisations based abroad. 
 
6. Ideology evidence: This refers to party manife stos and campaign promises made by a 
political party or its flag-bearers to the electorates. 
 
7. Residual knowledge of policymakers’ evidence: This is the expert knowledge or skills of 
the policymakers derived from their training and/or experience. This largely relates to the 
‘conceptual’ change in the behaviour of policymakers.    
 
8. Internet evidence : This is digital information and data obtained from the Internet, 
especially regarding policy issues from different jurisdictions . While this is not a perfect 
classification, it is a pragmatic response to the way policymakers approach evidence.         
 
9. Local consultants’ evidence : This consists of the views of local consultants, whether as 
formal input submitted to policymakers or as verbal contributions during policy 
deliberations or stakeholder engagement sessions. 
 
The qualitative data generated for this study was analysed in three interrelated stages (Neuman, 
2014). Generally, the analysis commenced with the data collection process as I listened to 
participants during interviews (O’Leary, 2014). This is the first stage of the analysis. This gave
<<<PAGE=142>>>
128 
 
me “some initial analytic interests or thoughts” which enabled me to have a reasonable 
understanding of the data from the very beginning (Braun and Clarke, 2006, p.87).  
  
Although I had intended to use the NVivo to facilitat e the development of codes, themes, and 
categories (Yin, 2014), I settled for a manual analysis (Adams et al., 2014) in the belief that it 
would make me more familiar with the data (Riger and Sigurvinsdottir, 2016). After the 
interviews, the voice recordings were transcribed by me verbatim (Bryman and Bell, 2011). I 
then listened to the transcribed interviews carefully once to confirm the accuracy of the 
transcription and to prepare myself for coding (Braun and Clarke, 2006).   
  
To be immersed in the data,  I read the data repeatedly to search for meanings, emotions, and 
patterns (Braun and Clarke, 2006) and took note of possible coding categories that may be 
developed further in subsequent analyses (Riger and Sigurvinsdottir, 2016). 
The second stage of the data analysis was the use of open coding which involved the conversion 
of raw data into concepts or themes (Neuman, 2014; Holton and Walsh, 2017). At this stage, I 
went through all the transcripts word by word and line by line and highlighted important themes 
that emerged. I also highlighted other themes that promised to be important. This iterative 
process was done for each of the 36 transcripts to discover incidents in the data (Holton and 
Walsh, 2017).  Throughout the open coding process, these questions  were at the back of my 
mind: “What is actually happening in the data?” and “What category does this incident 
indicate?” (Holton and Walsh, 2017, p.82). By asking these questions, and highlighting key 
and promising themes, I was able to unearth themes that were not very ‘visible’ within the raft 
of rich data (Neuman, 2014). 
Thirdly, I used axial coding (Neuman, 2014) to get a broad view of the responses of all the 
respondents against the various theme. This was helpful to me as it provided a general overview 
of the respondents’ views and thoughts against each of the themes. Importantly, it enabled me 
to see the whole picture of each respondent easily and clearly in terms of their category, and 
their opinion about the theme in reference, for example, regardin g kinds of evidence used in 
policy development. The coding also showed the interdependence and interconnectedness 
among the identified themes and the underlying conditions that gave rise to them (Saunders et 
al., 2012).
<<<PAGE=143>>>
129 
 
Finally, selective coding was used to obtain more detailed responses from the respondents 
which engendered a more extensive overview of the entire picture. At this stage, I went back 
to the data relating to each theme and organised them coherently to develop an empirically 
consistent account (Braun, and Clarke, 2006). This was to further strengthen the relationships 
in the data. Thus, concepts or themes that were not connected to the emerging account were 
disregarded (Chametzky, 2016) to create a “single storyline around which all else is dr aped” 
(Van der Merwe and De Villiers (2011, p.371). 
4.15. QUANTITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS  
Quantitative data analysis is the use of numerical data to assist the researcher to draw 
conclusions (Albers, 2017). For this study, quantifiable data were collected throu gh on-line 
questionnaires and analysed to determine the relative importance respondents attached to the 
nine kinds of evidence collectively identified by the respondents and me. As explained earlier, 
an on-line questionnaire was sent to the respondents requesting them to rank the evidence they 
believed were used in the development of NSIP in terms of how useful they thought they were 
in the policy-making process with 1 being the most useful and 9 the least useful.  
Rankings of individual evidence by respondents were scored in such a way that the higher an 
evidence was ranked, the higher it was scored in line with Table 3 below.  
TABLE 3: RANKING AND SCORE USED 
Ranking Score 
1 9 
2 8 
3 7 
4 6 
5 5 
6 4 
7 3 
8 2 
9 1
<<<PAGE=144>>>
130 
 
The table above shows that a ranking of 1 (the most useful evidence) was scored 9 (the highest 
possible score); a ranking of 2 was scored 8 (the second highest score); a ranking of 3 was 
scored 7; a ranking of 4 was scored 6; a ranking of 5 was scored 5; a  ranking of 6 was scored 
4; a ranking of 7 was scored 3; a ranking of 8 scored 2; and a ranking of 9 (the least useful 
evidence) was scored 1 (the lowest possible score).  
This ranking exercise, however, has two main limitations. First, it does not recogni se the 
relative distance between the different types of evidence. For instance, one evidence may be 
overwhelmingly preferred more than the next preferred, yet the first one can only score one 
point more than the other, thereby obfuscating the real value of the two kinds of evidence. 
Secondly, some evidence types have overlapping characteristics and can be associated with 
two or more sources. The Internet is the main evidence in this regard. For example, how would 
a previous policy obtained from the Internet  be classified? Previous policies evidence or 
Internet evidence? For clarity, where any of the other kinds of evidence was obtained from the 
Internet, the Internet was simply seen as a conveyor. Although this was explained to the 
respondents, the possibili ty that some evidence with overlapping characteristics might have 
been misclassified existed.  
For each case study, the total score for each of the nine types of evidence was computed to 
show respondents’ aggregate perception of the relative importance of each of the nine kinds of 
evidence. A hierarchy of evidence reflecting the respondents’ perceptions was developed for 
each of the case studies. 
To determine respondents’ aggregate perception of the relative usefulness of each of the nine 
types of evidence across the four policies (in other words, the most useful evidence type 
overall), the total score for each evidence in all the case studies was computed. The results 
were used to develop a hierarchy of evidence showing the evidence with the highest total score 
at the top and then cascading down to the one with the least total score at the base of the 
hierarchy. The hierarchy, therefore, captures the respondents’ aggregate perception of the 
relative usefulness of the nine types of evidence in a descending or der with the most useful 
evidence at the top and cascading to the base of the hierarchy where you have the least useful 
evidence. 
My research adopted a component framework for analysis as such data from the qualitative 
and quantitative methods maintained their originality with conclusions consolidated at the end
<<<PAGE=145>>>
131 
 
(Greene et al., 2011). This way, research questions were answered in a more focused manner 
since each method was meant to answer specific question(s). The consolidation weaved 
together conclusions from the two methods and presented a whole picture of the phenomenon 
investigated. 
4.16. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION  
Ethical research protects both the researcher and the subjects of the research (Cousin, 2009). 
This study was guided by ethical guidelines since it involved human participation (Saunders et 
al., 2012). Approval for the conduct of this research was obtained through the King’s College 
London’s Ethics Committee. Consistent with the approval, all respondents were availed of the 
Information Sheet which provided details of the research. The respondents also signed the 
Consent Form to indicate their willingness to participate in the study. 
 
4.17. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This chapter has demonstrated the methodological framework used in the conduct of this study. 
It shows an engaging use of triangulation to obtain data. It also demonstrated how I used both 
the qualitative and quantitative research methods in a systematic w ay for data analysis using 
the component framework for integration. 
 
The next four chapters present findings for Case Study 1 (NSIP), Case Study 2 (NiDCOM), 
Case Study 3 (NTP), and Case Study 4 (NWRP).

CHAPTER 5 
FINDINGS  FROM CASE STUDY 1: THE NATIONAL  
SOCIAL INVESTMENT  PROGRAMME  (NSIP) 
5.0. INTRODUCTION  
This Chapter presents findings from the fieldwork in respect of the first case study, the NSIP. 
The findings will attempt to answer the questions of this study. The chapter is divided into 
three sections. The first section provides a background to the case. Second, it presents findings 
against the themes that emanated from the literature and the data. Finally, it concludes by 
highlighting the major findings from the fieldwork.  
5.1. BACKGROUND  
Over the years, Nigeria has experienced dire developmental chall enges including extreme 
poverty, pervasive income inequality, limited economic opportunities, imbalanced access to 
social services, and significant infrastructural deficits. It has been argued that the causes of 
these challenges are predominantly economic and structural exemplified by the country’s high 
dependence on crude oil for foreign exchange earnings, unemployment, corruption, and 
ineffective public spending regimes. The results are predictable. About 44% of the country’s 
population of over 191 millio n lives in extreme poverty with more than 10 million children, 
the majority of them girls, out of primary school, and a primary school drop -out rate of 30% 
(ActionAid, 2018). At the end of the 4th quarter of 2015, unemployment rates were 19.0% and 
11.4% for youths aged 15‐24 and 25‐34 respectively (National Bureau of Statistics, 2016). To 
alleviate these challenges, particularly to lift people out of poverty, successive governments 
have implemented various social protection programmes with different degrees of success.    
Consequently, leading up to the 2015 presidential election in Nigeria, the All Progressives 
Congress (APC), which was the main opposition party to the then ruling Peoples’ Democratic 
Party (PDP) campaigned on the strength of a “Change Agenda” that rested on a tripod: tackling 
corruption, improving security, and revitalising the economy. A key feature of the “Change 
Agenda” as consistently articulated by the party throughout the campaign period was the 
creation of a social safety net programme to provide succour to poor and vulnerable Nigerians 
(The Nation, 2015).
<<<PAGE=147>>>
133 
 
Following its success at the polls in 2015, the APC led government created the National Social 
Investment Programmes (NSIP) aimed to combat poverty and unemployment by empowering 
the poor and vulnerable through direct support. The programme, which was created in 2015 
and launched in 2016, was derived from the National So cial Protection Policy (NSPP). The 
NSPP is a broad policy framework that promotes social justice, poverty alleviation and 
inclusive growth (National Social Protection Policy, 2017). The NSIP therefore underscores 
the vision of the APC government towards po verty eradication and grass -root economic 
empowerment. 
The NSIP has four components: 
5.1.1. Job Creation Programme (N-Power) 
The focus of the N-Power Programme is to help unemployed young Nigerians acquire life-long 
vocational skills that would improve the ir income and employability. Specifically, it targets 
100,000 non -graduates and 500,000 graduates, providing them with skills development 
trainings and paid work placement as teachers, health workers, social welfare workers, 
agriculturalist etc. The long-term objective of the programme is to engender sustainable large 
scale skill development and productivity. 
5.1.2.  Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP) 
The Home -Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP) provides food to primary school 
pupils with a view to encouraging enrolment into primary schools and retaining pupils in the 
schools. The targeted beneficiaries of the programme are 4 to 8 years old children who are not 
in school and those who are in school but are likely to abandon school to support their parents 
eke out a living. Other beneficiaries of the programme include local small farmers who supply 
the farm produce for the food and the cooks who prepare the food.     
5.1.3. Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) 
The Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program me is targeted at the poorest and most 
vulnerable households. The main purpose of the programme is to pull 5 million households out 
of poverty through the provision of a monthly cash transfer of N5,000 to the households. 
Further, the programme seeks to bui ld the capacity of beneficiaries in the areas of basic 
financial management, hygiene, and nutrition.
<<<PAGE=148>>>
134 
 
5.1.4.  Government Enterprise Empowerment Programme (GEEP) 
Through the Government Enterprise Empowerment Programme (GEEP), financial support and 
training are provided to micro, small and medium enterprises that often encounter significant 
challenges to access credit. The programme targets small scale farmers, workers in the 
agricultural value chain, market women, artisans, traders, industrious youth, and wom en co-
operative societies. Specifically, the programme aims to provide interest-free loans of N10,000 
to eligible Nigerians to boost their businesses.      
  
5.2. TYPES OF EVIDENCE  
This section analyses participants’ responses regarding the kinds of eviden ce policy makers 
felt were used in the development of the NSIP.   
First and foremost, the respondents I interviewed demonstrated a good grasp of evidence as a 
concept and its importance in policy making and implementation. Majority of them spoke with 
a commendable amount of understanding. A number of them stated that they had used or had 
participated in the use of evidence in policymaking. One of them said:  
Data helps you to understand things better. You need reliable data to plan before you start 
spending money. It helps you to achieve value for money…evidence tells you what you need to 
consider in policymaking (R9, Top-level Public Servant). 
 
It was observed, however, that the majority of them had a romantic view of evidence. They 
saw it as a panacea for ineffective policymaking and implementation. While this simplistic and 
overwhelmingly optimistic view of evidence is contrary to the reality that it is an acutely 
contentious concept, the respondents, nonetheless, demonstrated a good understanding of the 
varieties of evidence.  
Relying on the background presented above, my interviews and informal interactions with 
respondents, it is evident that quite a significant amount of evidence was used in the 
development and implementation of the NSIP. This position is buttressed by the fact that 
numerous stakeholders, representing different interests, participated in the development and 
implementation of the NSIP including legislators, MDAs, consultants, interest groups, and 
external organisations. Findings suggest t hat the diverse stakeholder participation was not an 
accident but a deliberate attempt to enable a wider utilisation of evidence. A top-level 
bureaucrat who had spent 10 years on the desk of Social Protection Human Capital
<<<PAGE=149>>>
135 
 
Development Division in the Ministry of Budget and National Planning, and who participated 
in the development of NSIP, had this to say:  
 A comprehensive consultation actually took place…The Governors’ Forum was key…and so 
was the National Assembly (federal legislators). And then we had a few line ministries that 
were key too – such as the labour and employment ministry, the education minis try, and the 
health ministry. UNICEF and the world bank played very huge roles…we conducted desk -
research and university professors also provided inputs in form of research, so the amount of 
evidence was quite commendable (R3, Top-level Public Servant). 
The statement above represented the general feeling of most respondents regarding their 
perception that multiple evidence was used in the development of the NSIP.  The majority of 
the respondents expressed satisfaction with the adequacy of the range of evide nce used to 
develop the policy under reference. Importantly, even non-state actors were “satisfied with the 
level of consultation”  (R8, Management Consultant) that took place. This is laudable and 
suggests a robust consultation process. Deeper scrutiny rev ealed that the government 
determined from the beginning that the implementation of the programme should be scientific 
and based on “inputs from the field” (R1, NSIP Top Management Executive).  The Vice 
President of Nigeria, who chaired the NSIP steering com mittee, clearly conveyed the 
government’s determination to the National Social Investment Office (NSIO) which was 
responsible for the implementation and coordination of the NSIP nationwide. Thus, the 
generation of primary data for the development and imple mentation of the NSIP, and indeed, 
the extensive consultation exercise for the programme was based on a deliberate attempt by the 
government to make the programme evidence-based.    
On that note, respondents identified nine different kinds of evidence they felt where used in the 
development and implementation of the NSIP as presented below.

The table above shows that the policy benefited from data and information from different 
sources. It also reveals a diverse participants’ perception of the kinds of evidence used in the 
development of NSIP. The percentage of people that identified the different kinds of evidence 
used in the development and implementation of NSIP are as follows:    
TABLE 5: TYPES OF EVIDENCE BY PERCENTAGE (NSIP)

The Table above shows that all the participants (100%) reported that ‘previous policies 
evidence’ and ‘residual knowledge of policy makers evidence’ were used in the development 
of NSIP. The main previous policy used in the development of the NSIP was the National 
Social Protection Policy (2017) which provided broad social protection principles. Inputs were
<<<PAGE=151>>>
137 
 
also obtained by the policymakers from the constitution of the country, alongside many 
relevant policies authored by different MDAs relating to social w elfare. In terms of ‘residual 
knowledge of policy makers evidence’, a number of the respondents stated that policymakers 
used a lot of the knowledge and skills they have garnered over the years during the development 
of the policy.       
In contrast, only four of the nine respondents (44.4%) felt ‘media evidence’ was used in the 
development or implementation of the NSIP. Majority of the respondents explained that the 
media were not formally consulted and that their inputs were not influential because 
policymakers did not consider them as adding real value to the process because they mostly 
dwell on “juicy negative stories” ( R1, NSIP Top Management Executive) . Historically, 
policymakers in Nigeria see the media as armchair critics who condemn policies without  
offering recommendations.  
A respondent went on to further explain:   
We have journalists who see nothing good in what we are doing, and they write just to tarnish 
what we are doing. When they write by just seeing their names, I know them. Some of it is 
politics, right? But as I often say even with the worst ever report, we have learned something 
to improve the NSIP (R1, NSIP Top Management Executive). 
Considering that similar programmes have been largely unsuccessful in the past, with some 
hijacked by powerful private interests, the media were expected to play a more influential role 
in the development and implementation of the NSIP. Across the respondents, the dominant 
view was that the media failed to set a positive agenda to situate the NSIP but instead favoured 
stories that put the NSIP in a bad light. Although a lot of the respondents did not feel that media 
evidence was used in the policy development, their admission that the media reported negative 
news regarding the NSIP meant that, indeed, the media performed their responsibility. And as 
we will see later, the so called “juicy negative stories” instigated a review of the policy and 
reshaped its implementation.  
While the general feeling of respondents about the media was negative, a few respondents held 
a favourable sentiment about the media and mentioned it as a source of evidence. One of such 
respondents stated that the media was a critical partner in the implementation of the NSIP and 
argued that the success recorded so far was partly because of the role played by the media to 
bring up issues that needed attention.
<<<PAGE=152>>>
138 
 
Actually, the media are playing their role of raising issues that need government attention. I 
believe th ey helped in influencing the (NSIP) policy by providing useful information to 
policymakers (R8, Management Consultant).  
One thing that is clear in all this is that although the government made deliberate efforts to get 
all stakeholders to contribute to th e development and implementation of the NSIP, the media 
were not formally invited. Considering that various other interest groups were invited, the 
absence of the media was curious. This absence was responsible for the perception of majority 
of the respondents who felt that ‘media evidence’ was not used in the development of the NSIP. 
It also contributed to the continuous tension that characterised the relationship between the 
policy drivers and implementers on the one hand and the media on the other hand.  
Notwithstanding the tension, however, the media drew considerable attention to the NSIP 
particularly when things went wrong. While they may not have offered realistic 
recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the programme, they fairly undertook the ir 
monitoring jobs, which led to the review of the NSIP.  
5.3. HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE  
This theme examines the relative importance respondents attached to the nine types of 
evidence. Respondents were requested to rank the nine types of evidence in order of how useful 
they were in the development of the NSIP. The respondents were guided by the information in 
Table 6. 
TABLE 6: Ranking Table (NSIP) 
Ranking Interpretation 
1 Most useful evidence 
2 2nd Most useful evidence

5 5th  Most useful evidence 
6 6th  Most useful evidence 
7 7th  Most useful evidence 
8 8th  Most useful evidence 
9 9th  Most useful evidence 
 
This means the respondents ranked the most useful evidence as ranked 1; the second most 
useful evidence was ranked 2; the third most useful evidence was ranked 3; the fourth most 
useful evidence was ranked 4; the fifth most useful evidence was ranked 5; the sixth most useful

evidence was ranked 6; the seven most useful evidence was ranked 7; the eight most useful 
evidence was ranked 8; and the ninth most useful evidence was ranked 9.

Respondents’ rankings of the nine kinds of evidence were turned into scores to reflect the 
relative weight the respondents accorded each type of evidence. This was done in such a way 
that the higher an evidence was ranked, the higher it was scored in line with Table 8.

The Table shows the total score for each of the nine kinds of evidence. The higher the score of 
a type of evidence, the more useful it was considered by the respondents. A review shows that 
the total scores for the nine types of evidence from the highest to the lowest are as follows:

The total scores were used to develop a hierarchy of evidence showing the evidence with the 
highest total score at the top and then cascading down to the one with the least total score at 
the base of the hierarchy as shown in figure 4 below.

FIGURE 4: HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE BASED ON DATA (NSIP) 
A review of the pyramid shows that ‘ideology evidence’ had the highest total score meaning 
respondents considered it as the most useful evidence. Eight out of the nine respondents ranked 
it as their number one (the most useful) evidence. This finding is not surprising considering 
that social safety  and poverty alleviation were major campaign promises made by the 
opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), when it was seeking the votes of the electorates.  
A legislator who was part of the senate committee responsible for poverty alleviation confirmed 
this position:  
Government ideology and party manifesto relate to the promises made to the electorates and 
citizens during electioneering campaigns, and the  economic direction the government wants 
to pursue. The government had promised the people it would pursue that policy prior to it being 
elected to power. These postures – the programmes, manifestoes and the economic and 
political direction of the ruling party had endeared the party to the people during election 
campaign which the government now pursues (R4, Legislator). 
Other respondents mentioned that in the development and implementation of the NSIP, the 
party manifesto was undoubtedly the most useful evidence. They argued that it was the promise

by government during the campaigns that served as the basis for the development of the NSIP. 
For example: 
The party manifesto represented the foundational basis for the programme. The programme 
was derived from that (the party manifesto) (R 8, Management Consultant). 
Evidence abounds that one of the main selling points used by the party during its campaign 
was poverty alleviation and investment in human capital. Electorates soon became aware of it 
and embraced it. Interestingly, the ruling party then, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) did 
not use that as a campaign issue but rather harped on other areas.  
The social orientation ideology of the APC’s presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, also 
played a role in reinforcing the promises of the party. All through his public life, Mr. Buhari 
was seen as an honest and frugal leader who fought to improve the lives of the masses, 
particularly in areas of security and the economy. Buhar inomics, his economic blueprint 
includes increased state investment in social welfare to lift the poor and the vulnerable out of 
poverty. Thus, the social democratic aura of Mr Buhari played a role in the party adopting the 
welfare ideology as its key campaign promise. 
In support of this argument, it was found that the N5000 quoted by Buhari when he was 
campaigning to be elected president was the exact amount ultimately adopted as the amount of 
support for the poor and vulnerable under the Conditional Cash Transfer component of the 
NSIP indicating a connection between Mr Buhari’s personality, the party’s manifesto and the 
NSIP. This point was alluded to by a respondent:  
…When President Buhari as a contestant was touring the country, he really made the point  
that a lot of Nigerian people were poor and he promised to distribute N5000 to them if elected 
(R7, University Professor). 
Thus, the amount prescribed under the Conditional Cash Transfer “was tied to that 
proclamation” (R2, Supranational Organisation) which policy makers simply ratified. Thus, in 
addition to the campaign promise, the new government was very determined to ensure that its 
welfare promise was fulfilled. This is because no matter how well advocates had justified the 
need for NSIP, it would have amounted to nothing if the government did not throw its political 
weight behind the proposal - a point reinforced below. 
I do believe that when it comes to policies no group has the ability to create policy without the 
political will of elected political leaders. So I could say there was significance influence from 
the political manifesto and political goal of the administration which influenced the policy. The
<<<PAGE=157>>>
143 
 
programme was influenced by what the administration has set out to achieve  (R2, 
Supranational Organisation). 
In contrast, media evidence was considered the least useful evidence. This is an interesting 
finding, and it aligns with the finding in the previous theme where media evidence was reported 
as the least used source of evidence in the developme nt and implementation of the NSIP. So, 
it means media evidence was both the least used and the least useful evidence in the 
development and implementation of the NSIP. Many respondents admitted that they: 
Were sceptical about the input of the media because majority of them were either sensational 
or not contextual. So, if you want specific, contextual and unemotional input, the media is 
probably not the first place you would go (R3, Top-level Public Servant). 
The statement above largely captures the approach of most media outfits in Nigeria. Whereas 
they are reasonably effective in identifying problems, they are poor in providing solutions to 
the problems they identify. In that regard, their interventions turned out not very helpful to the 
policymakers who had to look elsewhere for solutions often from individuals or organisations. 
When the reality of “bounded rationality” is added to the mix, it becomes clearer why the 
policymakers would rather get their evidence from sources other than the media. 
Evidence from the findings, therefore, suggests that while respondents considered government 
ideology and party manifesto as the most useful evidence, they were sceptical of media input 
which resulted in that evidence type not considered very useful during policy development and 
implementation. Thus, the consensus that ideology was the most useful evidence in the 
development and implementation of the NSIP was largely because the party made it its main 
campaign promise which the electorates accepted. Little wonder that once inaugurated, the 
NSIP was one of the first policies the new APC government implemented. In contrasts, the 
media was seen as the least useful evidence by the respondents partly because of the historical 
tension between Nigerian policymakers and the media, which manifested in the media not 
being formally invited to contribute to the NSIP. The inability of the media to engage in robust 
editorials to offer credible recommendations to the NSIP challenges also contributed to the 
poor ratings of the media by the respondents. Yet, as we will see shortly, evidence from the 
media played an influential role in engendering a review of the programme.
<<<PAGE=158>>>

5.4. INTEGRATION OF EVIDENCE  
The previous section examined the relative importance respondents attached to the different 
kinds of evidence they identified as having been used in the development and implementation 
of NSIP. This section discusses the way the different evidence types were integrated in the 
policy process. 
This study found out that the NSIP was a government -driven policy developed through a 
continuous collaboration between state and non -state actor. The collaboration involved 
consultation, discussions, arguments, iteration, and integration of the different evidence types. 
The study also found that the collaborations took place on three formal sites. These were the 
sites where the various types of evidence were considered for possible integration into policy 
proposals.  
The first site was an int er-ministerial steering committee comprising ministers of Health, 
Education, Finance, Budget and Planning, Labour and Employment, and Women Affairs. This 
high-level committee was responsible for synthesising and refining the various evidence types 
into a f airly recognisable policy proposal. It also had policy oversight responsibility on the 
implementation of the entire programme. The steering committee, chaired by the Vice 
President of Nigeria, undertook the integration of the various evidence types and the design of 
an implementation plan to guide the administration of the entire NSIP. The calibre of the 
members of the committee meant that the committee possessed significant influence which it 
used to achieve its objectives. This was important because NSIP was a cross -cutting 
programme that affected different ministries; and to succeed, all the ministries had to play their 
part.  The Vice President, whose office coordinated the NSIP, was very involved in the 
activities of the committee and ensured that other minister members participated fully.  
The VP took it as his project and he made sure everything went well, he led by example. And 
because he was fully involved, all the ministers also got involved fully (R3, Top-level Public 
Servant).  
The committee met severally, and discussions were tailored to determine the best way to 
address the identified problem. Although it was an inter -ministerial steering committee, with 
focus on inputs from the MDAs, some inputs were obtained from outside the MDAs. To further 
improve the instrumental dimension of the steering committee, a technical sub-committee was
<<<PAGE=159>>>
145 
 
established to give civil servants that had cognate experience an opportunity to make 
contributions as mentioned by a respondent:  
One of the things they also suggested at the steering committee meeting was, why don’t you 
nominate civil servants who had done some works in this area, maybe grants or employment 
issues and lets have a technical advisory committee so that you can consult them…so we set 
up a technical advisory committee (R1, NSIP Top Management Executive). 
Part of the responsibilities of the technical advisory committee was to employ the knowledge 
and experience of its members to determine which suggestions were more practically feasible 
with a view to impro ving policy outcomes. Members of the technical committee were senior 
civil servants who had considerable requisite experience. It was unsurprising that the 
committee played a key role in the design and implementation phase of the programme. During 
those periods, the inter-ministerial steering committee requested advice on a number of issues 
including budgeting, funding options, and empowerment. To arrive at a decision, or advise the 
inter-ministerial steering committee, the technical committee considered al l available inputs 
and engaged in robust deliberations. This indicates that the technical committee served as a 
sub-integration site that fed the larger inter-ministerial steering committee.   
A member of the technical committee explains:   
In the technical committee when we started, like in the N -power (Job Creation Programme), 
we brought people from Ministry of Labour which I was part of, then Ministry of Works, 
National Planning Commission, people from National Directorate of Employment, and all the 
MDAs that were directly related to the programme. Ministry of  Trade, Industry and 
Investment, and (the Ministry of) Women Affairs…they brought their inputs which we put  
together to solve the social menace (R3, Top-level Public Servant).  
The second site for integration of evidence was found in the various stakeholder workshops 
and meetings held at the instance of the steering committee. Respondents reported that although 
the executive arm of government drove the process, it was largely effective. For example:   
The evidence gathered were validated across stakeholder workshops at the national and sub -
national governments. Deliberations in the workshops were usually very robust and rigorous. 
During deliberations, the different evidence  types were considered, and viable ones accepted 
or refined so one can say the texture of the NSIP was formed at these workshops. (Thereafter) 
consensus was built and a final document was adopted and launched (R3 Top-level Public 
Servant).
<<<PAGE=160>>>
146 
 
Another respondent agreed: 
Policy makers as well as relevant stakeholders both local and international had regular 
brainstorming sessions that were driven by the executive arm of government. ( R9, top-level 
public servant). 
It was noted that the various stakeholder workshops and meetings provided an opportunity for 
both the generation and integration of evidence. Indeed, many stakeholders, including 
academics and supranational organisations (UNICEF and the World Bank), offere d technical 
support in the form of expertise and guidance during these engagements. Some consultants and 
academics conducted primary research that provided raw data and recommendations which 
were analysed at the workshops and meetings.  
Further, some prospective beneficiaries of the NSIP were engaged to obtain their views. This 
is salutary because it was the first time that such engagement took place as far as social 
investment programmes in the country is concerned. It also affirms the government’s 
determination to avoid the mistakes of the past when such programmes were formulated and 
implemented without recourse to critical stakeholders including prospective beneficiaries. The 
point also needs to be stressed that although the media were not formally invited to contribute 
their inputs despite their known criticism of previous social welfare programmes (as is the case 
with some national policies in Nigeria), commentaries in the media contributed to shaping the 
development, implementation, and review of the NSIP.  
The final integration site was found in a platform for the review of the NSIP when the 
government realised weaknesses in the original NSIP, after about one and half years of 
implementation. The review exercise involved selected stakeholders, with a l ocal consulting 
firm leading the exercise. From 2016 and 2020, the firm was actively involved in supporting 
the National Social Investment Office (NSIO) which was established to coordinate NSIP 
nationwide. In that role, the firm designed program -related st rategies relating to digital 
technology, program delivery, operational efficiency, and coordination.  
A respondent from the firm explains:   
So, the initiation (for the review) started from the government and the right stakeholders were 
pulled into the roo m at different times including private firms which were my team and two 
other teams, one local one foreign, government representatives , donors, and academics (R8, 
Management Consultant).
<<<PAGE=161>>>
147 
 
Driven by the lead firm, the stakeholders undertook a holistic review of the NSIP ascertaining 
what had worked and what had not worked. In the process, previous information was 
interrogated, and new ones obtained, considered, refined, and utilised. At this point, the 
programme had elicited different kinds of comments in the country. Many of the beneficiaries 
of the programme applauded the government and expectedly turned themselves into the 
programme’s most ardent defenders. A few of the beneficiaries, and in some cases supposed 
beneficiaries, however, complained particularly about lack of, or delay in payment of their 
stipends. A lot of commentators also gave credit to the government with oth ers pointing out 
areas that needed to be improved. A few others, however, condemned the programme in its 
entirety. These comments in the media were responsible for the review of the policy, especially 
its implementation as recalled by a respondent who participated in the review.    
As we move into execution (of the NSIP), certain realities cropped up that started to let us 
know that there was more that we needed to do to straighten the policy, to evolve the policy, 
so that it would be more realistic when it  comes to execution. So, in addition to existing 
information from the original policy, we got primary information from several interviews, from 
beneficiaries, from everyone. We (then) brought everyone back into the room…The academics 
and government stakeho lders… So we will take that information as feedback to update and 
review what we have done. We can’t move pass any issue until we have agreed on it, that 
means we were not doing it out of our own understanding without the experts also in the room 
(R 8, Management Consultant). 
The government’s reason for appointing a private firm to lead the review was to improve 
NSIP’s effectiveness considering that the programme was already being implemented. To let 
the civil service to undertake or lead the review would h ave exposed it to bureaucratic 
bottlenecks which the government could ill -afford. Yet, the government knew that the civil 
service needed to be part of the review to provide critical information and support. The civil 
service played its part to the satisfac tion of the firm and contributed to the success of the 
review. 
In a nutshell, the firm undertook the following three important interrelated tasks during the 
review of the NSIP.  
1. Conducted new primary research to obtain additional information and new insights to assist 
in the review exercise. 
2. Led the redesign of the NSIP to address identified shortcomings of the subsisting one.
<<<PAGE=162>>>
148 
 
3. Participated in the implementation of the programme. 
The general idea regarding the integration of evidence was that various stakeh olders came 
together and deliberated which led to a “granular cross -fertilisation of ideas” ( R9, Top-level 
Public Servant). Indeed, each of the three integration sites highlighted provided a platform on 
which different kinds of evidence were integrated, le ading to the development and 
implementation of the NSIP.   
5.5. THE ROLE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATORS  
For this study, the NSIP is seen as a legislative policy since it needed the input and approval of 
the legislative arm of government (Ibrahim, 2004). Indeed, th e two arms of the Nigerian 
legislature (Senate and House of Representatives) played important roles in shaping the policy 
and its outcome. For one, the implementation of the policy involved appropriation of public 
funds which is a constitutional responsibility of the legislature. The sum of five hundred billion 
Naira annually which was  “the first time money of that amount” was invested in any social 
empowerment programme in the country, was appropriated by the legislators ( R1, NSIP Top 
Management Executive). Although the NSIP and the required budgetary approval received the 
overwhelming support of the legislators, the devil was in the details. Findings show that many 
legislators had vested interests in the NSIP. All the respondents that had an enga gement with 
the legislators alluded to a growing tension in the relationship between the managers of the 
NSIP and the legislators. A respondent gives an insight into the relationship:   
We had some of them that understood what we were trying to do, but many of them were like, 
“we are the grass roots people so we should know what is happening, you should come through 
us.” They think, why are you going and selecting people from our constitu encies without 
coming through us? Many of them say “no, we cannot appropriate money at federal level for 
you to spend at state level.”…You know it’s not really about Nigeria, it is about how it is going 
to impact on somebody’s popularity…But the President and Vice President have been very 
clear about this, maybe they are not typical politicians they say these programmes are about 
Nigerians, whether they voted for them or not they are entitled to the impact of government so 
it is about the social contract be tween every citizen irrespective of your class, political 
affiliation, your culture or religion (R1, NSIP Top Management Executive). 
In hindsight, many of the legislators felt the state governors were getting all the credit and the 
potential electoral benefits while they got nothing even though they were the ones doing the 
appropriation. So, clearly, the legislators were more concerned about how their constituencies 
would benefit from the programme through them to improve their chances of getting re -
<<<PAGE=163>>>
149 
 
elected. The argument of the National Social Investment Office (NSIO) for a centralised 
federal arrangement that would treat all eligible people equally and improve the transparency 
of the process fell on deaf ears.  
Indeed, many legislators who were members of t he committee for poverty alleviation, which 
had oversight on the NSIP, were not favourably disposed to the NSIP as currently developed. 
They would rather the money was used for direct investment in their constituencies, to be 
supervised by them. A legislator who was a member of the committee in the Senate offered a 
different viewpoint on how the N500b should have been spent:  
When we met the VP (Vice President of Nigeria), I advised that the N500b should be divided 
to the 774 local governments which would t ranslate into N649 million for each state and 
divided by three, you have N215m (which) could be used to establish a cottage industry the 3 
senatorial districts in each state. I did my research and found that N180m could build a cottage 
industry. But they did something else which I am not in support of (R4, Legislator). 
While the policy preference of the legislators may have been driven by research and 
constituency considerations, it also indicates the possibility that it was in furtherance of their 
self-interest. This is because the Nigerian National Assembly, with the knowledge of the 
executive arm of government, has long devised a ‘constituency project’ arrangement where 
legislators identify critical constituency projects for funding with the legislators u ndertaking 
“legislative oversight” on the project. The said oversight includes determining the contractor 
or vendor to handle the project. Expectedly, the arrangement has been described as an 
aberration and as such has continued to receive increasing public backlash.  
Meanwhile, other legislators wanted each legislator to be given the welfare amount to be 
distributed to their constituencies to enhance their chances of being re -elected. One of the 
legislators asked pointedly: “you did not come through us how can we be elected next time?” 
(R1, NSIP Top Management Executive ). The legislators’ attempts to control the NSIP is, 
therefore, motivated by their self -interest including their desire for influence to enhance their 
chances of re -election. This line of rea soning represented the sentiments of majority of the 
legislators.  
Unsurprising, significant tension was evident in the relationship between the managers of the 
NSIP and the legislators. Most of the legislators, while not openly condemning the programme 
for fear of electoral backlash since majority of the citizens were happy with it, antagonised the 
managers of the programme in the parliament, away from the public.
<<<PAGE=164>>>
150 
 
A high-ranking member of the NSIP executive team reflects:  
The parliament gives us money and I still have apprehension when I appear before them and 
they still don’t understand. I have argued with them many  times. They said I would come 
round to their way of thinking. I said just get me out of the job because I won’t come round to 
your way of thinking because if it’s politics you like to play, go and get a politician. I cannot. 
It’s like asking me to speak Spanish I cannot speak Spanish, I don’t have that sense at all, I 
don’t  know how to integrate into your…(R1, NSIP Top Management Executive). 
Findings suggest that the legislators’ viewpoint was predicated on how similar programmes in 
the past were managed (actually mismanaged). They were thus fixated on the old ways of 
welfare distribution in Nigeria where resou rces were mostly given to elected or executive 
members of the government for onward distribution to citizens. This hangover still lingers and 
was at the core of the tension between the NSIP managers and the legislators. Clearly, the 
legislators could not understand why there should be a change in the way such programme are 
administered. Understandably, there were significant pressures from them to hijack the 
programme or to at least change the implementation to suit them. In a sense, the attitude of the 
legislators underscores the thinking of typical politicians who usually sacrifice national 
interests for their personal ones. 
All through the battle between the NSIP officials and the legislators, the President and the Vice 
President supported the former, whi ch was why the programme achieved the success it did. 
Like the President, the Vice President was also passionate about the unemployed, the weak, 
and the vulnerable in society. He did not shy away from brandishing these credentials and  
supported the impleme ntation of the NSIP as conceived by the National Social Investment 
Office (NSIO).  
The tension between those who supported the implementation of the NSIP as conceived by the 
NSIO, including the President and the Vice President, and the legislators, was largely based on 
differences in motives. While the legislators wanted to see the NSIP as part of their 
“constituency project” for which they should undertake “legislative oversight”, the President 
and his tribe preferred the NSIP to be seen and implemented as  a national social intervention 
designed to empower deserving Nigerians irrespective of political, religious, or tribal 
affiliations. Sadly, the battle continued to fester with noticeable implications. Principally, the 
NSIO continued to battle the legislators for the control of the programme, and considering the 
constitutional power of the legislators, they were able to exert influence. They put the managers 
of the programme under constant legislative searchlight and continued to seek concessions
<<<PAGE=165>>>
151 
 
from not only the managers of the NSIP but also from  the executive arm of government . Of 
course, these actions negatively impacted the efficiency and effectiveness of the NSIP.   
5.6. GOVERNING THE POLICY PROCESS  
The previous section has provided an insight into the tension between federal legislators and 
the managers of the NSIP and other stakeholders in a way that is quite revealing even if 
unsurprising. This section will further provide the thoughts of responden ts regarding the way 
the government influenced and governed the policy development process.  
 
All the respondents I interviewed strongly believed that the government was “largely 
responsible” for the policy development process ( NSIP Top Management Executiv e). The 
policy development process shows that the government control led the process in three main 
ways. First, the government decided which stakeholders to invite which means it had the power 
to include stakeholders sympathetic to it and exclude those it f elt would not support its vision 
or be antagonistic to it. In other words, the government reserved the power to decide who it 
invited to the table. This practice is common and remains one of the most enduring features of 
governments’ influence on the polic y process. From the collective explanations of some 
respondents, it was apparent that there was a discussion about whom to invite. Invitations to 
participate in the policy development were extended to only those regarded as friendly to the 
government’s pol icies. The omission of the media in the process is seen in this light and 
affirmed the government’s control. The statement of one of the respondents who thought in 
that line is apt: 
 
The government and the media are always at each other’s throat so why inv ite someone you 
knew would cause you one or two problems? (R9, Top-level Public Servant) 
 
However, a few respondents saw it differently. They believed the government did not need to 
formally invite the media to derive the benefits of extending an invitation since the views of 
the media are an open secret. One of those who shared this view commented: 
 
I am not sure the government deliberately omitted the media…they did not need to be physically 
present, but their messages and commentaries were usefu l during the exercise, especially the 
review and implementation of the policy (R 8, Management Consultant).
<<<PAGE=166>>>
152 
 
 
Whatever might have been the case, the fact remains that the government decided not to 
formally invite the media to the table, reinforcing the argu ment that it had the power to select 
the stakeholders to participate in the policy process. Notwithstanding, the media contributed 
significantly to the policy, especially in review. The continuous monitoring of the 
implementation of the programme and its c ritical stand on some parts of the implementation 
no doubt provided a fillip for a review.  
 
Second, the government provided ‘terms of reference’ (ToR) to the various committees and 
organs that were established to deliver specific deliverables. Starting with the inter-ministerial 
steering committee, then the technical committee and finally the review committee, the 
government specifically ensured that they all were aware of, and abided by the scope and 
limitations of the work they were required to do. The T oR spelt out what they could do and 
what they could not. A respondent provided insights into what the government achieved with 
the ToR: 
The idea was to give every stakeholder the right to contribute meaningfully to the emerging 
policy but within the limits  allowed by the strategic objectives of government (R3, Top-level 
Public Servant). 
 
The statement above confirms that although the government made use of multiple sources of 
evidence and encouraged increased stakeholder participation in policy development and 
implementation, it still restricted the breath of evidence by determining what should be “on the 
table” and what s hould be “off the table”. For instance, the government ensured that all 
stakeholders recognised that equity was a major concern to ensure the success of the policy. 
Both the President and the Vice President were strong advocates of embedding equity in the 
NSIP. As a result, at every available occasion, policymakers were reminded by the Vice 
President to ensure that the development and implementation of the policy were based on 
equity. One of the respondents reflected on the influence of the Presidency:    
 
From day one, it was something the Vice President said to us, we needed to be guided by equity, 
because one of the things that could shut down our programmes is if there is no equity. As I 
say to people equity and inclusiveness from the very beginning were  things we sought... We 
were clear that if we didn’t address some of those weaknesses (of lack of equity in the past),
<<<PAGE=167>>>
153 
 
our programmes would slide back into what was happening before and we will not go round 
(cover Nigeria) (R1, NSIP Top Management Executive).  
Consequently, the stakeholders bought into government’s vision and made equity and 
inclusiveness central features in all the four interventions within the NSIP suite. In furtherance 
to that, the policymakers adopted an innovative methodology using a c ommunity-based, self-
identification approach to determine who qualified for some of the interventions. Supported by 
the World Bank, the policymakers went to the field and obtained data directly from the targeted 
communities regarding who was poor and deserving of the NSIP empowerment.              
 A respondent who was a key player in the use of the methodology confirmed how it was used: 
Based on what the government wanted, we went to the community and asked them, it was also 
like a self-assessment. The question is always how do you know who is poor? In the past that 
question has always been answered incorrectly and has actually been the reason why we had 
a lot of exclusion errors in targeting…the idea was to get it right from the targeting. So , the 
community themselves nominated people, that way people can counteract…when all have 
agreed then there was an initial list and a testing approach by World Bank methodology for 
testing the poorest. We made use of the methodology as against the criteria listed, and t he 
national cut off of defining the poor from the NBS (Nigerian Bureau of Statistics) (R2, 
Supranational Organisation).  
It is evident from the quote above that embedding equity in the NSIP was an “order” the 
government gave to all stakeholders who partici pated either in the policy development or 
implementation to ensure that mistakes of the past were avoided. The main story here is that 
the policy is a government policy and the government provided direction and guidance on how 
it should be designed. Within the senior civil servants, several respondents agreed that the 
regular reminders by the Vice President and the ToR were useful in setting contexts and limits. 
Beyond political control, however, the ToR performed a very critical instrumental function . 
They ensured that policymakers only expended their energy on those things that were important 
and useful in pursuit of the government’s objectives. 
The third and final way the government controlled the policy development process was  by 
making itself the final gatekeeper in the process. Whereas the policymakers and the committees 
were able to make recommendations and take smaller decisions, only the government had the 
power to approve major decisions. In other words, the government was the final approving 
authority for both the development and implementation of the policy. The overriding influence 
of the government was noticeable even where it gave non -state actors the opportunity to 
participate in, or even lead some aspect of the policy process. In that regard, the non-state actors
<<<PAGE=168>>>
154 
 
were obligated to submit their reports or recommendations for the consideration and approval 
of the government. Of course, recommendations or decisions that were not in line with the 
government's vision or strategic objectives were not allowed to see the light of day. A case in 
point is the review of the NSIP led by a local consulting firm where the government had to 
amend a few things in the draft reviewed policy to reflect what the government wanted. 
 
It is apposite to mention t hat one of the main reasons why the government made use of non -
state actors in the policy process was lack of sufficient expertise in some policy areas. 
Nonetheless, sovereignty lies with the government and not the non -state actors, hence the 
government protected its sovereign authority by ensuring that the actions of the non-state actors 
were consistent with the government’s vision. As aptly captured by a respondent: 
 
The government wanted the programmes to succeed and invested a lot of resources. But you 
know government has limitation as regards technical stuff so it invited the private sector to 
provide its expertise…yet the government supervised (the private sector)…so that things went 
right  (R3, Top-level Public Servant). 
In the development and implementation of the policy, three state players were the most 
influential. The first one was the inter-ministerial steering committee, which was a high-level 
committee responsible for determining the broad principles of the policy.  The committee was 
also responsible for administrative oversight on the implementation of the NSIP. The second 
one was the National Social Investment Office (NSIO), responsible for the actual 
implementation of the policy as well as its coordination across the country. The last one was 
the legislators who were responsible for budgeting and legislative oversights. As can be clearly 
seen, each of these state players exerted significant controlling influence within its 
“jurisdiction”. Yet, it is when their resp onsibilities are aggregated that their impact on 
controlling the policy process becomes apparent. Together, they worked in a complementary 
way and shaped the policy process within a rigidly controlled policy environment.   
 5.7. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This chapter presented empirical findings from the first case study of this research, the National 
Social Investment Programmes.  
The findings from the chapter show that respondents exhibited a good knowledge of evidence 
and its importance in policymaking. Findings also show that multiple sources of evidence were
<<<PAGE=169>>>
155 
 
used in the development of the NSIP debunking widely held view that policy making in Nigeria 
is evidence deficient.  
Evidence from the chapter reveals that ‘ideology evidence’ was considered the most useful 
evidence with eight out of the nine respondents ranking it number one. The high value of the 
ideology of the government in policy development and implementation was because the 
programme was based on the campaign promises of the APC pol itical party and the social 
democratic credentials of the president. In contrast, ‘media evidence’ was considered the least 
useful evidence largely on account of the scepticism regarding its relevance and accuracy.  Yet, 
findings from the collective respon ses of the respondents show that media evidence played a 
major role in highlighting weaknesses in the implementation process which led to a review of 
the policy.   
Findings indicate that the different evidence types gathered were integrated at three formal  
sites. The first one was an inter -ministerial steering committee, chaired by the Vice President 
of Nigeria, comprising ministers of health, education, finance, budget and planning, labour and 
employment, and women affairs. The second site was various stak eholder workshops and 
meetings held at the instance of the steering committee. The last integration site was the various 
sessions held for the review of the NSIP when the government realised the need for 
amendments to the original NSIP to make it more effe ctive, after about one and half years of 
implementation. 
The Findings also indicate that the federal legislators played a key role in both the development 
and implementation of the NSIP. In addition to their constitutional role of fund appropriation 
for the implementation of the NSIP, they also provided ideas and oversight functions for the 
programme. However, there were evidence of significant tension between the managers of the 
NSIP and the legislators. Respondents who engaged with the legislators reporte d that many 
legislators attempted to maximise their self -interests particularly their electoral value in the 
process of developing and implementing the programme. The continuous battle for the control 
of the NSIP, manifested in a number of ways particularl y in the passage of the programme’s 
budgets and in seeking concessions from the implementers of the programme. This invariably 
affected the smooth running of the programme. 
Finally, this section shows that even though multiple stakeholders participated in the 
development of the policy, the government had the largest influence in governing the policy 
process to suit its strategic objectives. The non -inclusion of some stakeholders and
<<<PAGE=170>>>
156 
 
government’s power to change the policy during implementation reinforced the notion that the 
government largely controlled the policy process. Notwithstanding, it was evident that the 
government made effort to ensure that equity was embedded in the development and 
implementation of the NSIP which differentiated the NSIP from simi lar programmes in the 
past where social welfare was used as a tool for selfish political purposes. 
The next chapter will present findings on the second case, the Nigerians in Diaspora 
Commission policy (NiDCOM).

CHAPTER 6 
FINDINGS  FROM CASE STUDY 2 – THE NIGERIANS  IN 
DIASPORA  COMMISSION  (NIDCOM) 
6.0. INTRODUCTION  
The Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) is an agency established by the Nigerian 
government to protect the Nigerian diaspora community's interest and provide  a formal 
platform for engagement between the government and the diaspora community for the benefit 
of Nigeria. The commission was established in 2019 pursuant to the Nigerians in Diaspora 
Commission (Establishment) Act, 2017.  
The history of the Nigerian government’s engagement with the diaspora community is long 
and episodic. As a background, the evolution of the Nigerian diaspora community is 
attributable to certain political and economic factors. Indeed, years of military dictatorship and 
a growing national economic crisis instigated a deluge of emigration from Nigeria (Adebayo, 
2011). Thus, like in many countries, Nigeria’s emigrants left the country either to escape a 
hostile political environment or to enjoy the economic incentives offered by develope d 
countries (Hunger 2002, 1).  
Invariably linked to emigration from Nigeria is the issue of brain drain as most of the emigrants 
are trained professionals like doctors, nurses, engineers, and academics (Adebayo, 2011). Brain 
drain as a concept is believed to have emerged on the global scene in the 1960s to describe the 
migration of European professionals to the United States of America for greener pastures 
(Adebayo, 2011; Akinrinade and Ogen, 2011). With time, Latin America and Asia were 
affected by the brain drain bug followed closely by Africa (Adebayo, 2011). The issue of brain 
drain occupies a particularly important place in Nigeria’s development efforts because it is 
widely seen as a key contributory factor to Nigeria’s underdevelopment (Fagite, 2018; Nwozor, 
e al., 2022).  
Scholars’ perception of brain drain has come full circle. Earlier literature largely views brain 
drain exclusively from the lenses of losses to the countries of the emigrants (Akinrinade and 
Ogen, 2011; Hunger 2002). This is the main argument of the brain drain theory, which holds 
that brain drain depletes the human capital stock of the emigrants’ home countries, thereby 
adversely affecting the countries’ quest for economic development (Adebayo, 2011). Indeed,
<<<PAGE=172>>>
158 
 
modernisation and depende nce theories consider brain drain as “one of the most important 
causes of under-development in the Third World” (Hunger, 2002, p.1). 
As argued by Artuç et al., (2015, p.6) many home countries, especially developing countries 
“are deeply concerned about ret aining their most skilled workers, whose absence ultimately 
impinges upon their long-term economic and political development.” In that regard, some hard-
line proponents of this notion are of the view that to address the issue and stimulate the 
economic gro wth of affected countries, emigrants must remigrate to their home countries 
(Adebayo, 2011).   
During the 1990s, however, a new school of thought emerged within the brain drain discourse. 
Champions of this school contend that migration of skilled workers should not be seen only in 
terms of loss but as a potential gain for the home countries of the migrants in what is referred 
to as brain gain (Hunger, 2002). Brain gain according to Adebayo (2011, p.71), is when “the 
negative effects of brain drain are rever sed, rolled back, and turned into great advantage.” In 
other words, the emerging literature argues that emigration can be used to accelerate a country’s 
growth and development. 
In a well -written article in response to the growing argument that emigration “ has almost 
exclusively negative impacts on the Third World” (Hunger 2002, p.1), Clemens and Sandefur 
(2014) demonstrate how migration is beneficial not only to the national economies of home 
countries of emigrants but also to the world economy. They reported that a World Bank study 
estimates that in 2012, remittances from migrants to developing economies were over $400 
billion with such flow accounting for over 20% of the GDP of small economies such as Nepal 
and Liberia. According to them, research has show n that upon migration from a developing 
country to a developed one, the economic value of migrants rises by a minimum of 60 per cent 
thereby increasing the size of the global economy. On his part, Hunger (2002) uses the example 
of the IT industry in India to show how remigration could significantly contribute to a country’s 
economic development. Indeed, the 1970s and 1980s witnessed the migration of Indian IT 
professionals to the US raising serious concerns for the Indian government at that time but the 
migrants started returning to India in the year 2000 largely because of a slump in the US IT 
sector leading to significant growth in the Indian IT industry (Chacko, 2007).   
Bacchi (2016) summarises three avenues through which brain gain can be achieved. The first 
is when migration by highly skilled citizens motivates the remaining population to acquire
<<<PAGE=173>>>
159 
 
marketable education to improve their chances of migration which could potentially be useful 
to the home country regardless of whether they eventually migrate.  The second is when 
migrants’ remittances support household expenditures while the third occurs when migrants 
return home to use their skills, knowledge, and experiences for the betterment of their country.      
Back to Nigeria. Long before the emergence o f the brain drain discourse in the 1990s, the 
Nigerian government recognized the need to engage its diaspora community for national 
development. As a result, in the 1970s, the government started collaborating with the diaspora 
community to enhance national  economic development (Nigerians in Diaspora Commission 
n.d.) and promote Nigerian foreign policy (Wapmuk et al., 2014). 
While the government’s efforts achieved some relative success, the efforts were largely 
unstructured, and it was not until the 1990s, w hen the issue of brain drain and migration of 
skilled workers from developing countries to their developed counterparts became a global 
issue, that Nigeria began to take the engagement more seriously (Nigerians in Diaspora 
Organisation, n.d.). Consequently , more engagements took place between the Nigerian 
government and the Nigerian diaspora community, culminating in the establishment of the 
Nigerians in Diaspora Organization (NIDO) in 2001 as a non -profit-making organization 
(Wapmuk et al., 2014). The broa d objective of the organisation was to provide an effective 
platform for technocrats, policymakers, intellectuals, and all Nigerian citizens in the diaspora 
to contribute to national growth and development (Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation, n.d.).  
To ma ke NIDO more effective, the government provided it with an office in the Federal 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Akinrinade and Ogen, 2011) and directed all foreign missions to 
support the growth of the organisation (Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation, n.d.).  NIDO also 
established a presence in Nigerian embassies abroad (Akinrinade and Ogen, 2011). Ultimately, 
the organisation became the single body recognised by the Nigerian government as the 
umbrella body for all Nigerians in the diaspora (Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation, n.d.). 
In addition to NIDO, the government established the Nigerian National Volunteer Services 
(NNVS), under the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation to among other 
things address the issue of brain drain (Akinrinade and Ogen, 2011). Also, the National 
Migration Policy, an administrative policy, was developed in 2015 to serve as an overarching 
document in the management of migration and diaspora in Nigeria (International Organisation 
for Migration, 2015).
<<<PAGE=174>>>
160 
 
In all, the government’s desire to o rganize its engagement with its diaspora citizens was 
motivated by the positive experiences of other countries, such as China, the Philippines, 
Malaysia, and India, that leveraged their diaspora communities to promote national economic 
growth (Akinrinade a nd Ogen, 2011). India, for instance, used the expertise, networks, and 
assistance of its diaspora citizens to become a renowned global giant in information technology 
(Akinrinade and Ogen, 2011). Nigeria, therefore, drew inspiration from India and other 
countries that adopt the philosophy of turning brain drain into brain gain. This development is 
described in the diffusion literature as international policy diffusion where national policy 
decisions are conditioned by policy choices made by other countries (Simmons et al., 2006). 
So far, the results have been encouraging for Nigeria as the country’s share of diaspora-driven 
financial and non -financial contributions to national economic development show. Between 
2017 and 2020, Nigeria had an annual diaspora remittance of more than $25bn which was one 
of the highest in Africa (Jackson -Obot, 2020). In the non -financial aspect, there has been 
increasing collaboration between the diaspora professionals and their Nigerian counterparts in 
various fields including ac ademics, business, and science, thereby contributing to national 
development (Akinrinade and Ogen, 2011). 
The establishment of NiDCOM in 2019 was, therefore, a very strategic move by the 
government to systematically deepen its relationship with the diaspora community and extract 
as much gain as possible from the growing brain drain phenomenon. By its establishment, 
Nigerian policymakers have heeded the advice of Hunger (2002, 1 -2) that brain drain should 
not be “seen as the (dead) end of a negative developm ent that intensifies the economic and 
social crises of developing countries” It should rather be seen, he continued, as “a temporary 
stage within a long-term process with the possibility of a final resource profit for the developing 
country.” This line of argument finds alignment with the point made strongly by Clemens and 
Sandefur (2014) that while it is true that developing countries need to convince their highly 
trained professionals to stay back and contribute to economic development until that is done,  
they should make the best of the situation by maximizing the benefits accruable to them on 
account of their citizens being abroad. 
NiDCOM is without a doubt the most strategic and ambitious effort of the government to 
streamline its engagement with the co untry’s diaspora community and to derive significant 
gain from the country’s growing emigrants.

The key objectives of the commission included to: 
⚫ develop policies as the commission may determine from time to time. 
⚫ execute policies and programmes that will complement the federal government’s efforts 
toward accelerated development. 
⚫ strengthen the administrative structure of the Nigerians in Diaspora Organization (NIDO). 
⚫ co-ordinate all the continental NIDOs. 
⚫ advise the government on diaspora-related matters. 
⚫ establish a worldwide council (comprising local, regional, and continental leadership). 
⚫ reach out to socio-cultural and professional Nigerian diaspora groups or communities for 
collaboration and development. 
⚫ articulate and communicate government plans and programmes for the benefit of the 
diaspora communities (Nigerians in Diaspora Commission n.d.). 
6.1. TYPES OF EVIDENCE  
This section examines respondents’ responses on the types of evidence they felt were used in 
the development of the NiDCOM policy.   
My empirical engagement with the respondents indicates that various types of evidence were 
used in the development of the p olicy. This finding is underscored by the existence of a wide 
range of participants in the policy process and the use of different types of evidence by the 
participants. Thus, although the policy was an Act enacted by the legislative arm of 
government, a sizeable state and non-state actors contributed to the policy development.  
Historically, the diaspora community did not feature in Nigeria’s development plan until the 
1970s but since then there has been a growing engagement between the two parties. The 
establishment of the Nigerians in Diaspora Organization (NIDO) in 2001, however, changed 
the dynamics with the organisation becoming more visible and relevant. Over time, the 
question of how best to streamline the community into national development became a  
politically salient issue with many interest groups contributing.  
A respondent, who was knowledgeable about the issue commented as follows:    
I think the entire idea of the diaspora initiative became very relevant and a lot of interest 
groups, a lot of members of the Nigerian diplomatic corps, the diaspora community, and a lot
<<<PAGE=176>>>
162 
 
of other stakeholders all took part and contributed. Some actually conducted research and 
presented papers on the issue. We the legislators also did a lot of research. For example, I did 
a lot of ‘googling.’ I researched the Bangladesh model, as well as studied part of the Israeli 
diaspora system and the Indian system (R11, Legislator). 
The comment above mirrors respondents’ views on the multiplicity of evidence sources used 
in the development of the NiDCOM policy. Interestingly, majority of the respondents came 
across as knowledgeable about what evidence is and its importance in the policy process. Like 
the respondents in the NSIP, many of these respondents also placed a lot of fait h in EBP. To 
most of them, the use of evidence determines whether a policy achieves its objective or not, 
not minding other important socio-political and cultural factors. This sentiment was pervasive 
and is captured by the response of one of them:  
Evidence-based policymaking is the best way to go because if a policy is formulated with 
sufficient data, you are not talking based on  assumptions, you are dealing with real -life 
indicators and implications that suggest whether a policy will achieve its purpose  or not. It is 
also important for proper planning…so in today’s world, evidence is key in policy formulation 
(R 13, Top Civil Servant).  
A few of the respondents, however, recognised the limits of evidence and provided their 
comments within the context of these limits. Some of them mentioned that even though the use 
of evidence potentially improves the quality of policy, evidence can only be used when it is 
possible to use it, because as one of them said “it is not only the data, it is also what is practical, 
what is doable” (R19, Legislator). Statements such as this, when juxtaposed with the earlier 
one, underscore a significant difference in the way the respondents evaluated evidence in the 
policy process. While the majority had a strong, often unrealistic, faith that the use of evidence 
automatically improves policymaking, a few respondents recognised that whether evidence 
improves policymaking, and the extent of the improvement depends on the prevailing 
circumstances. Nonetheless, findings show that the r espondents were aware of the different 
kinds of evidence used in policymaking. 
Data obtained from respondents regarding the kinds of evidence used in the development of 
the NiDCOM policy are presented below:

The table above shows that multiple evidence types were used in the development of the 
NiDCOM policy. ‘Research evidence’ and ‘ideology evidence’ were considered by 
respondents as the least used evidence in the development of the NiDCOM policy (6) while 
‘previous policies evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’, ‘residual knowledge of policymakers 
evidence’, and ‘local consultants evidence’ (9) were considered as the most used types of 
evidence. 
A review of the table above shows that the percentages of respondents that i dentified each 
source of evidence as having been used in the development of the NiDCOM policy are as 
follows:    
TABLE 12: TYPES OF EVIDENCE BY PERCENTAGE (NIDCOM)

<<<PAGE=178>>>

This means all the respondents (100%) reported that ‘previous policies evidence’, ‘MDA 
evidence’, ‘residual knowledge of policy makers evidence’ and ‘local consultants evidence’ 
were used in the development of the NiDCOM policy.  
It was not surprising that  all the respondents believed these four kinds of evidence were used 
in the development of the NiDCOM. In terms of ‘previous policies evidence’, the erstwhile 
National Migration Policy (NMP), developed in 2015 to streamline the issue of emigration in 
Nigeria, provided significant inputs to the NiDCOM. The inadequacy of the NMP was 
responsible for the birth of NiDCOM. For ‘MDA evidence’, collective responses of the 
respondents indicate that all relevant MDAs were requested to provide inputs into the policy 
and most of them did provide them. Relatedly, quite a large number of the state and non -state 
actors that participated in the development of the NiDCOM, had earlier participated in the 
development of the NMP. In fact, it was reported that about 18  MDAs and other stakeholders 
took part in the development of the NMP in 2015. These policymakers, therefore, possessed 
cognate knowledge and experience which served them well during the development of the 
NiDCOM. Finally, a few local consultants were engaged by the legislators at different times to 
provide technical support for the policy development process.  
In contrast, ‘research evidence’ and ‘ideology evidence’ were identified as the least used 
evidence (66.7%). Considering that some respondents suggested that p rimary research 
contributed greatly to the development of NiDCOM, with one respondent saying that some 
academics ‘came with their research’ (R19, Legislator), it was surprising that some respondents 
did not think ‘research evidence’ was used as a form of evidence. The discrepancy between 
respondents’ accounts may be attributed to the fact that different engagement sessions took 
place at different phases of the policy development each with pre-selected demographics. Also 
notably, ‘ideology evidence’ was not considered by some respondents to have provided 
evidence because they believed the di aspora issue pre -dated the government under whose 
administration the policy was finalised and issued. Also, successive governments did not make 
any worthwhile commitment to it. To such respondents, the development of the policy followed 
the traditional bureaucratic process which was not dependent on the ideology of a government.    
 6.2. HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE  
This theme examines the relative importance respondents attached to the nine types of 
evidence. Respondents were requested to rank the nine evidence i n order of how useful they
<<<PAGE=179>>>

were in the development of the NiDCOM. The respondents were guided by the information in 
Table 13 below.

This means the respondents ranked the most useful evidence as 1; the second most useful 
evidence was ranked 2; the third most useful evidence was ranked 3; the fourth most useful 
evidence was ranked 4; the fifth most useful evidence was ranked 5; the sixth most useful 
evidence was ranked 6; the seven most useful evidence was ranked 7; the eight most useful

Respondents’ rankings of the nine kinds of evidence were turned into scores to reflect the 
relative weight the respondents accorded each type of evidence. This was done in such a way 
that the higher an evidence was ranked, the higher it was scored in line with Table 15.

The Table shows the total score for each of the nine kinds of evidence. The higher the score of 
a type of evidence, the more useful it was considered by the respondents. A review shows that 
the total scores for the nine types of evidence from the highest to the lowest are as follows:

Figure 5 above shows that ‘MDA evidence’ is at the peak of the pyramid meaning it had the 
highest total score. Put another way, it indicates that it is  the most useful evidence in the  
development of the NiDCOM policy. Of the nine respondents, four ranked it as their number 
one (the most useful) evidence. The status of ‘MDA evidence’ as the most valuable is anchored 
on the role it played in the development of the NiDCOM itself and its p recursor, the National 
Migration Policy (NMP). The NMP was developed in 2015 by a committee comprising 18 
MDAs and other stakeholders. As regards the NiDCOM Act, based on the request of the House 
of Representatives, a number of MDAs made written contributions to the technical committee 
that worked on the bill. They provided their contributions based on their knowledge and 
experiences, especially those relating to the development of the NMP. Therefore, ‘MDA 
evidence’ played a pivotal role in development of t he NiDCOM in two main ways. The first 
one was in the development of the NMP, which served as an important resource for the 
NiDCOM. The second one was in the development of the NiDCOM where MDAs provided 
useful inputs. In addition, the legislators also util ised the structure and process knowledge of 
the MDAs as explained by another respondent: 
Traditionally, the civil service is responsible for the  development of government policy, right? 
So, it is not surprising that the National Assembly leaned on the civ il service to enrich the 
NiDCOM law because the MDA representatives were the ones on the field handling migration 
and diaspora issues (R13, Top-level Civil Servant).  
 
The status of the ‘MDA evidence’ in the development of the NiDCOM reflects a common 
policymaking approach in Nigeria where the government selects experienced experts from the 
MDAs to develop policies, like in the case of the NMP, or where the legislators (or other 
policymakers) request the inputs of the MDAs based on their specialised skills and knowledge, 
as in the case of the NiDCOM. Often, this happens where the policy domain in question needs 
more specialised skills and less ideology. Indeed, the legislators that worked on the formulation 
of the bill that translated into the NiDCOM found the input from the MDAs “critical and very 
useful” (R19, Legislator). It is, therefore, understandable that majority of the respondents chose 
‘MDA evidence’ as the most useful kind of evidence in the development of the NiDCOM.  
 
In contrast, respondents deemed ‘ideology evidence’ as the least useful evidence. This finding 
can be explained by looking at the history of the NiDCOM policy which is traceable to the 
country’s return to democracy in 1999. None of the governments from 199 9 identified the 
diaspora issue as a guiding ideology or as part of their party’s manifesto even though two major 
parties in the country had won general elections. Nevertheless, successive governments had
<<<PAGE=183>>>
169 
 
undertaken routine measures to advance the cause of  the diaspora community as part of the 
traditional bureaucracy. Thus, no government stood out ideologically in respect of the 
development of the NiDCOM policy.   
In the words of one respondent: 
The policy formulation had no bearing with the party in power or its manifesto. The issue of 
diaspora started during the Obasanjo regime. It was (the) EU that helped Nigeria in that 
regard because all the resources being used were from the EU and other donors like the 
German government, the Swiss government, and what  have you. Truth is the Nigerian 
government had a lukewarm attitude towards the issue of migration. The reason government 
is now taking special interest in the diaspora is because of their contributions to the Nigerian 
economy in so many ways. In 2017 Nige rians in diaspora remitted almost 27 or 29 billion 
dollars into the country, which was the highest in Sub -Saharan Africa. The money being 
remitted back home is having multiple effects on the Nigerian economy (R13, Top-level Civil 
Servant).  
  
The statement above confirms that unlike in the NSIP, where government ideology served as 
prominent evidence, the opposite was the case in the development of the NiDCOM. The 
majority of the respondents alluded to the insignificant influence of government ideology on 
the development of the NiDCOM. To them, governments did not see the diaspora issue as “ a 
valued initiative” (R18, Representative, Diaspora Community).   
Looking at NiDCOM through the lenses of successive Nigerian governments reveals a lack of 
ideology to explain its development. In hindsight, no government made the diaspora issue a 
campaign issue or even a matter of urgent national concern. As a result, it becomes clear that 
the development of the policy was not based on any desire of bureaucrats to translate ideology 
into policy. Consequently, the history of the evolution of NiDCOM, and the collective 
comments of the respondents provide a convincing explanation on why ‘MDA evidence’ and 
‘ideology evidence’ were the most useful and least useful k inds of evidence, respectively, in 
the development of the NiDCOM. 
6.3. INTEGRATION OF EVIDENCE  
The previous section explored respondents’ perceptions of how useful the different kinds of 
evidence were in the development of the NiDCOM policy. This section will examine how the 
different kinds of evidence were integrated into the policy process. As has been demonstrated 
thus far in this thesis, the policy environment is conflictual. To demonstrate, stakeholders 
provide different, often competing, kinds of evi dence to influence policy. Therefore, an
<<<PAGE=184>>>
170 
 
understanding of how the different types of evidence is harmonised by policymakers provides 
a useful insight into the policy process. 
Findings of this study show that being a legislative policy, the NiDCOM policy was conceived 
by the legislature with significant input from legacy policies and other sources. Spurred by the 
need to exploit and harness the economic benefits of streamlining migration into the country’s 
national life, federal legislators in the House of Representatives started the process that led to 
the establishment of the NiDCOM. The legislators resolved that their intervention was needed 
in this regard and subsequently established a committee on diaspora to advice the house on the 
best way to achieve that goal. A legislator who participated actively in the process leading to 
the development of the policy explained:    
First and foremost, the identification of the  diaspora population as a critical partner for 
national development was conceived by the government as far back as the years 2000, and 
2001.…(then) the NASS (National Assembly), specifically the House of Reps in 2011 
established a house committee on diaspora which Hon. Abike Dabiri, the current chairman of 
the commission was given the responsibility to chair. I was fortunate to be a member of that 
committee. The committee got inputs from different sources including MDAs, the private sector, 
and some international organisations (R11, Legislator).    
The forgoing statement means that the development of the NiDCOM policy involved 
continuous collaboration among members of the policy community for the provision and 
utilisation of evidence. As might be expected, different stakeholders provided various inpu ts, 
some of them contrasting, which the house considered. For instance, as we will see later, while 
some stakeholders advocated the establishment of a ministry in charge of migration issues, 
some suggested the establishment of an agency. Therefore, one of the major tasks the 
legislators undertook was to consider the different stakeholder inputs alongside their own with 
a view to integrating them into the policy being developed. This study deduced that the 
integration took place in three formal sites, where the various evidence provided by the 
different stakeholders were refined and integrated into policy proposals.  
Firstly, considering that the NiDCOM policy drew reasonably from the diaspora section of the 
National Migration Policy (NMP) developed in 2015, the initial integration site was the inter-
ministerial committee that developed the NMP. Membership of the committee was drawn from 
18 MDAs and private organisations (International Organisation for Migration, 2015). The 
NMP was developed by the government with inputs from other non-state actors including civil 
society groups and development partners. Based on my interaction with the respondents, the
<<<PAGE=185>>>
171 
 
government had anticipated from the outset that a law would “eventually be passed” to achieve 
a sustainable solution to the migration problem (R18, Representative, Diaspora Community). 
The NMP, therefore, served as the forerunner of the NiDCOM.   
A major qualification for membership of the NMP development committee was knowledge 
and/or experience of migration iss ues to enhance robust contributions. The committee was 
grouped along thematic lines and each thematic group developed a draft report which was 
scrutinised and refined by the larger committee to produce the draft NMP. The draft NMP was 
then extensively revi ewed and endorsed by an enlarged stakeholder group at a national 
conference on migration (International Organisation for Migration, 2015). 
A respondent provided further comment on the way the integration occurred: 
We had the National Migration Policy which served as the overarching policy on all migration 
issues including the diaspora. It had thematic areas such as labour migration, diaspora, and 
the rest. The thematic areas had working groups that conducted research, obtained various 
data and information f rom different sources, then submitted their report to the Technical 
Working Group (TWG) for review. So, you see the policy (National Migration Policy) provided 
some materials for the diaspora Act (R14, Top-level Civil Servant).  
  
Members served on committ ees they had a comparative advantage in terms of skills and 
experiences. That way, members made contributions to the development of sections of the draft 
policy from the point of knowledge. Each sub-committees met, examined the issues that were 
germane to their section, and wrote a report. At the plenary, each of the committees made a 
presentation to the larger group which examined and harmonised the entire work. While a few 
of the provisions presented by the various sub-committees were accepted by the plenary, most 
of them ignited discussions and disagreements with members providing justifications for the 
position they have taken. Based on the ensuing discussions, contending provisions were 
clarified and integrated into the policy. 
 
Secondly, the legislatur e also served as a site for the integration of evidence. To recap, the 
Nigerian House of Representatives in 2011 established a house committee on diaspora which 
Hon. Abike Dabiri as chairman. This development underscored the fast -growing importance 
the House attached to diaspora issues. Subsequently, a House bill was initiated by Hon. Dabiri 
and presented before the House of Representatives in 2011. Deliberations on the bill involved 
persuasions and debates both within and outside the legislature “to expand  the options and 
possibilities” (R17, legislator). A legislator elaborated:
<<<PAGE=186>>>
172 
 
  
The bill was presented, and it went through the first reading, second reading, then it went for 
a public hearing where different stakeholders advanced their positions. At all these points, the 
bill was scrutinised and updated; contentious positions harmonised...so, at this point, the idea 
was to consider the best way to address the problem…for this bill, most of the documentation 
that justified the basis for the establishment of the commission was presented and considered.  
(R11, Legislator).  
 
The bill was presented in the House of Representatives and as usual, went through the 
policymaking process in the house which included presentations and debates. The diaspora 
community provided very useful inputs for consideration. I nterestingly, two camps emerged 
regarding the solution to the problem. While t he first camp advocated the creation of a full 
ministry, the second camp suggested the establishment of a government age ncy with full 
powers to address the problem. Each camp provided justifications for their chosen preference. 
Many respondents admitted that a lot of arguments, counterarguments, and lobbying took place 
during this phase with a view to producing a robust pol icy. In the end, legislators settled for 
the establishment of a government agency instead of the creation of a ministry.    
Finally, a review committee was found to be the last integration site. The committee was 
mandated to review the draft bill developed by the house committee on diaspora. Membership 
of the technical committee included representatives of the International Organisation on 
Migration (IOM), Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs (FMFA), Nigerians in Diaspora 
Organisation (NIDO), Nigerian National Volunteer Scheme (NNVS), Directorate of Technical 
Aid Corps in Africa (DTACA), and the National Assembly Policy Analysis and Research 
Project (NAPARP), which is the research and documentation arm of the Nigerian legislature.  
 
The nature of the organisa tions that formed the technical committee suggests a commitment 
for a more technocratic policymaking process as the functions and mandates of all the 
organisations related to migration in one way or another. Also, the representatives of these 
organisations were knowledgeable and experienced which enabled them to offer useful advice 
and suggestions. Also, based on their residual knowledge of the subject matter, they were able 
to decipher which inputs were more suitable and feasible.  
The integrating function of the committee is highlighted by a legislator: 
   
The technical committee reviewed the draft Bill. However, most of  them were also involved in 
developing the initial Bill which started during the 7th Assembly (201-2015) but it lived through
<<<PAGE=187>>>
173 
 
the 8 th Assembly (2015-2019) and it was passed in 2017. The review was to see if certain 
provisions or ideas needed to be changed, whether the information was adequate, whether we 
needed more (information) and how they can make the law more effective (R11, Legislator). 
The committee was divided into sub -committees with each sub -committee allocated specific 
theme(s) to review. Based on the insight above, each sub -committee had the power to make 
amendments on proposed provisions and introduce additional ideas subject to the approval of 
the house committee on diaspora. Thus, each sub -committee interrogated and refined the 
evidence types related to its theme. Thereafter, the technical committee cross-checked the work 
of the sub-committees to establish that the “information from each sub-committee” was “fit for 
the purpose” (R19, Legislator). A respondent offered the following insights:   
Much of the work of the technical committee took place in their volunteered themes ma de up 
of around 7 to 30. The committee examined issues in detail: the working documents, 
advantages, and disadvantages of certain provisions, and how they compared with other 
nations. The committee refined many things like the legal framework, to topics li ke the 
composition of the board members and their responsibilities (R18, Representative, Diaspora 
Community). 
The technical committee, therefore, undertook significant work in confirming that the entire 
content of the policy aligned with the mandate it was given. Considering the calibre of people 
and organisations in the committee, the HoR attached a lot of premium to the committee’s work 
and instances of the legislators disagreeing with the committee were rare. This is 
understandable since the committee members possessed expertise that the legislators lacked.    
The technical committee, in the words of a respondent, approximates “a high -level clearing 
house” with the responsibility to apply “finishing touches” to the NiDCOM policy (R14, Top-
level Civil Servant).      
6.4. THE ROLE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATORS  
  
The establishment of NiDCOM is a classic example of a ‘constituent’ policy as it involved the 
creation of a government agency by the legislators (Lowi, 1972). To reiterate, the NiDCOM 
policy was initiated in the House of Representatives (HoR) as a House bill. Upon receiving the 
concurrence of the senate, the bill was passed and assented to  by the president leading to the 
establishment of the NiDCOM. Understandably, most of the discussions, deliberations, and 
debates concerning the policy were held on the floor of the HoR. It was also in the house that
<<<PAGE=188>>>
174 
 
a technical committee was established t o review the draft bill developed by the house 
committee on diaspora. 
Findings, however, showed that majority of legislators in the diaspora committee did not 
participate fully in deliberations because the committee was considered non-lucrative in terms 
of potential financial benefits to members. The financial benefits thesis is captured in the 
following statements by a legislator who was a member of the committee. 
I remember back then in the house it was a committee of 36 members from each state of the 
federation but of course (laughing), it was not a committee you would call a juicy committee 
(continued laughing); it was barren. Very few people attended meetings, not exceeding six, 
seven members but she (Abike Dabiri) took it and eventually made it one of the most prominent 
committees of the house. There was a committee for petroleum, a committee for finance, a 
committee for budget but she made it (committee on diaspora) to become almost at the same 
level with those committees due to her personal commitment  and passion, and because the 
media was her constituency, she leveraged her capacity and the opportunities that her (former) 
media colleagues could afford her, and she gave it all the necessary prominence, to a larger 
extent, single-handedly (R11, Legislator). 
Similarly, being a constituent policy, its implementation did not require the appropriation of 
significant public funds that legislators could benefit from. This seems to provide a further 
explanation for members’ poor participation considering that the likelihood of financial benefit 
potentially influences members’ behaviour.   
Furthermore, there was the electoral benefit thesis. It could be argued that the poor participation 
of many committee members may not be unconnected with the realisation that the development 
of the diaspora policy had no electoral value to them, at least in the short term. This is because 
the main beneficiaries of the policy - Nigerians in the diaspora - were constitutionally not 
allowed to vote from diaspora and their lack of electoral value meant they were dispensable. A 
representative of the diaspora community who participated in the development and review of 
the policy lamented: 
The government didn’t take seriously to the request of the diaspora community (for diaspora 
voting)…the commission is still tracking its path to be sustainable to become more useful  for 
the benefit of diaspora interests (R18, Representative of the Diaspora Community). 
Some few exceptions existed, though. Legislators in this category might have been inspired by 
their personal commitments to the cause of the diaspora community or by their expectation of 
future recognition or benefits (Kingdon, 1995). Clearly, a few legislators worked assiduously 
for the establishment of NiDCOM. Drawing from Kingdon, it was probable that these 
legislators were motivated by the possibility that the establ ishment of NiDCOM could give
<<<PAGE=189>>>
175 
 
them an opportunity to play a pivotal role in the administration of the new agency. This 
argument is strengthened by the fact that some legislators ended up being part of the top 
management of the newly created NiDCOM and contr ibuted to setting it up and leading it in 
its formative years.  
From the foregoing, two sets of legislators that worked on the establishment of NiDCOM are 
identifiable. The first set comprised legislators in the diaspora committee of the HoR who fully 
participated in the development of NiDCOM either based on their personal interests or the 
interests of the diaspora community. The second set, on the other hand, consisted of legislators 
whose participation in the development of NiDCOM was at best, partial, an d at worst 
dispiriting. This set of legislators did not commit to the development NiDCOM because there 
was no motivation for them to do so, whether financial or otherwise. 
6.5. GOVERNING THE POLICY PROCESS  
 
The previous section highlights some of the hidden influences of legislators during the 
development of the NiDCOM policy. This section provides an insight into respondents’ 
perception of how the government governed the policy development process.  
From the collective responses, it was evident that despite the participation of many stakeholders 
in the policy development process, “the government regulated” the process to achieve the 
policy objectives (R13, Top -level Civil Servant). All through the dev elopment process, 
incidents of governmental control are discernible.     
First and foremost, the policy was a Bill initiated by an influential House of Representatives 
member of the ruling party, Hon. Abike Dabiri, which suggests that the draft content s of the 
Bill were consistent with the ideology and objectives of the government as reflected by a 
respondent: 
NiDCOM was a House bill and to that extent one could say it reflected the mindset of the APC 
government. And there is sufficient evidence of governme nt support of the Bill (R16 Civil 
Society). 
Although the APC government did not make the migration challenge a campaign issue, it 
nevertheless, lent its total support to the development of the policy. In that regard, the 
government used a number of avenues  to demonstrate its support for the policy. And unlike 
some instances where some government functionaries or legislators may give contradictory
<<<PAGE=190>>>
176 
 
messages regarding a policy, there was no evidence of such in this case. Furthermore, the House 
of Representatives, particularly the house committee on diaspora developed the report that was 
considered in the plenary based on the engagements with many stakeholders giving it additional 
gate keeping powers. This point was articulated by a legislator:     
After the public hearing, the committee responsible went back and  developed a report based 
on the engagements and any other memorandum that was presented to the committee. So, in 
the end, the committee believed that the reasons were cogent enough, that it was a critic al 
sector of Nigeria’s national development and thus  needed to be considered by the 
parliament. Then, it got the concurrence of the senate on the need to establish the commission, 
and eventually, in 2017 the bill was passed and assented to by the president to establish the 
commission (R11, Legislator). 
 
A key finding was that a technical committee wa s established by the house committee on the 
diaspora to add value to the bill being considered and several respondents believed the 
committee, comprising many stakeholders, made significant inputs that shaped the NiDCOM 
policy. Importantly, the technical committee comprised policymakers, both public and private, 
who were knowledgeable in migration issues. This demonstrates a desire to give prominence 
to technocracy as against ideology in the policy process. Further, the technical committee was 
dominated by MDAs who used their numerical and strategic influence to nudge the committee 
one way or another.  
 
Further, two respondents suggested that the so-called robust stakeholder consultations that took 
place were symbolic; that they were designed to legitimate a  decision that has already been 
taken. They argued that although the technical committee and the larger stakeholders offered 
inputs, the inputs were useful to the extent they aligned with the vision of the house committee. 
One of them argued that: 
  
It is true that all critical stakeholders contributed to the Bill, but I believe the house has already 
taken a position. They have, ab initio, decided to establish a commission so the consultations 
were, in my opinion, to give credibility to the process. It woul dn’t make them to accept other 
options (R 16, Civil Society).    
On paper, th e statement above sounds inaccurate. My interview with the two respondents, 
including an informal discussion with one of them, however, revealed that there are grounds to 
suggest that was the case. The two respondents argued that the emphasis of the legislators from 
the outset was for the establishment of an agency to address the migration issue and it was clear 
what the outcome would be. In addition, when the government developed the NPM in 2015, it
<<<PAGE=191>>>
177 
 
knew that a law would eventually be passed to “permanently” address the migration issue. This 
implies that the NPM was designed as a placeholder pending the establishment of the 
NiDCOM.  
In sum, several respondents believed that although the government engaged various 
stakeholders in the development of NiDCOM, it controlled the process from the shadow, an 
action that seems to sit well with the respondents because its their “constitutional 
responsibility” (R18, Representative, Diaspora Community). 
6.6. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This chapter has presented empirical findings from the second case study of this research, the 
NiDCOM policy. The chapter started by providing a background to the case study highlighting 
the evolution of the NiDCOM. 
The chapter demonstrated that respondents understood the concept of evidence and its 
importance in the policy -making process. The respondents identified multiple sources of 
evidence used during the development of the NiDCOM policy. Evidence from the chapte r 
indicated that ‘MDA evidence’ was considered the most useful evidence based on its 
importance in the development of the National Migration Policy ( NPM), the precursor to the 
NiDCOM. MDAs also provided considerable input in the development of the NiDCOM. In 
contrast, ‘ideology evidence’ was considered the least useful evidence largely because no 
successive governments used it as a campaign issue or even made it an important one.  
Findings showed that the multiple evidence identified by respondents were int egrated at three 
formal sites. First was an inter -ministerial committee established for the development of the 
NMP, which was a precursor to the NiDCOM policy with membership drawn from about 18 
MDAs and organisations. Second was the committee on diaspora in the House of 
Representatives (HoR) where various inputs were collected, analysed and refined. Lastly, a 
technical committee established by the HoR comprising national and international stakeholders 
served as the last site for the integration of evidence.      
Findings further showed that in the HoR, where the policy was developed, legislators’ 
participation, or lack of participation, was largely influenced by self -interest: financial, 
electoral, or entrepreneurial. Generally, the development of the NiDCOM revealed two sets of 
legislators. The first set comprised legislators that fully participated in the development of the
<<<PAGE=192>>>
178 
 
policy either based on their personal interests for recognition or the interests of the diaspora 
community. The second set consisted of legislators who did not fully participate in the process 
because they lacked the motivation, financial or otherwise. 
Lastly, findings indicated that even though the government accorded numerous stakeholders 
the opportunity to contribute inputs  to the policy, it still controlled the process. The fact that 
the bill for the development of the NiDCOM was a legislative one, coupled with the numerical 
dominance of government representatives in the various committees that collectively 
developed the po licy reinforced the notion of governmental control. Indeed, there was 
considerable ground to argue that the policy preference of the government from the outset was 
for the establishment of a commission, a mission it accomplished based on the significant 
influence it wielded in the policy process. 
The next chapter will present the findings on the third case study, the National Tax Policy.

CHAPTER 7 
FINDINGS  FROM CASE STUDY 3 – NATIONAL  TAX 
POLICY 2017 (NTP)  
7.0. INTRODUCTION  
The first National Tax Policy (NTP) in Nigeria was developed in 2012 as part of the 
government’s efforts to entrench an effective tax system in the country (National Tax Policy, 
2017). Prior to the birth of the NTP, the government has undertaken a number o f measures to 
improve the country’s tax system.  
Indeed, the evolution of Nigeria’s tax system is traceable to the economic reform initiated in 
the early 20th century by Sir Fredrick Lugard, the High Commissioner of the erstwhile Northern 
Protectorate, who issued the Stamp Duties Proclamation and the Native Revenue Proclamation 
in 1903 and 1906 respectively (Okauru, 2012). As part of the provisions of the Native Revenue 
Proclamation, Northern emirs and chiefs were required to surrender 25 percent of the revenue 
they collected to the Protectorate administration, while the outstanding 75 percent was used for 
public works and for the payment of the fixed personal i ncome of the emirs and chiefs 
(Adebayo, 1995). 
When the Northern and Southern Protectorates were amalgamated in 1914, the Native Revenue 
Proclamation was re -issued as the Native Revenue Ordinance in 1917 even though the 
application of the ordinance in the western and eastern territories was delayed until 1918 and 
1927 respectively (Okauru, 2012). Notwithstanding, the collection of colonial tax in the 
Protectorates was enforced for the most part by the police using intimidation and force 
(Adebayo, 1995). In 1935, Frank G. Lloyd was appointed as the Commissioner of Income Tax 
for the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria under the supervision of Walter B. Dare, the 
Commissioner of Income Tax for Anglo -phone West Africa (Okauru, 2012b). In 1943, the 
Nigerian Inlan d Revenue Department (NIRD) was carved out of the Anglo -Phone Inland 
Revenue Department (AIRD) and renamed the Federal Board of Inland Revenue (FBIR) in 
1958 (Okauru, 2012).  
After independence, the government set up several committees to investigate and improve the 
country’s tax system, especially policy development and restructuring of the country’s tax 
architecture. The committees included the Shehu Musa Task Force (1978) whose 
recommendation led to the introduction of withholding tax in Nigeria; the Emmanuel Edozien
<<<PAGE=194>>>
180 
 
Study Group (1991) responsible for the creation of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS); 
the Sylvester Ugoh Study Group (1992) that recommended the introduction of the Value Added 
Tax in 1993; and the Dotun Phillips Study Group (2002) wh ich “identified the need for a 
National Tax Policy to redress the imbalances and shortcomings in the Nigerian tax system” 
(Okauru, 2012, p.74). 
The NTPs of 2012 and 2017 are therefore in continuation of the government’s efforts to 
revitalise the country’s tax system. Scholars and practitioners have argued that the non -
implementation of the 2012 policy was responsible for its review leading to the development 
of the 2017 policy (Adebayo, 1995). The broad objective of the 2017 policy is to stimulate 
economic growth by setting clear principles to regulate tax administration in Nigeria. The 
policy is designed to:   
1. “Guide the operation and review of the tax system.  
2. Provide the basis for future tax legislation and administration.  
3. Serve as a point of reference for all stakeholders on taxation.  
4. Provide benchmark on which stakeholders shall be held accountable.   
5. Provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities of Stakeholders in the tax System” 
(National Tax Policy, 2017). 
7.1. TYPES OF EVIDENCE  
This section examines respondents’ responses on the types of evidence used in the development 
of the 2017 NTP.   
To start with, the respondents demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of evidence-
based policymaking including what evidence is and why it is useful in the policy process. They 
affirmed that evidence enriches policymaking and provides a basis for the development and 
review of policies. One respondent conveyed this sentiment as follows: 
Policies should and must be based on evidence if th ey are to be useful.  Everything that was 
done with respect to this policy (NTP, 2017) was evidence-based. You have to obtain relevant 
data sets and use them to enrich your policy…It is all about openness, government should be 
open and allow citizens to participate (R 23, Top-level Civil Servant). 
Most of the respondents supported the use of multiple sources of evidence in the development 
of the 2017 NTP. They believed that the more evidence policymakers have, the better equipped 
they are to make optimal po licy choices. As one respondent put it, more evidence sources 
‘potentially produce the best policy possible’ (R 27, Representative, NGO).
<<<PAGE=195>>>
181 
 
Some of the respondents were of the view that multiple evidence sources reduce biases because 
usually, each type of ev idence says a different thing and harmonising them requires some 
degree of rigour. Yet, while the majority of the respondents were satisfied with the adequacy 
of evidence used in the development of the NTP, a number of them were not. One of them 
bemoaned that “the paucity of relevant data at critical points”  made policymakers resort to 
their “ individual knowledge”  (R26, Professional Accountant). While this criticism sounds 
credible and seems to question the notion that multiple sources of evidence were used  in the 
development of the NTP, in fact it does not. Within the frame of this research, “ individual 
knowledge” represents a form of evidence labelled  “residual knowledge of policymakers’ 
evidence”. To be clear, it comprises the policy knowledge and expertise policymakers possess 
on account of their experiences and training. So, in a way, the criticism strengthens the 
argument that, indeed, multiple sources of evidence were used in the development of the policy.  
Yet, a few respondents drew attention to the limits of evidence. They contended that while 
evidence is important in policymaking, it is not a “silver bullet that automatically makes 
policies more effective”  (R 23, Top -level Civil Servant).  Such cautious statements are 
important reminders to policymakers especially those who have an overwhelming faith in EBP. 
Of course, the literature recognises that part of peoples’ disillusionment with the EBP is the 
high expectation associated with the concept.  
Notwithstanding, my engagement with the respondents sh ows that various types of evidence 
were used in the development of the 2017 NTP. There was, thus, a constellation of participants 
spanning both the public and the private sector, as explained by a respondent:     
So, to mention the stakeholders I will say the government and private sector. In the government, 
we have the ministry of finance, the Federal Inland Revenue Service, and the Joint Tax Board 
which we can still classify as government too. On the side of the private sector, we have some 
private sector players like accounting and auditing firms. We also had a consultant from the 
University of Lagos - a professor of law. He was one of the key players that participated. Then 
we had lawyers, interest groups, the media, and so on (R 22, Mid-level Civil Servant). 
Data obtained from respondents regarding the kinds of evidence used in the development of 
the NTP are presented below:

The table above indicates that eight types of evidence were used in the development of the 
2017 NTP. Respondents considered ‘local consultants evidence’ as the evidence type that was 
used most (9). In contrast, ‘research evidence’ and ‘media evidence’ were considered the least 
used evidence types (5).   
 
A review of Table 18 above shows that the percentages of respondents that identified each 
source of evidence as having been used in the development of the 2017 NTP are as follows:    
TABLE 199: TYPES OF EVIDENCE BY PERCENTAGE 
Evidence type Total percentage (%)

Media evidence 55.6 
Ideology evidence 77.8 
Residual knowledge of policymakers evidence 66.7 
Internet evidence 77.8 
Local consultants evidence 100
<<<PAGE=197>>>
183 
 
The table shows that all the respondents (100%) reported that ‘local consultants evidence’ was 
used in the development of the NTP, 2017. Interestingly, that was the only kind of evidence 
that all the respondents believed was used in the development of the NTP. This is anticipated 
and confirmed because the literature emphasises the leading role of local consultants in the 
development of the NTP.    
Contrastingly, ‘research evidence’ and ‘media evidence’ were identified as the least used 
evidence (55.6%) each . The poor use of ‘research evidence’ in policy development is a 
universal challenge which this research has so far confirmed. As regards ‘media evidence’, the 
majority of policymakers in Nigeria have a pessimistic view of them. They are usually seen 
not as credible providers of evidence but rather as creators of sensationalism to advance their 
business interests.      
7.2. HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE  
This theme examines the relative importance respondents attached to the eight types of 
evidence. Respondents were  requested to rank the eight types of evidence in order of how 
useful they were in the development of the NTP. The respondents were guided by the 
information in Table 20 below. 
TABLE 20:  RANKING TABLE (NTP) 
Ranking Interpretation 
1 Most useful evidence 
2 2nd Most useful evidence 
3 3rd  Most useful evidence 
4 4th  Most useful evidence 
5 5th  Most useful evidence 
6 6th  Most useful evidence 
7 7th  Most useful evidence 
8 8th  Most useful evidence 
This means the respondents ranked the most useful evidence as 1 ; the second most useful 
evidence was ranked 2; the third most useful evidence was ranked 3; the fourth most useful 
evidence was ranked 4; the fifth most useful evidence was ranked 5; the sixth most  useful 
evidence was ranked 6; the seven most useful evidence was ranked 7; the eighth most useful 
evidence was ranked 8. 
Respondents’ rankings for each of the eight types of evidence are provided in Table 21 below.

Respondents’ rankings of the eight kinds of evidence were turned into scores to reflect the 
relative weight the respondents accorded each type of evidence. This was done in such a way 
that the higher an evidence was ranked, the higher it was scored in line with Table 22.

The Table shows the total score for each of the eight kinds of evidence. The higher the score 
of a type of evidence, the more useful it was considered by the respondents. A review shows 
that the total scores for the eight types of evidence from the highest to the lowest are as follows:

The total scores were used to develop a hierarchy of evidence showing the evidence with the 
highest total score of 56 (local consultants) at the top of the pyramid, followed by the evidence 
with the second highest score of 50 (previous policies evidence) and this co ntinued down to 
the evidence with the lowest total score of 15 (research evidence) which is placed at the base 
of the hierarchy as shown in figure 6 below.
<<<PAGE=200>>>
186 
 
  
FIGURE 6: HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE BASED ON DATA (NTP) 
Figure 6 above shows that ‘local consultants evidence’ is at the peak of the pyramid meaning 
respondents considered it the most useful evidence in the development of the 2017 NTP. Of 
the nine respondents, four ranked it as their number one (the most useful)  evidence. Many of 
the respondents justified their ranking by describing the input of the consultants as the most 
critical in policy development. During all the policy development sessions, the consultants not 
only fully participated but made telling contributions. By virtue of their decades of experience 
as consultants to both the government and the private sector, they have garnered deep 
knowledge and understanding of the Nigerian tax landscape.  
As such, the main reason why the consultants occupied such a prime position in the 
development of the policy was their technical knowledge. Clearly, they were the most 
knowledgeable group during the sessions both in terms of theory and practice, which made 
their contributions well respected. On occasions where there were controversies or arguments, 
the consultants often served as arbiters. The view expressed below by a respondent aptly 
captures the feeling of most of the respondents:

Their (consultants’) impact was great, perhaps the greatest of any  demographic…so, they 
had ideas of which areas (of the policy) needed to be changed, and where the government 
needed to come in because of that professional experience that they brought to bear. Those 
experiences were extremely useful in revising the tax policy (R 21, Top-level Civil Servant).  
The use of consultants in developing technical policies in Nigeria is gradually rising largely 
because of their expertise. Their ability to deliver on tight schedules, as seen in the case of the 
NTP, has also increased their popularity. This contrasts with  the delays and bureaucratic 
bottlenecks associated with the development of policies by the civil service. In the development 
of the NTP, the consultants approached the issue with private sector mentality including setting 
targets and measuring progress which helped to fast-track the policy process. Accordingly, the 
policy development process was biased in favour of technocracy, underscored by the 
significant emphasis on the expertise of consultants.  
Contrariwise, respondents considered ‘research evidence’  as the least useful evidence. 
Although academics served on the tax review committee, there impacts in terms of research 
were minimal. A respondent lamented that he was “disappointed with the academics” who did 
not live up to general expectations (R26, Professional Accountant).  Considering the technical 
nature of the policy domain in question - tax - and the leading role played by consultants in the 
development of the policy, this finding is surprising. The limited time available for the 
committee to deliv er the policy contributed to the poor showing of the academics on the 
committee as explained by a respondent from the Federal Ministry of Finance who coordinated 
the review process:  
The policy delivery was set on a very tight deadline and given the time f rame for the review 
and submission, there was not sufficient time to conduct new research.  Like I told you, 
membership of the tax policy review committee, was largely made up of people from academia 
and professional bodies, and the committee was headed by a professor of tax law, so maybe he 
was able to gather some input from some of his colleagues…(but) it wasn’t a research that took 
so long like you go back and consult the literature, no. (R 21, Top-level Civil Servant).     
Based on the comment above, a key reason for the poor ranking of “research evidence” was 
timing. The academics did not have sufficient time to undertake research to contribute to the 
policy, making the academics and policymakers to operate in two different communities. This 
challenge is well documented in the literature with scholars making several recommendations 
to bridge the existing gap between the two.
<<<PAGE=202>>>
188 
 
Another reason was the attitude of Nigerian policymakers that did not attach the desired 
importance to research during the policy development process. A respondent reflected:  
Unlike in other climes where research drives policy, here, we are not there yet. We hardly 
undertake primary research or government commissioning research purposely for policy 
development (R 27, Representative, NGO).  
 
Although timing has been recognised as a major issue, the history of policymaking in Nigeria 
suggests that the perception of policymakers in terms of the value of research in policymaking 
was a contributory factor. The contr ibutions of research findings to policymaking in Nigeria 
have been miserable over the years. Rarely do governments in Nigeria commission research 
purposely for policymaking. Considering that the country has always had a big government, 
the poor uptake of research by the government continues to adversely affect the use of ‘research 
evidence’ in policymaking.  
 
In the case of the NTP, the government failed to commission research or encourage academics 
to conduct research to enrich the policy. This speaks volumes about the government’s attitude 
to the use of research in policymaking. And as anticipated, the researchers were unable to 
provide the required ‘research evidence’ to influence the development of the NTP. The bottom 
line is that as long as the governme nt does not support research, research evidence would 
continue to be less influential in policymaking in Nigeria.  
7.3. INTEGRATION OF EVIDENCE  
The previous section examined the perceptions of respondents on the usefulness of the eight 
kinds of evidence they believed were used for the development of the 2017 NTP. This section 
will analyse how the different kinds of evidence were integrated into the policy process.  
As we have seen so far, the 2017 NTP involved the use of numerous evidence types and 
collaboration among members of the policy community for both generation and utilisation of 
evidence. As a result, an examination of how these multiple types of evidence were integrated 
is germane to enhance our understanding of the 2017 NTP policy process. Findings shows that 
the integration took place in two formal sites: the National Tax Policy Review Committee, 
created by the then minister of finance, and stakeholders’ engagement meetings.   
The review committee represented the first integration site where nume rous evidence types 
were sourced and utilised. The committee’s main deliverable was to ‘aggregate diverse views
<<<PAGE=203>>>
189 
 
and draft the policy’ (R 29, a mid-level civil servant). Membership of the committee was drawn 
from the public and private sectors and understan dably, there were residual biases based on 
differences in members’ orientation. The committee was  ‘multi-sectoral’ and provided an 
avenue for ideological contestation with members using evidence to ‘rally support for their 
arguments and point of views’ (R 27, Representative, NGO). One respondent noted: 
The policy was committee driven. At the committee level, we held meetings from time to time 
to get the work done. We took the existing national policy as a framework as a guide; We took 
the topics in the old document item by item, what we needed to delete, we deleted, what we 
needed to include based on current realities, we did. We had debates on each topic, subject by 
subject. Members used statistics, persuasion and what have you to convince the meeting as to  
why a position should be taken. Other members who might have contrary views would then 
provide counter arguments (R 28, Top-level Civil Servant).    
The foregoing statement indicates that the discussions in the committee were productive. As 
we have highlighted earlier, the membership of the committee was diverse and represented 
various interests. Considering that tax is usually one of the most polarisi ng and ideologically 
charged public policy issues, it was not surprising that the committee represented a site for 
robust deliberations and debates. The major debate revolved around the appropriate level of 
tax for different taxpayers. Expectedly, while the business community generally advocated low 
taxes to encourage production and investment; representatives of the government and civil 
society, on the other hand, argued that the elites should be taxed higher to fund investment in 
infrastructure and to sup port the government’s welfare programmes. Another issue that 
instigated a sustained debate was whether the SMEs were overtaxed or not. Consequently, each 
demographic used data, information, and moral suasion to persuade other members of the 
committee. The committee looked at all contending issues in detail with members taking 
positions based on their convictions or interests. As a result, issues were determined based on 
the level of support they received. Owing to their expertise and experience, the tax consultants 
were respected, and their views carried significant weight. In most cases, their interventions 
settled contentious issues and provided a direction for the committee.  
Interestingly, all through the committee’s deliberations, there existed a good r elationship 
between the consultants and the representatives of the Ministry of Finance, which in the first 
place was responsible for the engagement of the consultants. Findings show that the 
relationship pre -dated the development of the NTP in 2017. Findin gs also show that the
<<<PAGE=204>>>
190 
 
consultants offered their services at no cost based on the company’s policy of undertaking 
selected free consultancy services for public interest. 
The committee also received, considered, and analysed inputs from selected professional  and 
business groups who had been requested to provide inputs. These inputs were critically 
examined to ascertain their usefulness and feasibility. One respondent mentioned that: 
Lots of people gave in evidence of what they felt, either specific part of the policy that they felt 
was unfair to them or they felt generally that the policy was not clear or any way they thought 
it would be improved. The committee decided what to accept or reject (R 25, Tax Consultant).  
It was found from the collective responses of the respondents that a vast amount of inputs was 
collected from other stakeholders. In some instances, the inputs supported or controverted 
existing arguments in the committee. These inputs,  alongside the evidence obtained by the 
committee members themselves were analysed to arrive at most of the provisions in the 2017 
NTP.  
To streamline the activities of the committee and engender specialisation, sub-committees were 
created to focus on different subjects. Each sub -committee synthesised the types of ev idence 
at its disposal and developed a report. The report of each sub -committee was then further 
reviewed by the main committee as mentioned by a respondent:   
Then we had the committee broken down into sub -committees and we had different thematic 
areas, so what we did was look at the different thematic areas. Some of the members were able 
to go back to do their own personal research and come back with input which was fed into the 
different sub-committee and at the end of the day it was submitted to the lar ger committee for 
a review (R 28, Top-level Civil Servant).   
This means the integration in the committee was done at two levels. The micro level, the level 
of the sub-committees and the macro level, which was the larger committee. The membership 
of the sub-committees was done with consideration of members’ expertise and interests. The 
sub-committees considered themes in more detail and where necessary, consulted other sub -
committees or even obtained further inputs from external sources. Thereafter, the sub -
committees analysed the whole gamut of evidence at their disposal, deciding what needed to 
be included in, or excluded from the policy. Finally, the sub -committees developed reports 
which they submitted to the larger committee.
<<<PAGE=205>>>
191 
 
The larger committee, on it s part, considered and analysed all the reports from the sub -
committees and determined the appropriateness and feasibility of the positions taken by the 
sub-committees. This involved more analysis and the synthesising of the positions or 
arguments presented by the sub-committees. Ultimately, the policy was updated to reflect the 
collective decisions of the larger committee.      
  
The other integration site were the stakeholders’ engagements otherwise referred to as ‘town 
hall meetings’ with each meeting taking “ 3 to 4 hours of robust discussions”  (R 27, 
Representative, NGO ). The engagements were held across the ‘geo -political’ zones of the 
country to enhance coverage and acceptability. During the engagements, different interest 
groups participated either physically or in the form of sending inputs. A respondent recalled:  
They (interest groups) all sent in their inputs and participated in a series of stakeholders’ 
physical engagements where relevant issues were discussed and harmonised (R 29, Mid-level 
Civil Servant).  
The discussions and harmonisation involved considering the inputs of stakeholders and 
accepting them, refining them or rejecting them. This means that the meetings provided a 
platform for members to share ideas and scrutinise the various kinds of evidence provided by 
stakeholders.  
One of the most fundamental features of the ‘town hall meetings’, as the name implies was that 
various stakeholders were invited, and all participants were free to express their views. 
Although formal in nature, the meetings were organised and handled in a semi -formal way to 
make the participants feel confident. This encouraged participants to make useful suggestions 
that were considered at the meetings.    
Further, the draft NTP was exposed to the stakeholders during these engagements to secure 
their buy -in and support. Like in the first  integration site, the inputs and positions of the 
stakeholders were considered and scrutinised. This led to the acceptance of some of the inputs 
and the rejection of others. As anticipated, the meeting turned out to be a critical part of the 
policy development, and all outstanding issues were resolved at the meetings leading to the 
amendment of the policy. A respondent noted: 
There was a committee that was set up, people sent in their inputs, and we came up with a draft 
document. It was exposed to the public through stakeholder engagements. Eventually, the final
<<<PAGE=206>>>
192 
 
document was arrived at which was finally approved by the ministry. It also went to the 
national economic council for their endorsement before it became a document (R 23, Top-level 
Civil Servant). 
Like the first integration site, stakeholders were broken into different groups along thematic 
lines with each group required to critique the themes in the draft policy allocated to it after 
which the teams collectively critiqued the entire draft policy. A respondent explained:  
Like I told you, there were sub-committees for different subject matters, so what we tried to do 
was break the stakeholders into four groups and have these four different was presented to the 
stakeholders’ plenary, and it’s now for all members of the stakeholders to critique the work of 
each of the four groups that we broke into four. So , at the end of the day whatever we did not 
agree with, it was agreed, the committee would decide (R 23, Top-level Civil Servant). 
To make the meetings more organised and obtain the best outcome therefrom, the draft policy 
was broken down into chapters, and participants were requested to indicate their interest 
regarding which group they wanted to belong to. This was to enable the participants to choose 
parts of the policy they were more experienced or had more interest in. It was found that a 
number of the stakeholders came to the meetings well -prepared and made convincing 
arguments in support of their preferences. This arrangement worked very well as p articipants 
made rich contributions that enriched the 2007 NTP. Generally, the two integration sites in this 
case study offered stakeholders involved in policy development an opportunity to synthesise 
different kinds of evidence as part of the policy process. 
7.4. THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL LEGISLATORS  
The 2017 NTP is considered an administrative as it did not require the input or approval of the 
legislative arm of government (Ibrahim, 2004). Findings, however, indicate that the input of 
the federal legislators was sought for strategic reasons.  
A respondent elucidated the rationale behind their invitation:  
A tax system typically is supposed to have three legs. The policy, administration, and law.  The 
law is with the national assembly; the policy is with the ministry while the administration is 
with the tax authority…it is important to have synergy and that was the thinking for inviting 
the National Assembly (R22, Mid-level Civil Servant).  
Since the legislature is responsible for making laws and the 2017 NTP was developed to guide 
the tax system in Nige ria, the invitation of the input of the legislators was to achieve two
<<<PAGE=207>>>
193 
 
objectives. The first one was to acquaint them with the knowledge of the subsisting tax policy 
framework to guide them in their legislative functions on tax administration in Nigeria. T he 
second one was that being the representatives of the people, their participation would give them 
an opportunity to contribute to the development of the tax policy which was meant to affect 
their constituencies.  
Thus, the invitation of the legislators w as in part to ‘prepare and enlighten them’  regarding 
major issues in the Nigerian tax administration (R 28, T op-level Civil Servant). Importantly, 
the development of the policy was seen as a major component of a tax system , and as such 
collaboration among the critical stakeholders was seen as a way to improve the effectiveness 
of the tax system as well as improve synergy. The need for synergy is a commendable objective. 
This is especially so because over the years, the relationship between the legislative a rm of 
government and the executive has, for most part, been frosty. A case in point was the unfriendly 
and uncooperative relationship we saw in chapter five between the Social Investment Office 
(NSIO) and the legislators which adversely affected the develo pment and implementation of 
the NSIP.  
Yet, the legislators did not participate in the policy development owing to their disagreement 
with the executive arm of government at the time. A respondent recalled:    
The National Assembly did not play a major role I think partly because at that time t he 
relationship between the executives and the National Assembly was not very smooth, so when 
we were told as part of this process to go to the National Assembly, they just said to the minister 
don't bother coming…So, I think I was disappointed with the Na tional Assembly (R26, 
Professional Accountant). 
The attitude of the legislators further highlights the often -uncooperative relationship between 
Nigerian legislators and the executive arm of government, particularly the MDAs. In many 
instances, as the NSIP case demonstrates, the dispute between the two is not based on principle 
but on selfishness. The non-participation of the National Assembly impacted the policy in two 
broad ways. Firstly, it potentially detracted from the quality of the policy. This is bec ause as 
critical stakeholders, the input of the NASS could have added value to the policy based on their 
knowledge base, experience, and influence. This sentiment is shared by most respondents, with 
one of them stating:    
The (National) tax policy is a landmark policy and I think many people would tell you that all 
the critical stakeholders participated except the National Assembly. For sure, the participation
<<<PAGE=208>>>
194 
 
of the National Assembly would have expanded the sources of evidence with the potential for 
value addition in the policy process (R26, Professional Accountant). 
Secondly, the non -participation impacted the synergy among the three key players in the 
Nigerian tax system - the legislators, the ministry, and the tax authority. While the last two 
players f ully participated in the development of the 2017 NTP, the legislators failed to 
participate. Considering the importance of collaboration and cooperation in policy 
development and implementation, it is easy to decipher that the lack of participation of the 
legislators impacts the required synergy.  
In sum, although the 2017 NTP is an administrative policy not requiring the input of the 
legislators. Nonetheless, the legislators were requested to participate in the development of the 
policy to add value and im prove synergy among the key stakeholders. As we have seen, the 
legislators refused to participate. By spurning the invitation to contribute to the policy, the 
legislators have compromised the ‘robustness of the policy both in terms of policy formulation 
and implementation’ (R 27, Representative, NGO).   
7.5. GOVERNING THE POLICY PROCESS  
A major finding under this variable is that the National Tax Policy Review Committee was 
established by the Minister of Finance who appointed a professor of tax law to head it. This 
demonstrates the minister’s overwhelming influence in the formation of the committee. It also 
demonstrates that the minister determined the membership and leadership of the committee. A 
respondent confirmed that: 
The tax draft committee was establ ished by the minister (of finance) and the committee 
comprised public servants, various professionals and practitioners with a  professor of tax 
law being the chairman of the committee (R 22, Mid-level Civil Servant).  
Two outstanding features are discerni ble from the statement above. One, which was 
anticipated, was that the government included its representatives on the committee to ensure 
that government’s interests were protected and advanced. Also, the representatives of 
government had numerical advanta ge which ensured that working together, they influenced 
proceedings and decisions more than any other bloc. The second feature, which was not entirely 
anticipated was that the minister made a private sector person to head the committee. The 
reason for the minister’s choice was both technical and political. The technical dimension 
related to the personal expertise and experience of the head, being a professor of tax law. This,
<<<PAGE=209>>>
195 
 
together with the inclusion of other experts on the policy development committee confirms that 
the process was relatively technocratic. T he political dimension, on the other hand, was to 
enhance the legitimacy and acceptability of the policy. Choosing a respected academic to head 
the committee, engendered some degree of confidence in th e minds of Nigerians who rarely 
trust the government. Yet, the minister chose someone she could work with; someone whose 
personal ideology was consistent with what the minister wanted. Herein lies a subtle element 
that influenced the policy process and dem onstrates the government’s considerable control of 
the policy process. To emphasise, the two features above taken together underscore the steering 
influence and capacity of the government.   
Findings indicate that several of the private sector members of t he committee had a good 
“understanding with the ministry” (R 28, Top-level Civil Servant). A few of them had worked 
with the ministry on some national projects relating to tax, budget, and fiscal expenditure. For 
instance, the consultants had a good relati onship with the ministry which might be largely 
responsible for offering free consultancy services. Nevertheless, the consultants’ participation 
at no cost was also pursuant to their internal policy of undertaking some gratuitous consultancy 
services. Notwithstanding, the good relationship the ministry had with many of the private 
sector members of the committee ensured that they did not strongly disagree with the ministry, 
and even where that happened, the issue was resolved amicably. 
Another significant demonstration of the government’s steering capacity is that it reserved the 
right to review the committee’s draft policy. As we have seen in the preceding chapters, the 
government established the NTP review committee, and put in place some mechanisms to 
ensure that it significantly influenced the policy process. Yet, upon completion of the review, 
the committee submitted the draft policy to the ministry for approval to issue. The draft policy 
was then reviewed by the ministry and ensured that it was consistent with the ministry’s vision 
as captured by a respondent’s comment:  
Yes, the committee was given a free hand to produce the policy and they obtained information 
from different stakeholders, but you know they also need to ensure they are comfortable with 
the committee’s work before it (policy) was approved (R 23, Top-level Civil Servant). 
The gatekeeping responsibility articulated by the comment above represented the government’s 
final measure to control the policy process. It meant that after all said and done, the government 
maintained the ultimate authority to accept or amend the draft policy before issuance. Although
<<<PAGE=210>>>
196 
 
the government’s action in this regard might be considered as undue influence by some, the 
government reserved the right to ensure that all its policies aligned with its broad vision. 
7.6. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This chapter presented findings from the empirical research conducted on the 2017 NTP, which 
is the third case study in my research. The chapter provided a background to the case study 
highlighting its historical underpinnings.  
The chapter showed that respondents had a good understanding of the term evidence and how 
useful it is in the policy-making process. Further, the respondents identified multiple types of 
evidence for the development of the NTP policy. Finding indicates that ‘local consultants 
evidence’ was considered the most useful evidence while ‘research evidence’ was seen as the 
least useful evidence. The ranking of ‘local consultants evidence’ as the most useful was based 
on the superior technical knowledge and expertise of the consultants who p layed the most 
significant role among all the other experts. As a result, the policy process was largely 
technocratic substantially utilising the skills and experiences of various experts. In contrast, 
‘research evidence’ was considered the least useful ev idence largely because no primary 
research was done to provide input to the policy.  
Findings also indicated that the integration of the multiple types of evidence identified occurred 
in two formal sites. These were the National Tax Policy Review Committee with membership 
drawn from the public and private sectors; and the stakeholders’ engagement meetings which 
were held across the country. These sites provided avenues where various forms of evidence 
were presented and analysed with a view to accepting, ref ining or rejecting them. The sites, 
therefore, served as venues for discussions and debates. 
Findings confirmed that although t he 2017 NTP is an administrative  policy which did not 
require the approval of the legislative arm of government, the inputs of legislators were sought 
to improve their understanding of tax issues and to help them in their legislative duties. The 
legislators, however, did not participate in the policy development mainly because they had a 
fundamental disagreement with the executive arm of government at the time. As a result, it was 
believed that the non -participation of the legislators potentially impacted not only the 
development of the policy but its implementation, as well. It is also believed that their lack of 
participation adversely affected the potential for cooperation and synergy among the key 
players in the tax system in Nigeria.
<<<PAGE=211>>>
197 
 
Lastly, the chapter showed that the government’s steering capaci ty influenced the policy 
development process in a few w ays. First, the government established the tax development 
committee with membership drawn from the public and private sectors. It also chose an 
academic as the head of the committee. Second, it ensure d that its representative had a 
numerical advantage which influenced deliberations and the decisions of the committee. Lastly, 
the government had the final authority for the approval of the policy after its submission by the 
committee. Indeed, the Ministry of Finance reviewed the draft policy and ensured that it agreed 
with the government’s broad policy objectives. 
The next chapter will present the findings on the fourth case study, the National Water Resource 
Policy and Strategy (NWRP).

CHAPTER 8 
FINDINGS  FROM CASE STUDY 4 – NATIONAL  WATER 
RESOURCES  POLICY (NWRP) 
 
8.0. INTRODUCTION  
The cliché that water is life has been around for ages. Indeed, water is generally recognized as 
central to survival and civilization. It is one of the five basic needs - others are food, health, 
peace, and education - and is a common denominator in the other four needs (Federal Republic 
of Nigeria, 2004). Water has therefore assumed critical importance for both domestic and 
industrial use. As articulated by Hakima El Haite, former minister of environment of Morocco, 
“Water connects everything…it is crucial for human development, it is crucial for education, 
it is crucial for health, it is crucial for stability and food security” (Marrakech, 2016). 
Indeed, the absence of potable water has been a major concern for policymakers in the last five 
decades. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN-Habitat, 
the number of people that die from poor water quality is more than those that die from all forms 
of violence including wars (Corcoran et al., 2010 cited in Zawahri et al., 2011). Every year, 1.5 
million people die, mostly in developing countries, due to diarrhoeal disease caused by unsafe 
water (Weststrate et al., 2018).  
The issue of improving access to clean water in developing countries has therefore become a 
politically expedient one. The importance of water as a critical resource is further stressed by 
its finite nature as a natural resource and the attendant growing pressur e on it. Some analysts 
have speculated that the pressure could potentially be a major cause of conflicts around the 
world (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004).  
 To address the issue, especially as it relates to developing countries which are understandably 
the worst hit, numerous events and conferences have been held at the international level. The 
first conference that focused on water was the UN Conference on the Environment held in 
Stockholm in 1972 (United Nations, 1973). Others included: the International Drinking Water 
Decade Conference in Mar del Plata in 1977; the International Conference on Water and the 
Environment in Dublin in 1992; the Drinking Water and Environmental Sanitation Conference 
for the implementation of Agenda 21 in Noordwijk in 1994; and the First World Water Forum 
in Marrakesh in 1997 (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004). A major turning point was the
<<<PAGE=213>>>
199 
 
United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals (MDG) campaign. Launched in 2002 and 
endorsed by 189 countries, the campaign ran from 2002  to 2015 to improve access to potable 
water (Zawahri et al., 2011). Target 7c of the MDG aimed to halve the population without 
sustainable access to water (Onda et al., 2012; Weststrate et al., 2018).  
Drawing from the global response to the water issue, N igeria has increasingly undertaken 
efforts to manage its water resource to ensure optimal utilization. Although Nigeria has 
abundant water resources, poor water governance amid a fast-rising population has made water 
inaccessible to many citizens (Enyidi, 2017; Federal Ministry of Water Resources, 2016; 
Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004). As a result, many Nigerians depend on rivers, streams, and 
boreholes for their water needs (Enyidi, 2017) even as the country’s constitution provides that 
every citizen is entitled to adequate water and sanitation (Federal Ministry of Water Resources, 
2016). Indeed, water is considered “Nigeria’s most unique and indispensable natural resource” 
(Federal Ministry of Water Resources, 2016, p.11). 
Nigerian water resources come from two main sources: rivers and lakes on the one hand, and 
rainfall on the other hand. One key challenge in managing the Nigerian water resource is the 
unequal distribution of the resource. To illustrate, there exists temporal variation in water 
availability across the country with Northern Nigeria having low precipitation of around 
500mm and the Southern part of the country having precipitation of 4,000 mm (Federal 
Republic of Nigeria, 2004). This has manifested in flooding and salt -water intrusion in th e 
Southern part and persistent drought in the Northern part for more than four decades (Federal 
Ministry of Water Resources, 2016).  
In addition, water is the most misused and mismanaged resource in Nigeria leading to acute 
scarcity in many parts of the country, which in turn culminates in a threat to livelihoods and 
the country’s quest for economic growth and development (Federal Ministry of Water 
Resources, 2016). This situation is even worse among the rural areas in Northern Nigeria where 
many people r esort to the use of unclean water from the river or stream with the attendant 
health risks. In urban areas, the health risks are mostly from the purchase of sachet water, some 
of which are unfit for consumption (Enyidi, 2017). 
To address these challenges, preserve the country’s water resource, and have a holistic 
approach to managing the water resource, the government has undertaken a couple of steps, 
some dating back to the colonial era. For instance, in the 1950s, the colonial government 
conducted a geolo gical survey to understand the country’s groundwater resources
<<<PAGE=214>>>
200 
 
(Nwankwoala, 2014). Subsequently, the Nigerian government has implemented various 
measures designed to provide potable water to the Nigerian people. 
The government’s first major effort to devel op the country’s water resources after 
independence was the creation of the River Niger and Lake Chad Basin Commissions as part 
of the first National Development Plan (1962 -1968), followed by the establishment of the 
Sokoto-Rima Basin Authority in 1973 and  the Chad Basin Authority in 1974 to provide the 
citizens with potable water and to boost agriculture (Nwankwoala, 2014). In the 1970s and 
early 1980s, armed with the oil boom proceeds, the country made significant investments in 
the water resources develo pment, especially in the construction of dams to control floods, 
provide water for both domestic and industrial use, and hydro-power generation, among others 
(Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004). 
These measures achieved limited success in part because of th e absence of a framework to 
drive the country’s efforts in the sector, and because the country’s water management 
responsibility is simultaneously performed by the three tiers of Government - federal, state and 
local governments leading to duplication and lack of cohesion ( Federal Ministry of Water 
Resources, 2016; Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004; Nwankwoala, 2014). 
In response, the government developed the first National Water Policy in 2004 based on the 
philosophy of Integrated Water Resource Management  (IWRM) (Federal Ministry of Water 
Resources, 2016) which is a process that prescribes a coordinated management of water and 
other related resources equitably, and for the benefit of the present generation without 
compromising the potential benefit of future generations (GWP 2000, cited in Cho et al., 2021). 
The policy is aimed to address identified challenges and achieve: 
▪ “Clear and coherent regulation.  
▪ Clear definitions of the functions and relationship of sector institutions.  
▪ Coordination Finds solution to the problem of dwindling funds.  
▪ Reliable and adequate data for planning and projections.  
▪ Decentralization in order to boost efficiency, performance and sustainability.  
▪ Autonomy of water supply agencies.  
▪ Regard water as an economic good.  
▪ Create public awareness about water conservation and management.  
▪ Provision of stable and adequate power supply.  
▪ Accountability.
<<<PAGE=215>>>
201 
 
▪ Technical and financial capacity building to efficiently manage water delivery system.  
▪ Human resource development” (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004, 6). 
New developments in the water sector especially the existence of a Water Resources Master 
Plan developed in 2013 and the need to adopt a more participatory approach to policy 
formulation led to the review of the 2004 policy in 2016 (Federal Ministry of Water Resources, 
2016). Thus, the 2016 policy is aimed to reflect emerging realities in the sector and to adopt a 
participatory, demand-driven approach to water resource management instead of the top-down, 
supply-driven approach that “has failed for many reasons including poor community and other 
stakeholders’ participation” (Federal Ministry of Water Resources, 2016, 1). 
The objectives of the 2016 policy are to: 
1. “Optimise the use of Nation’s water resources at all times, for the  present generation 
without compromising the existence of the future generations.  
2. Foster Integrated Water Resources Management which will lead to:  
-Managing the water resources for equitable and sustainable water related sub-sector 
development and environmental protection.  
-Promoting stakeholder participation (governments,  communities, Civil Societies and 
Private Sector) in the water  sector development to meet rapidly growing demand for 
domestic and industrial water supply, sanitation, irrigation  and drainage, food and 
erosion control, hydropower  generation, inland transportation, inland fishery, 
livestock farming and other uses). 
-Improving River Hydrological Area Management by adopting hydrological 
boundaries as the basic units of water resource man agement and regulating activities 
within the Hydrological Areas units.  
3. Managing the water resources for the purpose of eradicating poverty while enhancing 
and improving public health.  
4. Improve and expand the delivery of water services in an equitable manner.  
5. Foster the conservation of water and increase systems efficiencies.  
6. Promote rain water management with sustainable drainage as a method of household 
water supply, drainage and flood control.  
7. Prevent the over-exploitation of groundwater and protect its quality.
<<<PAGE=216>>>
202 
 
8. Promote national and international cooperation and increase the mutually beneficial use 
of shared water resources within Nigeria and with its neighbouring countries.  
9. Facilitate the exchange of water sector information and experience.  
10. Improve governance, institutional development, capacity development and the 
advancement of gender mainstreaming in the water sector. 
11. Conserving the quality of both surface and ground water resources while promoting the 
protection of the environment and associated aquatic ecosystems to ensure long term 
sustainability.  
12. Development of dams and institutionalizing proper dam’s management as a means of 
mitigating flood and erosion.  
13. Position Nigeria on a road map to achieving international and national goals and targets 
in water resources development.  
14. Harness the power generation potentials of dams across the country.  
15. Mitigate the impacts of climate change especially on desertification, floodi ng, coastal 
inundation and rapid drying up of lakes and rivers” (Federal Ministry of Water 
Resources, 2016, pp.14-15) 
8.1. TYPES OF EVIDENCE  
This section examines respondents’ responses to questions on the types of evidence used in the 
development of the NWRP.   
My interactions with the respondents showed that they had a good understanding of the concept 
of evidence -based policymaking and how it enriches policymaking. They all accepted the 
statement that: 
Policymaking today is scientific in that you need t o search for data and information and use 
them to make good policies (R39, Mid-level Civil Servant).  
All the respondents stated that different kinds of evidence were used in the development of the 
NWRP. This finding is consistent with earlier findings regarding the previous policies 
examined in this thesis. It has been established that policymakers in Nigeria make attempts to 
obtain different kinds of evidence in policy development. Indeed, the m ajority of the 
respondents confirmed that they had obtained and used evidence in the development of policies 
in their careers. Generally, the respondents had an optimistic view of the impact of evidence in
<<<PAGE=217>>>
203 
 
policymaking with some of them suggesting that the use of various types of evidence 
guarantees effective policymaking and implementation. 
One respondent, a consultant, however, issued a note of caution.  
I have been in the business long enough to know that while evidence is good, and nobody can 
argue about that, evidence is often over -hyped. Practitione rs need to moderate their 
expectations. A lot of people see evidence as the panacea for ineffective policies but evidence 
is just one of many factors that affect policies. So, all stakeholders need to be aware of this 
reality (R37, Consultant). 
Although th e above intervention was incongruent with the sentiments of majority of the 
respondents, it was a necessary one as it draws attention to the limit of evidence. Majority of 
the respondents seemed to believe EBP is a silver bullet that cures all policy malad ies. They 
talked about EBP, particularly evidence, with passion and belief. The literature, however, tells 
us that evidence is a contentious subject and getting the right types, or sufficient evidence is 
difficult. Fundamentally, evidence is just one of th e many factors necessary for effective 
policymaking, and the impact of evidence in significantly nuanced.  
Notwithstanding, findings reveal that various types of evidence were used in the development 
of the NWRP. A respondent noted:  
The policy review actually started with the ministry…which established a technical team to 
review the policy…Then you have the consultants, and development partners like the EU 
funding the review. Then you have the ministry of water resources, which…provided most of 
the materials and knowledge for the formulation of the policy. Then agencies under the 
ministry, other ministries, academic and…yes, the national water council (R32, Top-level Civil 
Servant).  
The quote above highlights some of the stakeholders that provid ed the evidence used in the 
development of the NWRP. Indeed, findings show that the policy benefited from a wider range 
of evidence than the respondent mentioned.  
Data obtained from respondents regarding the kinds of evidence used in the development of 
the NWRP are presented below.

The table above confirms that various kinds of evidence were used in the development of the 
NWRP. Respondents considered ‘previous policies evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’, and ‘residual 
knowledge of policymakers evidence’ as the most used types of evidence (9) while ‘media 
evidence’, ‘internet evidence’ and ‘external stakeholders evidence’ were the least used 
evidence (7). 
A review of the table above shows that the percentages of respondents that identified each 
source of evidence as having been used in the development of the policy are as follows:    
TABLE 26: TYPES OF EVIDENCE BY PERCENTAGE 
Evidence type Total percentage (%) 
Research evidence 88.9 
Previous policies evidence 100 
MDA evidence 100 
Media evidence 77.8 
Ideology evidence 88.9 
Residual knowledge of policymakers evidence 100 
Internet evidence 77.8 
Local consultants evidence 88.9 
External stakeholders evidence 77.8
<<<PAGE=219>>>
205 
 
Thus, all the nine respondents (100%) reported that ‘previous policies evidence’, ‘MDA 
evidence’, and ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ were used in the development 
of the policy. As regards ‘previous policies evidence’, all the respondents bel ieved that 
erstwhile policies, principally the National Water Policy, were used in policy development. 
Also, all the respondents identified ‘MDA evidence’ as having been used because they believed 
that the Ministry of Water Resources, some agencies under t he ministry, and other ministries 
played a huge role in the provision of the data and information used in the policy development. 
In terms of respondents’ collective mention of ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’, 
all the respondents alluded to a t least one instance where policymakers used their skills or 
knowledge impromptu, to intervene during the policy development process.   
In contrast, only seven respondents (77.8%) thought that ‘media evidence’, ‘internet evidence’, 
and ‘external stakeholders evidence’ were used in the policy development process. Like in the 
other three policies, a significant number of the respondents did not believe that ‘media 
evidence’ and ‘internet evidence’ were used in the development of the NWRP. This was largely 
because many of the respondents did not utilise them in their search for evidence. However, 
the responses of a few of the respondents that ‘external stakeholders evidence’ was not used in 
policy formulation came as a surprise because findings show that develo pment partners, 
especially the EU, did provide evidence. Thus, the two respondents (22.2%) that reported that 
‘external stakeholders evidence’ was not used in the development of the policy were probably 
not aware of the participation of the development partners.   
8.2. HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE  
This theme examines the relative importance respondents attached to the nine types of 
evidence. Respondents were requested to rank the nine types of evidence in order of how useful 
they were in the development of the NWRP. The respondents were guided by the information 
in Table 27 below.
<<<PAGE=220>>>

6 6th  Most useful evidence 
7 7th  Most useful evidence 
8 8th  Most useful evidence 
9 9th  Most useful evidence 
 
This means the respondents ranked the most useful evidence as 1; the second most useful 
evidence was ranked 2; the third most useful evidence was ranked 3; the fourth most useful 
evidence was ranked 4; the fifth most useful evidence was ranked 5; the sixth most useful 
evidence was ranked 6; the seven most useful evidence was ranked 7; the eig ht most useful

Respondents’ rankings of the nine kinds of evidence were turned into scores to reflect the 
relative weight the respondents accorded each type of evidence. This was done in such a way 
that the higher an evidence was ranked, the higher it was scored in line with Table 29.

The Table shows the total score for each of the nine kinds of evidence. The higher the score of 
a type of evidence, the more useful it was considered by the respondents. A review shows that 
the total scores for the nine types of evidence from the highest to the lowest are as follows:

Figure 7 above shows that ‘p revious policies evidence ’ is at the peak of the pyramid. This 
means respondents widely considered it the most useful evidence in the development of t he 
NWRP. Interestingly, five of the nine respondents ranked it as the number one (most useful) 
evidence among all the evidence used in making the policy. The explanation of one respondent 
is insightful on this choice: 
A policy was already in existence which was redone to conform with global trends and make it 
more effective. So, it was the first and most useful source of evidence. You know the new policy 
was not entirely new per se. And as is traditional in policymaking, where you have an old 
policy, it should be the first choice in terms of evidence (R31, Consultant).      
The erstwhile policy referred to by the respondent above was the National Water Policy (NWP) 
which was developed in 2004 to regulate the country’s water system. The NWP soon became 
inadequate to address emerging challenges in Nigeria’s water sector. To add ress those 
challenges and  develop a policy that is participatory and demand -driven, the government 
established a committee to review the old policy. Expectedly, the principles and provisions of 
the NWP served as the baseline information for the new policy,  the National Water Policy 
Resources Policy (NWRP), which was developed in 2016. Other relevant policies and even the 
constitution of the country was also used and thus, provided further evidence. Indeed, the 
policymakers ensured that the NWRP was consistent with the Nigerian constitution especially 
regarding the rights and responsibilities of all stakeholders in the water ecosystem.  
Notably, in the development of the NWRP, new issues like funding and financing, the 
relationship between water and key econo mic activities in Nigeria, principles of Integrated 
Water Resource Management (IWRM) and the institutional arrangement to achieve the IWRM 
targets were introduced. Notwithstanding, the policymakers used the NWP as the overriding 
template which they updated with the generated evidence accordingly. In accordance with the 
incremental policymaking philosophy, the use of the NWP as the main source of evidence for 
the development of the NWRP was, therefore, to build on the existing policy in force because 
a lot of work has gone into it.  
Conversely, respondents widely believed that ‘media evidence’ was the least useful evidence 
in the policy development. Findings show that in the development of the NWRP, t he media 
role was very minimal. During the policy development, there was no formal engagement with 
the media; none of the respondents disclosed the use of media as evidence in policy 
development. This finding is surprising considering that the media in Nigeria has over the years
<<<PAGE=224>>>
210 
 
been very critical of many governme nt policies. And unlike during the military regimes, the 
media in democratic Nigeria have significant freedom. Yet, ‘media evidence’ has consistently 
ranked poorly in the respondents’ perception in this thesis mainly because they believed the 
media often resorted to sensationalism to boost their readership and increase their bottom line.  
Specific to the NWRP, ‘media evidence’ was the least useful because the media offered very 
little in terms of coverage and recommendations. Water resources issues have not  been 
politically salient in Nigeria in the last three decades or so, and as such media attention to them 
have been scant and tentative. In fact, even where adverse events like flooding occurred, the 
media tended to gloss over it and identified the problem s without proffering solutions. 
Generally, the media failed to pay sustained attention to water resources issues hence the 
paucity of ‘media evidence’ in the development of the NWRP.  
A respondent stated:   
The media in Nigeria especially the print, in ord er to sell they look for sensation and (water) 
policy issues are not sensational…editorials about policy issues are not common here. (R31, 
Consultant). 
As a consequence, respondents felt ‘media evidence’ played a far less role than other kinds of 
evidence in the development of the NWRP. The role of the media, however, increased 
marginally after the development of the NWRP when they broadcast the policy. As expected 
of the media after the release of a policy, they carried the story as a news item for informational 
purposes.  
8.3. INTEGRATION OF EVIDENCE  
The previous section discussed respondents’ perceptions of the relative usefulness of the 
different kinds of evidence used in the development of the NWRP. T his section will examine 
how the different kinds of evidence were integrated into the policy process.  
This study maintains that the policy environment is replete with chaos. Part of the chaos is that 
different players in the policy environment provide different, often contradictory, evidence for 
consideration. It is, therefore, useful to analyse how the different kinds of evidence were 
integrated into the policy process. 
This study found out that the integration took place in two formal sites where the various types 
of evidence generated were harmonised.
<<<PAGE=225>>>
211 
 
The first integration site comprised the technical committee established by the Ministry of 
Water Resources to review the erstwhile National Water Policy (NWP). The committee 
developed the first draft of t he policy. The team, initially led by consultants, obtained 
information from different sources which it scrutinised and harmonised. The staff of the 
Ministry of Water Resources in the team provided a considerably high amount of information 
and data on acco unt of their access to the ministry’s database. They provided invaluable 
institutional memory, underscored by their knowledge of the ministry’s policies and processes. 
Other agencies and parastatals of the ministry, and staff of other ministries also participated in 
the process and provided information concerning their operations and how to make the policy 
effective. In addition to the generation of evidence, staff of the MDAs ensured that the NWRP 
was in synergy with the ministry’s specifications and the country’s peculiarities.  
The committee held many meetings in which they considered the multiple evidence on offer. 
The first task the committee undertook was to analyse the current policy which enabled 
members to be abreast of its content. The committee th en received inputs from other 
stakeholders. Findings show that the committee had a considerably large array of inputs from 
diverse sources as explained by a respondent: 
(We) got so much information from various sources which we had to prioritise based on quality 
and feasibility. So, we interrogated all the data and of course those that didn’t meet those 
criteria we had to jettison while some were in the grey area and we had to tweak to make them 
useful. So, we took many decision as we proceeded but we had to keep going back and forth to 
reflect new information (R37, Consultant). 
The statement above highlights the way the committee analysed and integrated the different 
kinds of evidence generated for the development of the NWRP. Specifically, the integration 
involved a few stages across the policy development process. First, the old policy was 
projected, and the committee members went through it line by line and examined every 
provision. Second, the inputs received from the stakeholders were analysed. Committee 
members provided inputs (particularly information and data) to support their preferences. 
Third, the consultants cleaned up the document and projected the updated document in a 
technical committee meeting. This was to obtain the validation of members reg arding the 
updated provisions. The committee synthesised the various types of evidence available and 
then made a judgement as to what should be in the policy and what should be excluded. 
Instances of disagreements or discrepancies were addressed in one tec hnical meeting or the 
other through extensive discussion and deliberations . Finally, a draft policy was produced 
which was largely based on the various inputs received and considered.
<<<PAGE=226>>>
212 
 
While the highlights of the integration presented a seemingly straightforward exercise, in truth, 
it was a relatively ardours task. To buttress, the development of the policy including the 
integration of the various kinds of evidence led to the production of six drafts before the final 
one. Simply put, the integratio n involved extensive discussion and deliberations by members 
as regards how each type of data and information fit into the policy being developed. This was 
done through what a respondent described as “separating the wheat from the chaff” (R39, Mid-
level Civil Servant).  
The separating the wheat from the chaff analogy indicates the team’s effort to determine which 
evidence went into the policy and which did not - an integration function. As expected, there 
were debates around the usefulness and f easibility of the evidence types, supporting the 
characterisation of the technical committee as a site where different kinds of evidence were 
integrated into the policy process.  
The second integration site was the stakeholder meeting. Many of the meetings , with some 
called “ zonal workshops” took place in the six geo -political zones in the country and the 
nation’s capital to obtain the views of stakeholders. This process was undertaken by the 
technical committee with the consultants playing a lead role. The main stakeholders in the 
meetings were the directorate cadre in the Ministry of Water Resources from all the 36 states 
of the federation and the National Water Resources Council, which is the highest policymaking 
body in the Nigerian water sector, comprising all the state commissioners responsible for water 
resources in the country. 
 
At this stage, the draft policy developed by the technical committee was ready. Each of these 
meetings was, therefore, to present the draft to water resources policymakers acr oss all the 
states of the federation and the apex water resources policymaking body. The key objective of 
the meetings was to obtain the perspectives and endorsement of the stakeholders. Considering 
that the states have their peculiarities, and are at different levels of development, the meetings 
were valuable in gauging how suitable the provisions of the draft policy were to the states. It 
is also worth mentioning that although a federal policy, the states would be responsible for the 
implementation of a number of the provisions in the policy, hence the need for their buy-in.  
  
Findings reveal that several participants identified areas that needed amendments, especially 
areas they felt were inconsistent with their states’ peculiarities. They, therefore, offered
<<<PAGE=227>>>
213 
 
recommendations, backed by evidence, to address the perceived inconsi stencies. The 
workshops analysed these concerns and recommendations and arrived at collective decisions.  
 
A respondents recalled: 
One interesting thing about the workshops was that stakeholders’ inputs were discussed and 
debated and a decision reached on whether an input should be accepted or not. And I would 
say the workshops were quite useful in bringing consensus in a lot of the contentious issues 
(R34, Representative, Development Partner).   
The stakeholder meetings, like the technical committee served  as a site for the integration of 
various kinds of evidence. Indeed, the stakeholders made valuable contributions regarding the 
appropriateness of various provisions in the policy and the quality of the whole policy. These 
inputs were discussed and, in som e instances, intensely debated to arrive at decisions. In the 
end, the stakeholders endorsed the policy for issuance, having been largely satisfied with it. 
8.4. THE ROLE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATORS  
The NWRP is an example of an administrative policy since it did not need the input or approval 
of the federal legislature. As a result, the developers of the policy did not seek the inputs of the 
federal legislators as confirmed by respondents.  
This is not a law that needed the approval of the legislature. It is only a policy initiated by a 
ministry to achieve its mandate so there was no need for legislative approval (R34, 
Representative, Development Partner).   
The statement above is correct and underline s the fact that the inputs of the legislators were 
neither invited nor expected in the development of the policy. Having said that, recent 
developments in the water sector indicate that the involvement of the legislators would have 
been valuable. 
In 2017, the executive arm of the government introduced a bill to, among other things, regulate 
the use and management of water resources in a sustainable and equitable manner. The bill was 
titled ‘A Bill for An Act to Establish a Regulatory Framework for the Water Resources Sector 
in Nigeria, Provide for the Equitable and Sustainable Redevelopment, Management, Use and 
Conservation of Nigeria’s Surface Water and Groundwater Resources and for Related Matter.’
<<<PAGE=228>>>
214 
 
The bill was passed in the House of Representatives and se nt to the Senate for concurrence.  
Some senators, however, truncated the bill insinuating that it was an attempt by some powerful 
interests to take control of the country’s water resources. Subsequently, the Senate refused to 
pass the bill.  
Considering the nexus between policy and legislation in Nigeria which was demonstrated in 
the case of the establishment of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) in 2019, 
where the National Migration Policy (NMP) developed in 2015, played a significant role, the 
involvement of federal legislators in the development of the NWRP would have improved the 
understanding of legislators and potentially elicited their support for the bill. It suggests, 
therefore, that where policymakers envisage that a policy might be strengthened by a legislation 
in the future, they should endeavour to engage legislators to enlighten and lobby them. 
8.5. GOVERNING THE POLICY PROCESS  
Findings revealed that many respondents believed that the government was alive to its 
responsibility of “coordinating and managing” the entire policy process (R32, Top-level Civil 
Servant). To start with, it was the Ministry of Water Resources that establi shed the technical 
committee that reviewed the erstwhile National Water Policy (NWP). As we have stated 
previously, members were drawn from the Ministry of Water Resources, parastatals under the 
ministry, other ministries, development partners, and consult ants. The Ministry of Water 
Resources, therefore, selected all the members, except the representatives of the development 
partners. The power to select the members of the committee was clearly one of the most 
influential decisions in the development of the policy.   
Secondly, the ministry provided the technical committee with Terms of Reference (ToR), 
stipulating the scope and objectives of the assignment as indicated by a respondent:  
The government was…in charge of the policy process. Based on its sovereignty, the government 
set the rule and hold the committee accountable (R35, Top-level Civil Servant).    
The clear implication of the statement above is that the committee was required to function 
within the bounds set by the ministry. Even though the committee had diverse membership and 
multiple types of evidence at its disposal and was given relative independence to deliver on its 
mandate, the ToR guided its operations. Also, representatives of the Ministry of Water 
Resources ensured that all through the process, the committee’s work was in line with the 
ministry’s specifications and the country’s vision.
<<<PAGE=229>>>
215 
 
I think the ministry did very well in the area of consultation and consideration of stakeholders’ 
inputs. In fact, some people said there was consultation overload (laugh)…so, the ministry did 
well to ensure that the process was not hijacked by stronger interests (R38, Top-level Civil 
Servant).      
Thirdly, findings show that the consultants selected by the ministry had a healthy professional 
relationship with the ministry, which indicates that the two could work together amicably. The 
two did work together amicably until “some disagreements emerged”  that could not be 
resolved (R31, Consultant). As a result, the appointment of the consultants was terminated by 
the ministry who replaced them with another set of consultants. This capacity to hire and fire 
possessed by the ministry was an unquestionable manifestation of the saying he who pays the 
piper calls the tune. Within the context of governing the policy process, it underlines the 
ministry’s power and influence.  
Fourthly, findings further show that for most part, the ministry funded the policy process 
especially the numerous stakeholder enga gements even though “ some development partners 
helped in the technical areas” (R35, Top -level Civil Servant). Based on the funding, the 
ministry had considerable leverage and shaped the engagements in terms of scope, level of 
participation, and timing.        
Finally, like in all the other policies, the government reserved for itself the exclusive right to 
approve the policy. Specifically, the draft policy was submitted to the Federal Ministry of 
Water Resources who ratified the policy before seeking the approval of the Federal Executive 
Council, which is the cabinet of the country.  
8.6. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This chapter presented empirical findings from the fourth and last case study of this research, 
the National Water Resources Policy (NWRP). First, the chapter provided a background to the 
case study, highlighting national and international dimensions to the evolution of the policy. 
Findings showed that respondents had a good understanding of EBP and the importance of 
evidence in policymaking. A few respondents expressed caution over the high hope EBP elicits, 
nevertheless. Although this is an interesting finding, it was not the focus of this study.   
The research identified nine kinds of evidence used in the development of the NWRP with 
‘previous policies evidence ’ as the most useful evidence. The choice of ‘previous policies 
evidence’ as the most useful evidence was predicated on the fact that the NWP, which served
<<<PAGE=230>>>
216 
 
as the forerunner of the newly developed NWRP, provided most of the informa tion used in 
policy development. Conversely, ‘media evidence’ was the least useful evidence because the 
media did not consider water resources issues as politically salient and as such provided very 
limited coverage and recommendations for the issues.  
Findings also showed that the multiple evidence identified by respondents were integrated at 
two formal sites. These were the locations where the various inputs collected were considered 
for inclusion in the policy. The first site comprised the technical team  established by the 
Ministry of Water Resources including representatives of the government, consultants, and 
development partners, which reviewed the old policy. The team played a significant role in the 
generation and harmonisation of the various forms of evidence. The second site were the zonal 
workshops, many of which took place in the country’s six geo-political zones and the nation’s 
capital. The main stakeholders that participated in the workshops were the directorate cadre in 
the states’ ministries in charge of water resources, and the National Water Resources Council, 
which is the highest policy making body in the Nigerian water sector, comprising all the state 
commissioners responsible for water resources in the country. 
Evidence from the chapter indicated that the NWRP is an administrative policy and 
policymakers did not seek the inputs or approval of the federal legislators. This research holds 
the view that considering the far -reaching impact the po licy is expected to make in the 
country’s water resources sector, and the plan to enact a water resource law to guide the sector, 
federal legislators ought to have been involved as stakeholders to iron out grey areas and solicit 
their support.  
Lastly, findings showed that although the development of the NWRP involved a wide range of 
policy actors from both the public and private sectors.   
The next chapter will present cross-case analysis of the major findings of the four case studies.

CHAPTER 9 
CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS   
9.0. INTRODUCTION  
The last four chapters presented the findings from the field in respect of the four policies used 
as case studies for this study. This chapter presents a cross-case analysis of the cases and aims 
to explore their similarities and dissimilarities with a view to supporting empirical conclusions. 
The analysis of the findings is presented within the context of the four cross -data themes 
adopted in the analysis of the individual policies. It is apposite to mention that the themes are 
part of an interrelated policymaking process and as such some overlaps will be noticed.  
For ease of reference, the four case studies are presented as follows in this section:

9.1. TYPES OF EVIDENCE  
The first theme addresses my first research question on the kinds of evidence used in the 
development of the four policies selected for this research. Importantly, although the four 
policies are different with disparate background stories and objectives, t hey share a lot of 
similarities in terms of the kinds of evidence used in their development. Thus, a comparable 
set of evidence types were anticipated and confirmed as highlighted in Table 33.

As Table 33 highlights, the respondents identified nine types of evidence used in the 
development of each of the policies, except in the case of NTP where ‘ external stakeholders 
evidence’ was not mentioned as a source of evidence by any of the respondents . For each 
policy, the table shows the number of participants, from a sample size of nine, that reported the 
use of each type of evidence in the development of that policy.  
Starting with the NSIP, a review of the findings above shows that  all the nine respondents 
reported that ‘previous policies’ evidence’ and ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ 
were used as evidence. Other responses are as follows: eight respondents mentioned that 
‘research evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’, and ‘ideology evidence’ were used; seven respondents 
stated that ‘internet evidence’ and ‘external stakeholders evidence’ were used; six respondents 
said ‘local consultants’ evidence’ was used, and four respondents reported that ‘media 
evidence’ was used. 
As per the NiDCOM, the responses are as follows: all the nine respondents reported that 
‘previous policies evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’, ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ 
and ‘local consultants evidence’ were used as evidence; seven respondents ‘internet evidence’, 
‘media evidence’ and ‘external stakeholders evidence’. Meanwhile, six respondents mentioned 
that ‘research evidence’ and ‘ideology evidence’ were used as evidence.  
For the NTP, the responses are as follows: all nine respondents stated that ‘local consultants 
evidence’ was used as evidence; eight reported that ‘previous policies evidence’ was used; 
seven reported that ‘ideology evidence’ and the ‘internet evidence’ were used; six mentioned 
that ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ and ‘MDA evidence’ provided evidence. 
Lastly, five respondents stated that ‘research evidence’, and ‘media eviden ce’ were used as 
evidence.

Finally, as regards the NWRP, the responses are as follows: all nine respondents mentioned 
that ‘previous policies evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’, and ‘residual knowledge of policymakers 
evidence’ were used as evidence. Eight responde nts reported that ‘research evidence’, 
‘ideology evidence’ and ‘local consultants evidence’ were used as evidence while seven 
respondents affirmed that ‘media evidence’, ‘internet evidence’, and ‘external stakeholders 
evidence’ were used as evidence. 
A key finding in this theme is that there were a lot of commonalities in terms of respondents’ 
perceptions of the kinds of evidence used in the development of the four policies. At least four 
respondents reported that each of the nine types of evidence was used  in policy development, 
except for the NTP where no respondent mentioned ‘external stakeholders evidence’ (this is 
discussed shortly).  
Notwithstanding these similarities, the findings show a recognisable level of differences in 
respondents’ perceptions an d responses. For instance, while six respondents reported that 
‘ideology evidence’ served as an evidence in the development of the NiDCOM policy, three 
respondents did not think so. This finding was anticipated and confirmed. The reasons for this 
disparity include the subjective nature of the phenomenon and the difference in the positioning 
of the respondents. A civil servant who participated in the invitation of other stakeholders, and 
collated the various evidence types would have a helicopter view of the  issue while a 
respondent who represented an interest group on the policy development committee would 
probably have a restricted view.  
As pointed out earlier, in terms of the NTP, respondents did not mention that ‘external 
stakeholders evidence’ provided evidence. This is because unlike in other policies, the 
government did not invite or got input from ‘external stakeholders evidence’. One respondent 
explained that the high level of tax evasion and tax default in the country compelled the 
government to involve only local stakeholders to address what was considered a problem that 
can only be efficiently addressed with local inputs. A number of respondents considered the 3 
months policy development period as being too short to enable the inclusion of ‘externa l 
stakeholders evidence’ as evidence.  
Findings across the four policies demonstrated the pre -eminence of ‘previous policies 
evidence’ as it received the highest mention in total. In aggregate, of the 36 respondents in the 
whole study, 35 mentioned that ‘p revious policies evidence’ was used in the development of 
the four policies. The evidence with the second highest aggregate mention was ‘residual
<<<PAGE=234>>>
220 
 
knowledge of policymakers evidence’ (33) jointly followed by ‘local consultants evidence’ and 
‘MDA evidence’ w ith 32 each. Others include: ‘ideology evidence’ (29), ‘internet 
evidence’(28), and ‘research evidence’ (27).    
At the bottom, ‘external stakeholders evidence’ received the least aggregate mention, closely 
followed by ‘media evidence’. Whereas 21 responde nts mentioned the former, the latter was 
mentioned by 23 respondents. The ‘external stakeholders evidence’ had the least aggregate 
mention because it was not used as an evidence in the development of the NTP.   
When considering the types of evidence used in the development of the four policies examined 
in this study, it has emerged that all the nine kinds of evidence were used by the respondents. 
Indeed, it was found through the interviews that except for the NTP, where eight types of 
evidence were used, all the nine types of evidence were used in the development of the other 
three policies. Notably, while differences in perception existed in terms of the kinds of evidence 
respondents felt were used in the development of each policy as shown by the non-mention of 
some evidence types by some respondents, what is not in contention is the fact that all the 
respondents considered the use of multiple evidence as non -negotiable and wondered how 
policies could be developed otherwise. Thus, considering the four policies chosen for this study 
represent the two broad policy types in Nigeria, it is logical to assert that policies in Nigeria 
are developed with most or all of these nine types of evidence. 
9.2. HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE  
Like in the previous theme, there are a n umber of similarities and differences regarding 
respondents’ perceptions of the importance they attached to the different kinds of evidence 
used in the development of the four policies.  
  
One prominent similarity is that all the respondents recognised that although all evidence types 
are useful, some are more useful than others. Their perceptions of the relative usefulness of 
each type of evidence are, however, different in some instances in a remarkable way. Take for 
instance respondents’ rankings of the nine types of evidence used in the development of the 
NSIP. Seven of the nine respondents mentioned ‘ideology evidence’ as the most important 
evidence, one respondent believed it did not serve as an evidence while the remaining one 
considered it the least useful evidence ranking it ninth which translates into the lowest score of 
one point. He justified his ranking by explaining that Nigeria does not “implement ideology”
<<<PAGE=235>>>
221 
 
and although ‘ideology evidence’ could have been “politically said…it was not a major driver 
of the (NSIP) policy” (R7, University Professor).  
  
He, however, admitted that the APC “campaign was strong on”  the social protection of 
vulnerable Nigerians which me ans the party ideology actually served as an evidence. His 
decision to view ‘ideology evidence’ as the least useful evidence might have been influenced 
by a historical bias where policies of previous governments were not known to be ideologically 
driven. Thus, context and the orientation of respondents influenced their perception leading to 
an interesting aggregate of respondents’ views as captured in Tables 34, 35, 36, and 37.

Table 35 illustrates that in the development of the NiDCOM policy, the nine respondents, on 
aggregate, ranked ‘MDA evidence’ as the most useful evidence with a total score of 63. The 
respondents ranked the other types of evidence as follows: ‘previous poli cies evidence’ was second 
with a total score of 57; ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ was third (53 total score); ‘local

respondents ranked ‘external stakeholders evidence’ as the second least useful evidence with a total 
score of 27 and ranked ‘ideology evidence’ as the least useful evidence with a total score of 25.

 As shown by Table 36, the nine respondents, on aggregate, believed ‘local consultants 
evidence’ was the most useful evidence in the development of the NTP, having a total score of 
56. This is followed by ‘previous policies evidence’ which has a total score of 50 and ‘ideology 
evidence’ with a total score of 38. Further, the respondents ranked ‘internet evidence’ as the 
fourth most useful evidence (37 total score), and ‘MDA evidence’ as the fifth (29 total score). 
The other types of evidence, as ranked by t he respondents are: ‘residual knowledge of 
policymakers evidence’ was ranked sixth (26 total score); ‘media evidence’ was ranked seventh 
(20 total score); and lastly ‘research evidence’, ranked eighth with a total score of 15.

Finally, Table 37 shows that the nine respondents, on aggregate, viewed ‘previous policies 
evidence’ as the most useful evidence in the development of the NWRP with a total score of 
74 and ‘media evidence’ as the least useful evidence, ranked eighth with a total score of 17. In 
between the two, they ranked ‘MDA evidence’ as the second most useful evidence (58 total 
score); ‘research evidence’ and ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ as the joint 
third most useful evidence (52 total score) and ‘ideo logy evidence’ as the fourth most useful 
evidence (42 total score). The others are: ‘local consultants evidence’ ranked fifth (39 total 
score); ‘external stakeholders evidence’ ranked sixth (39 total score); and ‘internet evidence’ 
ranked seventh (28 total score).  
 Thus, a major finding is that respondents’ perceptions of the relative usefulness of the various 
kinds of evidence differ significantly. To buttress, there existed no commonality in what 
respondents, on aggregate, considered the most useful evid ence across the policies. For 
instance, using the aggregate figures, respondents for the NSIP, ranked ‘ideology evidence’ as 
the most useful evidence. Their counterparts for the NTP, reserved that status for ‘local 
consultants evidence’. Meanwhile, NiDCOM respondents believed ‘MDA evidence’ trumped 
other types of evidence. Lastly, respondents for the NWRP viewed ‘previous policies evidence’ 
as the most useful evidence.  
  
Respondents’ thoughts on the least useful evidence across the policies are not any dif ferent. 
Whereas respondents for the NSIP, on aggregate, believed ‘media evidence’ was the least 
useful evidence, respondents for the NTP felt ‘research evidence’ was the least useful evidence. 
As per NIDCOM, ‘ideology evidence’ was seen by respondents as t he least useful evidence 
while respondents for the NWRP ranked ‘media evidence’ as the least useful evidence. Thus, 
as far as the respondents’ rankings for the most useful and least useful evidence are concerned, 
there is consistency in only one area which is the ranking of ‘media evidence’ as the least useful 
evidence by the respondents for the NSIP and the NWRP. 
  
To estimate the relative usefulness of the nine types of evidence across the four policies, I have 
aggregated the total score for each evidence  (based on respondents’ ranking) as presented in 
Table 38.

As outlined in Table 38, ‘previous policies evidence’ has the highest total score suggesting that 
it was, on aggregate, the most useful evidence across the four policies examined in this study. 
The majority of respondents believed ‘previous policies evidence’ represents the foundation of 
the policies they pa rticipated in developing and it provided them with baseline resources to 
build on.  
  
A synthesis of the respondents’ responses on this variable shows that the success and (mostly) 
the failure of previous policies provided invaluable learning points to the  respondents in the 
development of new policies. For example, in the cash transfers component of the NSIP, the 
“weaknesses and strengths…(of) about twenty -six” previous policies were studied aimed to 
“build on the strengths and address the weaknesses”  of t he said policies (R1, NSIP Top 
Management Executive). As per the extant NTP, respondents mentioned that the poor 
stakeholder consultation conducted for the development of the previous NTP motivated the 
incorporation of many new players. For some respondents, however, it was simply a matter of 
policy pragmatism:  
  
“…as is traditional in policymaking, where you have an old policy, it should be the first …and 
most useful source of evidence” (R31, Consultant).
<<<PAGE=239>>>
225 
 
Discussions with the respondents conclusively sh ows that they placed a high premium on 
previous policies owing to their inherent learning capabilities and the depth of legacy 
information they possess. In terms of learning, respondents leveraged policy successes and 
learnt lessons from policy failures to  avoid recurrence. To most of the respondents, previous 
policies are the most strategic and convenient types of evidence in policy development.  
  
In contrast, the respondents, on aggregate, considered ‘media evidence’ as the least useful 
evidence. Their reasons are for the most part closely relates to the ‘media evidence’ being more 
sensational than objective in their reportage, making their input less welcome. In fact, some 
respondents were of the view that media organisations in Nigeria “discredits everything for 
whatever reason” (R1, NSIP Top Management Executive) , likening it to throwing away the 
baby with the bath water.  
  
It was unmistakable from the interviews that most of the respondents had a negative view of 
the influence of media evidence. A number of them clearly mentioned that they were reluctant 
to use information from the media as useful evidence for policymaking because the media were 
mostly sensational and speculative without providing alternatives for consideration. Some 
other respondents felt the reason for this is because the media were more concerned about 
attracting readers’ patronage for profit than positive policy outcomes. Within the context of the 
findings of this study, the media in many ways, is seen as less useful and even unhelpful to 
most of the policymakers.   
  
Returning to the total score presented in Table 38, the relative usefulness of the other kinds of 
evidence are as follows: ‘MDA evidence’ (2nd), ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ 
(3rd), ‘local consultants evidence’ (4th), ‘ideology evidence’ (5 th), ‘research evidence’ (6 th), 
‘internet evidence’(7th), ‘external stakeholders evidence’ (8th).     
  
Consequently, I have developed an empirical hierarchy of evidence to show the “usefulness” 
of each evidence, in descending order, as illustrated in Figure 8.

9.3. INTEGRATION OF EVIDENCE  
A notable feature of all four policies is that although they are public policies, they were 
developed through continuous collaboration between numerous state and non-state actors. The 
collaboration involved consultation, discussions, iteration, and integra tion of the different 
evidence types. A summary of the key players that participated in the development of the 
policies is presented in Table 39.

The table above shows that a wide range of players, representing different interests within the 
public and private sectors participated in the development of the policies.  
  
A key similarity across all the policies is the participation of two stakeholders  across all the 
policies suggesting their importance in policymaking in Nigeria. The first one, the MDAs, are 
anticipated and confirmed based on their mandatory responsibility of public policy formulation 
and implementation. Their participation is, therefo re, to add value to the policies, enhance 
policies’ alignment, facilitate implementation, and most importantly present the position of the 
government. Indeed, the development of each policy required the involvement of ministries 
and agencies that were relevant to the policy being developed. For instance, in the case of NSIP, 
which was mainly to empower deserving citizens through conditional cash transfer, vocational 
training, or paid work placement as teachers, agriculturalists, social welfare workers, heal th 
workers, and the rest, the federal ministries of education, agriculture, health, labour and 
employment, and a host of related departments and agencies participated.  
  
The second stakeholder group that participated in the development of all the policies  was the 
local consultants. In terms of the NWRP, respondents confirmed that the first draft of the 
NWRP was developed by consultants. Also, the NTP was not only driven by local consultants,
<<<PAGE=242>>>
228 
 
but respondents agreed that they (the local consultants) played the most significant role among 
all the stakeholder groups in policy development. Similarly, respondents reported that local 
consultants drove the review of the NSIP when the government faced some teething 
implementation challenges. Regarding the NIDCOM, al though the role of local consultants 
was not as influential as the other three policies, they participated actively, nevertheless.    
  
As the findings demonstrate, three of the four policies had external participants with the NTP 
being the odd one. None o f the respondents mentioned external participants as a kind of 
evidence because as the respondents revealed, there was neither external influence nor support 
in the development of the policy.   
  
One key difference across the policies was that federal legi slators, especially the relevant 
legislative committees, participated in the development of the two legislative policies (NSIP 
and NiDCOM) in fulfilment of their constitutional responsibilities but not in the development 
of the administrative policies (NTP and NWRP). In the same vein, stakeholders’ participation 
as outlined in Table 39 shows that the participation of stakeholders was based on their relevance 
to the policy domain under reference. For instance, the National Union of Teachers, the only 
trade organisation that participated in the development of any of the policies was involved in 
the development of the job creation component under the NSIP because their expertise was 
needed in respect of the plan to deploy graduates as teachers in secondary scho ols. The 
participation of the National Water Resources Council in the development of the NWRP, the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria in the development of the NTP, and the 
Directorate of Technical Aid Corps in Africa in the development of NiDCO M was all based 
on their relevance hence the lack of uniformity in stakeholders’ participation.     
  
In terms of the integration of the different kinds of evidence into the policy process, findings 
indicate a high degree of similarity as presented in Table 40.

As the findings show, a key similarity across the policies is that all the policies were either 
wholly or significantly developed by advisory committees. Notably, two of the policies, the 
NTP, and the NWRP were developed by technical committees while for the NSIP, the policy 
proposal was developed by an inter -ministerial committee. As per the NiDCOM policy, its 
precursor, the National Migration Policy (NMP), was developed by an inter -ministerial 
committee. It was found that the NiDCOM policy draws substantially from the NMP. Also, the 
draft NiDCOM Bill was reviewed by a technical committee that “worked diligently on the 
NiDCOM Bill” (R17, Legislator). This means that the committees not only served as providers 
of evidence but as aggregators of evidence as we ll. Within the context of the integration 
variable, the functions of the committees include the examination of the multiple types of 
evidence obtained to “make a judgment as to their suitability” (R17, Legislator).   
 
Findings also show that the technical committees operated as advisory committee. Two 
respondents used the words “advice” and “advising” respectively to describe the 
responsibilities of the technical committees to the government. A number of respondents 
confirmed this position.  
 Another key similarity is that except for the NiDCOM policy, the other three policies involved 
the integration of evidence at sub -national levels. Indeed, findings indicate that stakeholder 
workshops and meetings were held in the country’s six geo-political zones for the development 
of the NTP, the NWRP, and the NSIP. For the NSIP, respondents reported that such workshops 
were held more frequently across the country. Respondents affirmed that the workshops 
provided avenues for the generation and integration of multiple pieces of evidence from a wide
<<<PAGE=244>>>
230 
 
range of individuals and groups. The odd policy is the NiDCOM policy where there was no 
evidence of either generation or integration of evidence at the sub-national levels. 
  
As regards the legislature, it was expected and confirmed that the two legislative policies (NSIP 
and NiDCOM) were subjected to legislative interventions at different periods of their 
development. Both the Senate and House of Representatives had committees on poverty 
alleviation and diaspora matters for the development of NSIP and NiDCOM, respectively. For 
the two policies, the integration, therefore, occurred in plenaries, but mostly, in the relevant 
committees on the floors of the houses where competing types of evidence were presented and 
evaluated. Discussions in both houses, for both policies, involved a whole gamut of issues, 
particularly issues relating to funding, equity, structures, and sustainability.  
 9.4. GOVERNING THE POLICY PROCESS  
As the findings indicate, the government’s steering capacity was a prominent feature in the 
development of the four policies. Generally, the government steered the policy processes in 
similar ways which is anticipated considering the tendency for a government to use the same 
policy style and because the policies wer e developed within a comparable time frame. 
Notwithstanding, there are a few areas of notable dissimilarities in the way the government 
steered the process.     
  
One of the key similarities across the four policies is that they were all developed wholly or 
partly by committees established by the government. The establishment of the committees by 
the government indicates that the government is influential. Additiona lly, findings show that 
the government set the ground rules for the committees, including the use of ‘terms of 
references’ to guide deliberations. These two points suggest some degree of hierarchical 
imposition in support of a strong steering capacity of the government. 
  
Building on these similarities, the government, in all cases, was able to determine who served 
on the policy development committees and whose contributions were sought outside the 
committees. There is ample evidence of the government inviting individuals and organisations 
that they had prior relationships with to either be part of the committees or to participate as 
critical stakeholders in the policy process. Evidence also shows that the government chose the 
leadership of the committees.
<<<PAGE=245>>>
231 
 
 
Importantly, a key difference is identified regarding the leadership of the committees. Whereas 
two of the committees (for the NTP and the NWRP) were led by members of the private sector, 
the NSIP was headed by an elected public officer. For the NiDCOM po licy, the inter -
ministerial committee that developed the NMP, the precursor of the NSIP, was headed by a 
public servant, while the technical committee that reviewed the draft NiDCOM Bill was headed 
by a member of the private sector. A significant number of the respondents believed the power 
to choose the leadership of these committees gives the government significant influence.  
  
Another common feature across the committees is that they offered technical knowledge to the 
government, often beyond what the g overnment possessed. This point resonates with several 
respondents across the policies. They suggested that the committees added significant value to 
the policy process which is the key reason why the government patronised them. Across the 
policies, there are, however, a few respondents who, while not undermining the contributions 
of the committees, suggested that the contributions of the committees, and indeed all 
stakeholders, were only useful if they strengthened the government’s pre -determined policy 
preferences. Beyond that, however, respondents alluded to the committees and the larger 
stakeholders enhancing the legitimacy and acceptability of policies.   
  
It is found that the government was largely responsible for funding the entire policy 
development process, especially the various stakeholder consultations. This suggests the 
likelihood of governmental influence in the policy process. Findings indicate, ho wever, that 
some international development partners offered technical support in the development of the 
NSIP and NWRP. This finding may suggest that the development partners may have had some 
modicum of influence in the policy process.   
  
Another key simi larity across the policies is that the government was the final approving 
authority regardless of the dynamics of the policy development. In that regard, the committees 
submitted draft policies to the government for consideration. Respondents suggested that even 
where the government conceded some authority to private sector actors, the ultimate power to 
approve a proposal resided with the government.  
   
The findings under this variable have significant implications within the context of the 
government’s steering capacity. It demonstrates, in support of the arguments espoused by state-
<<<PAGE=246>>>
232 
 
centric relational scholars, that although numerous private sector players were involved in the 
development of the four policies examined in this study, the government still re mained by far 
the most influential player in the policy process. Invariably, the findings contradict, in 
important ways, the state -centric account of policymaking, which privileges a hierarchical 
policymaking process, and the society -centred account which argues that in policymaking, 
governments have been substantially marginalised by the private sector actors.   
 
9.5. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION   
This chapter presented a cross -case analysis of key findings on the four policies examined in 
this study. T he analysis has shown that there are more similarities than differences in many 
perspectives of the policies which is not surprising considering that the policies were developed 
by the same government and within a comparable time frame. Notwithstanding, th e analysis 
demonstrates some interesting dissimilarities. The key findings that emerged from the analysis 
are presented in the following paragraphs. 
  
All the nine types of evidence jointly provided by the researcher and respondents were used in 
the development of each of the policies, except the NTP where ‘external stakeholders evidence’ 
was not used. This means for the NTP, eight types of evidence were identified. Despite these 
similarities, a reasonable level of disparity was found in respondents’ perceptions of the kinds 
of evidence used. To illustrate, while six respondents reported that ‘ideology evidence’ served 
as an evidence in the development of the NiDCOM policy, three respondents felt they were not 
used. On aggregate, ‘previous policies evidence’  was returned as the most frequently used 
evidence (35 of the 36 respondents mentioned it as used across the four policies). In contrast, 
‘external stakeholders evidence’ has the least aggregate mention (with 21 out of 36 mentions) 
largely because it was not used as evidence in the development of the NTP.   
  
In terms of the hierarchy of evidence, the different kinds of evidence had different weights as 
far as their relative usefulness is concerned. In other words, even though all the evidence types 
are useful, some are more useful. The findings show that ‘previous policies evidence’ was also 
considered as the most useful evidence in the development of the four policies investigated, 
whereas ‘media evidence’ was seen as the least useful evidence.
<<<PAGE=247>>>

Regarding the integration of evidence, three integration sites were identified as follows: 
technical/advisory committees, the legislature, and stakeholder meetings otherwise referred to 
as either “town hall meetings” or “zonal workshops”. It was found that in the d evelopment of 
each policy, at least two of the three sites were used to integrate evidence. Interestingly, all the 
policies were either fully or partly developed by committees, bringing to the fore the 
importance of committees in policy development in Nige ria. The legislature was found, as 
anticipated, to have participated in the integration of evidence regarding only the two 
legislative policies (NSIP and NiDCOM) in plenary and in the relevant house committees 
consistent with their statutory responsibiliti es. Further, the integration of evidence also took 
place across the country’s six geo-political zones except in the case of the NiDCOM. 
Finally, the findings show that the government had a significant capacity to steer the 
policymaking process in respect of the four policies. Broadly speaking, the government was 
able to achieve that in four ways. First, the government established the techn ical/advisory 
committees and chose the leadership of the committees. There was evidence to suggest that 
some of the stakeholders the government invited were ‘friends’ with the government, with a 
likelihood that they would not be antagonistic to the governm ent’s vision. Second, it set the 
ground rules to guide the policymaking process by issuing ‘terms of references’ to the 
committees. There was no evidence to show that the committees or other stakeholders went 
contrary to the terms. Third, although some int ernational development partners offered 
technical support in the development of the NSIP and NWRP, the government was largely 
responsible for financing the policy development process especially the numerous stakeholder 
consultations. Fourth, the government  was responsible for approving the draft policy 
irrespective of the policy development arrangement in place. As a result, the government was 
able to amend or refine some part of the policies being developed. Should it desire to reject an 
entire policy, the government, indeed, had the power to do so. This, alongside the other points 
on the government’s steering capacity, means that the government’s steering capacity in the 
development of policies in Nigeria is alive and well.        
The next chapter presents a discussion of the cross-case analysis within the context of existing 
literature.

CHAPTER 10 
DISCUSSION  
10.0 INTRODUCTION  
The last chapter presented a cross-case analysis of findings for the four policies, highlighting 
their similarities and dissimilarities. This chapter discusses the findings and evaluates how they 
fit in with existing knowledge on the topic. The discussion is presented in line with the four 
cross-data themes adopted in the analysis of the individual case studies. 
10.1. GENERALISATION OF FINDINGS  
This study is built on the premise that the multiple case study approach, on account of its 
engagement with more cases, engenders better knowledge of a phenomenon and improves the 
theory-building capability of research (Bryman and Bel l, 2015; O’Leary, 2014; Yin, 2014).  
However, we must also recognise the limitations imposed by the subjective and largely context-
dependent responses of the respondents. Our objective (in this chapter) is to summarise the key 
themes emerging from the cases  to facilitate understanding of our findings and present some 
hypotheses regarding their generalisability. 
Thus, my “goal is not to produce a standardised set of results that any careful researcher in the 
same situation or studying the same issue would hav e produced” Schofield (2000, p.71). 
Instead, it is to simplify a complex phenomenon by describing the four cases in “sufficient 
descriptive narrative so that readers can vicariously…draw their own conclusions” which may 
not be the same as mine (Stake, 1994, p.243).    
10.2. TYPES OF EVIDENCE  
Existing literature on what constitutes evidence in policymaking is varied ( Greenhalgh and 
Russell, 2009; Head, 2008, 2010; Kay, 2011; Maddison 2012; Parkhurst, 2017). The dominant 
perspective espouses that evidence mea ns research-based knowledge  obtained through 
systematic research (Greenhalgh and Russell, 2009; Head, 2010; Kay, 2011). In other words, 
it is scientific and recognises only empirical data that is replicable. Proponents of this narrow 
characterisation of ev idence disavow non -scientific evidence such as stakeholder inputs or 
residual knowledge of policymakers (Greenhalgh and Russell 2009; Kay 2011; Oakley 2002).
<<<PAGE=249>>>
235 
 
Opponents of this narrow definition of evidence, however, assert that in addition to research-
based knowledge, evidence in the policy context encompasses the views and values of 
stakeholders, debates, and the prevailing political dynamics ( Greenhalgh and Russell 2009; 
Head 2008; Maddison 2012). Accordingly, evidence comes from “politics, judgement and  
debate” instead of “being deduced from empirical analysis” (Head 2008 p.1). The two positions 
highlighted above demonstrates conclusively that the determination of what is evidence is 
contested. The findings of this research underline the contested nature  of evidence as 
differences exist in respondents’ responses regarding the kinds of evidence used in the 
development of the policies examined in this research. 
A key finding in this theme is that nine kinds of evidence, comprised of research evidence, 
previous policies’ evidence, MDA evidence, media evidence, ideology evidence, residual 
knowledge of policymakers’ evidence, internet evidence, local consultants’ evidence, and 
external stakeholders’ evidence, were used in the development of three policies (NSIP , 
NIDCOM, NWRP). On the other hand, eight of the nine types of evidence, excluding external 
stakeholders’ evidence, were used in the development of the other policy (NTP). 
These findings have opposite implications for the two perspectives of evidence. It i s 
incongruent with the dominant school of thought that advocates that research evidence should 
be the only kind of evidence to drive policy . Granted that research evidence was part of the 
nine types of evidence used in the development of the four policies, it was not the only evidence 
type used. In fact, as we have seen in the cross-case analysis chapter of this study, on average, 
respondents consider research evidence as the 6th most useful evidence, suggesting the relative 
importance policymakers attach to it. In specific terms, these findings go against the 
recommendation of positivist theorists such as Oakley (1998) and Slavin (2004) that scientific 
experimentation should be the standard in social policymaking.  
On the other hand, the findings align with the minority notion that evidence should come from 
different sources. Thus, the variety of evidence sources used in the development of the four 
policies of this study is congruent with the claim of the interpretivist scholars. It is worth noting 
that the findings are also congruent with the prescription of the UK Cabinet Office Strategic 
Policy Making Team (SPMT) which is used for comparison based on its experience in policy 
praxis. The SPMT itemises nine types of evidence in use in the UK public sector as presented 
in Table 41.

It is interesting to note that nine types of evidence are identified by SPMT, the same number 
that is identified in this study. Beyond this, however, the similarities between the two sets of 
evidence are limited. The highlight of the similarities is that t here are two kinds of evidence 
that are clearly like for like - previous policies, and the internet. This suggests the two are 
recognised as evidence in both the Nigerian and the UK public services. Notably, some of the 
evidence types proposed by the SPMT and the ones used in this study bear a close resemblance. 
For example, “published research” (as per SPMT) approximates ‘research evidence’ (as per 
this study), the key difference being that the former requires research to be published to qualify 
as evidence while in the case of this study, research needs to be conducted purposely to address 
an identified policy problem. Also, SPMT’s “expert knowledge” seems to encompass this 
study’s ‘local consultants evidence’ and “Residual knowledge of policymakers’ evidence. It is 
observed that the SPMT’s “stakeholder consultations” is extensive because it is meant to cover 
engagements with all stakeholders whereas this study disaggregates stakeholders into two 
clusters, namely, the media, and external stakeholders. While  SPMT’s categorisation is 
convenient, it blurs the nature and influence of the different kinds of stakeholders in the policy 
process. 
Incongruities are, however, observed in two types of evidence adopted for this study – ‘MDA 
evidence’, and ‘ideology evidence’ - which are not part of the evidence types identified by 
SPMT. By the same token, “existing statistics”, “outcomes from consultations”, “costings of 
policy options”, and “output from economic and statistical modelling” are not among the types
<<<PAGE=251>>>
237 
 
of evidence adopted for this study. These evidence types are, however, not as disparate as their 
labels suggest. Indeed, on a closer scrutiny, most of them share similar features with some of 
the evidence types adopted for this study.  
For instance, considering the policy capacity of the UK civil service (Head, 2014) and the huge 
amount of data in its possession (Stevens, 2010), it is reasonable to believe that the four SPMT 
evidence types: “existing statistics”, “outcomes from consultations”, “costi ngs of policy 
options”, and “output from economic and statistical modelling” are provided or collated by the 
civil servants in the UK. Flowing from this assumption, one can see further similarities between 
the four types of evidence as per SPMT and this study’s ‘MDA evidence’.  
The absence of ‘ideology evidence’ in the SPMT listing, however, remains. Remarkably, this 
evidence is identified by Phil Davies, the former Deputy Chief Social Researcher in the UK 
(Nutley et al., 2013). Within the frame of this stu dy, the ideology of a government or its 
manifesto is presented as a source of evidence. This is because policymakers are sometimes 
inspired by, and get policy information from, what the government promises the citizens during 
campaigns, the government’s co mmunication with citizens, or the political beliefs of the 
government in power.     
In all, there are a number of similarities and differences between the types of evidence adopted 
for this study and the ones identified by SPMT as shown in Table 42

Regarding policymaking in Nigeria, the findings of multiple types of evidence are incongruent 
with the prevailing notion that policymaking in Nigeria is not based on evidence but instead on 
the whims of policymakers, particularly the elites (Ayuk and Marouani, 2007; El-Rufai, 2013; 
Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021; Ibrahim, 2004; Usman, 2004; Sanni et.al, 2016 ). Curiously, the 
findings do not fit in with the views of past Directors General of the Nigerian Institute for 
Social and Economic Research (NISER), a foremost policy think tank in Nigeria, who in 2010 
expressed displeasure over the non -utilisation of evidence, especially research evidence, in 
policymaking in the Nigerian public sector (Yagboyaju, 2019). 
In more specific terms, the empirical findings are contrary to the sentiments expressed by many 
policy theorists and practitioners who claim policymaking in Nigeria is anything but evidence-
based. As a result, they have described the country’s policymaking in pejorative terms: “self -
centred” ( El-Rufai, 2013, p .323), a “smokescreen” (Usman, 2004, p.108), “hit and run” 
(Yagboyaju, 2019, p.5) and developed by a “Dream Team” – a metaphor for a few members 
of the elite (Ibrahim, 2004, p.19). On account of the use of research knowledge as evidence in 
this study, the findings are also contrary to Sesan and Siyanbola’s view that the lack of policy
<<<PAGE=253>>>
239 
 
structures in the country means the utilisation of research knowledge in policy formulation is 
dependent on “individual ‘champions’” (2021, p.9).  
The findings are, however, c ongruent with a burgeoning minority view that advocates that 
policymaking in Nigeria is done using multiple types of evidence. To illustrate, Onwujekwe 
et.al (2021) identified seven types of evidence used in the development of urban development 
policies in Nigeria, namely, policy evaluation, lessons from other countries, previous policies, 
situation analysis, literature review, theoretical knowledge, and policy evaluation.  
Additionally, this study’s findings highlight empirical congruency with the findings  of 
Akinbinu, and Tiamiyu (2016) that civil servants in Nigeria used numerous types of evidence 
to develop policies across different domains. The scholars identified 14 types of evidence: 
internal files and documents, academic books, colleagues or superior s, the internet, 
newspapers, government publications/annual reports, academic journals, research reports, 
committees, research libraries, indexes, researchers in the universities/polytechnics, 
researchers in research institutes, and students’ thesis and dissertations. Notably, there are some 
notable similarities between the evidence types they identified and those adopted for this study 
with two, the internet and newspapers (media), being alike. Others are not alike but bear some 
resemblance. In this catego ry, there are government publications, research reports, academic 
journals, research libraries, researchers in the universities/polytechnics, researchers in research 
institutes, and students’ theses and dissertations which could be collapsed into ‘research  
evidence’ as used in this study.  
Also, internal files and documents could be closely related to ‘previous policies evidence’ as 
used in this study because previous policies and the processes that birth them are usually 
documented and stored in internal files. Government publications could  also fit with the 
‘previous policies evidence’ used in this study. Furthermore, colleagues or superiors could be 
considered as part of ‘MDA evidence’ (as per this study) since Akinbinu, and Tiamiyu’s (2016) 
participants are civil servants. It may, however , be more useful to see ‘MDA evidence’ as a 
distinct type of evidence considering the significant impact it had on the four policies used for 
this study and the fact that it was a well-structured and deliberate type of evidence representing 
the official position of a ministry, department or an agency unlike the personal input of some 
random “colleagues or superiors”. The findings are also congruent with the following specific 
evidence types identified in Onwujekwe et al., (2015) relating to the development of health
<<<PAGE=254>>>
240 
 
policies in Nigeria: previous policies, research evidence, consultants’ evidence, and 
policymakers’ opinions and experiences.  
A further empirical congruency is found in Sanni et al. (2016). Their study identified eight 
kinds of evidence employed by Nigerian federal and state lawmakers in the discharge of their 
policymaking functions. The eight types of evidence comprised expert opinion, the internet, 
evidence from seminars, newsletters, policy briefs, academic journals, public opinion polls, 
and legislative resolutions. One important dimension worthy of note is that the evidence 
classification by Sanni et al. (2016) is well -structured and deals with policy development at 
both the federal and the state level unlike Akinbinu, and Tiamiyu (2016) that  focuses entirely 
on policy development at the state level. These characteristics, thus, make it a better fit from a 
comparative point of view.

As seen in Table 43 above, the two sets of evidence are exact in only one area, the internet 
evidence. They are, however, similar in three other areas notwithstanding the differences in 
nomenclature: media (public opinion polls), local consultants (expert opinion), a nd research 
findings (academic journals). For instance, the media encompasses the entire gamut of contents 
including editorials, news item and public opinion polls so to that extent, public opinion polls 
as used in Sanni et al., (2016) is a subset of the ‘ media’ as used in this study. Also, expert 
opinion (as per Sanni et al., 2016) seems like an omnibus type of evidence that could comprise
<<<PAGE=255>>>
241 
 
many stakeholders including civil servants, academics, and consultants (Meling, 2022). Thus, 
under this premise, MDAs,  local consultants, and even external stakeholders as used in this 
study could conveniently be called experts, further showing a similarity between the two sets 
of evidence. Finally, research findings in the current study can be compared with academic 
journals as Sanni per et al. (2016) even though as regards the contextualisation in this study, 
‘research evidence’ refers to only research conducted for the purpose of developing a particular 
policy.   
  
Additionally, seminars as used in Sanni et al. (2016) a re closely related to the workshops and 
other stakeholder engagements used to generate and integrate evidence as found in this study. 
Similarly, newsletters as periodic bulletin to share relevant information to members of an 
organisation (legislators in th is case) can be seen as part of the media as used in this study. 
There also exists a relationship between policy briefs and previous policies to the extent that to 
prepare a brief, government officials often articulate a ‘problem definition’ highlighting t he 
weaknesses of existing policies.     
  
Ideology evidence was, however, not identified in Sanni et al. (2016) as a type of evidence in 
Nigeria even though the current study identifies it. Akinbinu, and Tiamiyu’s (2016) empirical 
study also fails to accord ideology evidence such recognition. Other studies located in Nigeria 
such as Onwujekwe et al., (2015) fail to mention ‘ideology evidence’ as an evidence used in 
policymaking in Nigeria. The current study, however, agrees with Phil Davies, the former 
Deputy Chief Social Researcher in the UK who mentioned it as a type of evidence in the UK 
(Nutley et al.,  2013). Majority of the respondents mentioned that ‘ideology evidence’ is a 
critical factor in policymaking in Nigeria, with a number of them claiming that it is the most 
useful type of evidence, where it exists. Some even suggest that policymakers routinely use the 
government’s “body language” as an evidence.   
  
Another type of evidence that has emerged from this study which previous empirical studies 
do not adequately characterise as such is ‘local consultants evidence’. A review of the literature 
suggest that scholars subsume ‘local consultants evidence’ into ‘expert evidence’, ‘expert 
opinion’ or similar sounding concepts which weakens its centrality and impact on 
policymaking. In this regard, a tranche of the literature advocates that ‘local consultants  
evidence’ could comprise inputs from academics, civil servants, and consultants (Meling, 
2022). Notwithstanding, the significant and fast -growing contributions of consultants to the
<<<PAGE=256>>>
242 
 
four policies of this study suggest the need for ‘local consultants evidence’ to be recognised as 
a distinct type of evidence in the literature (Gunter et al., 2015; Lapsley et al., 2013). 
  
Also, although theorists and practitioners have espoused that foreign influence impacts 
policymaking in Nigeria, empirical research on the  country have not identified ‘external 
stakeholders evidence’ as a substantive type of evidence. For instance, Akinbinu and Tiaminu 
(2016) and Sanni et al., (2016), do not consider it as a type of evidence in their studies. 
Meanwhile, Onwujekwe et al., (2015) mentions “lessons from international experience” which 
exclusively relates to the acquisition of knowledge through policy transfer. Elsewhere, Steven 
(2011) highlights “various kinds of reports from abroad” as a source of evidence in the UK 
public service. Yet, Phil Davies (cited in Nutley et al., 2013) does not recognise it as a type of 
evidence.  
 This study, however, found evidence of an active and structured influence of external 
stakeholders, particularly development partners, in the development of three of the four policies 
under examination. The development partners did not only provide funds in support of two of 
the policies (NSIP and NWRP) but provided technical input, as well, indicating a deliberate 
effort to significantly influence the policy development. In the case of NiDCOM, the Nigerian 
Diaspora community actively participated in the policy development and provided significant 
inputs based on their experiences. As a respondent (R18, Representative, Diaspora 
Community) explained, the ultimate decision to establish a commission rather than a ministry 
to handle the diaspora issue was “favoured” by a section of the diaspora community who 
lobbied for it. On this note, three of the four policies had external participants with the NTP 
being the odd one. 
  
A probable explanation for why external stakeholders’ evidence is rarely seen as a type of 
evidence is the dearth of empirical research on evidence in Nigeria. Indeed, studies on the types 
of evidence used in policymaking disproportionately have a Western focus. The relatively high 
political and economic independence these Western countries enjoy, coupled with their 
advanced policy capacity, make them less vulnerable to external influence in domestic 
policymaking. In the case of developing countrie s, however, theory suggests the influence of 
external stakeholders in domestic policy development (Ayuk and Marouani, 2007; El -Rufai, 
2013; Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021). This resonates with the findings of this study which found 
that external stakeholders se rve as a type of evidence in three of the four policies examined. 
Notably, respondents explained how external stakeholders provided evidence in the
<<<PAGE=257>>>
243 
 
development of the three policies. In the development of NSIP, a key respondent (R3, Top 
level Public Servant) emphasised the role played by the UNICEF and the world bank to “guide 
and aid” policy development including funding some study tours which exposed policymakers 
to good practices on social investment programmes. For the NiDCOM policy, the “EU and 
other donors like the German government, the Swiss government” provided input and support 
(R13, Top-level Civil Servant) with the EU “funding the review” of the NWRP (R32, Top -
level Civil Servant).  
  
Strikingly, in all the four policies, the government ensured t hat the primary targets provided 
inputs. To elaborate, the Nigerian diaspora community was actively involved in the 
development of the NiDCOM. In fact, a former chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora 
Organisation, North UK chapter was the chairman of the te chnical committee that reviewed 
the NiDCOM Bill prior to its passage into law. The case of the NSIP is illuminating. To get the 
views of the poor and the vulnerable, who were the target beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash 
Transfer component of the NSIP, the government visited numerous villages and other locations 
of the target beneficiaries to get their inputs which were recorded and utilised in the policy 
development.    
 
Yet, there were a few instances where inputs and evidence seemed to have been used for 
political reasons only; to justify the position already favoured by the government. The most 
prominent case was in the development of the NiDCOM policy where findings suggested that 
the government had “already taken a position” (R 16, Civil Society) to establish an agency to 
address the migration issue and still called for inputs from s takeholders. Two major solutions 
were offered by the stakeholders: the establishment of a ministry, and the establishment of an 
agency. The government, therefore, used the latter option as an “ammunition” since it was 
“congenial and supportive” of its preference (Weiss, 1979, p.429).        
  
Notwithstanding, it is evident from the findings under this variable that policymakers in 
Nigerian employ a wide range of evidence to develop public policies. For each of the policy 
examined in this study, findings rev ealed the use of multiple sources of evidence by 
policymakers. Notably, almost all those interviewed cited multiple forms of evidence, often 
five or more; and in the discussions, it was clear that they were very reluctant to make decisions 
without referring to multiple forms of evidence. These findings contrast with some theoretical 
discussions that assume that policymaking in Nigeria is devoid of the use of multiple forms of
<<<PAGE=258>>>
244 
 
evidence. The findings are also in contrast to the romantic notion that research evidence should 
be the only evidence to drive policy development. Truth is while the ‘only research’ evidence 
mantra is theoretically appealing; no real-world policymaker thinks you can develop a policy 
from only research evidence. The findings, therefore, support and build on the minority view 
that “a wide breath of evidence” is used in the development of public policy in Nigeria 
(Onwujekwe et. al 2015, p.10).  
10.3. HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE  
Existing literature proclaims that policymakers attach different levels of importance to various 
kinds of evidence used in policy development (Boruch and Rui, 2008; Davies, 1999; Hansen, 
2014; Head, 2010; Kazi et al., 2011; Leigh, 2009; Haynes et al., 2012). The findings of this 
study have confirmed this view with interesting participants’ perspectives.  
  
Findings across the four policies show that participants’ perspectives vary, often in a dramatic 
way, and do not follow any distinctly recognisable pattern. This situation is observed within 
each policy and across the four policies, reminding us of the subjective nature of respondents’ 
views. On aggregate, there is no commonality in what respondents considered the most useful 
evidence across the cases. For instance, respondents for the NSIP, ranked ‘ideology evidence’ 
as the most useful evidence. Their coun terparts for the NTP viewed ‘local consultants 
evidence’ as the most useful evidence while NiDCOM, respondents believed ‘MDA evidence’ 
is the most useful evidence. Last but not the least, respondents viewed “previous policies 
evidence” as the most useful evidence in the development of the NWRP.  
  
Respondents’ perceptions on the least useful evidence across the policies, on aggregate, are not 
significantly different. Whereas respondents for the NSIP believed ‘media evidence’ is the least 
useful evidence, re spondents for the NTP reserved that title to ‘research evidence’. As per 
NiDCOM, ‘ideology evidence’ is seen by respondents as the least useful evidence while 
respondents for the NWRP felt ‘media evidence’ is the least useful evidence. Thus, as far as 
the respondents’ ranking for the most useful and least useful evidence is concerned, there is 
consistency only in the ranking of ‘media evidence’ as the least useful evidence by the NSIP 
and the NWRP respondents.
<<<PAGE=259>>>
245 
 
The inconsistency in the level of importance policymakers attached to different kinds of 
evidence is not a peculiar phenomenon. Rather, the finding fits in with existing knowledge on 
the topic to the effect that scholars and practitioners have different opinions on which evidence 
is the most useful and which is as least useful (Alliance for Useful Evidence, 2015; Boruch and 
Rui, 2008; Hansen, 2014; Haynes et al., 2012; Leigh, 2009; Nutley et al., 2013). On a whole, 
there are more differences than agreements in respondents’ perceptions of the relative 
importance of the nine types of evidence for this study. 
 
The total score of each type of evidence is tabulated below.

It is important to state upfront that each of the three views under comparison presents a mixture 
of common and unique evidence types. The common types, which the three views share, are 
internet evidence, research evidence, and media evidence (which Akinbinu and Tiaminu 
referred to as newspaper evidence). The unique ones are many and vary significantly. From 
Phil Davies’ perspective, the unique evidence types are expert evidence (including consultants

248 
 
and think tanks), street evidence (urban myths, conventional wisdom), opinion-based evidence 
(including lobbyists/pressure groups), lay evidence (constituents’ or citizens’ experiences), and 
cabbies’ evidence. Akinbinu and Tiaminu on their part have government publications and 
reports, input of colleagues or su periors, committees, research libraries, academic books, 
academic journals, researchers in research institutes, researchers in tertiary institutes, indexes, 
and students’ theses and dissertations as unique evidence types. For this study, the unique 
evidence types are:  ‘MDA evidence’, ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’, ‘local 
consultants evidence’ and ‘external stakeholders evidence’. 
 Essentially, the way each view ranks different evidence types in terms of their usefulness 
offers an interesting discussion. The three views are predominantly different with no consensus 
across any single evidence type. Put another way, the three views are not in agreement as 
regards, for instance, which is the most useful evidence, which is the second, third, fourth most 
useful, and so on. The closest in terms of a consensus regarding the usefulness of evidence is 
in two areas where two views are consistent. The first one relates to Akinbinu and Tiaminu’s 
internal files and documents vs. this study’s “previous policies evidence”.  
 
Although Akinbinu and Tiaminu did not define what internal files and documents are, from my 
personal experience in policymaking in Nigeria, they probably mean all general files and 
related documents regarding a particular field of an organisation’s operations including 
previous policies and policy development materials. With this assumption, one can say there is 
a similarity between this study and Akinbinu and Tiaminu that previous policies are the most 
useful evidence in policy develo pment. Phil Davies, however, considered expert evidence 
(including consultants and think tanks) as the most useful evidence. 
  
The other consensus is Phil Davies’ view on ‘research evidence’ which coheres with Akinbinu 
and Tiaminu’s research report. This means that both accounts place ‘research evidence’ as the 
ninth most useful evidence in policy development. This study, however, adjudges ‘research 
evidence’ as the sixth most useful evidence.  
  
These findings, therefore, fit with the theory that policymak ers’ perceptions of the usefulness 
of various kinds of evidence used in policy development differ. In corollary, and as confirmed 
by Table 45, there is no agreement between the evidence types in this study and those of both 
Phil Davies and Akinbinu and Tiaminu except in one area, (‘previous policies evidence’ in this
<<<PAGE=263>>>
249 
 
study and Akinbinu and Tiaminu’s “internal files and documents” after interpreting the latter 
to mean the former).       
    
A plausible explanation for the difference in perception relates to context, which played a key 
role. A few examples are appropriate here. Take the NSIP as a case in point, respondents felt 
that the government ideology and party manifesto is “the foundational basis for the 
programme” (R 8, Management Consultant) and having  clearly promised the people a social 
welfare programme during campaigns, majority of the policymakers considered government’s 
promise as the most useful evidence. To strengthen this line of argument, this study found that 
the N5,000 welfare support promised by the APC political party during the campaign session 
was the amount approved for distribution to the poor and vulnerable under the Conditional 
Cash Transfer component of the programme.  
  
Another example is that the development of the NTP was driven b y local consultants at the 
instance of the Minister of Finance who provided them with all the support they needed. All 
the respondents generally believed the consultants’ “impact was great, perhaps the greatest of 
any demographic”  (R 21, Top -level Civil Se rvant). This explains why ‘local consultants 
evidence’ evidence’ was generally adjudged by respondents as the most useful evidence in the 
development of the NTP.  
  
In contrast, respondents viewed ‘ideology evidence’ as the least useful evidence in the 
development of NiDCOM policy because, since the return of democracy in Nigeria in 1999, 
no political party or government has made the diaspora issue a cornerstone of its programmes. 
As admitted by a respondent, NiDCOM has no bearing with any particular politi cal party or 
government and successive Nigerian governments “had a lukewarm attitude towards the issue 
of migration.” (R13, Top-level Civil Servant).  
  
As regards, the NWRP, respondents considered ‘media evidence’ as the least useful evidence 
in the policy development because the ministry did not consider them as a value-adding partner. 
According to a respondent “in the process of formulating the policy itself, we didn't interface 
with the media at all” (R35, Top-level Civil Servant).
<<<PAGE=264>>>
250 
 
In all, this study found that context is of utmost importance in the determination of the relative 
priority policymakers attach to the different kinds of evidence on offer, supporting the findings 
of previous studies including Onwujekwe et. al (2015) and Sesan and Siyanbola (2021). 
  
Returning to the empirical hierarchy developed from the findings of this study, the hierarchy 
shows that on aggregate, “previous policies evidence” is the most useful evidence in the 
development of the four policies of this study. This finding lends credence to the incremental 
policy theory which emphasises the improvement of previous policies in the development of 
new ones ( Anderson, 2015; Kingdon, 2014; Lindblom 1959) . As the findings demonstrate, 
policymakers consulted and benefited from previous policies to develop all four policies of this 
study. In fact, one respondent stated that previous policies represented the “first and most 
useful source of evidence” (R31, Consultant) which confirms the findings of this study. Many 
respondents advanced a number of reasons to justify why they thought previous policies’ 
evidence was the most useful in policy development. The phrase ‘legacy policies’ was 
mentioned by some respondents in reference to how policymakers used previous policies as 
“the baseline for the new policy” (R37, Consultant). In this regard, policymakers benefit from 
extant thinking, principles or practices, usually arrived at after rigorous deliberations. 
Considering that policymakers are unendingly bounded rationally, it is easy to understand their 
pragmatism (Anderson, 2015).  
  
Further, a few policymakers stated that the success of previous policies provided necessary 
learning points for them in terms of what to emulate. The failure of previous policies, however, 
provided the m ost learning according to many respondents. Since policy development is a 
response to policy failure, many respondents reported that policy failure provided an extremely 
useful insight into what went wrong and the lessons to be learnt to avoid recurrence. Put 
differently, the findings indicate that one of the key reasons respondents believed previous 
policies were the most useful kind of evidence was because they embody the pitfalls that 
policymakers wish to address. In a nutshell, in the development of the  four policies the 
respondents considered the “progress, and setbacks experienced” in relation to the 
implementation of previous policies (Onwujekwe et.al 2021, 529). This thinking is supported 
by the arguments of policy scholars including Hogwood and Gunn (1984) and Bovens,and ‘t 
Hart (1996) who argued that policies mostly fail because they are either not based on the right 
information (evidence) or they are not effectively implemented. As clearly stated by some of 
the respondents, their recourse to previo us policies was to avoid informational deficit and
<<<PAGE=265>>>
251 
 
enhance policy implementation. Another perspective to the respondents’ prioritisation of 
previous policies is the path dependence theory which stresses that history matters - 
policymakers are constrained by institutions to make only limited changes to existing policies 
hence their cautious approach to their decision -making. Within the context of the findings of 
this study, respondents alluded to how their behaviours aligned with the path dependence 
theory. For instance, in reference to their policy development responsibilities, many 
respondents mentioned that they were guided by the vision of the government. In fact one 
respondent stated that their role was not to “re-invent the wheel”  (R13, Top -level Civil 
Servant), consistent with the theory.    
  
To underscore the importance of ‘previous policies evidence’, an empirical study by 
Onwujekwe et. al (2015, 7) considered it as the third most useful evidence out of 10 forms of 
evidence behind “findings from national surveys” (1st), and “research publications” (2nd) in the 
development of three different health policies. Although the positioning of previous policies as 
per Onwujekwe et. al (2015 ) contradicts the findings of this study, the study, nevertheless, 
highlights the importance of previous policies in policy development in Nigeria consistent with 
the incremental policy theory. 
  
The empirical hierarchy also shows that media evidence was the least useful evidence, 
confirming some arguments in the existing literature. For instance, Kingdon (1995) argues that 
the media hardly influences policy. Further to this, Irwin and Kiereini (2021) conducted an 
empirical study and found limited use of media evidence in policymaking in developing 
countries. Their study asserts that policymakers were skeptical of stories carried by the media 
as they tend to be sensationalistic and inaccurate even though many of the policymakers 
acknowledged that in some instances the media drew their attention to issues they were 
unaware of.  
  
In support of this notion, a high number of the respondents were of the view that the media 
dwell more on what one respondent called ‘juicy negative stories’ at the expense of serving as 
a source of evidence ( R1, NSIP Top Management Executive) . Other res pondents stated that 
they ignored media evidence because the media is often divided along ideological or 
sentimental lines such that a medium sympathetic to a particular policy will locate its reportage 
in a friendly frame whereas a medium that is antagonistic to the policy will do the opposite to 
make a policy change more likely (Crow and Lawlor, 2016).
<<<PAGE=266>>>
252 
 
 
Contrastingly, the findings are against a tranche of the literature that proffers that ‘media 
evidence’ plays a key role in influencing policy (Kiage and  Njogu, 2015; Mwangi, 2018; 
Russell et. al, 2016; Head, 2014). The findings are also inconsistent with the belief of British 
politicians that the media significantly influence legislative debates often leading to policy 
changes (Davis, 2009).  
10.5. INTEGR ATION OF EVIDENCE  
Existing literature espouses that policymaking involves the participation of many players at 
different stages of the policy process (Anderson, 2015; Cairney, 2012; Head, 2008, Head, 2010; 
Howlett et al., 2009; Johns, 2008; Kay 2011; Knill and Tosun, 2012; Lindblom, 1959; 
Maddison 2012; Yadav and Bhaduri 2021). The findings of this study show that the 
development of the policies investigated involved various players within and outside 
government, consistent with the literature. The findings also show that th e integration of the 
different types of evidence are done in three evidence integration sites, namely, committees, 
stakeholders’ meetings/workshops, and legislature as articulated in the cross -case analysis 
chapter.   
 
10.5.1. Advisory Committees  
One of t he fastest -growing instruments of modern policymaking is the use of advisory 
committees (Lavertu and Weimer, 2011). One tranche of the literature classifies hybrid 
committees into full hybrid committees (comprising public sector and private sector players) , 
and quasi-hybrid committees (composed of public sector players from different departments) 
(Krick, 2015).  
  
Across the four policies examined in this study, the presence of either a hybrid or a quasi -
hybrid advisory committee is evident in line with the literature (Krick 2015; Onwujekwe et.al 
2021). In terms of the hybrid advisory committee, this study found tha t in the development of 
the NTP, and the National Migration Policy, which was the precursor on which the NiDCOM 
policy was built, the government established a traditional hybrid advisory committee that 
comprised interested groups: government representatives, experts, and other stakeholders (civil 
society organisations in the case of the NiDCOM policy, and businesses in the case of the NTP)
<<<PAGE=267>>>
253 
 
while for the NWRP, a hybrid committee was established by the government with membership 
drawn from government representatives and experts (Krick 2015; Lavertu and Weimer, 2011).  
  
On the other hand, the quasi -hybrid advisory committee established in relation to the 
development of NSIP was composed of only government employees (Krick, 2015). To clarify, 
an inter -ministerial steering committee was established comprising ministers of health, 
education, finance, budget and planning, labour and employment, and women affairs with a 
responsibility to synthesise and refine the various evidence types into a proposal for the 
consideration of the legislators.  
  
Theory proposes that a committee, whether hybrid or quasi-hybrid, is established to develop a 
policy or contribute to the development of one (Krick, 2015; Winickoff and Brown 2013). 
Evidence indicates that whereas the committ ees established by the government in relation to 
the NTP and the NWRP developed draft policies, those established for the NSIP and NiDCOM 
contributed to policy development consistent with existing literature. 
  
Further, the committees were established by the government to perform a number of important 
functions. One of their most important functions is that they provided the government with a 
pool of expert knowledge in one location and involved the interrogation of different policy 
ideas with a view to selecting appropriate options (Ashford, 1984; Brown 2008). To recall, all 
respondents acknowledged the contribution of technical knowledge and experience by the 
committees which added significant value to the policies. For each policy, several respondents 
mentioned that the policy development committee extensively considered and refined different 
types of evidence as well as stakeholders’ inputs. In addition, the committees provided their 
services to the government at relatively low costs ( Ashford, 1984; Brown 2008). The 
consultants that participated in the development of the N TP, offered their services in “public 
interest” (R 22, Mid-level Civil Servant) and “at no cost” (R 23, Top-level Civil Servant). The 
international development partners that provided fina ncial and technical support for the 
development of the NWRP and the NSIP also did so at no cost. Even the quasi -hybrid 
committee used in the development of the NSIP seemed to have saved the government time 
considering that a longer policy development perio d would have been used if the NSIP was 
allowed to go through the traditional bureaucracy of policymaking (Stevens, 2010).
<<<PAGE=268>>>
254 
 
The hybrid committees performed political or public participation functions which improved 
legitimacy and acceptability (Ashford 1984; Brown 2008; Rowe and Frewer 2000). It is to be 
noted that members of the hybrid committees represented different competing interests and by 
including them in the development of policies, the government democratised the policymaking 
process and promoted the potential for consensus (Ashford 1984; Haas 1992). As reported by 
many respondents, the inclusion of many, a few say all, critical stakeholders in the development 
of the four policies, gave the people a representation and the opportunity to influen ce policies 
that would affect them. The idea was to “get the buy-in and support of all stakeholders” is how 
one respondent put it which conveys the general feeling of the respondents in this study (R14, 
Top-level Civil Servant).  
  
Implicit in the committe es are sub -committees that served as working groups for smaller 
decision-making and to deal with allocated themes (Krick 2015; Onwujekwe et.al 2021). The 
findings are partly consistent with the espoused literature. For the NiDCOM and the NTP, sub-
committees were created along thematic or functional lines to focus on specific issues. For 
example, in the development of NIDCOM, “labour migration” and “diaspora” sub-committees 
were created to develop appropriate contents based on research and the experiences of members 
of the sub-committees (R14, Top-level Civil Servant). For the NTP, the main committee was 
“broken down into sub -committees” with each sub -committee looking at a particular theme 
allocated to it and “agreeing on next steps” . (R 28, Top -level Civil Servant). There was, 
however, no evidence of such an arrangement in the development of NSIP and NiDCOM 
indicating incongruence with the literature. Instead, the main committees were responsible for 
the development of the two policies at the substantive committee levels.   
  
Policy theorists advocate that the decisions of hybrid advisory committees are made by 
consensus (Coleman, 1994; The LSE GV314 Group, 2018). This resonates with the findings 
of this study. Findings show that the decision-making process in the committees was based on 
consensus and decisions were reached only when there was no major objection from any 
member (Coleman 1994; Krick, 2013). On this note, a respondent (R37, Consultant) observed 
that during the development of the NSIP, consensus was the watchword. He felt that the need 
for consensus was so critical that for contentious or complex issues, decisions were reached 
only when committee members were comfortable with an input or proposal. On such occasions, 
he said, “we can’t move pass any issue until we have agreed on it.” Across, the other policies, 
similar sentiments were expressed by many respondents suggesting conformity with the
<<<PAGE=269>>>
255 
 
literature. In all, majority of the respondents recognised that the committees served as tools for 
both the generation and refinement of ideas. It was especially found that committee discussions 
were, in most cases, robust and very engaging.  
  
10.5.2. Stakeholders’ meetings 
The place of stakeholder consultation in the existing policy literature is well -documented. 
There has been a deluge of literature on the issue with many scholars contributing either 
theoretically or empirically (Anderson, 2015; Birkland, 2011; Head 2008; 2010; Howlett et al., 
2009; John 2013; Kay 2011; Knill and Tosun, 2012; Maddison 2012; Thomas 2001; Fraussen 
et al., 2020; Onwujekwe et al., 2021; Sen, 2001). The common thread running through the 
scholars’ theses is that policymaking involves engagements between the government and a host 
of stakeholders in various forms including workshops, conferences, and other kinds of formal 
and informal meetings.  
  
The literature classifies policies along different lines one of which is the functional 
classification. In this regard, policies are broadly divided into technical and general. Technical 
policies, are policies that require specialised knowledge and skills for their development while 
general policies are those policies that are socially and politically contested, prioritising values 
over science (Head, 2014) 
  
It should be noted that the four policies examined in this study are general policies suggesting 
consultation of various stakeholders. This was anticipated and identified. Some aspects of  the 
stakeholder engagements identified in the four policies are both congruent and incongruent 
with the existing literature. 
  
First, and as has been reported repeatedly, the development of the policies involved many state 
and non-state players that contributed to the policy process. Findings show that for each of the 
policies, multiple meetings were held at different times and at different locations during the 
policy development, consistent with the closed consultation approach (Fraussen et al. 2020; 
Mah and Hills, 2014). In the development of the NTP, in addition to the inputs sent in by 
stakeholders, “three stakeholder engagements - two in Abuja and one in Lagos”  were held 
(R21, Top-level Civil Servant). Regarding the NWRP, “workshops were held in many s tates 
of the federation” to obtain the inputs of stakeholders (R39, Mid -level Civil Servant). In the
<<<PAGE=270>>>
256 
 
same vein, various technical and stakeholder meetings were held at the instance of the house 
committee on diaspora (R11, Legislator) and the senate committee on poverty alleviation (R4, 
Legislator) for the development of the NiDCOM and NSIP, respectively.  
  
Second, in line with the espoused literature, the meetings were held to process various evidence 
types and consider different policy options (Onwujekwe et.al 2021; Thomas 2001). As asserted 
by Nabatchi (2012, p.704), the meetings provided platforms to give “voice to multiple 
perspectives and different interests, allowing for more thoughtful decisions…(Beierle and 
Cayford 2002; Sirianni 2009)". Majority of the respondents reported that the meetings involved 
debates and discussion around various policy proposals especially the inputs to be incorporated 
into draft policies, consistent with literature (Sen, 2001). A respondent who participated in the 
developmet of the NTP affirmed: “(in the meetings), we gave all stakeholders the chance to 
express their views and defend them. If a view gets the right support it goes, if not it doesn’t”  
(R 21, Top-level Civil Servant). His colleague that participated in the deve lopment of NWRP 
concurred. “The meetings were robust…sometimes it got heated when people hold on tight to 
their positions and other people are criticising them (the positions)…sometime we refine the 
positions and there is peace. Other times, we vote and so metimes the chairman takes a 
position” (R 31, Management Consultant). Thus, the meetings served as venues where different 
kinds of evidence were considered for incorporation into policy drafts. 
  
Third, findings revealed the government made deliberate and conscious efforts to include as 
many stakeholders as possible in the development of the four policies of this study to enrich 
the policy options. For the NSIP, the views of poor and vulnerable Nigerians who were the 
major target of the Conditional Cash Transfer component of the NSIP were not only considered 
but indeed the policymakers (including government officials and some private sector persons) 
went to meet them in their places of abode, including villages that were difficult to access. This 
finding is also in line with the closed consultation approach (Fraussen et al. 2020; Mah and 
Hills, 2014). As a respondent put it, governments effort is an attempt to get the views of the 
targeted group to “understand what poverty means” to them with a view to identi fying those 
who were genuinely in need of the government’s support, (R3, Top-level Civil Servant). In the 
case of NIDCOM, “all critical stakeholders contributed”  to the policy (R16, Civil Society) 
including Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation, (NIDO), migra tion-related civil society 
organisations and academics. Most of the NiDCOM respondents agreed that a wide range of 
stakeholders participated and contributed to the policy development.
<<<PAGE=271>>>
257 
 
 
As per the NTP, the government “wanted diverse inputs” and invited the public to participate 
through the “publications in 3 national dailies with widespread readership” (R21, Top -level 
Civil Servant). This finding corresponds with the open consultation approach since every 
person that wished to participate in the consultati on process was given the opportunity to do 
so. On the NWRP, the policy process revolved around the need to adopt a participatory 
approach instead of the top -down approach that has failed (Federal Ministry of Water 
Resources, 2016, 1). A consultant offered that the emergence of new players in the water 
resources ecosystem provided additional motivation for the “robust stakeholder consultation” 
the government superintended and “all those who should be invited were invited”  (R31, 
Consultant). This finding is c ongruous with the closed consultation approach since only 
selected people were invited to participate in the process (Fraussen et al., 2020).  
  
The practice of deliberate and elaborate stakeholder consultation is steep in conflicting 
narratives as far as existing literature is concerned. There is a tranche of literature that theorises 
that governments are normally not favourably disposed to sufficient stakeholder consultation 
(Rhodes, 2011, Cairney, 2012). The findings of this study, therefore, contradict the assertions 
of Rhodes (2011) and Cairney (2012). The findings also contradict the empirical finding of 
Yadav and Bhaduri (2021) that found that the government of India refused to undertake any 
consultation with stakeholders when it was in the process to develop a new rare disease policy. 
In summary, the findings of this study under this variable, are incongruent with the “muscular” 
policy style that fails to recognise non-state actors in policymaking (Cairney, 2012, p.231). 
  
In contrast, the findings af firm the centrality of stakeholder consultation in policymaking 
consistent with the empirical findings of Marais et al., who found that the South African Mental 
Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan benefited from a wide consultation with 
stakeholders. The findings also support the claim of Solorio et al., (2022) that extensive 
consultation took place in the development of two clean energy policies in Mexico. They are 
also congruent with the findings of Mah and Hills (2014) that robust consultation was  
undertaken during the 2007 nuclear consultation exercise in the UK. In sum, all the three 
empirical studies found evidence of extensive stakeholder engagement in policy development. 
The findings support the assertions of Cairney (2012) and Sheer and Hoppn er (2010) that the 
UK has a long history of stakeholder engagements between the state and non -state policy 
players, further indicating an area of congruence.
<<<PAGE=272>>>
258 
 
  
Worthy of mentioning is that Mah and Hills (2014) found that the stakeholder engagement used 
for the 2007 nuclear consultation exercise in the UK comprised both written inputs and 
meetings. The findings of this study show that the consultation for the four policies of this 
research involved the two main consultation components reported by Mah and Hills (2014).  
  
An analysis of the findings of this study has shown that the development of the four policies 
involved the consultation of a broad array of stakeholders representing different interests. 
Findings indicate that all the respondents were aware of this fact, and discussions with them 
revealed that they considered stakeholder consultation as an integral part of the normal policy 
process. Important to note is that the stakeholder meetings represented platforms for 
constructive dialogue and evaluati on of the different kinds of evidence provided by the 
stakeholders. As we have seen, the dialogue resulted in the acceptance, rejection, or amendment 
of the evidence types on offer.   
 
10.5.3. Legislative Committees 
The iron triangle theory espouses that the legislators, alongside bureaucrats and interest groups, 
are the three key players in the policy process (Gais et al., 1984; Jordan, 1981). An alternative 
explanation of the policy process, however, stresses that policies are made by the bureaucracy 
and involve numerous clusters of interconnected actors without the input of the legislature 
(Jordan, 1981; Stevens, 2010; Rose 1980). For this study, I call policies developed under the 
first arrangement legislative policies, while those that fall in the second arrangement, I refer to 
as administrative policies.  
  
This study has identified two types of policies - legislative, and administrative, corroborating 
the espoused literature on the issue. Federal legislators, bur eaucrats, and interest groups, 
participated in the development of NSIP and NIDCOM, consistent with the iron triangle 
literature. The participation of the legislators is also consistent with a central notion in 
legislative literature which reiterates that t he legislators are the most crucial players in the 
development of legislative policies (Geys, 2013; Phadnis 2021; Wonka, 2017). By the same 
token, the legislators did not participate in the development of the NTP and the NWRP since 
they are administrative policies.
<<<PAGE=273>>>
259 
 
In respect of legislative policies, policy theorists maintain that legislators require and utilise 
varying degrees of evidence in their policymaking duties (Krehbiel, 1992; Varone et al., 2020). 
The legislature, therefore, provides a location for the consi deration of different types of 
evidence leading to development of policies. A number of empirical studies found that 
legislators utilise a deluge of evidence for their policymaking duties. For example, Sanni et 
al.’s (2016) research shows that both federal  and state lawmakers harmonise numerous types 
of evidence in the production of their desired policies. Sanni et al.’s (2016) finding, therefore, 
agrees with the findings of this study which shows that, in total, the legislators use nine types 
of evidence w hich they used in the development of the NiDCOM and the NSIP policies. 
Likewise, an empirical study by Mosley and Gibson (2017) found that legislators used an array 
of scientific and non -scientific evidence in the development of foster care laws policies i n 
California in 2010. The findings of this study are, therefore, congruent with those of Sanni et. 
al’s (2016) and Mosley and Gibson (2017).  
  
The findings are also consistent with a large body of legislative literature that emphasises the 
critical role l egislative committees play in legislative policymaking (Bevan et al., 2019; 
Halligan 2008; Hendriks and Kay 2019, 28). As has been established, the bulk of the 
policymaking was done in the committees, both in the Senate and the HoR. Consistent with the 
literature, a number of the kinds of evidence in the committees’ possession contradict one 
another (Hendriks and Kay, 2019), and it was in the committees that most of the contradictory 
kinds of evidence were evaluated and considered for acceptance, amendment or rejection. This 
suggests that the committees are the main venue for interactive dialogue, hence where “where 
the action is” (Cairney and Oliver, 2017, p.5). To exemplify, in the development of the 
NiDCOM policy, the legislators considered all the “infor mation and pieces of evidence” in 
their possession (R18, Representative, Diaspora Community). This is evidenced by the fact 
that while a section of the diaspora community advocated the creation of a ministry dedicated 
to issues of diaspora, another section  preferred the establishment of a commission. The two 
sections provided evidence in support of their preference. For the NSIP, the legislature 
examined many “conflicting interests and perspectives” to reach a compromise in terms of the 
distribution of the NSIP fund (R5, Legislator).  
  
A further congruity with the literature is found in the committees’ consideration of the voices 
of stakeholders that are neither elites nor experts (Halligan 2008; Hendriks and Kay 2019). In 
the development of the NiDCOM policy, it was found that the different factions of the diaspora
<<<PAGE=274>>>
260 
 
community were consulted by the legislative committees. On a few occasions, they were 
invited to the parliament to ventilate their views. It was also found that direct beneficiaries of 
the NSIP w ere consulted by policymakers (including government officials and some private 
sector persons) to get their inputs. Indeed, part of the data collection process involved 
policymakers visiting targeted beneficiaries in their houses, majority of which were in  remote 
areas.  NiDCOM policy 
  
A large body of literature holds the view that political parties are the most important 
mechanisms in shaping legislative outcomes in line with partisan theories (Patterson 1963; 
Peabody, 1967). As a consequence, legislators  are considered purposive - which means they 
sacrifice their individual preferences and uphold the preferences of their party (Crowe,1986, 
165). In furtherance of their purposiveness, legislators vote along party lines regardless of the 
evidence at their disposal. This affects the legislators’ behaviours in not only the integration of 
evidence but in the way they approach policymaking generally.    
  
The literature documents several empirical studies that support the purposive thesis. Opello’s 
(1986) study of the Portuguese national legislature and Crowe’s (1986) examination of the 
British House of Commons are examples. The studies found that political parties have the 
biggest influence on legislative policy outcomes. In the same vein, Cox and McCubbins (2005) 
stressed that parties are tools for re -election and have the power to persuade or compel 
legislators to behave in a particular way.   
  
Findings regarding the actions of many legislators are, however, at variance with the literature 
on purposiveness and instead partially supports the pivotal politics theory (PPT) which presents 
the parties as weak (Cox and McCubbins, 2005). For instance, one of the legislators of the 
ruling party said he did not “support” the NSIP because the executive  “did something else” 
after refusing to accept their proposal that the monies for the NSIP should be distributed 
through them (R4, Legislator). The legislator revealed that the action of the executives might 
have impacted his contributions, and those of a few of his colleagu es, to the policy. This 
suggests that the legislators’ apathy weakened the effectiveness of the evidence integration 
process.  
  
It will be recalled that N500 billion was earmarked by the government for the implementation 
of the NSIP. Findings reveal that a number of the legislators wanted to personally control the
<<<PAGE=275>>>
261 
 
distribution of the funds meant for their constituencies. The literature suggests that the quest to 
enhance their re-election influenced their behaviours. In validation of this notion, one of the  
legislators that participated in the development of the NSIP rhetorically asked some of the 
public servants responsible for the implementation of the NSIP: “you did not come through us 
how can we be elected next time?” (R1, NSIP Top Management Executive). As far as the NSIP 
is concerned, the need for re -election appears to be at the root of the behaviours of many 
legislators and goes to illuminate “why pork -barrel politics dominated the attention of (the) 
legislators” (Buchannan 2003, p.18).  
  
In contrast , NiDCOM policy is a constituent policy that did not require the investment of 
financial resources in the legislators’ constituencies making the policy less attractive to them 
financially. In consequence, majority of the legislators in the diaspora committee of the House 
of Representatives consistently refused to participate in the committee work because the 
committee, in the words of one of them, was “barren” and not “juicy” (R11, Legislator). Also, 
the focus of the NiDCOM policy is the diaspora community who are not constitutionally able 
to vote, rendering them not useful to the legislators. These two reasons account for the 
legislators’ participation apathy as seen in the low attendance to committee meetings which a 
legislator put at only six or seven at a time as against the 36 members in the committee.    
  
Thus, the behaviours of the two sets of legislators mean that the legislators failed to uphold the 
preferences of their party contrary to the argument in the purposive literature, (Owens, 2003). 
The incongruity of some legislators’ behaviour with the literature on purposiveness is even 
more striking considering that they belonged to the ruling party which strongly supported the 
NSIP and NiDCOM in fulfilment of its promises. Within the context of the po licy integration 
process, it is clear that the discussions and debates that accompanied the NSIP and NiDCOM 
could have been more robust, which might have impacted the policy outputs and outcomes 
regarding the two policies. 
  
Their behaviours are, however, congruent with the public choice theory. Indeed, public choice 
theory offers a solid theoretical explanation for the legislators’ behaviours (Mayhew, 2004; 
Karadimas, 2022). Theoretically, legislators represent the dual interests of their constituencies 
and their political parties yet, empirical findings indicate that the likelihood of pecuniary and 
electoral benefits trumped their avowed desire to promote the dual interests (Phadnis 2021). 
Thus, far from being public servants concerned about the common goo d, the legislators were
<<<PAGE=276>>>
262 
 
primarily concerned with how to maximize their personal interests (Buchanan, 2003; 
Immergut, 2008; Leeson and Thompson 2021; Karadimas, 2022; Phadnis 2021). On the whole, 
the legislators’ behaviours confirm Eskridge’s (1988, p.285) argument that the recourse to their 
self-interest leads to the production of few laws in pursuance of “public goods” and many laws 
to advance their "rent-seeking" interests. 
10.6. GOVERNI NG THE POLICY PROCESS  
Extant literature presents three broad accounts of approaches to governance in the pursuit of 
common goals: society-centred, state-centric, and state-centric relational. The society-centred 
approach, which is the dominant one, holds that in the last few decades, non-state actors have 
substantially been “hollowed out” - marginalised in policymaking and implementation (Bevir 
and Rhodes, 2003; Rhodes, 2017; Ryser et al., 2021).  The state -centric on the other hand, 
argues that governments govern in a hierarchical manner and impose their policy preferences 
on society ( Hysing, 2009; Bell and Hindmoor, 2009 ). The last approach, the state -centric 
relational, asserts that although  governments still undertake policy development and 
implementation through hierarchical control, they have developed strategic partnerships with 
non-state actors to enhance their capacity and achieve their goals (Hysing 2009; Pierre and 
Peters 2000). 
 
Generally, there  are two dimensions to the three policymaking account s: the level of 
stakeholders’ participation in policymaking (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009 ) and the degree of 
government’s capacity to steer (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Hysing 2009; Ryser et al., 2021).  
 
In terms of participation, the findings indicate that multi ple stakeholders participated in the 
development of the policies in this study. They also indicate that several platforms were created 
to engage the stakeholders. The findings, therefore, do not fit with the state-centric account of 
policymaking because the government did not “operate in splendid isolation from the society 
they govern” (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009, xiii) or in a traditional command and control manner 
(Pierre and Peters, 2000). In contrast, the findings align with the state-centric-relational account 
which accepts the participation of government and society in policymaking.  
 
As findings indicate, the development of the policies involved mutual exchanges and co -
operation between state and non-state actors with the latter group contributing more capabilities
<<<PAGE=277>>>
263 
 
to the policy process than the state could operating unilaterally (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; 
Keating 2004 Pierre and Peters, 2000). The central idea of incorporating private sector actors 
in the development of the four policies was to improve access to relevant knowledge, enhance 
legitimacy and promote political credibility (Ashford 1984; Brown 2008; Rowe and Frewer 
2000). In accordance with the state -centric-relational tradition, the government specifically 
adopted workshops and other formal con sultation techniques in obtaining the input of 
stakeholders in the spirit of partnership and mutuality (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009).  
 
The findings also align with the relational aspects of the society -centred account in that b oth 
state and non-state actors participated in the development of the four policies examined ( Bell 
and Hindmoor, 2009; Kjaer 2011; Rhodes 1994; Stoker, 1998). Consequently, while the 
participation coheres with a mild version of the literature on the society-centred account since 
government actively participated in the policy process, it is inconsistent with the radical version 
which prescribes the absence of government in the process, a scenario generally described as 
“governance without government” ( Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Schout and Jordan 2005; 
Sorensen and Torfing 2009).  
 
Findings for the most part, are contrary to the claims of the society -centred and state-centric 
accounts but instead corroborate the state -centric relational account. In the first place, the 
development of the policies examined was not done in an excessively hierarchical way in the 
manner suggested in the state-centric account (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009). They were also not 
products of autonomous, self -organizing networks (Rhodes, 2017). Instead, they were 
developed by a policy community comprising key stakeholders, including the government, and 
the private sector (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Pierre and Peters, 2000 ). Yet, the government 
was able to steer and guide the process because the exchange relationship betw een the 
government and private policy actors was unequal and predominantly in favour of the 
government in line with the state-centric relational account (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Pierre 
and Peters, 2000). The asymmetries of influence and power  privileged the government and 
manifested through three meta -governance elements: steering, resourcing, and accountability 
(Bell and Hindmoor, 2009).  
 
In terms of steering, it was the government that decided the mechanisms to employ to address 
the policy problems, the key persons or institutions that were invited to participate in the policy 
process, and the ground rules (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Kjaer 2011). To illustrate, while the
<<<PAGE=278>>>
264 
 
government chose to contract out the development of the NWRP to local consultants, supported 
by a few senior staff the Ministry of Water Resources for guidance, it established an inter -
ministerial steering committee, chaired by the Vice President of Nigeria, to develop the NSIP 
policy proposals for the consideration of the legislature. In the case of NWRP, the government 
decided to use a hybrid committee, led by local consultants for policy development. In all these, 
the government provided ‘terms of reference’ to guide deliberations.  Also, the legislature 
superintended the development of NiDCOM policy and ensured that the policy was consistent 
with the government’s strategic objectives. It is worth mentioning that when the government 
encountered challenges during the implementation of the NSIP, the government changed the 
subsisting mechanism and engaged a local consulting firm to address the issue which indicates 
the steering power of the government (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009).  
 
Further, contrary to the claim of the proponents of the society -centred account, the leadership 
of the  committees that developed the policies examined did not emerge from members’ 
negotiation but were chosen by the government which also decided the terms of reference of 
the committees ( Bell and Hindmoor, 2009). Crucially, even though all the policies had 
significant inputs from the private sector actors, who in some cases headed the policy 
development committees, the policies were ultimately approved by the government. This 
means the involvement of many non-state actors did not result in them taking “over the business 
of government” (Stoker, 1998, 23) as the society -centred account claims. Findings, therefore, 
build on the conclusion of many scholars, including Marinetto (2003), Pierre and Peters (2000), 
Bell and Hindmoor (2009), and Davies (2011) who all ar gue that the steering capacity of the 
government is alive and well. As famously put by Osborne and Gaebler (1992), in the 
development of the four policies in this study, the government has demonstrated a clear 
capacity to steer and row. 
 
As per resourcing, the government used its vast resources to meta-govern its relationship with 
the private sector actors. The entire consultation and stakeholder meetings that took place 
during the development of the policies were funded by the government ( Bell and Hindmoor, 
2009). It is reasonable to say, therefore, a failure of the government to adequately fund the 
consultation process and meta-govern well could have frustrated the process (Doberstein 2013; 
Rysera et al., 2021). Also, as the findings show, the government u sed a reasonable number of 
its civil and public servants to add value as well as protect its interest in the policymaking 
process (Milward and Provan, 2000). Indeed, the government’s bureaucracy brought policy
<<<PAGE=279>>>
265 
 
expertise, and institutional memory to the tab le ( Bell and Hindmoor, 2009; Rysera, et al., 
2021). A private sector actor who was widely considered one of the most influential in the 
development of the NTP reported that the government representatives on the policy 
development committee were “very knowl edgeable” and “technically sound”  (R26, 
Professional Accountant). Also, in the development of the NWRP, a team of consultants was 
contracted to guide the process, but they received most of the “materials” and “information” 
they needed from the representati ves of government on the policy development committee 
(R38, Top-level Civil Servant). Clearly, by bringing to bear the needed financial resources and 
professional bureaucracy, the government was able to significantly control the policymaking 
process. 
 
As regards the third metagovernance element, the government guaranteed accountability in two 
main ways. Firstly, it made its representatives members of the policy development committees 
and maintained a reasonable degree of oversight on the committee’s activit ies (Doberstein, 
2013; Gertler and Wolfe 2004). Considering that the representatives were knowledgeable and 
technically sound with robust institutional memory,  it is reasonable to assume that they were 
able to make strong arguments and skilfully sold the g overnment’s vision to the committee 
(Bell and Hindmoor, 2009).  
 
The draft policies for NTP and NWRP were submitted to the ministers of finance and water 
resources respectively before the policies were presented to the National Executive Council for 
approval. In the case of the NSIP, once the legislature has approved the programme’s budget, 
the implementation plans are decided by the inter-ministerial steering committee headed by the 
Vice President of Nigeria. In a similar vein, the NiDCOM policy revised by  a technical 
committee was submitted to the House Committee on Diaspora. This means the ministers of 
finance and water resources and the house committee have the power to alter or refine 
provisions of the policies before their presentation to National Executive Council for approval. 
Also, the inter-ministerial steering committee has the privilege to make implementation plans 
and to interpret the NSIP policy. Ultimately, these organs serve as the final gatekeepers for the 
policies. Indeed, they were the ones “controlling the gates and making the decisions” (Steele, 
2018, p.234) and indicated where the “buck stops” (Bell and Hindmoor, 2009, p.51).   
 
As has been stated all through this thesis, a broad range of players participated in the 
development of the four policies. The respondents were unanimous that although all the players
<<<PAGE=280>>>
266 
 
exerted some degree of influence in the policy process, the government was by far the most 
influential player in the process. A few of them mentioned that the process would not have 
been successful if the government had not guided it and provided all the needed resources. So, 
these findings demonstrate a correlation with the state-centric relational account of governance 
but contradict the society-centred and state-centric accounts. 
10.7. CHAPTER SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This study examined policymakers’ perspectives on the nature and hierarchy of evidence used 
in the development of public policies in Nigeria. It also examined the role of three major players 
in the policy process and how their roles impact policy dynamics. This study's literature review 
and empirical findings have clearly shown that the policymaking environment is fluid and 
chaotic, suggesting that a cocktail of factors determines the policymakers’ perspectives, the 
policy style, and the final policy. As anticipated, the empirical findings have shown a number 
of congruities and incongruities with the existing literature. The summary of this chapter will 
be presented based on the congruities and incongruities found in the  four key variables that 
emerged from the study. 
 
As regards the nature of evidence used in the development of public policies in Nigeria, this 
study identified nine kinds of evidence: ‘research  evidence’, ‘previous policies evidence’, 
‘media evidence’, ‘i deology evidence’, ‘internet evidence’, ‘residual knowledge of 
policymakers’ evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’, ‘local consultants’ evidence’, and ‘external 
stakeholders’ evidence’. Thus, this study questions the dominant view in the literature that 
policymaking i n Nigeria is largely devoid of the use of evidence. In corollary, it has 
conclusively shown that, indeed, policymakers use a wide range of evidence in the 
development of public policies. This finding is particularly important because it strengthens 
the burgeoning minority view that offers a more empirically compelling explanation on the use 
of evidence in policymaking in Nigeria. Considering that there have been very limited 
empirical studies on the use of evidence in the Nigerian policymaking environment, the novel 
findings justified the need for this study.   
 
More significantly, the study identified three types of evidence that previous studies have not 
identified as substantive types of evidence: ‘local consultants evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’ and 
‘external stakeholders evidence’. These three types of evidence highlight the peculiarity of the
<<<PAGE=281>>>
267 
 
Nigerian policy environment. Also, the study identified ‘ideology evidence’ for the first time 
as a type of evidence used in policymaking in Nigeria even though Western literature has long 
recognised it as such. Clearly, the discovery of the four kinds of evidence invites us to pay 
attention to them when we analyse policymaking in Nigeria. 
  
Policymakers’ striking differences in their perception of the hierarchy of evide nce are 
consistent with the literature which affirms that the differences are ‘normal’. Theorists and 
practitioners have consistently presented different, often significantly different, views about 
the usefulness of various types of evidence. This notion is clearly demonstrated by the apparent 
lack of agreement in the three ‘models’ of hierarchy used for comparison.   
 
The empirical hierarchy developed based on the ranking of the different types of evidence by 
the respondents shows that on aggregate, ‘previous policies evidence’ is the most useful 
evidence in the development of the four policies examined in this study. This finding is 
complimentary with the incremental policy theory that prioritises the use of previous policies 
in the development of new ones. Contrariwise, the least useful evidence is “media evidence.” 
This finding has a contradictory relationship with existing literature. While it coheres with 
some tranche of the literature that asserts that the media has, at best limited im pact on policy, 
and at worst does not influence policy at all, it goes against the notion that the ‘media evidence’ 
significantly influences policy. 
 
With reference to the integration of evidence, three evidence integration sites were identified 
in this st udy – advisory committees, stakeholder meetings, and the legislative committees – 
with each site providing some congruities and incongruities with existing literature. 
Committees are fast becoming modern policymaking tools as advocated by theorists. Within  
the context of the integration of evidence, an important function of the committees is to 
aggregate various pieces of evidence and make a judgement as to their suitability for the policy 
being developed.  In terms of congruities, all four policies assesse d in this study were either 
developed by a committee or a committee provided significant input in the policy development 
process. The use of such committees is not a recent phenomenon in the Nigerian public service 
as a number of legacy policies that served as precursors to the policies examined in this study 
were developed by committees. Another congruity is in decision making which was based on 
consensus among the committee members. A further congruity is in the establishment of sub -
<<<PAGE=282>>>
268 
 
committees for the NiD COM and the NTP. The absence of such committees for NSIP and 
NWRP, therefore, represents an incongruity with existing literature.   
 
Regarding stakeholder meetings, the major congruent feature is that the development of all four 
policies in this study invo lved continuous and robust engagements between the government 
and a number of private sector players. The meetings provided policymakers an avenue to 
process various evidence types and consider different policy options. Flowing from this is the 
government’s efforts to include as many stakeholders as possible in the development of the 
four policies of this study. This practice is incongruent with a tranche of existing literature that 
argues that governments are not favourably disposed to sufficient stakehold er consultations. 
However, the practice corroborates the argument of the other tranche of existing literature that 
affirms that governments encourage and support stakeholder consultation in policymaking. 
 
Consistent with the literature, this study found th at legislators, particularly legislative 
committees participated in the development of legislative policies but not administrative 
policies. Policy theorists espouse that legislators utilise and evaluate a substantial amount of 
evidence in their policymaki ng duties. The findings of this study are congruent with the 
literature in this regard.  
 
Beyond their ‘integration’ functions, however, the literature stresses that one of the most 
important functions of legislators is to translate their party’s manifesto  into policies. Related 
literature affirms that legislators’ political parties are the most influential players in shaping 
policies owing to their power to reward and punish their legislative members . In this regard, 
legislators are considered purposive, m eaning they sacrifice their individual preferences to 
uphold the preferences of their party. The behaviours of many legislators are, however, 
incongruent with the literature in this regard. They were largely not purposive and subordinated 
their party’s preferences to their selfish ones. Interestingly, their behaviours confirm the thesis 
of the public choice theory, which views them as inherently selfish and desirous of only 
promoting their personal interests particularly the desire to be re-elected. To reiterate, this study 
characterises the three integration sites as venues where policies are made and are, therefore, 
of great value to stakeholders desirous of influencing policies. 
  
Regarding the state’s steering capacity in governing the policy process, there is congruency in 
how the government is responsible for deciding the tool to address the identified policy
<<<PAGE=283>>>
269 
 
problem, the players to involve, and the rules to guide the policy process. These meta -
governance practices are present in the way the governm ent handled the policy processes that 
produced all four policies of this study. Further, the government’s deployment of its relatively 
vast resources – financial, technical, and personnel - to ensure the successful development of 
the policies serves as ano ther congruency. A final congruency is found in the fact that the 
government played the role of the final gatekeeper for all draft policies before they were 
approved. According to the state-centric relational theory, which best fits the state’s behaviour, 
these practices strengthen the state’s steering capacity and demonstrate that the state 
significantly influenced the policy process to suit its vision.   
This study has identified various kinds of evidence generally used in the development of public 
policies in Nigeria , contrary to the widely held view that policymaking in Nigeria is largely 
based on the whims of policymakers. Within the context of Nigeria, four of the evidence types 
are novel since previous studies failed to identify them as substantive ki nds of evidence. 
Findings showed that ‘previous policies evidence’ is the most useful evidence largely on account 
of its being the first and often the most convenient evidence policymakers obtain. On the other hand, 
media evidence is considered as the least useful evidence because of its inability to provide valuable 
recommendations to policymakers. The study explored three sites where the different kinds of 
evidence are integrated into the policy process and emphasised that in all the sites, the government  
wielded significant influence either directly or indirectly leading to the development of only policies 
that the government favoured.  
This study has , thus,  provided significant insights into key themes in the Nigerian policymaking 
environment and recommends that stakeholders should take advantage of the findings on the relative 
priority policymakers attach to the different kinds of evidence and the policy venues to impact policies. 
Equally important is the fact that the study has enriched our understandin g of the progress Nigeria 
has achieved in evidence -based policymaking and provided broader insights into the sophisticated 
way policies are made in the country.

CHAPTER 11 
CONCLUSION  
11.0. INTRODUCTION  
The previous chapter presented a discussion of the key findings of this study, identified 
congruities and incongruities between the findings and existing literature, and developed an 
empirical hierarchy of evidence based on respondents’ ranking of the nine  evidence types 
adopted for this study. This final chapter will conclude this study and is structured into five 
sections. The chapter starts by recalling the objectives of this study. Secondly, it evaluates how 
the objectives of the study have been achieve d using key findings. Thirdly, it outlines the 
contribution to knowledge, including the implication to policymakers. Next, it highlights the 
limitations of the study. Finally, it proposes opportunities for further research.  
11.1. RECALLING MY RESEARCH AIM AND OBJECTIVES  
This exploratory study aimed to critically interrogate the nature and hierarchy of evidence used 
in the development of public policies in Nigeria. To achieve the aim of the study and answer 
the research questions, four objectives were formulated. 
Research Objectives 
1. To identify and evaluate the types of evidence policymakers use in the development of 
public policies.  
2. To explore policymakers’ perceptions of the relative usefulness of the types of evidence 
they use in policy devel opment and develop an empirical hierarchy of evidence based on 
the fieldwork data to serve as a contribution to existing knowledge in the area. 
3. To ascertain how different kinds of evidence are integrated into the policy process. 
4. To assess the meta-governance practices used to govern the policy process.  
Using a multiple case study approach, these objectives were achieved using the empirical 
findings from the fieldwork data. In the following paragraphs, I highlight how these objectives 
were achieved.
<<<PAGE=285>>>
271 
 
11.2. ACHIEVING THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES USING KEY FINDINGS  
1. To identify and evaluate the types of evidence policymakers employ in the 
development of policies. 
To achieve this objective, I undertook a critical review of the literature to understand the types 
of evidence identified by previous studies such as Akinbinu, and Tiamiyu (2016), Nutley, et 
al., (2002), Onwujekwe et al., (2015), Sanni et al., (2016), Stevens (2011), and Taylor (2012).  
Consequently, I came up with six types of evidence that stood out in te rms: of 1) their 
recurrence in the literature, and 2). My belief that they were used in policymaking in Nigeria. 
The six types of evidence are:  
a). Research evidence 
b). Previous policies evidence 
c). Media evidence 
d). Ideology evidence 
e). Internet evidence 
f). Residual knowledge of policymakers’ evidence  
Subsequently, I conducted interviews with the respondents and provided them with the working 
definition of evidence and the six types of evidence mentioned above as examples. This was to 
illuminate their understanding of the focus of my study and to provid e them with baseline 
information. I then asked them to confirm whether, in the development of the policy they 
participated in, they used any of the six types of evidence and to mention any additional 
evidence they used. For each of the four policies examin ed in this study, majority of 
respondents stated that the six types of evidence were used. In all, the 36 respondents identified 
three more types of evidence:  
a). MDA evidence 
b). Local consultants’ evidence
<<<PAGE=286>>>
272 
 
c). External stakeholders’ evidence.  
By recognising the three types of evidence provided by respondents, in addition to the six I 
extracted from the literature, this study has identified nine types of evidence used in the 
development of public policies in Nigeria. Following this, I argue that the thr ee types of 
evidence provided by the respondents have not been identified by previous studies as distinct 
types of evidence used in the development of public policies in Nigeria. I also argue that 
‘ideology evidence’, though long recognised in the literature as a type of evidence, has not been 
so recognised by previous studies that focussed on public policymaking in Nigeria.    
2. To explore policymakers’ perceptions of the relative usefulness of the types of 
evidence they use in policy development and develop an empirical hierarchy of 
evidence based on the fieldwork data to serve as a contribution to existing 
knowledge in the area. 
This objective was achieved by the administration of an on -line questionnaire where 
respondents were requested to rank the nine types of evidence in terms of their relative 
usefulness in the development of the policy in which they participated. Each ranking was 
scored and consequently, the total score for each type of evidence was computed. Thereafter, 
an empirical hierarchy o f evidence was developed for each policy showing the relative 
importance of the different types of evidence. To determine the relative usefulness of each of 
the nine types of evidence across the four policies, I aggregated the total score for each evidence 
(based on respondents’ ranking) and developed a global empirical hierarchy of evidence which 
was one of the major deliverables of this study.  
The hierarchy shows that ‘previous policies evidence’ is the most useful kind of evidence in 
the development of the four policies examined in this study. This is followed by ‘MDA 
evidence’, ‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’, ‘local consultants evidence’, 
‘ideology evidence’, and ‘research evidence’. Others, in terms of usefulness, are ‘internet 
evidence’, ‘external stakeholders evidence’ and lastly, ‘media evidence’ which is considered 
the least useful evidence.  
It is worth stating that the finding that ‘previous policies evidence’ was the most useful kind of 
evidence did not come to me as a surprise. As  a senior public servant in the Central Bank of 
Nigeria (CBN), I have participated in the development of a number of policies, and ‘previous
<<<PAGE=287>>>
273 
 
policies evidence’ has always been the first and often the most useful evidence during policy 
development, except w here a policy is a completely novel one, which is a rarity. And even 
where that is the case, related or complementary policies are used to generate baseline 
information. The finding on ‘media evidence’ as the least useful was, however, surprising. 
Policymaking departments in many MDAs in the Nigerian Public Service keep track of media 
reportage, particularly the print media, that affect their mandate and operations with a view to 
developing or reviewing policies where necessary. In fact, monitoring newspape r reportage 
was one of the first tasks I undertook when I joined the services of the CBN, and I am aware 
that several policies were developed or reviewed on the strength of such monitoring.  
Equally surprising is the relatively poor showing of ‘internet ev idence’ which has gradually 
become a major source of policy information for public servants, especially in the areas of 
novel policies or where there is the need to assess jurisdictional experiences or good practices. 
Personally, I have benefited from the internet on many occasions while participating in the 
development of sundry policies. Also, a number of the respondents emphasised that they found 
internet very crucial in the policy development. 
I did not have strong expectations regarding the relative us efulness of other types of evidence 
at the beginning of this study. My attitude to them was more of a “let’s wait and see” and as 
such their positions are neither confirmatory nor surprising.   
3. To ascertain how the different kinds of evidence are integrate d into the policy 
process. 
This objective was achieved by synthesising the responses of respondents to questions relating 
to the integration of the different types of evidence. Findings show that each of the policies 
was developed by a group of policymakers that collaborated continuously. Findings also show 
that the integration of the different kinds of evidence involved the policymakers considering 
each piece of evidence on its merit and making a judgment as to whether the evidence should 
be accepted, refined, or rejected.  
The findings further indicate that the consideration of the different types of evidence was done 
at different sites depending on the type of policy in question. For the administrative policies 
(NTP and NWRP), integration took place in tw o uniform sites: technical committees and 
stakeholder meetings. In terms of the legislative policies (NSIP and NiDCOM), integration
<<<PAGE=288>>>
274 
 
took place in three largely uniform sites. For the NSIP, the sites were: an inter -ministerial 
steering committee, stakeholde r meetings, and the legislature. For the NiDCOM, integration 
took place in an inter-ministerial committee (which developed the National Migration Policy, 
the precursor of the NiDCOM), the technical committees, and the legislature. 
Drawing from the foregoing, I argue that the integration of the different kinds of evidence used 
for the development of these policies entailed the determination by policymakers of what 
information or data should be incorporated into policy proposals and what should be rejected. 
I also argue that, in all, four sites, namely, inter-ministerial committees, stakeholder meetings, 
technical committees, and the legislature served as evidence integration sites for the four 
policies examined.  
4. To assess the meta-governance practices used to govern the policy process. 
This objective was achieved by synthesising the different responses of the respondents on the 
meta-governance practices that governed the policy process. Findings conclusively indicate 
that the government was responsible for th e meta-governance of the policy process, which it 
carried out using three practices: steering, resourcing, and accountability.   
Regarding steering, findings show that for all the policies, the government determined the 
mechanisms, rules, and key personnel to address the policy problems. To draw home this point, 
findings show an instance where the government changed an existing policy development 
mechanism which demonstrated its authority to meta-govern.      
In terms of resourcing, findings indicate that t he government deployed its huge human and 
financial resources to control the policy process. Further, findings indicate that the 
government’s decision to utilise highly intelligent and technically sound public servants did 
not only add significant value to the process but also protected its interest.   
The key finding in respect of accountability is that regardless of the policy mechanism used, 
all the draft policies were presented to the government for approval. Specifically, the draft of 
the NTP and NWRP,  which are the administrative policies were presented to the relevant 
ministers for approval before they were taken to the National Executive Council for final 
approval. In the case of the legislative policies (the NSIP and the NIDCOM), findings show 
that they were largely controlled by the legislature.
<<<PAGE=289>>>
275 
 
Consequent to the foregoing findings, I argue that the government was exclusively responsible 
for the meta -governance of the policy process which it undertook through three interrelated 
elements, namely stee ring, resourcing, and accountability. In addition, I further argue that 
contrary to the claims of the proponents of the “hollowing out” thesis, the steering capacity of 
the state, as extensively demonstrated by the findings, is not diminished. The government still 
controls the policy process from the shadows even where it allows non -state actors to ‘lead’ 
the policy process. 
11.3. CONTRIBUTIONS TO ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE  
The aim of this study was to critically interrogate the nature and hierarchy of evidence used in 
the development of public policies in Nigeria. The achievement of this aim necessitated the 
formulation of four objectives which were represented at the beginning of this chapter. As the 
previous section has shown, the objectives have been achieved. This section highlights the 
contributions of this study to academic knowledge.   
This study has made six significant contributions to knowledge. First, the preponderant of 
previous policy research on Nigeria has focused on the relationship between research  and 
policy (Akinbinu and Tiamiyu, 2016; Sesan and Siyanbola, 2021; Uneke, et al., 2018; 
Uzochukwu et al., 2016; Yagboyaju, 2019) with only a small amount conducted on evidence 
(Onwujekwe, et al., 2015; Onwujekwe et al., 2021; Sanni et al. 2016). This study supports the 
minority view that multiple kinds of evidence are used in the development of public policies in 
Nigeria. In contrast, it shows that the dominant view that policymaking in Nigeria is devoid of 
the use of evidence is unjustified. This study, t herefore, extends the range of the existing 
literature on the use of evidence in policymaking.    
Second, based on empirical evidence, this study reveals new types of evidence used in the 
development of public policy in Nigeria. Previous studies on Nigeria  failed to identify ‘local 
consultants evidence’, ‘MDA evidence’ and ‘external stakeholders evidence’ as substantive 
evidence in the Nigerian policy environment. Also, previous studies located in Nigeria failed 
to identify ‘ideology evidence’ as a type of evidence even though it has long been identified as 
a type of evidence in developed democracies where governments are largely differentiated 
based on ideology (Nutley et al., 2013). In terms of ‘external stakeholders evidence’, it is quite 
curious that although theorists and practitioners have suggested the influence of external 
stakeholders in policymaking in Nigeria, no empirical study, to the best of my knowledge, has
<<<PAGE=290>>>
276 
 
identified it as a kind of evidence within Nigeria’s policymaking environment. Consequently, 
based on the findings of this research, it is clear that the four kinds of evidence are influential 
types of evidence in  policy development in Nigeria and should be recognised as distinct and 
substantive kinds of evidence in the Nigerian policy environment. 
Third, this study has developed an empirical hierarchy of evidence to show the usefulness of 
the nine kinds of evidenc e identified in the study. ‘previous policies evidence’ is considered 
the most useful evidence. In contrast, ‘media evidence’ is identified as the least useful evidence. 
The relative usefulness of the other types of evidence are as follows: ‘MDA evidence’ (2nd), 
‘residual knowledge of policymakers evidence’ (3rd), ‘local consultants evidence’ (4th), 
‘ideology evidence’ (5th), ‘research evidence’ (6th), ‘internet evidence’(7th), ‘external 
stakeholders evidence’ (8th). These findings and the hierarchy develop ed are important 
because they help policymakers to ‘see’ how different kinds of evidence are prioritised thereby 
broadening their understanding. The findings also help scholars to gain more insights into the 
ways policymakers prioritise the various forms of evidence to enable the scholars to know how 
best to exert influence.  
Fourth, this study demonstrated an exploratory and interpretive streak by exploring the way 
multiple evidence types are integrated into the policy process in Nigeria. The findings strongly 
suggest that stakeholder meetings, technical/advisory committees, and the legislative 
committees in the legislature represent evidence integration sites. These sites provide venues 
where multiple types of evidence are interrogated leading to their acc eptance, refinement, or 
rejection.   
Fifth, dominant studies on governance have claimed that central governments have been 
“hollowed out” and marginalised (Bevir and Rhodes, 2003; Rhodes, 2017; Ryser et al., 2021; 
Salamon 2002). The findings of this study challenge this claim and instead confirm the 
argument of the alternative state -centric relational school of thought that asserts that despite 
the change in the policymaking dynamics and the participation of a wider range of players from 
the private sector in policymaking for mutual benefit, governments retain the power to control 
the policy process to reflect their vision. Thus, contrary to popular opinion, my study indicates 
that governments occupy a pre-eminent position in the policy process.   
Finally, this study has responded to the call by a number of policy scholars including Akinbinu 
and Tiamiyu (2016) and Onwujekwe, et al., (2015) for Nigerian -based research to illuminate
<<<PAGE=291>>>
277 
 
understanding of the the dynamics of evidence: what constitutes evide nce, the range of 
evidence policymakers could use, and the influence of the various policy actors. Thus, unlike 
many previous studies that focused on the relationship between research (evidence) and policy, 
this study examined the broader evidence landscap e and provided useful insights into the 
evidence phenomenon. The study, therefore, attempted to fill the theoretical and empirical gaps 
suffered by previous studies. 
11.4. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE  
This study, which is largely a qualitative one, comprised four case studies, and 36 respondents. 
As explained at the beginning of the discussion chapter, the goal of this study is not to generate 
standardised findings but to sufficiently describe the phenomenon in question to enhance 
readers’ understanding. Invar iably, the implications of the findings of this research are 
constrained. Nonetheless, a number of potential implications for practice have emerged which 
could make policymaking in Nigeria and in other similar contexts more evidence-based.   
One, policymakers should be aware that there are numerous kinds of evidence in the policy 
environment with each one possessing significant value-adding potential. While the scientific 
evidence is being touted by its advocates as the ‘gold standard’, this study has demon strated 
that non -scientific evidence, especially evidence from critical stakeholders, assists in the 
generation of new ideas, data, and perspectives. The use of multiple types of evidence enhances 
an in -depth understanding of the issue at hand and offers a  wider range of options for 
policymakers. Thus, policymakers need to be aware of the different kinds of evidence, how to 
get them, and their impact on policy development.  
Two, the recognition of previously unidentified or inadequately recognised evidence types: 
ideology, external stakeholders, local consultants, and MDA, expands the frontiers of evidence 
and gives policymakers additional resources to improve the robustness of evidence, the policy 
process, and ultimately, the quality of policies. These ‘new ’ types of evidence offer a deluge 
of policy-relevant information and data that policymakers can ill-afford to ignore. For instance, 
policymakers could use ideology, being the beliefs and values of the ruling political parties or 
politicians, to rally political support for both policy development and implementation. External 
stakeholders, where they are present, often offer technical support or funding. Also, the stock 
of local consultants has risen sharply in recent times based on their strategic importance while 
the MDAs are very useful in the area of policy alignment and also because, being on the field,
<<<PAGE=292>>>
278 
 
they boast of experience and hands-on knowledge. Thus, the use of these types of evidence, in 
addition to those already documented in the literature would potentially improve policymaking.    
Three, policymakers need to be conscious of their perceptions and those of other policymakers 
in terms of the usefulness of the various kinds of evidence on offer. This awareness draws 
attention to multiple perspectiv es and potentially leads to an improved understanding of the 
value of different kinds of evidence. Within the context of this study, ‘previous policies 
evidence’ is considered the most useful evidence, highlighting its value and pervasiveness. This 
does not, however, suggest the underestimation of other evidence types, as context plays a 
major role in the determination of both the kinds of evidence to use and the importance to attach 
to them. Policymakers are, therefore, invited to exercise reasonable judge ment in the 
prioritisation of evidence types.  
Finally, policymakers should have more faith in the policy process and be innovative in 
creating new types of evidence where evidence gaps exist. A very effective way to achieve this 
is to be open -minded and w ork collaboratively and horizontally with other stakeholders to 
identify the kinds of evidence required to fill in the evidence gaps. Policymakers could also 
liaise with the potential primary targets or beneficiaries of proposed policies to understand their 
perspectives, which will no doubt serve as very useful evidence. 
 11.5. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 
This study which aimed  to critically interrogate the nature and hierarchy of evidence used in 
the development of public policies in Nigeria has three key limitations. 
Firstly, as previously stated, the goal of this study is not to make theoretical generalisations but 
to engender a more grounded understanding of the phenomenon in a sufficient and engaging 
way. The qualitative research element of the study, c omprised of in-depth interviews with 36 
respondents, provided a wealth of detailed material and insight on the policymaking process, 
but of course is not representative (and was not designed to be so) of hundreds of thousands of 
policymakers in the Nigeria n public service (Arabi, 2022). The subjective responses of the 
respondents and the restriction on the number of policies examined to only four also add to the 
limitation of the findings of the study. Consequently, although the study adopts a multiple case 
studies approach which is seen as more reliable than a single case study, generalisation of 
findings is still a significant issue as admitted by many case study scholars (Stake, 1994; 
Lincoln and Guba, 2009).
<<<PAGE=293>>>
279 
 
Secondly, the periodisation of the study (2015  to 2019) is another limitation. The study 
examined public policies developed in Nigeria in the referenced period, which is a unique 
period in the country’s development. It was the first tenure for a government from whom much 
was expected having defeated a n incumbent in a general election, the first time such event 
happened since the country’s return to democracy in 1999. The government also promised to 
do things differently and emphasised that its intention was to ‘change’ the way government 
business was conducted. Thus, the period of the study may have been an outlier making the the 
findings applicable only to the period covered by the study. 
Lastly, the research design of the study was initially to collect data through face -to-face 
interviews, followed by a survey. The initial plan was for me to travel to Nigeria three times 
for data collection. However, after my first trip to Nigeria, the Covid -19 pandemic emerged 
and the country like many other countries was ‘shut down’. This made it impossible for me to 
make the other subsequent trips as planned which affected my ability to get the pre -requisite 
data needed to proceed with the administration of the on-line questionnaire. After about a year, 
the face-to-face interviews was modified to telephone interview which I used to interview 16 
of the 36 respondents. Yet, I had to make a trip to Nigeria in November 2021 to get the 
remaining interviews when it became clear that my presence was important in getting the 
remaining interviews. This oscillation of data coll ection techniques from face -to-face to 
telephone and back to face -to-face affected my findings in at least two ways. The use of the 
telephone denied me the opportunity to capture important verbal and non -verbal cues. On the 
other hand, a recurring impedime nt during the face -to-face interviews was disruptions by 
colleagues and staff of the respondents which in a couple of cases affected the thought process 
of the respondents. There were a few instances when respondents, cut off by such disruptions, 
had to make a ‘detour’ in their explanations, indicating attempts to recall what they had meant 
to say earlier. In addition, the analysis of respondents’ responses obtained from two different 
data collection methods on the same information created a bit of a comparison challenge.  
 11.6. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH  
This study focused on the perception of policymakers in respect of the nature and hierarchy of 
evidence used in the development of public policies in Nigeria during the first tenure of the All 
Progressive Congress government (2015 -2019). The findings of the study represent an 
important effort toward understanding the phenomenon under study. Yet, I see four dimensions 
for future research in the area.
<<<PAGE=294>>>
280 
 
First, this study has a limited scope (2015 -2019) and although this has enabled a proper 
contextualisation of the phenomenon and enhanced the validity of the findings, it has also 
constrained the application of the results beyond the research period. Future research with a 
broader scope is, therefore, needed in this area to allow comparison across periods. 
Second, a subsequent study in this area would benefit from  a larger sample of respondents. 
Introducing additional respondents and more variations in demographics would result in 
improved datasets and more robust findings. This would also enable meaningful comparisons, 
especially regarding the prioritisation of evidence types by policymakers.  
Third, this study identifies ‘MDA evidence’, ‘local consultants evidence’, and ‘external 
stakeholders evidence’ as  distinct kinds of evidence for the first time, which suggests that 
research is urgently needed to confirm their credibility as types of evidence used in both the 
Nigerian policymaking environment and in similar contexts.  
Lastly, a more extensive study could be conducted to investigate the criteria policymakers use 
to decide which evidence to accept, refine or reject. This is critical because it will provide 
further insight into the thinking of policymakers regarding evidence. It will also be particularly 
useful to those interested in promoting the utilisation of evidence in policymaking, enhancing 
the implementation of policies, and improving the policy evaluation process.

INFORMATION SHEET FOR PARTICIPANTS 
Ethical Clearance Reference Number: MRS-18/19-13969 
YOU WILL BE GIVEN A COPY OF THIS INFORMATION SHEET 
 
Title of study 
Exploring the nature and hierarchy of evidence used in the formulation of public policy in 
Nigeria from 2015 to 2019. 
Invitation Paragraph 
I would like to invite you to participate in this research project which forms part of my PhD research. 
Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research 
is being done and what your participation will involve. Please take time to read the following 
information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask me if there is anything that is not clear 
or if you would like more information. 
What is the purpose of the study? 
The purpose of the study is to critically investigate the nature of evidence (information, data and ideas) 
used by public policymakers in developing policies in Nigeria and to identify the relative importance 
policymakers attach to the different evidence sources. To achieve this, a few policies have been selected 
for examination including the Revised National Tax Policy 2016 (NTP).  
Why have I been invited to take part? 
You are being invited to participate in this research because you have been identified by the researcher, 
through purposive sampling, as a key participant in the development of the NTP and as such you possess 
the knowledge required to take part in this study.  
What will happen if I take part? 
You will be interviewed to provide your personal perspectives on the development of the NTP and as 
such there is no right or wrong answer. The interview is semi-structured and would be audio recorded 
with your permission. Specifically, the interview will cover the sources of evidence used in the 
development of the NTP. 
To illustrate, I provide below examples of the questions you will be asked: 
1. In the development of the National Tax Policy 2016 (NTP), please mention the evidence that 
were used (By evidence, I mean information or data used in the development of policies. 
They may, for instance, include previous policies, research findings, input from the media, 
government ideology/party manifestos, expert knowledge of the policymakers, ideas from 
the internet).
<<<PAGE=328>>>
314 
 
 
2. Could you please explain to me how evidence was generated and used in developing the policy?  
 
3. Could you tell me how the policy got started? 
 
4. To what extent would you say subjective factors like equity, fairness, or the values of the people 
were considered in the development and/or implementation of the policy? 
 
5. Was there a person or an organisation that stood out for you during the policy formulation 
process? 
 
6. Do you subscribe to the adoption of evidence -based policy in the Nigerian p ublic service? If 
yes why and if no why not? 
 
The interview will be conducted via the telephone and it is expected to last not more than 30 minutes.  
Do I have to take part? 
Participation is completely voluntary. You should only take part if you want to and choosing not to take 
part will not disadvantage you in anyway. Once you have read the information sheet, please contact me 
if you have any questions that will help you make a decision about taking part. If you decide to take 
part we will ask you to sign a consent form and you will be given a copy of this consent form to keep.  
What are the possible benefits of taking part? 
There are no direct benefits for participants except that it will articulate their contributions to the 
policymaking process of the NTP and may provide learning points for them.  
Data handling and confidentiality 
Your data will be processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 
(GDPR).  
 
• Data will be stored in a secure online storage repository.  
• Participants will remain anonymous 
• Data will be retained up to one year after completion of the researcher’s study. 
• Data may be shared with a third party for a manual transcription service (with participants 
consent) and the researcher will ensure that a data transfer agreement is in place.  
How is the project being funded?  
This study is being funded by the Central Bank of Nigeria. 
What will happen to the results of the study? 
The results of the study will be used in my PhD thesis and I will communicate to you how to obtain a 
copy upon completion.
