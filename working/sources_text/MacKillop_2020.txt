The claim that evidence-based policy (EBP) produces better outcomes has gained increasing 
support over the last three decades. Knowledge brokering (KB) is seen as a way to achieve improved 
policymaking and governments worldwide are investing significant resources in KB initiatives. It 
is therefore important to understand the range of these activities and to investigate whether and 
how they facilitate EBP. This article critically reviews the extant literature on KB. It identifies six 
important limitations: the existence of multiple definitions of KB; a lack of theory-based empirical 
analysis; a neglect of knowledge brokering organisations; insufficient research on KB in social policy; 
limited analysis of impact and effectiveness; and a lack of attention to the role played by politics. 
The paper proposes an agenda for future research that bridges disciplinary boundaries in order to 
address these gaps and contribute new insights into the politics of evidence use.

Knowledge brokering (KB) is a tool or process to achieve knowledge transfer across 
a variety of settings. The focus of this paper is on KB for policymaking rather than 
practice. Although first mentioned in the literature as early as the nineteenth century 
(Lomas, 2007), it has gained momentum since the late 1990s. Governments worldwide 
have invested in knowledge brokering organisations (KBOs) and activities to improve 
the use of research evidence in policymaking. KB has been particularly prominent 
in Canada as a result of successive governments’ endowment of several organisations 
to develop KB and evidence use in different policy areas (for example, the Canadian 
Health Services Research Framework). In the UK, seven What Works Centres

(WWCs) and two affiliates synthesise and broker knowledge between research and 
policy, receiving over £200 billion of public funding since 2012 ( Cabinet Office, 
2018; Gough et al, 2018 ). Despite these investments, there is no consensus in the 
academic literature as to what KB is and insufficient evidence to support claims that it 
works. Crucially, analysis of the political dimension of policymaking is largely absent 
from the literature, leading to incomplete analyses of the phenomenon. Given that 
KB takes place within the political world of policymaking, it shouldn’t be studied 
without understanding and referring to the mechanisms of policymaking, including 
its political elements (Oliver et al, 2014; Cairney, 2016).
Our interest in KB resulted from our organisation’s structure, activities and 
involvement as an associate member of the What Works network. When we first sought 
to understand the role of organisations and individuals in the space between research 
and policy, we became increasingly puzzled by the array and variation of research on 
KB. The rationale for our review of KBOs is to improve our understanding of the 
brokering of research-based knowledge and provide the foundations to explore more 
complex questions. We hope that the results will be useful to other organisations and 
individuals in this field and the wider policy community grappling with brokering 
issues. The study of KB is important as it has proliferated in policy and research 
discourses and grown in funding in recent years and requires analysis and critique.
The literature on KB is varied and confused. A wide range of organisations are 
referred to as knowledge brokers, including think tanks, academic institutes and 
government research services. There is also a particular emphasis on the role of 
individual brokers (Bandola-Gill and Lyall, 2017). Analysis has focused on a wide range 
of topics such as identifying specific processes and activities such as data archiving 
(Woolfrey, 2009), to analysing personal skills and characteristics ranging from the ability 
to undertake systematic reviews and conduct one-to-one meetings with policymakers 
(Frost et al, 2012), to individuals’ charisma and emotions (Michaels, 2009).
This paper starts unpicking the meaning, practices and consequences of KB in 
policymaking by conducting a qualitative review of the existing literature on KB 
to identity key findings and gaps in current understanding. Based on a review of 75 
articles, we find six limitations of the literature which concern multiple definitions; a 
lack of theory and empirical data; a predominance of knowledge brokers as individuals, 
even though there is a growing number of organisations worldwide doing KB; a lack 
of research in social policy; an insufficient focus on impact and effectiveness; and a 
limited acknowledgement of the politics of KB. In light of these findings, we discuss 
how policy, politics and KB literatures could be married to advance analysis and 
understanding of KB and outline avenues for future research for KB in social policy. 
This builds on the work of academics who have recently urged dialogue between 
the policy and politics and evidence-based policy (EBP) literatures.
Research methods: searching the literature on knowledge brokering
We conducted a literature review by searching nine major databases using ‘Knowledge 
Broker Organisation’ (KBO) and six combinations of search terms which we deduced 
from the academic and grey literatures on KB. These search terms were agreed over 
two meetings with the extended research team and are shown in Table 1 below. The 
review was conducted in September 2018.

No date range was set for the search which returned a total of 3,177 sources. These 
articles were scanned according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses method (PRISMA) process depicted in Figure 1 below 
(Moher et al, 2009).
MacKillop scanned all titles and abstracts, retaining 198 articles to be fully read. 
Following reading of these articles by MacKillop (all 198 papers) and Quarmby  
(11 s/he randomly selected) over October–November 2018, 75 sources were retained 
for full review based on the criteria described in Figure 1. The appendix provides full 
details on the 75 papers included in the review.
MacKillop and Quarmby agreed a review grid template, an example of which 
is depicted in Table 2, to develop a meta-study – reviewing theory, methods and 
findings. Downe reviewed 15 sources randomly chosen by MacKillop. This additional 
reviewer helped ascertain that similar critical judgement was made on these sources.
Table 3 below depicts which policy areas and countries were the subject of the 75 
sources. The sources mobilised different methods and this is discussed throughout 
this review section. More information on the corpus is outlined in Appendix 1, 
available on request.
Finally, although the review was inspired by systematic methods such as how 
databases were searched and search terms established, we eschewed some essential 
systematic stages such as double-blinded peer-review due to restrictions of funding, 
resources and time. We accept that this is a limitation of the research.

Knowledge brokering and knowledge brokers: common themes 
from the literature
Definitions
We found multiple definitions of KB with some providing no definition at all (eight 
out of the 75 sources (8/75)). Some definitions are circular with KB being defined 
as the activity that knowledge brokers do, and knowledge brokers as the individuals 
or organisations that perform KB. For example, Lamari and Ziam (2014) state that 
‘knowledge brokering is defined as being an intermediation activity undertaken by 
intermediaries (individuals, organisations, networks, etc.) acting as “connectors”’ (p 
345). Most definitions are consistent with a ‘push’ approach to knowledge transfer, 
where research simply needs to be ‘pushed’ out of academia towards policymakers (for 
example, Elueze, 2015; Hopkins et al, 2018; Mallidou et al, 2018). Authors conceive 
of policymakers and researchers as inhabiting separate worlds (Michaels, 2009; Chew 
et al, 2013) with the often-repeated idea that knowledge brokers are ‘serv[ing] as 
intermediaries between the worlds of research and policy’ (Olejniczak, 2017: 554).
More broadly, Turnhout et  al (2013 : 356) warn against these definitional 
inconsistencies, with ‘the current literature on knowledge brokering us[ing] 
the term in a broad sense that covers a wide range of strategies and activities’.

Does knowledge brokering facilitate evidence-based policy?

Highlighting this lack of clarity, they explain how KB ‘refer[s] to interactive settings  
(Bielak et al, 2008), organizations (Hargadon, 2002; Hargadon and Fanelli, 2002) or 
individuals (Ward et al, 2012)’. These multiple definitions are symptomatic of the 
growth of the field and of various researchers and disciplines’ attempts at making 
sense of and implementing/refining these new processes.
Finally, 8/75 papers reiterate the Canadian Health Service Research Framework’s 
(CHSRF) definition:
all activity that links decision makers with researchers, facilitating their interaction 
so that they are able to better understand each other’s goals and professional 
cultures, influence each other’s work, forge new partnerships, and promote the 
use of research-based evidence in decision-making. (Lomas, 2007: 131)
There were 17 extra references to the CHSRF without explicitly quoting the definition, 
meaning that in total a third of the papers (25/75) relied on this theoretical basis. 
The repetition and application across contexts is unsurprising given that frontrunner 
organisations are likely to have more influence on terminology, but may also be problematic 
because the CHSRF definition was developed for the specific area of health services in 
Canada and it may not apply to cases as varied as KB in other countries or policy areas.
We do not argue that a general KB definition is required; rather, that a plethora of 
definitions are at play, causing confusion and reiterating past models of knowledge 
transfer and mobilisation.
Theories and methods of analysis
A second feature of the literature is its lack of engagement with theoretical and 
methods questions (Shaxson and Gwyn, 2010; South, 2011; Morton et al, 2012). When

there is theory, it is often linked to social network analysis (SNA) or dissemination 
and diffusion theories. SNA focuses on individuals and their networks, but says very 
little about the role which structures, ideas and wider discourses and narratives play 
in policymaking (Long et al, 2013; Jessani et al, 2016; Jessani et al, 2016; Cvitanovic 
et al, 2017 ). Some notable theoretical discussions conceptualise KB as boundary 
spanning, especially in environmental sciences (see Michaels, 2009; Turnhout et al, 
2013). These findings are likely to be difficult to translate to social policy because 
what constitutes knowledge is often more contested (Knorr-Cetina, 2013). Overall, 
a majority of sources appeared influenced by Caplan’s two-communities theory 
(1979). This influence could be linked to the overarching belief across this literature 
of the existence of two distinct worlds of research and policy, requiring brokering.
Regarding research methods, there is generally a lack of rich and robust empirical 
data, with many reviews (22/75) (for example, Lavis et al, 2003 ; Gold, 2009; Long 
et al, 2013; Bornbaum et al, 2015; Elueze, 2015; Olejniczak et al, 2016; Mallidou et 
al, 2017; Moore et al, 2017; Sarkies et al, 2017) self-reporting ‘practical experiences’ 
(Shaxson and Gwyn, 2010: 1 ) and self-evaluations from authors working in the 
organisations studied (for example, Leicester, 2007; Pennell et al, 2013; Bednarek et 
al, 2016; Notarianni et al, 2016). Some articles resemble manifestos in favour of KB 
and EBP or ‘how-to guides’, with modal verbs of necessity such as ‘ought’ and ‘must’ 
(Gold, 2009; Godfrey et al, 2010; Hering, 2016; Olejniczak et al, 2016) (at least 17 
sources use such phrasing) (Cairney and Oliver, 2018). This approach is prescriptive 
and normative and often involves a focus on enablers and barriers to ‘good’ KB (Hamel 
and Schrecker, 2011; Chew et al, 2013; Otten et al, 2015). Kislov et al (2017: 111) 
also highlight a preoccupation with ‘cataloguing’ KB activities rather than employing 
systematic and critical analysis of KB cases and their impact and situated effectiveness. 
The review suggests that there is still a need for robust and detailed empirical research 
(Cooper, 2014; Dagenais et al, 2015 ; van Enst et al, 2017 ), supported by clearly 
stated methodologies (Cooper, 2015; der Graaf et al, 2018). We argue that building 
on policy and politics could help go beyond positivist and generalising frameworks, 
towards critical and more realistic analyses that take account of context, politics, ideas, 
resistance, conflicts and alliances which constitute KB in policy.
There are relatively few case studies (18/75), these sometimes falling into 
self-reporting by people working in those organisations without the necessary 
methodological ‘arsenal’ to allow (some) objective evaluation of the data and 
reproducibility (for example, Bednarek et al, 2016). Others limit their data collection 
to published policy documents, thus missing out on other data collection techniques 
such as interviews and observations (de Leeuw et al, 2018). There are also noteworthy 
case studies, often involving action research, which provide some interesting findings 
to develop future research (Pannell and Roberts, 2009; Hoeijmakers et al, 2013; Lee 
et al, 2014; Saarela et al, 2015; de Leeuw et al, 2018).
Agency and structure as knowledge brokers
Despite the widespread acceptance that ‘[a] knowledge broker may be an individual, 
a team or an organization’ (Shaxson and Gwyn, 2010: 6; Elueze, 2015), the literature 
reviewed overwhelmingly focuses on knowledge brokers as individuals (38/75) rather 
than organisations (13/75). Five studies treated KB as a process or strategy and 24 saw 
KB as including individuals, organisations and processes (for example, Oldham and

Mclean, 1997; Lavis et al, 2003; Knight and Lyall, 2013; Meyer and Kearnes, 2013) but 
many only empirically discussed the role of individuals ( Dobbins et al, 2009; Ward 
et al, 2009; Knight and Lyall, 2013; Turnhout et al, 2013; Elueze, 2015). This focus on 
the individual veers the discussion towards personal characteristics such as charisma 
and emotions, often muting other important factors such as context, the policy in 
question, structural rules and processes, organisational culture and complexity (see 
also Bandola-Gill and Lyall, 2017).
Some studies develop useful findings regarding KBOs, with for instance Cooper 
surveying and comparing educational KBOs across Canada ( Cooper, 2014; 2015), 
Hoeijmakers et al (2013) discussing the activities and impact of a specific KBO, or 
Guston (2001) analysing how KBOs blur boundaries between research and policy 
to facilitate transfer (see also Wehrens et al, 2010 ; Boswell, 2018). However, the 
current focus of the literature on individuals means that there remain opportunities 
for original research into KBOs, analysing structures and processes of brokering at 
the organisational level.
Policy areas and countries
Fourth, studies tend to focus on KB in a single policy area and country. The majority 
focus on health (34/75) or the environment (19/75) with very few researching 
social policy (3/75). The literature tends to focus on ‘hard’ sciences rather than other 
types of knowledge or evidence, although we recognise that there is a wide range of 
‘softer’ social science being conducted in health, in particular. Social policy evidence 
or knowledge is often considered more subjective and open to being contested by 
other stakeholders in the policy community (Caplan, 1979; Knorr-Cetina, 2013). This 
niche focus sits awkwardly with the desire of most of the research to distil universal 
characteristics of KB. There is, therefore, a need to develop research on KB in the 
social policy context. Studies could explore questions of what counts as knowledge 
or evidence in this domain, who evaluates these sources of knowledge, how they are 
communicated and negotiated differently in other sciences than social sciences and 
the phenomenon of social policy research increasingly using quantitative and positivist 
methods – for example, randomised-controlled trials (RCTs), surveys, evidence 
matrices – to gain credibility and legitimacy (Wallace et al, 2004; Parkhurst, 2017).
One KBO pertaining to Canadian healthcare is mentioned across several sources 
(see first sub-section earlier in article): the CHSRF . In fact, as noted by Elueze (2015) 
in her review of 26 health KB studies, the biggest group of researchers in the field 
are Canadian and/or based in a Canadian university, with McMaster University 
producing half of the journal articles, followed by Western and University of Ottawa 
producing six each. This dominance of Canadian institutions (including the Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada) has helped to increase the 
visibility of knowledge mobilisation but leads to a lack of variety and alternative 
stories, practices and processes of KB, especially from countries where policy attitudes 
to knowledge are different.
Effectiveness and impact
The question of impact remains as contentious as when it was discussed by 
Weiss (1977) more than four decades ago. The literature usually refers to specific

342
social/relational factors and recommendations for achieving impact through KB 
(Pannell and Roberts, 2009 ; Knight and Lyall, 2013 ; Langeveld et al, 2016 ) such 
as ‘respect’ or ‘social conscience’ (Jessani et al, 2016 ), receptivity to research in an 
organisational culture (Dagenais et al, 2015), shared perspective, language and good 
negotiation skills (Gagnon, 2011), or focusing on specific findings for a place directly 
fed to policymakers ( Osmond et al, 2010). In fact, only a small number of studies 
evaluate KB interventions to determine their effectiveness or impact on policy, rather 
than simply outlining recommendations to be applied generally (Powell et al, 2018).
Other papers attempt to evaluate KB initiatives using more objective measures of 
impact. Cooper et al (2018), for example, examine the impact of various education 
research bodies on Canadian policy using surveys (see also Meagher and Lyall, 2013). 
Bednarek et al (2016) assess the impact of their KBO via anecdotes in the media and 
surveys. They draw on a hundred interviews across 12 stakeholder groups to measure 
the use and relevance of their evidence and practices (see also Kirchhoff et al, 2015 
on longitudinal evaluation). Some assume future effectiveness of KB based on what 
other studies had deemed ‘good’ or effective (Mavoa et al, 2012), or rely on the self-
reported perceptions of knowledge brokers ( Cvitanovic et al, 2017). A number of 
studies refer to credibility, legitimacy and salience when discussing KB effectiveness 
(Shaw et al, 2013), concepts that could benefit from theoretical framing within politics 
literatures. The problem with these various ways of grasping impact is their lack of 
reproducibility and objectivity, even though the latter will always remain contentious.
A few studies go further in addressing the question of impact. Cooper (2015) builds 
on Qi and Levin’s (2013 ) knowledge mobilisation measurement tool to evaluate 
the impact of education KBOs in Canada, but only uses data available on websites. 
Saarela et al (2015) underline the need for case-by-case KB strategies and evaluations 
and the importance of context, developing a typology of contextual factors and a 
pre-policy impact assessment which can influence the production, dissemination and 
use of knowledge in policy. Hoeijmakers et al (2013 ) develop a theory of change 
to organise their activities and evaluate the impact of their KBO by drawing on 
deliberative policymaking tools such as question-and-answer sessions and dialogue on 
solutions. Finally, Campbell et al (2015) propose a structured reflection event bringing 
knowledge brokers, policymakers and funders into discussing the contributions of 
a KB project.
This summary of papers shows that although there are some interesting studies 
tackling the question of effectiveness and impact of KB, there remains much to be 
done to bring the various components together and develop realistic evaluations of the 
effectiveness of KB. As one of the papers concluded: ‘probably the biggest challenge to 
knowledge brokering is the lack of knowledge about how it works, what contextual 
factors influence it and its effectiveness’ (Ward et al, 2009: 273).
T o conclude, the KB literature is still relatively young and lacks the necessary spread 
of empirical work to assess impact or effectiveness.
The politics of knowledge brokering and policymaking
Finally, discussion of the politics of KB features only intermittently within the corpus, 
which appears to be based on a simple understanding of policymaking. Out of the 
75 papers, 17 make no reference to politics, and do not feature a single politic* search 
term (politics, political, politician and so on). An additional 26 papers reference politics

less than three times each. Some papers reference the disjuncture between the analysis 
of KB in the literature and the (inherently political) policy context in which KB 
operates (for example, Hoeijmakers et al, 2013; Bednarek et al, 2016; de Leeuw et al, 
2018). A small number of papers refer to political science or apply specific political 
theories to their analysis of KB (Leicester, 2007; Gold, 2009; Michaels, 2009; Meyer 
and Kearnes, 2013; Sebba, 2013; Campbell et al, 2015).
Many papers refer to policymaking as unravelling according to a set blueprint, for 
example Mallidou et al refer to ‘the policy cycle’ (2018: 8) (see also Jessani et al, 2016; 
Olejniczak et al, 2016; der Graaf et al, 2018). Less than ten papers provide an explicit 
definition of policy, and none are complete or satisfactory. For example, De Leeuw 
et al define policy as ‘the negotiated endeavour to resolve social problems’ (2018: 540) 
which says nothing about the role of the government or power.
Most papers show an understanding of some aspects of policymaking while 
omitting other elements that are fundamental to analysing KB. For example, Lavis 
et al reference the ‘political factors with which research knowledge must compete 
to influence the decision-making process’, but do not differentiate between 
different types of policymakers, referring instead to ‘policy decision makers’ in 
general ( 2003: 222, 225 ). Equally, Dobbins et al state that the ‘decision making 
process is complex,’ but use an exclusively managerial framing for this: ‘program 
managers in public health departments typically make recommendations to senior 
management’ (2009a: 2).
Many other papers also do not make explicit the differences between the political 
and civil service aspects of policymaking. Around a third of papers (26/75) do not 
mention politicians as policymakers. This may be symptomatic of the fact that many 
papers are theoretically informed by the two-communities theory ( Caplan, 1979) 
which does not adequately account for the organisational, structural and cultural 
differences between the civil service and politics aspects of policymaking. Instead, 
this theory gives the impression that policymaking is a homogeneous and constant 
process (Stone, 2012; Newman et al, 2016).
At least eight sources also refer to ‘policy and practice’ as if these two areas 
were a single entity ( van Kammen et al, 2006 ; Dobbins et al, 2009 ; Woolfrey, 
2009; Chew et al, 2013; Knight and Lyall, 2013; Sebba, 2013; Cooper, 2015). This 
is problematic given that research evidence plays a radically different role in, for 
example, informing a government strategy, to the day-to-day activities of medical 
practitioners. However, this conflation may also be explained by the dominant view 
in some KB fields such as health services research of practitioners as policymakers 
(Lipsky, 1980).
Mere reference to politics also does not necessarily indicate a greater appreciation 
of policymaking, and politics and policy are sometimes used interchangeably. For 
example, Hage et al refer to their research variously as pertaining to ‘knowledge and 
policy in the Dutch political system’ and in the ‘Dutch policy system’ suggesting 
that they regard politics and policy as synonymous ( 2010: 255, 257). In addition, 
Otten et al mention politic * once in their paper when they refer to ‘the policy 
and politics process’ ( 2015: 4) which pays lip service to the political elements of 
policymaking without incorporating this into their analysis. In sum, the lack of 
detail regarding the policy process, particularly the failure to sufficiently address 
the role played by politics, leads to a trend of incomplete analysis of KB across 
the papers reviewed.

A critical research agenda for knowledge brokering
The typical KB image of the policy process, which posits research evidence as a 
necessary part of the policymaking process, is problematic as it is naïve and idealistic. 
The policymaking process is complex, involving a multiplicity of stakeholders and 
interests. Research evidence competes with multiple other factors in the development 
of policy, such as political agendas, electoral tactics, the political cycle, interests of 
other stakeholders, technical, bureaucratic and political feasibility, costs (which has 
many meanings here), and gripping narratives (Stoker and Evans, 2016). Pielke (2007) 
contrasts T ornado Politics, where information and science play a crucial role in 
determining policy, with Abortion Politics, where information plays a less important 
role than values and power plays. Unlike most of the sources reviewed for this paper, 
which tend to depict policymakers as a homogeneous group without distinguishing 
between politicians, administrators/civil servants and government scientists or experts, 
Christensen stresses the key role of bureaucrats ‘as brokers between research-based 
evidence and politics’ (2017) (see also Gains and Stoker, 2011). In this section, we 
discuss four particular points which we believe will help bring a fresh perspective 
to the current scholarship: theory, methods, the empirical deficit, and impact and 
effectiveness.
Building on recent examples of authors facilitating dialogue between policy and 
politics research and EBP (Sanderson, 2006; Smith, 2013; Oliver et al, 2014; Parkhurst, 
2017; Cairney, 2016; French, 2018; Weible and Cairney, 2018 ), we propose that 
more effort is placed on bridging academic literatures so that our understanding 
of KB is widened. Concepts from network governance, practice, discourse and 
narrative literatures could be applied to develop a more theoretically-informed and 
methodologically-sound approach to analyse KB and EBP (Fischer, 1990; Yanow, 2007; 
Wagenaar, 2011; Howarth, 2013). The EBP literature has tended to posit evidence/
knowledge as homogeneous ‘facts’ and ‘truths’ to be transferred, exchanged or ignored 
by policymakers, often overlooking the idea that knowledge/evidence is constantly 
re-made, re-interpreted and contested ( Newman, 2011; Sullivan, 2011; Ayres and 
Marsh, 2013). The role of knowledge and evidence in policy framing is important 
which points to the usefulness of discursive concepts in analysing such phenomena 
(Goffman, 1971; see also Majone, 1989). This political aspect of KB is present in only 
some sources (Meyer, 2010; Turnhout et al, 2013; Leino et al, 2018). Knaggård’s (2015 
policy broker concept, for example, which builds on multiple-streams analysis which 
frame brokers and researchers as political actors (Kingdon, 1984), could be developed 
further by building on narrative, discourse and practice studies in politics. More broadly, 
given the role of evidence in the policymaking process is often messy and complex, 
it requires ontological frameworks that make space for these realities and the politics 
at play (Monaghan, 2008; Smith, 2013; Cairney, 2019). Such approaches will help 
focus on the ‘why’ as well as ‘how’ questions of KB, emphasising how knowledge 
and evidence are mobilised, negotiated, and how policy problems themselves are  
re/formulated during brokering processes.
In addition to building on these theoretical concepts, we suggest that a  
critically-inspired methodology, for instance Rhetorical Political Analysis (Finlayson, 
2007), offers interesting tools from Aristotelian philosophy for analysing how evidence 
is mobilised in the policymaking narrative and to begin analysing the underlying 
discourse or rhetoric of KB and EBP . Furthermore, emulating some of the literature

reviewed, we feel that mobilising their action research tools and immersing ourselves 
in KBOs by working alongside them, will provide useful and detailed insights into 
how KB actually works, the politics of brokering, how organisations evaluate their 
impact and what similar or varied practices are at play ( Bartels and Wittmayer, 
2014). This will also help to uncover the organisational and structural dimensions of 
knowledge brokerage, which are often overlooked. By reframing KB and the wider 
EBP problematics through the prism of narrative, discourse, governance and practice, 
we believe it is possible to go beyond prescribing recommendations over how EBP 
ought to take place and instead produce empirically-rich studies which explain what 
happens in the real world, that is, the power plays, the different uses and mobilisations of 
evidence in policy, and critically discuss whether and how evidence influences policy.
There is an empirical gap surrounding the emergence and impact of new evidence 
intermediaries such as UK WWCs, the Ontarian Mowat Centre, US California Policy 
Lab, and the Africa Centre for Evidence which all operate outside of the health policy 
context (see National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)) and have 
different functions from traditional think tanks ( Stone, 1996; Rich, 2004; Abelson, 
2018; McGann and Shull, 2018). Various models/tools of KB have been designed and 
this provides an opportunity to apply some of these to examine empirically how these 
KBO’s work in the social policy area. Policy broker studies don’t discuss knowledge 
and evidence extensively (Ingold and Varone, 2012; Christopoulos and Ingold, 2015). 
Studies channelling advocacy coalition concepts are useful in conceiving of scientists 
as political actors but say little about these new KBOs ( Weible and Sabatier, 2005). 
These bodies require critical analysis and comparison to understand what they do 
and whether and how they influence and inform policy. This could look at the range 
of brokering practices at play and how they mobilise and re-interpret knowledge 
and evidence according to different policymaking scenarii. Currently, such analysis is 
lacking and remains the territory of the bodies themselves.
Finally, there needs to be more research on the ‘impact’ and ‘effectiveness’ of KB 
on policy and how these terms are defined. Abelson (2018) for instance explains 
how counting the number of times an organisation (he speaks of think tanks) is 
mentioned in the press or how many governmental meetings individuals attended is 
unhelpful and does not demonstrate impact. Speaking of relevance rather than impact, 
he argues that influence should be determined based on ‘if, when, and under what 
conditions they can and have contributed to specific public policy discussions and 
to the broader policy-making environment’ (Abelson, 2018: 229). Despite some of 
the think-tank literature providing useful concepts and frameworks, the KBOs we 
discuss in this paper, such as WWCs and academic institutes, have not done enough 
to examine their impact.
We believe that the development of theoretically-informed discussions on KB could 
best be done iteratively, whereby theory and empirical data are intertwined during 
the research project. This process could foster strong explanations of KB with theories 
which have been refined in the real world; a process within which researchers play 
a key role in critically judging and evaluating the ‘fit’ between theory and data (for 
example, Glynos and Howarth, 2007). Although we have intuitions about the types 
of policy and politics theories which could enrich KB research and its understanding, 
we believe that it is only by trialling these in the field, comparing different cases, and 
critically reflecting individually and in groups, that we can achieve both theoretical 
contributions in the field and better understanding of KB and its multiple facets.

Conclusions
Despite the quantity of research produced on KB, our review found that many of 
the sources often didn’t address issues of (1) definition; (2) theories and methods; 
(3) agency and structure; (4) policy areas and countries (5) effectiveness and impact; 
and (6) politics.
Based on these findings, we explored how policy and politics research could inform 
KB scholarship, notably by thinking about theories and methods for analysing them 
in a critical way. We believe that more research is needed which interrogates the 
different practices, processes and settings of KB in the social policy sphere, regarding 
topics such as education, welfare, employment or taxation. It is in these fields where 
knowledge and evidence often remain contested and where the problems and solutions 
are the topic of heated debates, that research into how knowledge and evidence are 
brokered will deliver important benefits.
In order to discuss and evaluate KB practices, we argue that it is necessary to 
develop studies which examine how KB actually happens, rather than developing 
models and concepts in vitro. Surveys are useful in painting a broad brush (though 
possibly blurred) picture of activities and impact, but multiple in-depth case studies 
of KB in different settings, policy areas, regions, countries and times could provide 
high-resolution snapshots of KB. These cases will help to build a more realistic 
and data-informed understanding of KB and its many visages. By comparing and 
contrasting these different practices, researchers will be able to critically discuss what 
works across different contexts. The results will enable individual knowledge brokers 
and organisations to reflect on their practices and test alternative approaches. It is 
by developing these bottom-up approaches, that we will be able to discuss KB and 
its politics in a realistic and more objective way, rather than with generalising and 
prescriptive ‘how-to’ guides and ‘top tips’.
Despite both EBP and policy-politics studies documenting and discussing how 
policy is made, the literature have evolved in almost hermetic silos, with little cross-
fertilisation happening between the two. These silos lead to the EBP literature lacking 
in realistic theoretically-informed discussions and methodologically-sound analyses 
of the policy process and of the role played by research evidence. Although EBP 
has evolved mostly separately from policy and politics studies, its ideas and models 
are increasingly influential in policymaking. These disciplinary boundaries must be 
bridged to bring new insights into the changing roles and politics of knowledge in 
policymaking. If successfully applied, it could provide considerable insight not only 
into how to broker research-based knowledge, but also how other forms and sources 
of knowledge are shared and brokered.
