Abstract
Academicsundertakingpublicpolicyresearcharecom-
mittedtotacklinginterestingquestionsdrivenbycurios-
ity, but they generally also want their research to have
an impact on government, service delivery, or public
debate. Yet our ability to capture the impact of this
research is limited because impact is under-theorised,
and current systems of research impact evaluation do
notallowformultipleorchangingresearchgoals.This
articledevelopsaconceptualframeworkforunderstand-
ing, measuring, and encouraging research impact for
thosewhoseektoproduceresearchthatspeakstomul-
tiple audiences. The framework brings together mes-
sage, medium, audience, engagement, impact, evalua-
tion,andaffordancewithinthelogicsofdifferentfields.
It sets out a new way of considering research goals,
measurements, and incentives in an integrated way.
By accounting for the logics of different fields, which
encompass disciplinary, institutional, and intrinsic fac-
tors, the framework provides a new way of harnessing
measurements and incentives towards fruitful learning
about the contribution diverse types of public policy
researchcanmaketowiderimpact.

is not the only source of research that impacts public policy, but it is a source that often goes
untapped. Although there are several reasons for this (Keith et al.,2019), an important one is
thatresearchimpact,inanacademiccontext,suffersfromalackoftheoreticalattention,aswell

Theimpactofresearchonbusiness,government,civilsociety,media,andculturehasgrownsub-

researchisextremelydifficult.
Thedesireforpolicyresearchtoinfluencedecision-makingiscompoundedbynewimperatives
around research impact in universities and research centres. Increasingly, a pattern of ‘shifting

3 MEASURINGANDENCOURAGINGRESEARCHIMPACT
The national research assessment exercise in Australia – the Excellence in Research for Aus-
tralia (ERA) – was extended to include an Engagement and Impact component in 2018. The
collection of data for this exercise involves constructing narratives of both engagement and
impact as separate stories, bound by a series of limits and directives (https://www.arc.gov.au/
engagement-and-impact-assessment).Thisissimilarto,butlesssubstantialthan,theU.K.’sREF
studiesof impact (Williams & Grant,2018).Much has been written about theproblemsof these
measurement systems in terms of the difficulties of attributing impact to discrete research out-
putsorprojects,thetemporalnatureofchange,thetimeframeofmeasurement,andtheissueof
whether to include positive and negative change, amongst other issues (Morton,2015; Penfield
etal., 2014).Suchsystemswillalwaysstruggletoadequatelycaptureresearchimpact,becauseof
itscomplexrelationshipwiththeproductionandspreadofknowledge.
Thus,measuringresearchimpactisanimportantissueforresearchersanduniversitiesinmany
nations,includingAustralia.Butexistingresearchevaluationpracticesincludeanassortmentof

Althoughmeasurementisoftenpresentedastheapoliticalapplicationoftheuseofinforma-
tion,collectedandusedtodemonstrateeffectiveness,manycomplexitiesarehiddenbehindthis
seemingly rational and technical enterprise (Lewis,2015). Closer scrutiny of any measurement
systemhighlightsthepoliticsthatsitbehinditsconstructionandtheconsequencesithasinprac-
tice. There are a number of features of research impact that render it particularly difficult to
measure.Impactcanrarelybeattributedtoasingleresearchprojectoroutput,but,rather,typi-
callyarisesfromabodyofknowledgethatcontainsmanythreadsfrommultipleresearchprojects
(Morrisetal., 2011).Inaddition,externalfactorscaninfluencetheeffectsofresearch,suchasnew
incentives,economicchanges,orshiftsinpublicattitudesorpoliticalagendas(Reed, 2018).Fur-
thermore,unintendedornegativeconsequences,timedelays,anddisconnectedimplementation
ofrecommendationsmakeevaluationchallenging(Alvarezetal., 2010;Sanjarietal., 2014).Thus,
there is increasing acknowledgement that the connection between research and impact is too
indirect,non-linear,andcomplextobecapturedbyexistingevaluationframeworks(Bornmann,
2012).Thisisexacerbatedbythetendencyofexistingevaluationstoeschewthelatestliteratureor
undulylimittherangeofevaluationoptions(Stemetal., 2005).
The area of research impact has thus largely been dominated by pragmatic research policy
imperatives, without careful and deliberate thought about how the benefit of research to soci-
ety is understood and assessed (Williams,2020). A lack of theoretical attention to the area has
resulted in a tendency for research assessment to focus on what can be measured, rather than
whatshouldbemeasuredinordertocaptureimpact.Therearetwomajoroverarchingproblems
withcurrentapproaches.First,becausetheyarebasedlargelyonpragmaticconcernsaboutwhat
canbemeasured,theyleadtoaconstrainedframingofthevalueofknowledgeandasuperficial
understandingoftherelationshipbetweenresearchandimpact.Second,inignoringthedeeper
question of what should be measured, they do not allow for anticipation or avoidance of unin-
tendedconsequencesorforthedevelopmentofproceduresthatcanencourageresponsibleand
impactfulresearch.
Yet,publicpolicyresearchershavepotentialopportunitiesforsocietalimpactforatleastsome
of their work, while also producing work that speaks more directly to academic communities.
Although there seems to be general support for understanding the wider influence of research,
there is great resistance amongst academics to the narrow and instrumental forms of assess-
mentofimpactthatmakeupthecurrentevaluationlandscape(Smithetal., 2020).Thereisgen-
eralacknowledgmentthatthemultifaceted,intricate,andlong-termconsequencesarisingfrom

4 UNDERSTANDINGRESEARCHIMPACT–ACONCEPTUAL
FRAMEWORK
Knowledgeproductionoccurswithinspecificsocialspacesthatcontainprescribedrulesandtra-
ditions(Brew,2001;Camic, 2011).Expertscanbeseenasgroupswhoseekclosureandwhowishto
maintaindominancewithinthesehierarchicalstructures(Abbott, 1988;Bourdieu, 1990),which
are described as ‘fields’. The groups are maintained by various symbolic and social boundaries,
maintained by taken-for-granted assumptions and criteria that individuals are socialised into
(Lamont & Molnar,2002). Fields are arenas in which actors aim to manipulate specific sym-
bolic resources or ‘capitals’. Actors participate within the logic of the site by pursuing different
typesofcapitalthatprovidepower.Thespreadofcapitalsgainedandmaintainedbyanindividual
ororganisationdeterminestheirstrategies,practices,andaffordanceswithinthefield(Medvetz,
2008). It follows that, in policy research, impact can only be understood by paying attention to
the range of fields within which policy research actors operate and the potential activities and
approachesthataremadepossibleineach(andincombination).
ThisarticlebuildsonthetheoreticalframeworkofWilliams( 2020),whichoutlinesthesymbolic
formsofpowerandprestigethataremadeavailablebydifferentfields.Researchersinuniversity
settings are increasingly expected to create ‘impact’ in a range of extra-academic fields, includ-
ingmedia,economic,application,andpolitics,byborrowingandnegotiatingthelanguage,logic,
and resources of each. There are several key proficiencies that are required to successfully nav-
igate these fields: scholarly expression, which gives credibility from the academic field; policy
relevance,whichgivesauthorityfromthepoliticsfield;practicalapplicability,whichgivesutility
fromthefieldofapplication;broadcastingskill,whichgivesvisibilityfromthemediafield,and
monetaryvalue,whichgivesweightfromtheeconomicfield.Payingattentiontotheseallowsfor

This article provides a conceptual framework for understanding, measuring, and encouraging
