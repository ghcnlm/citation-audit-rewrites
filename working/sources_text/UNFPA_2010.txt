Maternal Mortality Reduction 
Programme in Rwanda
No Woman should die while giving life
Higher levels of wom
en’s education are strongly associated with both lower infant mortality and lower fertility
Everyone has the right to enjoy reproductive health, which is a basis for having healthy children, intimate relationships and happy families.

Mountainous Rwanda, known as ‘the land of 
thousand hills’, is located in Eastern central 
Africa on a highland plateau averaging 1,200 
to 2,000 m in elevation.
The Health sector in Rwanda has made 
significant progress in recent years. 
Reproductive Health, including Family 
Planning and Maternal health is a priority in 
Ministry of Health Strategic Plan and the fight 
against maternal death is a concern in Rwanda 
and is registered among MDGs priorities
The Maternal Mortality Rate has fallen 
in recent years, but still high. Improved 
surveillance and accountability have played a 
large role in reducing the MMR and increasing 
the number of assisted deliveries in Rwanda. 
Improved surveillance has allowed Rwanda’s 
MOH to better track the causes of maternal 
deaths throughout the country, resulting in 
more targeted policies, strategies/road map, 
and programs. 
Contributing factors are unknown but include 
the high percentage of births that take place 
without skilled medical assistance (52 per cent) 
and the low utilization of basic obstetric care 
and family planning services (CPR:27%). 
UNFPA has been operating in Rwanda since 
1975. From that time on, it has been successful 
in advancing and advocating for Reproductive 
Health and Rights, Gender, Population and 
Development in Rwanda both at the central 
and decentralized level.
Currently UNFPA is implementing its 
sixth cycle of assistance through a country 
programme that provides an integrated 
package of Adolescents Sexual Reproductive 
Background
Health, gender equality, women empowerment 
and tackling other Population matters in 5 
Districts.
The sixth Country Programme was designed 
in the context of the “UN Delivering as 
one process” to last for five years and to 
assist Rwanda in achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
The programme was developed in collaboration 
with the Government of Rwanda and other 
UN agencies and based on: the Programme 
of Action of the International Conference 
on Population and Development (ICPD), 
the United Nations Development Assistance 
Framework (UNDAF), the Rwanda Vision 
2020 and the Economic development and 
Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS).

Maternal Mortality in Rwanda
<<<PAGE=4>>>
In 2008, the Government of Rwanda has devel -
oped and adopted, with UNFPA support a road 
map to accelerate the reduction of maternal and 
newborn mortality and morbidity which take into 
account the maternal death audit at health facili -
ties and community level. Maternal death audits 
are seen as an important mechanism to strengthen 
health information systems to improve under -
standing of the major causes of death and the 
changes needed to address them.
 
Since November 2008, the Ministry of Health has 
institutionalized maternal death audit through ca-
pacity building of health facilities. Three meth -
ods were selected: 1) Facility based deaths audit, 
2) Confidential enquiry into maternal deaths, and 
3) verbal autopsy (community based deaths au-
dit). The tools for those 3 methodologies were 
developed. In November 2008, a pool of trainers 
in Maternal Deaths audit (28 persons) was put in 
place and tools pretested and validated. The ToRs 
of focal point in charge of Maternal Death Au-
dit at the MoH level were proposed. This training 
was conducted together with UNFPA and WHO 
and was a good experience in delivering as one 
in Rwanda. In March-April 2009 the training sin 
Maternal Death Audit. were completed. As result, 
All District Hospitals (43) have 2 trained provid-
ers in maternal deaths audit and are prepared to 
start to review all maternal deaths which hap-
pened as well in the health systems as in the com-
munity.
As results, 256 maternal deaths in 2009 and 221 
maternal deaths in 2010 were audited and recom-
mendations formulated to avoid similar deaths in 
the future. The major causes of Maternal Deaths 
are currently known and this is the best way to 
prevent further deaths and focus interventions.
Maternal Mortality Ratio trends
UNFPA Achievements in reducing Maternal Mortality in 2010
Reduction of maternal mortality ratio: according to the 2008 UN MMR estimates, total percentage de-
clines in MMR in Rwanda is (–51%). DHS 2005: 1071/100.000 LB; UN estimates 2008: 540/100.000 
LB, 2010 HMIS: 383/100.000 LB
UNFPA is supporting the Government of Rwanda to achieve the commitments made to the UN Secretary 
General GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR WOMEN’S AND CHILDREN’S HEALTH, more specifically those 
related to maternal Health.

2. CARMMA and WRA
Concerned about the magnitude of Maternal 
Mortality on the continent, the African Union 
(AU) Ministers of Health at the fourth session of 
the Conference of Ministers of Health meeting in 
Addis Ababa launched the Campaign on Accel-
erated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa 
(CARMMA) in May 2009. The AU has spear-
headed this campaign, which aims to accelerate 
the availability and use of universally accessible 
quality health services including those related to 
reproductive and sexual health. “Africa cares: 
no woman should die while giving life” is the 
theme of the campaign.
In Rwanda, CARMMA was launched on 7th 
October 2009 by the First Lady of Rwanda, 
H.E Mrs. Jeannette Kagame. This high profile 
meeting that brought together key stakeholders 
provided a good entry point towards sustained 
efforts to reduce maternal and newborn deaths in 
Rwanda.
Several high level advocacy initiatives aimed at 
improving maternal and newborn health, have 
taken place in Rwanda led by government. These 
include the launch of the White Ribbon Alliance 
(WRA) in October 2008 by the First Lady of the 
Republic as patron, and the International Con-
ference on Maternal and Child Health in May 
2009 and July 
2010. These 
events have 
reaffirmed the 
Government 
of Rwanda’s 
commitment 
to address-
ing maternal 
mortality and 
morbidity. 
In this regard, 
UNFPA Rwan-
da CO continue 
to support MoH, network of parliamentarians, 
NGOs and Districts to increase awareness in 
ASRH with a complete and integrated pack-
age of information in Reproductive Health and 
Rights, and document and share good practices 
using CARMMA approach.
In Rwanda, the above approach is coupled with 
the White Ribbon Alliance (WRA) Initiative, 
launched in 2009, which aims to complete na-
tional efforts engaged to reduce maternal mortal-
ity and morbidity. A WRA strategic plan (2010 
– 2015) is being implemented.

Rapid SMS in One Pilot District: Be-• 
tween March-May 2010, 432 CHWs 
and 22 supervisors were trained on 
RapidSMS and equiped with teplehones 
for tracking 14,000 expected pregnant 
women over a 12-month period in Mu-
sanze district. During the reporting pe-
riod, 75 % (1783/2,333) of the expected 
pregnancies were registered through 
the RapidSMS system. CHWs reported  
583 births, 115 risks during pregancy 
and no maternal or child death. The DH 
has reported increased ANC attendance 
and facility delivery. 
RapidSMS is a mobile phone alert-• 
based and open-source system used for

cies authorise Community Health Work-
ers (CHWs) to provide condoms, pills, 
injectables and cycle beads. In March/
April 2010, 78 service providers were 
trained as trainers for CBP programme. 
In july 2010, 3,068 CHWs were trained 
in CBP and 64% certified to provide in-
jectable in November. In the first month 
of implementation, 3,263 clients were 
served in the 3 pilot Districts (41% in-
jectables, 32% condoms, 25% pills and 
2% cycle beads). The programme is be-
ing scaling up in 11 additional Districts 
in 2011.

4. Success stories for the year 2010
UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA Joint • 
intervention has increased local re-
source mobilization (procurement 
of  ambulances, piloting Rap-
idSMS in one district, improving 
FP services at community level)
Piloting of RapidSMS in one dis-• 
trict has provided evidence of the 
huge potentials of this innova-
tive technology and has empow-
ered Community health Workers 
(CHWs) through a tool (tele-
phone) that allows them to take 
action on real time  
The involvement of parliamentar-• 
ians in advocating for RHCS has 
increased their awareness on the 
issue of budget allocation to Re-
productive Health by the Govern-
ment
The involvement of parliamentar-• 
ians in voting for and allocation of 
the National Budget, and advocat-
ing for reproductive health com-
modity security is very relevant 
for maternal health improvement 
The existence of the national lo-• 
gistic committee is an efficient 
mechanism for coordinating the 
management of RH commodities
The partnership with FBOs en-• 
hances the promotion of, and utili-
zation of SRH/FP services 
Maternal Death Audit strategy: Scale up verbal autopsy, add neonatal • 
component and  regular M&E 
Obstetric Fistula: enhancement of fistula care programme with emphasis • 
on EmONC and social reinsertion
Skilled birth attendance/midwifery to be improved: Build partnership • 
with training institutions 
CARMMA&WRA: Raising awareness and documentation of good prac-• 
tices to strengthen national 
and decentralized capacities 
in Maternal Health
FP: Continue with procure-• 
ment of contraceptives, and 
scale up vasectomy and 
Community Based Provision 
of Condoms, Cycle bids,  
Pills and Injectables.
Way forward
