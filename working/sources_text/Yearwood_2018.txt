Evidence-informed health policy aims 
to utilize the best available research evi -
dence to inform policy-making (1). This 
approach gained increased attention 
globally after publication of the World 
Health Organization’s seminal report on

ABSTRACT Objective. Health policymakers in the Caribbean face challenges with research use in 
 decision-making. Although copious approaches to strengthen evidence-informed policy can be 
found in the literature, these strategies should be applied and evaluated in specific settings. We 
developed a theory of change for strengthening research uptake in health policy, and the 
 interventions were implemented as the Evidence Informed Decision Making Network of the 
Caribbean (EvIDeNCe). We assessed the model’s logic and evaluated whether the expected 
outcome was achieved.
Methods. The model was mapped in three stages: problem identification; goal  determination; 
and backward linking of interventions. Beneficiaries were surveyed to assess the design logic 
and to evaluate the main outcome.
Results . A total of 137 respondents completed evaluation questionnaires. The  inclusion 
of evidence briefs, stakeholder dialogues, a research database, and training  programs 
for policymakers in the model was validated. Respondents also reported their intention to 
act on research evidence to which they were exposed. After respondents had participated 
in stakeholder dialogues, the mean intention-to-use score was 6.4 on a scale of 
1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), and 6.3 on the same scale, after exposure to 
training.
Conclusions. This work provides initial validation of EvIDeNCe as a consolidated strategy 
to strengthen the application of research in policy in the Caribbean. To our knowledge, it is the 
first study to develop and apply a comprehensive model of this type to the Caribbean. The find-
ings support results from similar initiatives in other countries, but additional work is needed 
to evaluate the overall impact of the initiative.

Original research Yearwood • Research uptake in policy in the Caribbean
reasons advanced for persistence of the 
research-policy gap in health systems 
(3–7). In the Caribbean region, these ex -
planations include poor access to pub -
lished literature; limited capacity for 
knowledge translation and dissemina -
tion; and incongruity between the type 
of research that is produced and the type 
required for decision-making (8–10). 
Many approaches have been sug -
gested for strengthening the application 
of research in health decision-making, 
with interventions having varied effec -
tiveness, depending on the context in 
which they are applied (11–14). Models 
to guide country selection of strategies 
also exist. For example, one makes a dis-
tinction among four types of efforts: 1) 
those by research users to pull for evi -
dence; 2) those made by intermediary 
groups to push evidence towards users; 
3) efforts to facilitate user pull; and 4) ef-
forts to engage the producers and users 
of research in collaborative activities (15). 
This model has been implemented as an 
integrated strategy in settings such as 
Canada (16), Europe (17), Africa (18–20), 
and Latin America (21). Johnson and 
Lavis (22) developed a common logi -
cal framework for evaluating imple -
mentation of this strategy in low- and 
 middle-income countries. They noted, 
however, that more needs to be known 
about the interrelationships in the frame-
work, specifically how different activi -
ties and outputs can be combined, and 
how the framework can be applied in 
different jurisdictional and institutional 
contexts. This paper seeks to address this 
knowledge gap.
The Caribbean Public Health Agency 
(CARPHA) is a regional public health in-
stitution serving 24 Member States in the 
Caribbean. Public policymakers are the 
primary clients of CARPHA. One of 
the challenges faced by these policy -
makers is research utilization in policy. 
A framework to explain the mechanisms 
of change expected to result from imple-
mentation of interventions to address this 
challenge was needed. According to Bre-
uer and colleagues (23), logical frame -
works are limited in their ability to 
explain how various components of a 
program work together in a causal man -
ner to achieve impact. Theory of change 
(ToC), on the other hand, is a more  flexible 
format. ToC describes how a  program, 
through a logical sequence of intermedi -
ate outcomes, can bring about specific 
long-term outcomes. The pathways 
through which interventions work to 
achieve a desired impact are made ex -
plicit. ToC also allows for depiction of 
multiple pathways and feedback loops, 
which is more reflective of the complexi-
ties involved in real-world settings 
(23, 24). The objectives of the study re -
ported in this paper were: i) to develop a 
ToC to narrow the research-policy gap in 
the  Caribbean; ii) to assess its design logic; 
and iii) to evaluate the extent to which the 
main expected outcome was achieved. 
METHODS 
Development of the theory of 
change
Using the approach suggested by the 
World Bank (25) and Morra and Rist (26), 
we constructed the ToC using the follow-
ing steps: i) identification of long-term 
goals; ii) backward mapping and con -
necting the preconditions to achieve 
goals; and iii) identifying interventions 
to generate desired change. Prior to goal 
determination, we also included a prob -
lem identification step, to ensure that the 
model’s expected results were directly 
linked to the problems faced by Carib -
bean policymakers.
To identify long-term goals and map 
preconditions, we searched for pub -
lished and gray literature that investi -
gated application of evidence in 
decision-making in the Caribbean. Two 
pertinent studies were identified (8, 9). 
Seven challenges were common across 
these studies: 1) access to research was 
not systematic or widespread; 2) the dis-
semination of research findings to users 
was less than ideal; 3) the type of re -
search that was being conducted was not 
the type needed to inform decisions; 4) 
national planning and policy-making 
processes provided limited avenues for 
the systematic review of evidence; 5) 
there was little interaction between pro -
ducers and users of research; 6) research 
had a low standing in the list of factors 
deemed important to decisionmakers; 
and 7) policymakers generally lacked ex-
pertise to apply research in decision-
making. We therefore posited that three 
broad changes were needed to address 
these shortcomings: i) relevant evidence 
should be made available to policymak -
ers when needed; ii) the skills of 
 policymakers to apply evidence in the 
policy-making process should be en -
hanced; and iii) policymakers and other 
knowledge users who could inform 
health system changes should be well 
equipped to make, or to advocate for, 
these changes. We further hypothesized 
that these adjustments would stimulate 
knowledge users to act on the available 
evidence. Interventions that could gener-
ate these outcomes were then identified. 
Selection of interventions to generate 
desired change was informed by analy -
sis of published literature on the topic. 
We found that providing research data -
bases was a recognized strategy to facil -
itate user pull, as these resources assisted 
policymakers to efficiently find research 
and increased the likelihood of research 
use (27–29). A promising push strategy 
to answer policymakers’ questions was 
summarizing evidence and highlighting 
messages from systematic reviews 
(28, 30, 31). We found that deliberative 
dialogues were used to foster knowl -
edge exchange between policymakers 
and researchers (30, 32–34). Communi -
ties of practice (18, 35) and capacity-  
building programs (36–38) were also 
used in several settings to support users 
in their pull for research. Based on these 
findings, the following five interven -
tions were identified as appropriate for 
inclusion in the model: i) an electronic 
library of clinical, population health, 
and health systems research (the Evi -
dence Informed Decision Making Net -
work of the Caribbean (EvIDeNCe) 
portal); ii) preparation and dissemina -
tion of research syntheses (evidence 
briefs); iii) deliberative dialogues using 
the best available research evidence 
(stakeholder dialogues); iv) CARPHA-
sponsored training courses for policy -
makers; and v) a community of practice 
for evidence-informed policy.
Assessment of design logic and 
evaluation of expected outcome
Four of the interventions in the initia -
tive were implemented by CARPHA 
during 2014–2017. Due to resource con -
straints, start-up of the community of 
practice was not realized.
We surveyed beneficiaries exposed to 
each intervention, to collect data about 
the plausibility of the hypothesized 
 relationships in the model. We also 
 evaluated whether two interventions 
(stakeholder dialogues and training) 
achieved the main anticipated outcome, 
that is, the intention to act on presented 
evidence.

Yearwood • Research uptake in policy in the Caribbean Original research
For the EvIDeNCe portal survey, 
 beneficiaries were purposefully selected 
from CARPHA’s stakeholders who re -
flected the portal’s main target audiences 
(i.e., policymakers at ministries of 
health, CARPHA staff, professionals in 
health-related civil society organizations, 
and researchers). They were sent a link to 
an online survey, which included ques -
tions about the value of the portal, the 
usefulness of its search features in assist-
ing users to build a search relevant to 
their needs, and users’ perception of its 
ability to improve job efficiency and 
 effectiveness. Feedback was measured 
on a 5-point Likert scale. Development, 
pilot testing, and refinement of the data 
 collection instrument was done under 
guidance of the EvIDeNCe portal proj -
ect team, which consisted of technical 
staff from the Pan American Health 
 Organization/World Health Organiza -
tion (PAHO/WHO), the University of 
the West Indies, and CARPHA. 
For surveys on evidence briefs and 
stakeholder dialogues, we followed the 
methodology used by Moat et al. (30) 
and Lavis et al. (39). Three stakeholder 
dialogues were convened using evidence 
briefs that were circulated to participants 
approximately two weeks in advance of 
the dialogue. Each dialogue included 17 
to 19 participants, chosen from policy, 
 research, and other stakeholder commu -
nities. A steering committee comprised 
of policymakers, researchers, and other 
stakeholders selected the participants 
based on two criteria. The first was that 
they would be able to articulate views 
and experiences about the issue under 
discussion, while constructively engag -
ing with others. The second was that 
they would be able to champion, within 
their respective constituencies, actions to 
address the policy challenges. 
All participants attending stake -
holder dialogues received evidence 
briefs and evidence brief evaluation 
questionnaires prior to the dialogue. 
They also received stakeholder dia -
logue evaluation questionnaires at the 
end of each deliberation. We used the 
instruments developed and tested by 
Moat et al. (30) and Lavis et al. (39). 
Three types of questions were included: 
i) how well beneficiaries felt briefs or 
dialogues achieved their intended pur -
pose; ii) how helpful the beneficiaries 
found the design characteristics of these 
two mechanisms; and iii) a question 
about beneficiaries’ intention to use the 
evidence presented. All responses were 
measured on a 7-point Likert scale. 
For the training component, CARPHA 
Member States were invited to nominate 
individuals to participate in a combined 
online and face-to-face training work -
shop. Eleven individuals whose main 
responsibility was health policy and 
planning were nominated. All beneficia -
ries of the training received evaluation 
questionnaires that rated: i) their overall 
assessment of the course; ii) whether 
the course enhanced their skills in  finding 
and using research evidence; and iii) their 
intention to use the type of research pre -
sented during the training. Responses 
were measured on a 7-point Likert scale. 
Data analysis 
In total, 164 respondents received eval-
uation questionnaires: 49 evidence briefs; 
50 EvIDeNCe portal; 11 training evalua -
tion; and 54 stakeholder dialogue. The 
respective response rates were 85.7%, 
72.0%, 100.0%, and 88.9%. 
We calculated the mean scores on the 
Likert scales for all questions. To assess 
the model’s design logic, we analyzed re-
sponses to questions about the intended 
objectives of each intervention. Since the 
EvIDeNCe portal was expected to in -
crease availability of relevant evidence, 
we analyzed mean scores for five ques -
tions about the usefulness of the portal’s 
search features in helping to build a suit-
able search. Evidence briefs were ex -
pected to increase availability of relevant 
evidence, and to contribute to stake -
holder dialogues. Beneficiaries’ feedback 
about how well the briefs achieved this 
purpose was examined. We also consid -
ered views about the design features of 
the briefs. Similarly, stakeholder dia -
logues were expected to equip partici -
pants to make or to advocate for 
evidence-informed change. How well 
the dialogue supported a full discussion 
of issues was considered, along with 
feedback about the dialogue’s design 
features. Finally, the training interven -
tion was intended to enhance partici -
pants’ knowledge and skills. Responses 
to three questions about finding and ap -
plying evidence in policy-making were 
investigated.
The key expected outcome from im -
plementation of the EvIDeNCe initiative 
was the intention to act. We evaluated 
whether this was achieved after partici -
pation in stakeholder dialogues and 
exposure to training, by examining the 
responses to the “intention to use” ques-
tion. For stakeholder dialogues, we also 
compared the mean intention-to-use 
scores, for public policymakers working 
in government and in regional agencies. 
RESULTS
The ToC diagram (Figure 1) shows the 
relationships among inputs, activities, 
and outputs for each intervention, and 
across interventions. These interventions 
were collectively implemented by CAR -
PHA, under the umbrella of the EvI -
DeNCe. Table 1 summarizes the survey 
results.
All interventions were assessed in 
 relation to their intended objectives. 
 Evidence briefs achieved the purpose as 
a product to present available research 
evidence, and for use in stakeholder dia-
logues. The mean score was 6.6 on a scale 
of 1 (fail) to 7 (achieved). These briefs 
summarized findings from systematic re-
views and Caribbean research, contextu-
alized the evidence by outlining the 
political and socioeconomic relevance, 
and included considerations for imple -
mentation to guide users. These charac -
teristics were among the highest rated by 
the beneficiaries, in terms of their help -
fulness. Stakeholder dialogues, when 
combined with evidence briefs, achieved 
the purpose as a mechanism to support a 
full discussion of policy issues. The mean 
score was 6.6 on a scale of 1 (fail) to 7 
(achieved). Providing an opportunity for 
frank deliberation and engaging a facili -
tator to assist with the deliberation were 
prominent features contributing to the 
usefulness of this mechanism. Beneficia -
ries agreed that the EvIDeNCe portal 
would enhance job effectiveness and effi-
ciency. Three key features of the portal, 
designed to assist beneficiaries to build a 
relevant search, received the highest rat -
ings: i) the ability to search for research in 
different languages spoken in the Carib -
bean; ii) the availability of full text; and 
iii) the ability to narrow a search by Ca -
ribbean country of interest. Policymakers 
also agreed that the training course en -
hanced knowledge of sources of research 
evidence, with a mean score of 6.7 on 
scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly 
agree). The course also enhanced skills in 
searching for research, with a mean score 
of 6.3 on the same scale.
Beneficiaries’ intention to act on  
presented research was a key expected

outcome. Stakeholder  dialogues resulted 
in the production of three outputs (a 
 dialogue summary, a topic overview, and 
a commitment-to-act form), which in -
cluded clear statements of the partici -
pants’ intention to use the evidence in 
policy briefings, policy decisions, or ad -
vocacy. (These qualitative findings are 
not reported here.) The intention to act 
was also reported quantitatively. Over -
all, the mean response for all dialogue 
participants was 6.4 on a scale of 1 
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). 
Participants who were policymakers in 
government or in regional agencies re -
ported a slightly higher preference, with 
a mean score of 6.6 for both groups. 
 Beneficiaries of the training course also 
signaled their intention to act on the 
 research evidence to which they were 
 exposed, with an overall mean score of 
6.3 on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 
(strongly agree).
DISCUSSION
This study has shown that the barriers 
faced with research utilization in deci -
sion-making in the Caribbean can be 
 precisely addressed through a portfolio 
of interventions incorporated into a 
 single cohesive program. The logical 
pathway linking each intervention to the 
desired change in decision-making was 
demonstrated. Surveys of beneficiaries 
validated the inclusion of four of the 
 interventions in the model: i)  EvIDeNCe 
portal research database; ii) evidence 
briefs; iii) stakeholder  dialogues; and 
iv) training for policymakers. Two inter -
ventions (stakeholder dialogues using 
evidence briefs, and training) achieved 
the key desired outcome, namely, the in-
tention to act on available research.
The design characteristics of the in -
cluded interventions were instrumen -
tal. Policymakers need context-specific 
evidence to support their decision-
making. The EvIDeNCe portal database 
allowed users to focus a search on a 
specific Caribbean country or group of 
countries and a particular language 
spoken in the region. These features 
were viewed by beneficiaries as help -
ful. Evidence briefs presented evidence 
on important topics while also consid -
ering the political and socioeconomic 
environment. This, along with the op -
portunity to hold a frank off-the-record 
deliberation, was also viewed by bene -
ficiaries as very useful. 
The findings of this study are similar 
to those conducted in other countries. 
Evaluations of evidence briefs and delib-
erative dialogues used in Africa (20, 30) 
and Canada (39) have shown that partic-
ipants respond in a similar manner when 
asked about the usefulness of these 
mechanisms. The integrated approach 
adopted by the EvIDeNCe initiative is 
also in alignment with knowledge 
 translation platforms (KTPs), such as the 
Evidence-Informed Policy Network 
(EVIPNet), which is implemented in Af -
rica, Europe, and Latin America. The ac -
tivities included in the EvIDeNCe 
initiative are similar to those undertaken 
by EVIPNet teams (20, 21, 40), with the 
exception of a Rapid Response Service, 
which was not included in EvIDeNCe. 
Two main institutional differences can 
also be observed. Firstly, KTPs are usu -
ally hosted in universities, hospitals, or 
ministries of health (41). The EvIDeNCe 
initiative is, however, located in a re -
gional public health agency. Secondly, 
the work of KTPs tends to be coun -
try-specific, while CARPHA’s EvIDeNCe 
addresses issues relevant to the health 
systems across an entire region. It would 
therefore be important to understand, 
through future research, how this differ-
ence in governance arrangement and 
 activity scope impacts operations and 
sustainability. 
Our study has several strengths. It is 
the first to develop and apply a compre -
hensive framework for development and 
evaluation of interventions to strengthen 
the use of evidence in decision-making 
in the Caribbean region. It contributes 
theoretical and empirical knowledge on 
the activities and outputs that can be 
combined to support evidence-informed 
decision-making in this geographical 
and institutional context. It links the lit -
erature about the specific problems faced 
in the Caribbean region to program de -
sign. By using ToC instead of the logical 
framework, it depicts how the required 
change process can be logically brought 
about through the interrelated elements 
of the program.
Despite these strengths, the limitations 
of the work should also be acknowl -
edged. Firstly, the study is a formative 
assessment that signals the change pro -
cess possible, using the strategies identi -
fied. We did not evaluate all outcomes 
included in the model. Although the in -
tention to use evidence in decision- 
making is an important and measurable 
outcome, some attempt should be made 
to determine whether the other expected 
outcomes were also achieved. This 
would include determining whether 
the portal actually increased evidence 
availability, and whether policymakers 
and stakeholders were indeed better 
equipped to make evidence-informed 
decisions. We did not evaluate the con -
solidated initiative by using a composite 
data collection instrument. Therefore, 
until this further evaluative work is 
done, we are unable to draw conclusions 
about the overall impact. Secondly, the 
model rests upon several critical as -
sumptions. For example, we have as -
sumed the absence of access barriers to 
electronic resources. The validity of these 
assumptions would have to be verified. 
Conclusion
This work developed a theory of 
change to narrow the research-policy 
gap in the Caribbean. The model’s de -
sign logic was validated by beneficiaries, 
who gave positive ratings to the overall 
purpose and usefulness of four of the 
 included interventions. The ability of 
two of these interventions (stakeholder 
 dialogues using evidence briefs, and ca -

Policy recommendations
While the results are promising, con -
sideration could be given to incorporat -
ing a Rapid Response Service in the 
EvIDeNCe model. Such a service would 
provide research syntheses to policy -
makers, at their request, in a relatively 
short time frame. It was reported in Chile 
that this service is widely used and 
highly valued by ministry of health offi -
cials (21). However, because the EvI -
DeNCe initiative serves a region and not 
a country, the operation of such a service 
would have to be carefully managed and 
the required resources made available. 
One possible approach could be to build 
the capacity of country teams to support 
implementation. 
A consolidated indicator framework 
should also be developed to monitor 
the reality of progress in research 
 utilization in policy. We recommend a 
high-level framework for use in the Ca -
ribbean ( Table 2), although it could be ap-
plied elsewhere. The indicators in this

Yearwood • Research uptake in policy in the Caribbean Original research
framework span the four strategic areas 
included in the ToC model. Monitoring 
them would require collection of baseline 
data and intermittent surveys of policy -
makers. This framework can be imple -
mented by the Caribbean Community 
Secretariat, as part of the monitoring and 
evaluation process for the Caribbean Co-
operation in Health (CCH). CCH facili -
tates coordinated action and collaboration 
among partners for health in the region, 
and that initiative clearly articulates the 
desire to enhance regional capacity to 
generate and use quality evidence for ef-
fective policy and programming. 
Acknowledgments and funding. The 
EvIDeNCe initiative was developed with 
the support of the McMaster Health Fo -
rum, which provided the methodological 
approach for evidence briefs and stake -
holder dialogues; conducted training on 
finding and using research evidence; de-
signed the survey instruments for evaluat-
ing these components; and developed the 
scoping document for the EvIDeNCe 
 portal. PAHO/WHO provided financial 
support for stakeholder dialogues and 
completed the developmental work for the 
portal. The University of the West Indies 
MedCarib interface supports uploading of 
published and gray literature. We also 
thank the students from McMaster Uni -
versity who assisted with data entry and 
analysis and the graphic work presented 
here. We also acknowledge all the persons 
who reviewed and provided comments on 
 earlier versions of the manuscript.

Yearwood • Research uptake in policy in the Caribbean Original research
RESUMEN Objetivo. Los responsables de las políticas de salud en el Caribe afrontan retos con 
respecto al uso de la investigación en la toma de decisiones. Si bien en la bibliografía 
especializada pueden encontrarse estrategias muy diversas para fortalecer las políti -
cas fundamentadas en la evidencia, dichas estrategias deben aplicarse y evaluarse 
en entornos específicos. Elaboramos una teoría del cambio para fortalecer la incor -
poración de la investigación en las políticas de salud, y las intervenciones se eje -
cutaron en la Red de Toma de Decisiones Basadas en Evidencia del Caribe (conocida 
como EvIDeNCe). Evaluamos la lógica del modelo y también si se alcanzó el resul -
tado previsto.
Métodos. El modelo se proyectó en tres etapas: determinación de los problemas, 
establecimiento de las metas y vinculación retrospectiva de las intervenciones. Se rea-
lizaron encuestas a los beneficiarios para evaluar tanto la lógica de diseño como el 
resultado principal.
Resultados. Un total de 137 encuestados respondió los cuestionarios de evaluación. 
Se validó la inclusión en el modelo de sinopsis de datos científicos, diálogos entre los 
interesados directos, una base de datos de investigación y programas de capacitación 
para los responsables de las políticas. Los encuestados también informaron sobre su 
intención de actuar en respuesta a los resultados de la investigación a los que estu-
vieron expuestos. Después de que los encuestados participaron en los diálogos entre 
interesados directos, la puntuación media de la intención de usar la investigación fue 
de 6,4 en una escala de 1 (totalmente en desacuerdo) a 7 (totalmente de acuerdo), y 
después de exponerse a una capacitación, de 6,3 en la misma escala. 
Conclusiones. Este trabajo arroja una validación inicial de EvIDeNCe como una 
estrategia consolidada para fortalecer la aplicación de la investigación en las políticas 
en el Caribe. Hasta donde sabemos, es el primer estudio que ha elaborado y aplicado 
un modelo integral de este tipo en el Caribe. Los resultados apoyan las observaciones 
de iniciativas similares en otros países, pero hace falta seguir trabajando para evaluar 
las repercusiones más amplias de la iniciativa.

RESUMO Objetivo. Os responsáveis pelas políticas de saúde no Caribe enfrentam desafios no 
uso de pesquisa na tomada de decisão. Apesar de a literatura oferecer uma abundân-
cia de enfoques para reforçar políticas informadas por evidências, essas estratégias 
devem ser aplicadas e avaliadas em contextos específicos. Foi formulada uma teoria 
de mudança para reforçar a incorporação de pesquisa em políticas de saúde, sendo 
implementadas intervenções como a Rede de tomada de decisão informada por evi -
dências do Caribe (EvIDeNCe). Foi avaliada a lógica do modelo e analisado se o resul-
tado esperado foi alcançado.
Métodos. O modelo foi traçado em três estágios: identificação de problemas, deter -
minação de metas e ligação regressiva de intervenções. Foi aplicada uma pesquisa aos 
beneficiários para avaliar a lógica do design e analisar o resultado principal.
Resultados. Ao todo, 137 participantes responderam os questionários de avaliação. 
Foi validada a inclusão no modelo de informes de evidências, diálogos de interessa -
dos diretos, uma base de dados de pesquisa e programas de formação profissional 
para os responsáveis pelas políticas. Os participantes também informaram a intenção 
de proceder segundo as evidências de pesquisas às quais tiveram conhecimento. Após 
tomarem parte em diálogos de interessados diretos, a pontuação média de intenção de 
uso dos participantes foi 6,4 (em uma escala de 1 [discordo totalmente] a 7 [concordo 
plenamente]) e 6,3 após o treinamento.
Conclusões. Este estudo proporciona a validação inicial da rede EvIDeNCe como 
uma estratégia consolidada para reforçar a aplicação de pesquisa em políticas no 
Caribe. Ao que nos consta, trata-se do primeiro estudo a formular e aplicar um modelo 
completo deste tipo no Caribe. Os achados ajudam a respaldar os resultados de inicia-
tivas semelhantes em outros países, porém outros estudos são necessários para avaliar 
o impacto geral da iniciativa.
