SYSTEMATIC REVIEW Open Access
Building capacity in dissemination and
implementation science: a systematic
review of the academic literature on
teaching and training initiatives
Rachel Davis 1* and Danielle D ’Lima2
Abstract
Background: The field of dissemination and implementation (D&I) science has grown significantly over recent
years. Alongside this, an increased demand for training in D&I from researchers and implementers has been seen.
Research describing and evaluating D&I training opportunities, referred to here as ‘capacity building initiatives ’
(CBIs), can help provide an understanding of different methods of training as well as training successes and
challenges. However, to gain a more detailed understanding of the evidence-base and how D&I CBIs are being
reported in publications, a field-wide examination of the academic literature is required.
Methods: Systematic review to identify the type and range of D &I CBIs discussed and/or appraised in the academic
literature. EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO were searched between January 2006 and November 2019. Articles were
included if they reported on a D&I CBI that was developed by the authors (of each of the included articles) or the author ’s
host institution. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and extracted data using a standardised form.
Results:Thirty-one articles (from a total of 4 181) were included. From these, 41 distinct D&I CBIs were identified which
focussed on different contexts and professions, from 8 countries across the world. CBIs ranged from short courses to
training institutes to being part of academic programmes. Nearly half were delivered face-face with the remainder
delivered remotely or using a blended format. CBIs often stipulat ed specific eligibility criteria, strict application processes
and/or were oversubscribed. Variabilities in the way in whic h the D&I CBIs were reported and/or evaluated were evident.
Conclusions:Increasing the number of training opportunities, as well as broadening their reach (to a wider range of
learners), would help address the recognised deficit in D&I training. Standardisation in the reporting of D&I CBIs would
enable the D&I community to better understand the findings ac ross different contexts and sci entific professions so that
training gaps can be identified and overcome. More detailed examination of publications on D&I CBIs as well as the wider
literature on capacity building would be of significant merit to the field.

Introduction
The failure to optimally use research to improve popula-
tion outcomes and reduce service inefficiencies is an
endemic challenge to health and social care systems
worldwide [ 1– 3]. A critical and acknowledged issue is
the considerable gap between what we know we should
be doing based on the evidence, versus what gets
implemented in healthcare settings [ 3, 4]. Dissemination
and implementation science (referred to hereon in, as
‘D&I’) investigates ways to close ‘research to practice ’
gaps ( ‘implementation science ’) and spread knowledge
and information to practice settings ( ‘dissemination
science’)[ 5, 6].
The critical role of D&I in enhancing the application
of evidence-based interventions has led to the disci-
pline’s rapid advancement in recent years [ 7, 8]. Sig-
nificant steps have been taken to build D&I capacity
(defined as ‘a process which leads to greater individual,
organisation or system capabilities to conduct and im-
plement high-quality research and practice ’[9– 12]) in
recognition that a robust and sustainable workforce is
required to successfully implement or maintain health
and social care interventions of known effectiveness
[13, 14].
Efforts to build capacity in D&I take many forms
[15– 18]. In the USA, as early as 1998, research orga-
nisations and initiatives were established (e.g. the Vet-
erans Health Administration ‘Quality Enhancement
Research Initiative ’ (QUERI) [ 19– 21]), with the aim of
investigating ways to efficiently implement research-
driven best practices. Academic and government insti-
tutions, centres and departments dedicated to the
field have since been created in the USA [ 22– 26],
Canada [ 27, 28], Australia [ 29, 30], the UK [ 31, 32]
and other countries [ 33– 35]a sw e l la sg l o b a le f f o r t s
[36]. Opportunities for D&I funding are increasingly
available [7, 37–39], professional societies and groups have
been set up [ 40–42] and there are a growing number of
scientific conferences and meetings [ 43–47]. In 2006, the
specialist journal ‘Implementation Science’was born and,
in 2019, the inception of its companion journal ( Imple-
mentation Science & Communications )a sw e l la ss e v e r a l
other journals and libraries that have developed over the
years (e.g. the Cochrane library) that publish D&I-related
research [7].
Alongside these efforts, another very important way to
build D&I capacity is through the development and
delivery of teaching and training initiatives — referred to
hereon in as ‘capacity building initiatives ’ (CBIs). These
endeavours may be aimed at individuals conducting
research (i.e. ‘researchers’), those faced with translating
evidence into practice (i.e. ‘implementers’)[ 15– 18]o r
those tasked with training others in D&I principles and
methodologies (i.e. ‘educators’). Such training endeav-
ours include short courses, workshops and webinars or
they may form part of academic programmes [ 16– 18,
46– 49]— all of these can be important in ensuring indi-
viduals have the requisite knowledge and skill-set to suc-
cessfully implement scientific discoveries across diverse
populations [ 14– 17, 50, 51]. Given the value of D&I
CBIs, it is of interest to examine the type and range of
training opportunities available [ 15– 18] and how these
extend to a wide range of individuals (implementers,
researchers and educators) [ 14, 17, 52– 56].
In 2015, Implementation Science expressed a renewed
interest in research describing and critically appraising
D&I training initiatives [ 52]. Since this editorial, several
descriptive and/or evaluative articles on D&I CBIs have
been published [ 18, 47, 49, 57, 58], but for those working
in D&I to gain a more detailed understanding of the
evidence-base, a field-wide perspective of the published
literature is required [ 59]. A useful starting point to ad-
dress this gap is through the review and documentation
of D&I CBIs that have been written up in the academic
literature. Examining the way in which training endeav-
ours are reported can help highlight variabilities in
reporting and enable comparisons of different CBIs
against set criteria (e.g. mode of delivery, duration, target
audience) so that gaps in training (and the reporting of
training) can be identified.
To date, several articles published between 2013 and
2019 have reviewed (at least in part) D&I CBIs and re-
sources, specifically related to teaching and training. In
2013, an article that focussed on developing the next
generation of implementation researchers highlighted
selected D&I training programmes, conferences and
resources [ 55]. In 2017, a mapping exercise of D&I re-
search training initiatives, stemming from the National
Institute of Health ’s 2013 meeting on training, measure-
ment and reporting was published — comprising training
institutes, academic programmes and courses, webinars
and career development awards [ 17]. In the same year,
an expert assessment on training opportunities in D&I
was documented [ 59] together with a content analysis of

D&I resources using public, web-based information [ 60].
More recently (in 2018 – 2019), studies have identified
D&I training initiatives to help inform medical education
[61], training needs in public health [ 62] and mental
health [ 16], and a review of online D&I resources was
performed [ 63]. Taking this evidence collectively, the
value of D&I CBIs in developing and harnessing skills in
implementation research and evidence translation can
be seen. Taking the evidence individually, however, most
of the research is geographically restrictive, focussing
only on D&I CBIs in the USA [ 59] or the USA and/or
Canada [ 16, 55, 61, 63]. While one paper considered
D&I training efforts on a global level [ 62], this was not
the main aim of the work, and thus, information on the
characteristics of the CBIs and gaps in training needs
were understandably limited.
With these thoughts in mind and heeding the call
from Implementation Science on the need for publica-
tions on D&I CBIs [ 52], we present the findings of a sys-
tematic review aimed at identifying the type and range
of D&I training opportunities reported in the academic
literature. This review is part of a larger programme of
work aimed at describing and appraising D&I CBIs. The
aim of this paper is to provide a detailed description of
our review methodology and a high-level summary of
the main features and characteristics of the training
initiatives and how these are reported. We also reflect
on the implications of our findings and put forward rec-
ommendations on the future reporting of CBIs in the
context of D&I science.
Methods
Search strategy
EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched
(using the OVID interface) for relevant articles published
between January 2006 and November 2019. The cut-off
point was set at 2006 in line with the inception of imple-
mentation science [64]— where most of the relevant arti-
cles identified in our initial scoping of the literature
were published. The search strategy was informed by
several reviews and discussion papers on D&I-related
terms [ 65– 69] together with a brainstorming exercise in-
volving both authors (RD, DD) to generate applicable
terminology. Terms relating to (1) implementation sci-
ence (e.g. ‘knowledge translation ’, ‘implementation re-
search’) and (2) teaching and training (e.g. ‘capacity
building’, ‘curriculum’) were included. To avoid a priori
assumptions on the type of content (i.e. topics) the CBIs
may cover, the search strategy was restricted to generic
terms relating to D&I (e.g. ‘implementation science ’)
rather than specific terms that focussed on D&I method-
ologies or concepts (e.g. ‘hybrid designs ’ [70],
‘implementation outcomes ’ [71], or theories and frame-
works, e.g. ‘Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research’ [72]). To tighten the search specificity, the
search strategy was customised using appropriate wild-
cards (e.g. course$) and Boolean operators (i.e. OR,
AND), and restricted to titles and abstracts. The sensi-
tivity of the search was assessed by forward and back-
ward citation searching of included articles and through
handsearching key implementation and behavioural sci-
ence journals (e.g. Implementation Science, Translational
Behavioural Medicine ). The final search was conducted
on 21st November 2019 (see Table 1 for a full list of
search terms).
Inclusion criteria
At the first stage of screening (title and abstract), any
empirical or review article that discussed CBIs in D&I
and/or related areas (e.g. ‘improvement science ’, ‘quality
improvement’, ‘translational research ’) in the context of
teaching or training was included. At the second stage of
screening (full text), tighter restrictions applied. Articles
whereby authors discussed or appraised (as a primary or
secondary focus) a D&I CBI they (or their host institu-
tion) developed were included — this comprised CBIs
where the whole focus of the training was on D&I (e.g. a
D&I workshop) or only part of the focus (e.g. a D&I
module that formed part of a larger postgraduate
programme in public health). Articles were not re-
stricted based on their methodological focus — in other
words, we included all D&I CBIs that met our inclusion
criteria, irrespective of the type of information provided
on the D&I CBI or the level of detail.
Exclusion criteria
Dissertations and doctoral theses, books/book reviews,
conference posters/presentations and editorials/com-
mentaries were excluded, as were articles not in English.
Review papers were excluded following citation search-
ing for relevant articles, as were articles that focussed on
training in other areas of healthcare improvement (e.g.
patient safety or quality improvement) if they did not in-
clude an element of D&I within the training (e.g. [ 73,
74]). Articles were also excluded if they: described D&I-
related conferences or conference proceedings (e.g. [ 56,
75, 76]) unless there was a specific D&I CBI within the
conference (e.g. workshop) that delegates could register
for, examined how D&I methodologies or knowledge
translation techniques could be used to better imple-
ment training programmes [ 77] or training centres [ 78]
without the focus of the training itself being on D&I and
assessed D&I training needs [ 14, 55, 79] or competencies
in D&I [ 80] or discussed the development of D&I-
related research centres [ 21] without reference to a
specific D&I CBI. Equally, articles that provided an over-
view of a meeting(s) to discuss how to advance the field
of D&I [ 81, 82], focussed on the development of
Davis and D ’Lima Implementation Science           (2020) 15:97 Page 3 of 26
<<<PAGE=4>>>
collaboratives to encourage new research partnerships
[83], presented general repositories for D&I resources or
training opportunities [ 60, 63] or calls from journals for
work relating to D&I CBIs [ 23] were excluded.
Finally, articles that focussed on the development of
training programmes for mentors working in transla-
tional science [ 84, 85] were excluded unless the content
of the mentoring was on D&I science (versus more gen-
erally on how to be an effective mentor), as were those
that explored mentoring approaches as a way of assisting
knowledge translation without actually discussing a
D&I-related mentoring scheme [ 86].
Screening of articles
Articles were screened for relevance by the lead author
(RD). The second author (DD) independently screened a
random selection of 20% of the articles at the first stage
of screening (title and abstract) and 100% at the second
stage (full text). Discrepancies were resolved through
discussions between the authors until consensus was
reached.
Data extraction
A standardised form was developed to extract data from
the included articles and to help synthesise the data in
the review. The ‘Template for Intervention Description
and Replication ’ (TIDieR) checklist [ 87] was used as a
starting point to see which items in the checklist would
be of relevance to review aims — the TIDieR specifies the
clear reporting of interventions (in our context ‘training
interventions’). Additional criteria of potential relevance
were identified by the lead author (RD) and agreed by
the second author (DD) by searching google scholar,
electronic databases (e.g. PUBMED) and consulting with
the Equator network website for relevant guidelines
(https://www.equator-network.org/). Operational defini-
tions for each criterion were developed and tested across
all included articles to ensure reliability, validity and
consistency in the data extraction process (see Suppl. file
1 for data extraction form).
For articles where authors discussed more than one
D&I CBI they had developed (i.e. they presented a suite
of D&I CBIs that were independent of one another, such
as workshops or postgraduate courses), data was ex-
tracted on each CBI separately. Data was extracted by
both authors (RD, DD) across all articles to ensure
consistency and accuracy in the reporting of findings.
Quality assessment
The eligibility criteria for articles in our review led to
the inclusion of heterogenous research in terms of aims
and methodological focus. It was deemed inappropriate
therefore to appraise the methodological quality of the
articles. Instead, we used the data extraction form
(Suppl. file 1) to describe key characteristics of the D&I
CBIs, delineate commonalities and differences between
these and highlight key learnings when taking the evi-
dence collectively.
Results
Search results
The search retrieved 5564 articles, with a total of 4181
remaining after the removal of duplicates ( N = 1383). A
further 3938 articles were excluded at the title and ab-
stract stage, resulting in 243 full-text articles assessed for
eligibility. Of these, 212/243 articles were disregarded
(see Fig. 1 for reasons), leaving 31 articles relevant for
inclusion.
There was a high level of agreement (> 90%) regarding
inclusion between the reviewers (RD and DD) at both
stages of screening, with disagreements quickly and eas-
ily resolved.
Key characteristics of included articles
Articles spanned a 13-year period (2006 – 2019) with the
majority published during or post 2014 ( N = 21) [ 18, 47,

57, 58, 62, 88– 103] and 10 articles published pre 2014
(N = 10) [ 48, 49, 104– 111]. Publications originated from
8 countries: the USA ( N = 21) [ 18, 48, 57, 58, 62, 88– 90,
92– 96, 98– 101, 103, 104, 108, 109], Canada ( N =3 )
[106, 107, 110], Australia ( N =2 )[ 49, 91], the UK ( N =
1) [ 105], Sweden ( N =1 )[ 47], Kenya ( N =1 )[ 97],
Germany ( N =1 )[ 102] and Saudi Arabi ( N =1 )[ 111].
Articles reporting on the same CBI
Most of the articles ( N =2 7 )[ 47– 49, 57, 58, 62, 88, 89,
91– 103, 105– 109, 111] reported on just one CBI, with
the remaining articles ( N =4 )[ 18, 90, 104, 110] discuss-
ing between 2 and 10 different D&I CBIs. Four CBIs
were the focus of more than one article, including the
Implementation Research Institute (IRI) (mentioned in 4
articles) [ 18a, 57, 92, 109], the Knowledge Translation
Summer Institute (KTSI) (mentioned in 3 articles) [ 106,
107, 110c], the Mentored Training for Dissemination
and Implementation Research in Cancer (MT-DIRC)
(mentioned in 2 articles) [ 18b, 98] and the Training in
Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health
(TIDIRH) (mentioned in 2 articles) [ 48, 103]. Consider-
ing the articles separately, 48 CBIs were reported, but
taking the articles collectively, accounting for those CBIs
that were reported in more than one article, 41 distinct
CBIs were reported (across the 31 included articles).
Key characteristics of the included D&I CBIs
For the remainder of the results, findings are presented
in relation to the number of included D&I CBIs ( N =
41). Where CBIs are discussed in multiple articles (e.g.
data is drawn from two articles on the TIDIRH) [ 48,
103], this is reflected in the number of references
accompanying each finding.
Of the 41 D&I CBIs identified, a range of ‘types’of train-
ing (as defined by the authors of each of the included arti-
cles) were reported including training Institutes ( N =4 )
[18a, 48, 57, 92, 103, 106, 107, 109, 110c] or courses that

training initiatives ( N =1 )[ 99]; workshops ( N =4 )[ 49, 93,
95, 111], seminars ( N =3 )[ 90a, 110a,b], clerkships ( N =1 )
[88], mentorship programmes ( N =1 )[ 90b], graduate cer-
tificates ( N =1 )[ 89], webinars ( N =1 )[ 90c], fellowship
programmes ( N =1 )[ 97], master ’s programmes ( N =1 )
[102] or modules that have been integrated in master ’s
programmes— including clinical research ( N =1 )[ 104a]
p r i m a r yh e a l t hc a r e(N =1 )[ 105] and public health ( N =
1) [ 62]; or PhD programmes ( N =1 )[ 94] or modules that
are integrated as part of a Doctors of Nursing programme
(N =2 )[ 101, 108]. The 15 remaining CBIs were termed
by the authors as ‘courses’relating (in part or in full) to
D&I science [ 18c,d, 47, 58, 91, 96, 104b,c, 110d-k].
Fourteen CBIs were delivered face-face [ 47–49, 88, 91,
95, 100–104a, 106, 107, 110a-c,i,k, 111], 7 were delivered re-
motely (either online, over the phone or through video-
conferencing) [ 62, 90a-c, 105, 110a,b], 8 were blended —
employing F-F and remoted-based methods [ 18a,b, 57, 58,
89, 92, 96–98, 108, 109], 4 were delivered either F-F or re-
motely (i.e. individuals picked one mode of delivery) [ 93,
110e,f,h] and for the remainder, it was not reported/not clear
(N =8 )[ 18c,d, 94, 104b,c, 110d,g,j]. CBIs ranged in length
from hours [ 93], day(s) [ 49, 91, 106, 107, 110g], week(s) [11,
48, 103], month(s) [ 47, 58, 88, 96, 108] to years [ 18a,b, 57,
89, 92, 97–99, 102, 109].
Tables 2 and 3 provide further information on some of
the key selected characteristics of the included CBIs.
Eligibility criteria and application process
The majority of CBIs were aimed at individuals who had
undertaken or were undertaking a postgraduate qualifica-
tion ( N =1 2 )[ 62, 89, 95–97, 102, 104a, 105, 110a-g], and
to a lesser extent, doctoral/postdoctoral ( N =1 0)[ 18a,b,
47, 48, 57, 92, 94, 98, 101, 103, 106–109]o ru n d e r g r a d u a t e
level individuals ( N =1 )[ 88]. For the remaining CBIs ( N =
18 CBIs) [ 18c,d, 49, 58, 90a-c, 91, 93, 99, 100, 104a,b, 110i,k,
111], it was not reported. CBIs were run through aca-
demic institutions ( N =2 2 )[ 18a-d, 47, 57, 62, 88, 89, 100–
102, 104a-c, 108, 109, 111, 91–98] or healthcare organisa-
tions/institutions working in D&I-related areas ( N =1 7 )
[48, 58, 90a-c, 99, 103, 106, 107, 110a-k]a n dt oal e s s e re x -
tent through D&I-related collaboratives ( N =2 )[ 49, 93].
Seventeen of the CBIs focussed the training towards a
specific context, including cancer ( N =4)[ 18b, 90a-c, 98],
public or global health ( N =4 )[ 2, 91, 94, 96], nursing ( N
=2 )[ 101, 108], behavioural health (2) [ 89, 100], cardiology
(N =1 )[ 88], family medicine ( N =1 )[ 111], mental health
(N =1 )[ 18a, 57, 92, 109], dementia ( N =1 )[ 49] and pri-
mary care ( N =1 )[ 105]. The remaining CBIs were either
not restricted to a heath or social care setting ( N =2 2 )
[47, 48, 58, 93, 95, 97, 99, 102–104a-c, 107, 110a-k]o ri t
was not reported ( N = 2 CBIs) [ 18c,d]. Most of the CBIs
were aimed at multiple professions( N =3 3 )[ 18a,d, 47–49,
57, 58, 62, 90a-c, 91, 92, 95–100, 102– 104a-c, 105–107,
109, 110a-k] with fewer confined to specific groups of indi-
viduals, including medical students or medics ( N =2 )[ 88,
111]o rn u r s e s( N =2 )[ 101, 108]: for the remainder, it
was not reported ( N =4 )[ 18c,d, 93, 94].
Ten of the CBIs provided information on the applica-
tion and selection process. This ranged from individuals
taking a formative assessment to ensure they had the
requisite knowledge and skills in evidence-based medi-
cine [ 111]; providing evidence that they had not received
major research funding in D&I research before [ 48];
writing a 1.5 – 2 page concept paper describing a D&I re-
search project they would like to undertake as part of
the training [ 48, 57, 98, 109]; detailing prior experience
with implementation and/or health science research [ 48,
57, 58, 102]; producing a cover letter or statement to
demonstrate a motivation to undertake the CBI, pursue
a career in D&I and/or their long-term research agenda
[48, 57, 58, 97, 98, 102, 109]; obtaining a letter of
support or character reference from their workplace [ 48,
97, 98, 109]; providing evidence of academic grades or
research productivity [ 48, 57, 102, 106, 109]; answering
essay questions [ 106]; and undertaking interviews [ 88,
102]. One CBI also required individuals to apply in a
team (i.e. a joint application involving other individuals)
whereby they had to explain a D&I-related project they
would like to implement in their workplace to address a
healthcare-related challenge [ 99].
Additional data on the competitive nature of the appli-
cation process was referred to for six of the CBIs. The
TIDIRH [ 48, 103] had a total of 266 investigators apply-
ing in the first year (2011) for 30 places [ 48], with 1100
applicants over a 5-year evaluation period (2011 – 2015)
for 199 places [ 103], and in 2019, over 200 applicants
applied for 50 available training slots [ 103]. The IRI [ 18a,
57, 92, 109] accepted approximately 10 fellows each year
with a total of 31 fellows over the first 3 years (2010 –
2012) from a total pool of 86 applicants [ 109], with other
data derived across 4 separate occurrences of the IRI
training reporting a 43/124 acceptance rate [ 57, 92]. The
KTSI [ 106, 107, 110c] had 150 trainees that applied for
30 places [ 106] while the MT-DIRC [ 18b, 98] offered 56
fellows a place over the 4 occurrences of the training
(2014– 2017) [ 98]. The ‘Action Research Programme ’re-
ported that only 6 students were accepted at the start of
the programme ’ [88], and numbers on a master ’s (in
‘health services research and implementation science ’)
[102] and a doctoral-level course (on ‘implementation
science’)[ 47] were capped at 20 due to practical reasons,
despite the demand for the courses growing [ 47].

cles). It is beyond the scope of the present review to
examine this in detail here, but an individual breakdown
of the information supplied relating to the content of
the CBI (e.g. weblinks, course handbooks, workshop
agendas) can be found in Table 2. While we are not sug-
gesting here that the number of files, tables or supple-
mentary documents each article provides for each CBI
should be used as an indicator of the quality of the art-
icle, this does serve to illustrate the type of information
authors are providing when reporting on D&I CBIs.
Further inspection of the content of the CBIs will be
explored as part of our larger programme of work on
capacity building in D&I.
Evaluation and impact of CBIs
Of the 41 CBIs included in the review, evaluative data
was provided for 21 CBIs [ 47– 49, 57, 58, 62, 88– 90a, 91–
93, 95– 100, 102, 103, 106– 110c, 111]. We provide here a
high-level summary of key themes (see also Table 2).
Overall perception CBIs were rated ‘positively’by indi-
viduals— in terms of the CBI itself and/or the import-
ance of the contents [ 47, 95, 97, 98, 102, 108], overall
satisfaction [ 95], acceptability and appropriateness [ 93,
100], usefulness of tools/methods [ 62], helpfulness [ 48]
and likelihood of recommending the CBI to others [ 96].
Knowledge and skills Knowledge and use of D&I prin-
ciples as well as confidence in conducting D&I activities
increased as a result of the CBI [ 47, 49, 58, 95, 97– 100,
111]. Individuals reported using D&I skills they acquired
as a result of the training to influence and train peers in
D&I [ 48]; be involved in research networks [ 48]; deliver
educational modules and presentations [ 110c], embark
on practicums, master ’s papers and other projects [ 62];
and serve as mentors for more junior investigators [ 109].
Project-based work Conducting a D&I-related project
was reported as one of the main reasons for applying for
a CBI [ 89] and one of the most valuable aspects [ 96]
with individuals reporting this helped to enhance their
understanding of the relationship between evidence and
implementation [ 111]. However, individuals also raised
the need for more time to conduct projects and more
guidance from faculty on the scope of the projects [ 89,
96]— while some project ideas were implemented, most
did not move beyond conceptualization due to lack of
time or guidance from faculty [ 88].
Research productivity Undertaking and completing a
CBI was related to research productivity in terms of ap-
plying for and/or being awarded funding for D&I re-
search [ 48, 57, 92, 93, 95, 97, 99, 103, 109, 110c], writing
publications [ 92, 109, 110c] and embarking on D&I-

programme curriculum
1. Action Research Program (ARP)
Six students were selected, with an additional 2
joining in month 7 of the programme (for these
2students training focussed on the experiential
clinic-based learning component). The CBI was
evaluated through interviews with students and
clinicians. Students reported increased understanding
of how care delivery systems work, improved clinical
skills and confidence in interactions with patients.
Clinicians reported increased efficiency at the clinic
level and improved job satisfaction as a result of their
mentoring role. With regards to the improvement
projects, although some ideas were implemented,
most did not move from conceptualisation because
students did not have enough time dedicated to
conduct the project (reported by clinicians) or were
not given enough guidance by faculty (reported by
students).

2. Implementation Research Institute (IRI)
Article evaluated the CBI across 4 different cohorts
from 2010 to 2013 — the first 3 years had 10
delegates and the 4thyear had 12 (43 in total).
Applicants selected for the IRI training, versus those
that were not, were 6 times more likely to be
awarded a D&I grant after attending the IRI, even
when controlling for other variables. Applicants ’
odds of publishing in the journal ‘Implementation
Science’were higher for earlier alumni, starting at
12% after 1 year out of training to 94% for
those 4 years from training (versus non-selected
applicants which remained relatively stable). CBI

Adolescent Behavioural Health
In total 28 scholars were recruited in the first 2 years.
Preliminary results from surveys revealed that gaining
research experience through real-world
service-learning opportunities was a key factor in the
decision to apply for the graduate certificate. The
online method for presenting coursework proved
difficult and required additional time and effort from
faculty to help navigate technology. Academic
mentors felt the design of the program was
beneficial but that they needed more guidance on
their role as mentors and the scope of the projects.

This CBI occurs once a year and was evaluated over a
5-year period (2011 –2015). In total, 101 completed the
course, with numbers ranging from 20 to 25 over the
years (this is now capped at 20 for practical reasons).
Students rated their overall perception of the course
and its contents highly. The majority reported the
course had contributed to their current knowledge in
implementation science and two-thirds felt that the
knowledge gained would be very relevant to their
work. Additional data collected a few months after
course completion revealed that most individuals felt
they had used the knowledge gained in their work
and that this had been valuable.

This was a one-day workshop on KT in dementia but
also included a seminar on KT methods and practices
(which the article focusses on). Article states the response
rate for the evaluation survey but does not state the
number of delegates that attended the KT seminar.
Delegates were emailed a survey 6-months post-workshop.
Results were compared between those that did and did
not opt for the KT seminar as part of the workshop. The KT
group reported the highest median number of overall uses
of workshop information in daily practice when compared
to those that only participated in the clinical seminars - 7.5
vs. 6 ( p > 0.05). There was a correlation ( p < 0.05) between
the total number of ‘kinds of research use ’(e.g. changed a
practice, changed your beliefs) and individual mean scores
(average across 5 items) for conceptual research uses (e.g.
‘gave you knowledge on how to care for residents ’), and
this was stronger for those that attended the KT seminar.
Three items stood out — changing a practice, changing a
procedure and creating a new policy/guideline. Six separate
one-day workshops were held in total.

Article focussses mainly on challenges and
recommendations of end-of-grant KT plans. Feedback
from attendees and KT experts was that the session
was too complex for what would be a small
component of the grant proposal. However, the KT
experts also emphasised the importance of including
a KT component in the grant to increase the
likelihood of a successful grant application (see
Kho, 2009 and Straus, 2011C).

focusses on the mentoring component of the CBI.
Mentoring was positively and significantly related to
having scientific collaboration 2 years later, including
new research, grant submissions and publications.
For every additional mentoring relationship that was
established, the likelihood of scientific collaboration
increased by nearly 7%. CBI also discussed in

each workshop is not clear). 40 participated in
face-to-face only, 16 in virtual only, and 16 in both
formats. The focus of the article was to compare
F-F vs. virtual format for implementation science
training. Both were found to be equally acceptable
and were effective for collaboration and growth
and success in obtaining grants. A third of
presenters received funding for their proposals and
more than 80% of presenters said they would
present again.

Data collected 1 week after the CBI (from 34/68
responses) revealed that: 100% ‘strongly agreed ’they
were satisfied with the training and 97% felt the
workbook was a valuable resource. Delegates that
attended the day 2 mentoring session ‘strongly agreed ’
that working closely with faculty/experts increased
their confidence. At 6-month follow-up, evidence
of 23 new manuscripts and grant proposals
were found.

24. Dissemination and Implementation in Health
A total of 24 students enrolled in the course and 19
faculty researchers participated. Students strongly
agreed that they would recommend the course to
other students, they enjoyed it and were able to apply
what they learnt to their D&I project. Faculty rated it
highly too and strongly agreed that they would
recommend participation in the course to other faculty
and were interested in learning about D&I from
students. The collaborative learning projects were rated
by both as one of the most valuable aspects.
Suggestions for improvement centred on (for students)
course logistics, more meetings to discuss collaborative
project, more time from start of course to when they
meet faculty partners. Faculty reported the need for
clearer expectations for the collaborative learning
project and the opportunity to attend lectures.

Forty-three dissemination and implementation science
competencies were assessed — all improved from
baseline to 6 months and 18 months. The effect was
apparent across beginner, intermediate, and advanced
fellows. Mentoring was rated very highly by fellows
(and more highly than by the mentors). The importance
of different mentoring activities was linked to
fellows’satisfaction with the mentoring activities. CBI

size from 2 –4 people). Surveys (at 6, 12, 18,
24 months) revealed attendees ’self-efficacy in
evidence-based practices, KT activities, and using
evidence to inform practice increased over time.
Focus groups and interviews indicated that
confidence in using KT increased from baseline to
24 months and that training helped to achieve
attendees’KT objectives, plan their projects and
solve problems. Teams with high self-reported
capacity and commitment to implement projects
and ‘buy-in’from upper management that resulted
in securing funding and resources were stated as
important to achieve goals. Sustained spread of
KT practice was observed with 5
teams at 24 months.

and faculty rated the calibre of their counterparts
as ‘excellent’. Fellows from the first 3 cohorts have
submitted 74 proposals (52 funded) and are
beginning to serve as mentors for more junior
investigators. A total of 208 publications have been

Leadership (TRIPLE)
Sixteen mid-level leaders were enrolled in the
training. Most attendees reported increased
implementation leadership skills (86%) and
implementation climate (79%) after the training
(p < 0.05). Implementation leadership skills
improved most on the proactive and knowledgeable
subscales. For implementation climate, educational
support and recognition for using evidence-based
practice revealed the greatest increase (post
training). Attendees found the training highly
acceptable and appropriate and qualitative results
indicated that training led to increased organisational
implementation as well as leadership skills
for attendees.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic
review of its kind to identify and collate the type and
range of D&I CBIs relating to teaching and training that
have been described and/or appraised in the academic
literature. An array of training opportunities from coun-
tries across the world were uncovered, aimed at numer-
ous professions, focussed on different contexts and
ranging in delivery format, duration, structure and
content.
This review was (in part) in response to an editorial
calling for a greater number of publications on the de-
velopment and evaluation of D&I CBI training initiatives
[52]— we took this call one step further by synthesising
the collective evidence published to date. Our research
has raised several important implications for the devel-
opment and delivery of future D&I CBIs as well as their
reporting, discussion and appraisal in academic journals.
Here, we discuss some of the most pertinent overarching
challenges we believe should be prioritised in terms of
building capacity in teaching and training in D&I and in
how these training endeavours are reported and dissemi-
nated for wider use.
Demand and importance of D&I training
While our findings, supported by the wider evidence-
base [ 59, 112], highlight the recognised international de-
mand and importance of D&I CBIs, we also found an
unmet need for D&I training. For some CBIs, enrolment
may only occur once a year and/or may have strict eligi-
bility criteria (e.g. specific qualifications or experience),
which significantly limits the pool of individuals whom

Research in Health (TIDIRH)
In total 197 trainees have undertaken the training
between 2011-2015. Article evaluated long-term
impact on trainees that attended one of the
TIDIRH’s over a 5-year period (TIDIRH held once
annually). Selected applicants were compared to
unselected applicants for applications for NIH
peer-reviewed funding. A survey of trainees and
unselected applicants as well as a faculty survey was
conducted. Thirty-eight per cent of trainees stated they
had extensive contact with faculty following training
and a further 38% indicated they had at least limited
contact. Twenty-four per cent had extensive
collaborations with other fellows after the training
and 43% had at least limited contact. Overall trainees
submitted more funding applications than unselected
applicants and had better funding outcomes
(25% vs. 19%). CBI also discussed in Meissner, 2013.

Twenty-one participants attended the workshop.
Participants indicated that the ‘debate approach ’
added a new dimension to their evidence-based
medicine skills by adding purpose and motivation
but that their performance would have been better
if they had been offered a practical demonstration
of how to conduct a debate. The KT project
enhanced understanding of the relationship
between evidence and implementation, however,
some maintained this fell out the scope of the
role of the doctor.

103, 109] also suggest that the demand for training from
the wider population is likely much higher — oversub-
scriptions to D&I conferences, meetings and initiatives
provide further support for this view [ 7, 17, 59, 75].
Also, of note is that many of the CBIs we delineated
centred on advancing postgraduate or postdoctoral re-
searchers’ D&I skills. While these CBIs were designed
specifically for building research capacity, so do not by
nature restrict options for other kinds of learners (e.g.
practitioners, policy makers), there does appear to be
fewer training options for individuals newer to the field,
which could widen the gap between novices and those
already skilled in D&I [ 59]. Greater emphasis on reach-
ing out to predoctoral individuals, practitioners, policy
makers and consumers [ 14, 16, 59] and publishing find-
ings on such CBIs after they have been evaluated is re-
quired if we are to gain a better understanding of
training needs, priorities and challenges from a diverse
range of learners. Additional efforts are required to train
multidisciplinary teams (not just individuals), whom are
often critical to the successful design and execution of
implementation research and practice [ 16, 113, 114] and
on delivering training in low resource settings, whom
encounter unique challenges in implementing evidence-
based practices due to limited financial resources and
healthcare workforce [ 115– 117] (only 3 D&I CBIs in our
review focussed on this [ 97, 99, 111]).
Availability and accessibility of D&I training and resources
Creative approaches to providing support in D&I are re-
quired if/when local institutional support is lacking —
which may often be the case given the relative infancy of
the field [ 118] and proportionately small pool of experts
able to provide senior mentorship [ 60]. Examples of
such creative approaches uncovered in our review in-
clude the use of online platforms to provide mentorship
support [ 90b], web-networking to enhance research con-
nections and obtain feedback on research activities [ 48,
90c] and webinars/online seminar series [ 90a, 100a,b]t o
share D&I learnings. More widely, a whole host of add-
itional training opportunities and other resources exist
(many of which are free) — including interactive web-
based tools [ 63], networks and discussion forums [ 42],
MOOCs and online courses [ 119– 122] and numerous
guides on D&I methodologies [ 123– 131].
Preliminary evidence indicates that individuals are not
always aware of the existence of D&I resources nor may
they be aware how to access them [ 132, 133]. Arguably,
the D&I community may benefit from more focussed ef-
forts of dissemination in order to reach a wider critical
mass of individuals interested in learning about D&I — a
point which is of particular importance when no other
training option is available (e.g. due to cost or time).
While some organisations have made steps to providing
lists of D&I resources and training opportunities on
their websites [ 134– 138], a more general repository [ 17]
where all the up-to-date evidence and training could be
logged is likely to be of significant merit to the field.
Barriers to effective training
Systematic reviews and research in areas related to D&I
(e.g. behavioural sciences, quality improvement and pa-
tient safety) report that competing educational demands,
time, faculty expertise, motivation and institutional cul-
ture are important determinants of successful curricu-
lum implementation and/or completion [ 139– 142].
Parallels can be drawn from our review, with lack of
time to conduct D&I projects and insufficient guidance
on projects being raised as issues by faculty and trainees
[88, 89, 96]. More widely in the literature, costs and time
constraints are reported as major factors in the decision
to undertake knowledge translation training [ 50, 63],
particularly for those from low resources settings [ 63].
These findings, while only preliminary, highlight the
need to examine different systems and individuals in
which D&I curriculum will be implemented, alongside
the determinants of developing, delivering and accessing
curriculum within these systems for a variety of learners.
Doing this will better enable strategies to be put in place
to overcome barriers to implementation of D&I CBIs
and, in turn, help to address the recognised deficit in
training opportunities [ 14, 75, 80, 112].
Standardisation in reporting
Unlike other areas of research, where reporting guide-
lines exist, e.g. for systematic reviews [ 143], implementa-
tion research [ 144] and intervention reporting [ 87],
there is no equivalent resource specific to the reporting
of D&I CBIs. Systematic reviews on knowledge transla-
tion interventions (a related and synonymous term with
implementation science [ 65– 67, 145, 146]) have raised
how inconsistencies in intervention reporting hamper
evidence synthesis [ 147– 149]. In the same way through
this review, we found that variabilities in reporting D&I
CBIs (both in terms of describing and evaluating) can
make literature synthesis problematic. While this chal-
lenge is not surprising given the differing aims and focus
of our included articles (and so is by no means a criti-
cism of the articles we included), it nonetheless high-
lights an important issue. If we are to use articles like
these to learn and further build capacity efforts in D&I —
a point raised as important by this journal [ 52]— greater
consistency in reporting is required. We consider the
importance of standardisation in more detail here by
drawing on two key areas: (1) the reporting of the
Davis and D ’Lima Implementation Science           (2020) 15:97 Page 20 of 26
<<<PAGE=21>>>
content and structure of D&I CBIs and (2) the reporting
of how D&I CBIs are evaluated.
The reporting of the content and structure of D&I CBIs
Due to the extensive scope of this work, we were only
able to provide a high-level summary of the content and
structure of the CBIs in this paper. However, it was clear
when undertaking the review that despite evident simi-
larities on content (e.g. covering measurement or the-
ory), different topics were covered to varying degrees
and a consistent curriculum, focussed on inter-
disciplinary competencies, was not revealed. While initial
steps have been taken to reach consensus on D&I curric-
ula expectations and competencies for various learners
(both within the CBIs included in our review and more
widely [ 79, 80, 150, 151]), measures and methods are
still developing [ 152– 156] and can be difficult to define
[65, 67, 156, 157]. Advocating the adoption of a small,
common set of terms (which could then also be used
when reporting D&I CBIs) is one way in which a better
understanding of the evidence-base in D&I could be
reached [ 65, 71, 152, 154, 155]. Progress is already un-
derway in the reporting of some areas of implementation
methodology (e.g. implementation outcomes [ 71], imple-
mentation strategies [ 152, 154], theories, models and
frameworks [ 155]), but we are still a long way off being
able to establish a more comprehensive taxonomy of
common terms and methods.
The reporting of how D&I CBIs are evaluated
Appraising existing CBIs is one way which can help to
understand individual needs for D&I research and prac-
tice [ 14, 50, 51, 55] and identify priorities for D&I cap-
acity building [ 50, 51]. Articles in our review evaluated
CBIs to varying degrees. While this would be expected
given our eligibility criteria for articles and their subse-
quent differing aims, without clear and consistent
reporting of data, it is difficult to appraise, synthesise
and effectively communicate progress in D&I training
across different professions, contexts and purposes.
Ideally, evaluations of CBIs would be performed on re-
peated occurrences of the training (to check consistency
in the findings across several cohorts) and longitudinally
(to assess the longer-term impact of training) to better
establish the effectiveness of D&I curricula in enabling
desired outcomes in practice (something which few of
the articles included in our review did).
In a field where the evidence (and therefore priorities
for teaching) is rapidly changing, standardisation in the
reporting of key elements of D&I content and structure
as well as the evaluation of the CBIs is critical. This un-
derstanding and clarity is essential for D&I educators,
researchers and implementers to draw meaningful con-
clusions from the literature on D&I training. In turn, a
clearer cumulative assessment of the evidence-base can
be reached, so that training successes and challenges as
well as educational gaps in the field can be identified
and addressed.
Review caveats
While our review has much to add to the field of cap-
acity building in D&I, several important caveats should
be borne in mind when interpreting our results. First,
given the extensive scope of our review and its complex-
ity, we were only able to provide a high-level summary
of our findings here. We acknowledge that examining
the curriculum of each the D&I CBIs may be of interest
to the readership of this journal, as may a detailed syn-
thesis of the evaluation of D&I CBIs like those identified
in our review. However, while this is something we plan
to undertake in future work, it was beyond the scope
and aims of the current paper and would not have been
possible without significantly compromising on the level
and detail of other information required in order to
meet our review ’s aims. Second, given one of the aims of
our review was to show how D&I CBIs are reported in
the academic literature and to use these findings to help
inform future recommendations on reporting (a point
which has been raised as important to explore [ 52]), we
did not include ‘grey literature ’ in our review. We are
aware of D&I CBIs in the field that have not been writ-
ten up for publication [ 158– 162] so acknowledge that
our review (while intentional) only provides a fieldwide
perspective on the academic literature, not the total
number of D&I CBIs on offer. Third, to provide a com-
prehensive account of the literature, we did not exclude
articles based on their aims — unsurprisingly, therefore,
those that were included differed in focus, ranging from
brief or detailed descriptions and/or evaluations of D&I
CBIs to general overviews of several initiatives. Fourth,
we did not exclude CBIs based on the level of detail au-
thors provided on them. While this was intentional, in
order to highlight variabilities in reporting, undoubtedly,
this meant that less meaningful conclusions can be
drawn from those articles where minimal information
was included. Finally, it is worth noting that we exam-
ined just one way to build capacity in D&I — providing
funding for D&I research networks [ 163– 166], research
proposals [ 68, 167– 169], faculty positions and job vacan-
cies [ 170, 171] and departments and centres [ 22– 36], as
well as organising D&I-related conferences and meetings
[43– 46] are also important avenues for growth.
Conclusions
This review addresses a clear gap in the evidence-base
and helps pave the way for future research on building
capacity in D&I. Greater investment in education and
training is necessary to increase the cadre of D&I
Davis and D ’Lima Implementation Science           (2020) 15:97 Page 21 of 26

scientists and practitioners. Consistent reporting on D&I
CBIs is required to enable greater transparency on the
type and range of training opportunities, attitudes to-
wards them and training gaps that need to be prioritised
and addressed. Increasing awareness and accessibility to
D&I training and resources should also be prioritised.
Ultimately, doing this should result in D&I learnings be-
ing more clearly communicated so that the best possible
D&I CBIs can be developed to achieve the most optimal
outcomes. Further work examining the evidence on CBI
D&Is (both within the academic literature and more
widely) is required.
