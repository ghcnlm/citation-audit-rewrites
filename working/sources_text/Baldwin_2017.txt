CONCEPTUAL PAPER
         The State of Transfer of Training 
Research: Moving Toward More 
Consumer-Centric Inquiry 
      Timothy T.     Baldwin     ,    J.     Kevin Ford     ,    Brian D.     Blume    
   Over the past 30 years, there has been an explosion of research in the human 
resource development (HRD)   literature devoted to transfer of training - and 
much has been learned. Yet despite recent demands for evidence-based 
practice, too little of the science of transfer is informing professionals in 
their design and execution of training initiatives. We offer three broad 
prescriptions for moving future transfer research toward more consumer-
centric outcomes: (1) systematically report more and richer information 
related to the trainees, trainers, and organizational contexts under study; 
(2) focus explicitly on the optimization of  transfer  - not just learning; and (3) 
expand the measurement and reporting of transfer outcomes. We conclude 
with a general call for transfer scholars to adopt a more consumer-centric 
mind-set where studies are designed with an eye to informing training 
interventions of greatest frequency and importance to contemporary 
organizations and training practitione rs.   
  Key Words:   T ransfer of training  ,   Consumer-centric science    
   Nearly 30 years ago, the first two authors published a review of transfer of train-
ing (Baldwin & Ford,   1988  ) that summarized the existing research evidence 
of the time and outlined an agenda for going forward. Much has been learned 
since that time, and subsequent reviews and meta-analytic studies have synthe-
sized those findings (Baldwin, Ford, & Blume,   2009  ; Blume, Ford, Baldwin, & 
Huang,   2010  ; Burke & Hutchins,   2007  ; Ford & Weissbein,   1997  ). It has been 
gratifying to see the growing interest in addressing a recurring challenge of the 
HRD discipline - the training transfer problem - and it is clear that transfer has 
become widely recognized as an important arena for research and practice. 
 While there has been an explosion of interest and published articles, trans-
fer research is not immune to recent critiques regarding a ‘crisis of relevance’

in our academic literature (Hoffman,   2016  ). Behavioral science research in 
general, and transfer of training in particular, has prompted increasing con-
cerns about the applicability of findings to the problems of most pressing and 
substantive interest to consumers of our research. For example, among train-
ing professionals, the transfer problem remains acute and there are recurring 
calls for more evidence that can inform the design and execution of effective 
training initiatives. Recent survey evidence suggests that three-quarters of the 
nearly 1,500 senior managers at 50 organizations interviewed in 2011 by the 
Corporate Leadership Council were dissatisfied with their companies’ learning 
and development outcomes (Beer, Finnstrom, & Schrader,  2016 ). 
 If we want to be scholars who matter to our professional colleagues, we 
need to think critically about the questions we ask - and the questions we 
don ’ t ask - and what influences that distinction. We need to find better ways 
of collectively identifying the most important and relevant questions, the 
underinvestigated issues, and the applicable evidence that trainers and educa-
tors most need to design and execute effective learning experiences. 
 So we argue in this paper that the time is ripe for a  new  agenda for trans-
fer research. Today ’ s rapidly changing business climate dictates that organiza-
tional success depends more than ever on the speed with which people can 
learn and transfer new knowledge. For example, at Cisco Systems, consider-
able annual revenue comes from products or services  less than three years old . 
Similarly , at Eli Lilly & Co., projections are that nearly 80% of business rev-
enue in some divisions in 2022 will come from  different  products and services 
than in 2017. Indeed, technological, social, and economic developments are 
affecting  all  industry sectors and requiring that successful organizations design 
and accelerate their learning initiatives (Hagel & Reeves,   2015  ). It is therefore 
timely for scholars to renew our efforts to ensure that our research is targeted 
to provide relevant and consumer-centric evidence. 
 Toward that end, in this article we take stock of the current state of trans-
fer research and offer three prescriptions for moving toward greater relevance 
and consumer-centric inquiry: (1) getting closer to trainees, trainers, and learn-
ing contexts; (2) focusing explicitly on optimizing impact on transfer; and 
(3) expanding our perspective of training transfer outcomes or criteria. Our intent 
is to spotlight the type and form of empirical investigations that will provide the 
best yield in new  and useful  transfer knowledge. Our prescriptions are drawn in 
part from our recent qualitative and quantitative reviews (cf. Baldwin et al.,   2009  ; 
Blume et al.,   2010  ), but also very much from our work as instructors and consul-
tants directly involved in the design and implementation of training efforts.  
  Getting Closer to Trainees, Trainers, and Learning Contexts 
 Over 45 years ago, John Campbell (  1971  ) cautioned training researchers to 
be careful about treating trainees as if they just fell from some great ‘trainee 
bin in the sky .’ Unfortunately , much of our extant research continues to do
<<<PAGE=3>>>

exactly that. More specifically , it is all too common to see empirical studies 
with methods sections that include only passing reference to the trainees or 
learners (e.g., ‘126 subjects completed a one-day training program taught 
by an online provider’), or which present trainees as passive rather than 
active players in their own learning and transfer (Baldwin et al.,   2009  ). Yet, 
we know that individuals come into training with all sorts of differences in 
goals, expectations, needs, and attitudes toward training that change over 
time as they experience the learning process and then ultimately attempt 
to apply trained knowledge when opportunities present themselves on the 
job. Poell and Van Der Krogt (2010; 2014) have characterized this phenom-
enon as ‘learning paths,’ and we think this is an exciting direction for future 
research. 
 Weiss and Rupp (  2011  ) similarly argue that the prevailing research para-
digm treats employees as objects to be studied rather than understood. That 
is, the implicit goal is to measure employee properties (e.g., conscientious-
ness) and then use that measurement to predict some desired organizationally 
relevant outcome (e.g., training transfer). They contend that such research, 
while useful, also constrains the type of research that is seen as valuable and 
directs attention away from other important questions about work as it is “dis-
connected from what really matters to people” (Weiss & Rupp,   2011  , p. 84). 
They advocate for a more person-centric approach to studying work-related 
issues with an intentional focus on the work context and lived experience 
of the employees - both in the moment and over time (Weiss,   2014  ). This 
approach pays attention to not only what happens to people at work but also 
what it is like to experience an event; for example, “what is it like to the per-
son to experience injustice, to be bored, to be ostracized, to learn something 
new?” (Weiss & Rupp,   2011  , p. 87). 
 We contend that a timely and useful direction for future research is to 
get closer to the trainees and how they experience learning events - what the 
learning context is and the personal experience of those events - including 
their feelings, attention, and search for meaning and how these change over 
time during the learning event and subsequently on the job. For example, 
one could ask trainees what they expect to learn and transfer before training, 
and then follow up by linking the learning/training and work contexts with 
changes over time in expectations, motivation to learn, and transfer. We need 
to get closer to key stakeholders and the actual context of where and how 
learning and transfer occurs. This focus on the learner will require being more 
resourceful in our samples and data collection and intentional about reporting 
(or ideally even manipulating) variables in those domains (see, for example, 
the article in this volume by Kahn & Girvan,  2017   ). 
 In addition, too little research has examined or even reported the nature 
and motives of our  trainers . For example, in most extant transfer studies it is 
unstated what, if anything, trainers are held accountable for - satisfaction of 
the trainees, learning standards, transfer outcomes, or just filling seats. Frink

and Klimoski (  2004  ) contend that understanding the accountability demands 
relevant to human resource management strategies such as training are critical 
to understanding behavioral patterns that are found. In his classic treatise “On 
the Folly of Rewarding A While Hoping for B,” Kerr (  1975  ) used training as 
an exemplar of that phenomenon suggesting that trainers are often  disincentiv-
ized  to focus on and measure transfer. This is because trainees will often have 
favorable attitudes toward a training experience itself (e.g., measured via post-
training ‘smile sheets’) but are likely to be less satisfied if attention is shifted 
to more difficult objectives of transfer. The consequence is that if trainers 
are held accountable for conducting a well-received program, they will have 
little incentive to focus on or feel accountable for transfer outcomes. A better 
understanding of what transfer-enhancing strategies are embedded into the 
training by trainers, and what trainers are hoping will happen when incorpo-
rating those strategies, would be useful information to know in any transfer 
study . Clearly , there is a pressing need to develop a better understanding of 
how trainers are being evaluated and  their  expectations of, and accountability 
for, transfer. We suspect that the impact of trainers is more pronounced than 
existing transfer research conclusions might suggest. 
 Finally , it is hardly provocative to contend that what is meant by the 
phrase ‘learning context’ has evolved rather substantively over time. For 
example, today there is considerably more self-study (e.g., using online mod-
ules) and informal learning that occurs in conjunction with (or instead of) 
formal training. K. G. Brown and Sitzmann (  2011  ) note that while the major-
ity of past theory and research has focused on formal learning (i.e., planned 
and systematic efforts to teach knowledge and skills), formal learning is not 
sufficient for keeping pace with constant changes in the workplace. Today an 
important part of learning in the workplace is informal, such as looking up 
information online, experimentation, and discussing issues with colleagues 
(K. G. Brown & Sitzmann,   2011  ; Enos, Kehrhahn, & Bell,   2003  ). 
 Although formal learning opportunities and outcomes tend to be explic-
itly defined, in informal settings employees themselves identify or create learn-
ing opportunities (Enos et al.,   2003  ). The informal learning process that occurs 
outside of any traditional training context can significantly impact training 
transfer, and research that simultaneously examines formal and informal train-
ing is therefore needed. A recent study by Sparr, Knipfer, and Willems ( 2017   ) 
is a notable example of examining feedback seeking and reflection as informal, 
proactive learning behaviors in the transfer of formal training.  
  Study Ways to Optimize Impact on  Transfer  
 As noted in our introduction, since our 1988 review, many empirical studies 
have been conducted examining the relationship between predictor constructs 
and transfer outcomes (see, e.g., Massenberg, Schulte, & Kauffeld,  2017   ). 
Blume et al. (  2010  ) conducted a meta-analysis of this empirical research and
<<<PAGE=5>>>

HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY • DOI: 10.1002/hrdq
showed that certain individual difference factors such as conscientiousness and 
certain contextual factors such as supervisory support predict transfer out-
comes such as use and effectiveness. In addition, they found that pre- and 
post-training interventions had small effects on transfer outcomes. They also 
found evidence that most predictor variables had stronger relationships to 
transfer when the focus of training was on open as opposed to closed skills. 
 As noted by Roe (  2008  ), this type of empirical research has focused 
largely on ‘what happens’ between variables. This means that the research 
questions are related to whether an independent variable construct predicts 
some criteria of interest. Roe concludes that such research findings, while 
useful to some degree, are incomplete as they ignore temporal facets and the 
changing nature of relationships  underlying  ‘what happens.’ Similarly , Ployhart, 
Holtz, and Bliese (  2002  ) have also critiqued this approach with the concern 
that the cumulative knowledge derived from these efforts gives few insights 
into how people actually behave and perform over time. They note that “it is 
probably not an overstatement to claim that the cumulative knowledge gained 
from applied psychological resource gives us little insight into how people 
develop, behave, perform, and grow over time” (pp. 455–456.). 
 We agree that additional studies that simply examine if certain factors 
(e.g., workgroup support) predict transfer should no longer be a top priority . 
For example, we know that support, in varying forms, is an important factor 
that impacts transfer, and we have probably accumulated sufficient data on 
such relationships. Rather, we propose the need to examine ‘how’ to enhance 
or optimize transfer, rather than simply describing the ‘what’ of relationships 
between the predictor and transfer constructs. 
 Specifically with regard to work support, future studies might more use-
fully focus on examining different interventions or strategies for building sup-
port and which are most effective in various contexts. This requires thinking 
of different types of interventions than we have currently studied (e.g., relapse 
prevention) that target just the individual trainee. Instead, we need to also 
consider interventions that can influence contextual factors that can, in turn, 
positively impact transfer. 
 As one illustration, we know that debriefing sessions used by the mili-
tary to talk over lessons learned from an experience can have large impacts 
on future behaviors and performance (Dunn, Scott, Allen, & Bonilla,   2016  ; 
Ellis & Davidi,   2005  ). One could study the impact of ‘after-action review’ 
debriefing sessions held by supervisors with trainees soon after the trainee 
has attempted to apply something learned in training. This would provide 
insight into what was learned from the experience and how to more effectively 
apply trained knowledge and skills. From a conceptual perspective, we might 
predict that such an intervention could provide accountability , show support 
for the trainee, and potentially motivate the trainee to continue with efforts 
to apply trained skills to the job. What our literature needs now is empirical 
evidence of such effects discovered in contemporary training contexts.

 To truly advance our understanding of optimizing transfer, we also need 
more research  combining  both pre- and post-training interventions and the 
value added of such combined interventions on transfer outcomes. Our extant 
research is characterized by predominantly single intervention - type studies 
that have shown limited impact on transfer (Blume et al.,   2010  ). Once we 
build more understanding of how to effectively impact transfer through strate-
gies targeting contextual factors, we can then study the interaction effects of 
interventions focused on both the trainee and contextual factors. 
 For example, Gollwitzer and colleagues (Gollwitzer,   1999  ; Sheeran, 
Webb, & Gollwitzer,   2005  ; Wieber, Thurmer, & Gollwitzer,   2015  ) have 
extensively described the strength and functioning of implementation inten-
tions where individuals specify exactly how and when they will apply new 
strategies to address an issue. In an initial study in the training domain, Fried-
man and Ronen (  2015  ) found that sales managers with implementation inten-
tions received higher transfer of training scores than those without such goals. 
A useful next step would be to study the impact of including both implemen-
tation goals that focus on the trainee at the end of training and after action 
reviews that focus on transfer contextual factors and behaviors in the transfer 
setting to examine their combined effects. 
 Another way to consider how to optimize transfer would be to renew 
research examining traditional principles of learning, with an explicit focus 
on transfer - not just learning - outcomes. Perhaps one of the unintended 
outcomes of Baldwin and Ford ’ s (  1988  ) transfer review was a shift in research 
away from the principles of learning and training design in favor of pre- and 
post-training variables. We think the time is right to shift some focus  back to  
learning design, given recent research in cognitive science and educational set-
tings that have reconsidered some conventional wisdom regarding principles 
of learning and what strategies are more effective in making learning ‘stick’ 
(Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel,   2014  ; Dunlosky , Rawson, Marsh, Nathan, & 
Willingham,   2013  ). 
 This research has important implications for maximizing training transfer 
that may even seem somewhat counterintuitive to how trainers (and trainees) 
think about learning. One example is the overuse of blocked instruction and 
practice where one procedure is learned before moving to another procedure. 
Research indicates it is often the case that a  random  or interleaved practice is 
better to  blocked  practice for transfer. For example, P . C. Brown and colleagues 
(  2014  ) describe a study of a college baseball team whose coach employed two 
different batting practice regimens. One group practiced hitting 45 pitches 
each day delivered in block form (15 fastballs, then 15 curveballs, and 15 
change-ups) while a second group practiced hitting 45 pitches a day delivered 
in an interleaved form (i.e., the batter did not know which pitch was being 
delivered at any one time, yet by the end of the 45 pitches they had been 
given 15 fastballs, 15 curveballs, and 15 change-ups). The results showed 
that those given the blocked practice did better during the practice (learning)
<<<PAGE=7>>>

sessions in terms of the number of hits. However, the group that performed 
better in actual baseball games (the transfer context) was the group given 
the interleaved practice condition. Interestingly , when asked, learners and 
trainers typically say they prefer the blocked practice and believe they have 
learned under this practice condition - providing a powerful incentive to keep 
blocked practice during training, even though this approach may not maxi-
mize transfer - the ultimate goal (Simon & Bjork,   2001  ). 
 In this same vein, one of the more intriguing anecdotal observations we 
have made in conducting training sessions is how much better candidates 
think they will transfer than they actually do. Some prominent researchers 
have dubbed this phenomenon ‘unskilled and unaware’ (Kruger & Dunning, 
  1999  ), and we believe this is often operative in training domains. P . C. Brown 
and colleagues (  2014  ) discuss the value of generative learning in which learn-
ers generate their own thoughts, perhaps incorrect, about phenomena versus 
teachers or trainers presenting only effective models and correct answers. One 
advantage of a ‘generate first’ approach is that it provides an opportunity for 
students to contrast their own thinking with that of others, including experts 
in an area. This sets the stage for appreciating the critical features of the new 
information that is presented to them and their divergence from the views of 
experts or known templates. Learners may not immediately appreciate this 
approach, or feel as if they are not gaining knowledge, but research shows 
that the ultimate transfer achievement (e.g., later retrieval of information or 
procedures) is often greater (P . C. Brown et al.,   2014  ). 
 In short, we contend that the transfer  paradox  phenomenon—where the 
methods that work best for reaching isolated and specific learning objectives 
may  not  be the methods that optimize the achievement of integrated objec-
tives and transfer of learning—needs to be more center stage in our transfer 
research (Van Merriënboer,   1997  ; Van Merriënboer, Kester, & Paas,   2006  ). 
That is, we argue for a renewed interest in the study of instructional methods 
and strategies that explicitly aim at  transfer  - not just immediate learning - as 
the dependent variable (Yelon, Ford, & Anderson,   2014  ).  
  Expanding Training Transfer Criteria 
 A review of the specific measurement of dependent variables (or criteria) used 
in the extant transfer research literature reveals a notable narrowness in how 
we have conceived transfer in studies to date. We submit that it is time to 
expand our transfer criteria, and that such expansion is consistent with several 
of the points made earlier in this article. In fact, some of the above recom-
mendations would inherently necessitate examining transfer in different ways. 
For example, getting closer to trainees would enable us to understand what 
transfer means to trainees themselves and thus how to better capture that in 
our measures. This might also help better interpretation of findings such as 
those by Ellington, Surface, Blume, and Wilson (  2015  ), who reported that
<<<PAGE=8>>>

the transfer time interval negatively impacted a standardized measure of skill 
assessment, but not a measure of skill generalization evaluated by supervi-
sors. As another example discussed above, examining how informal training 
or post-training interventions influence training transfer is likely to require a 
longer-term perspective when assessing transfer over time. 
 While traditional research has generally defined transfer as the use of the 
trained skills or the effectiveness in applying the training (Blume et al.,   2010  ; 
Yelon, Ford & Bhatia, 2014) more recent work has embraced the notion that 
the trainee is an active participant in learning and transfer (Bell & Kozlowski, 
  2008  ; Bell, Tannenbaum, Ford, Noe, & Kraiger,  in press   ). Consistent with 
this perspective, we view transfer as a series of choices that trainees make to 
discard, maintain, apply , or modify trained knowledge and skills in their work 
context (Baldwin et al.,   2009  ). 
 Along these lines, one potential research direction is to enhance our 
knowledge of factors that are related to the emergence of transfer behaviors 
over time. Blume, Ford, Surface, and Olenick ( under  review  ) provide a model 
and direction for incorporating time into transfer research, focusing on the 
importance of initial attempts to apply training on the job and its impact on 
training transfer trajectories. Such a within-person analysis of trainees should 
be useful in understanding the transfer process over time (Sitzmann & Wein-
hardt,  in press   ). Another potential avenue for research would be to utilize 
experience sampling methodology (Fisher & To,   2012  ) to study transfer and 
evaluate the success of the initial transfer attempt and subsequent application 
attempts. 
 Future research might also fruitfully examine differences among trainees’ 
transfer  trajectories  , depending on the amount of time that passes between 
training and transfer and other factors. For example, Huang, Ford, and Ryan 
( in press   ) demonstrated that the application of trained knowledge and skills 
on the job may result in different transfer trajectories for different trainees. 
That is, some trainees may decrease their application of trained knowledge 
and skills over time while others would maintain or increase transfer over 
time. They investigated within-person variability in mastery goal orientation 
and variability over time in the application of statistical skills to the job. 
Participants completed six surveys after training to examine the extent to 
which the trainees reported using the newly acquired knowledge and skills 
in different research contexts. They found that trainees varied in their initial 
attempts to transfer and the subsequent rate of change in transfer behaviors. 
They also found that post-training self-efficacy predicted initial attempts to 
transfer, while motivation to transfer predicted the rate of change in behavior 
in the transfer setting. We believe there is a need for additional studies that 
examine training trajectories and the factors that can impact those trajecto-
ries. We also need to be more creative in measuring transfer outcomes such 
as how quickly a trainee achieves a certain  sufficiency   standard - not full 
mastery .

 A final direction is to expand the use of qualitative research studies 
to gain insight into the training context and transfer. Yelon and colleagues 
(Yelon, Ford, & Anderson,   2014  ; Yelon, Ford, & Bhatia,   2014  ) demonstrated 
that within two to three years post-training, many workshop participants had 
greatly expanded the use of trained knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) 
beyond direct use on their particular job such as teaching others strategies 
learned in training. These findings from their qualitative study suggest that we 
could expand our measure of transfer to examine whether trainees seek out 
new situations to apply a certain trained KSA, while at the same time decid-
ing to discard other trained KSAs after an initial attempt. Choi and Roulston 
(  2015  ) interviewed medical school residents and examined transfer criteria 
in terms of continuous learning. They discovered that subjects’ professional 
identity and prior positive or negative view toward the training material influ-
enced the extent to which they took advantage of other elective (versus man-
datory) training in the same content area as well as the extent to which they 
were proactive in gaining further information concerning the evidence base 
for the medical efficacy of the trained procedure. These types of qualitative 
studies reinforce the importance of measuring transfer in nontraditional ways 
and underscore the value of getting closer to our trainees as a path to better 
understand training transfer.  
  Conclusion 
 In organizational contexts, positive transfer of training is generally regarded 
as the paramount goal of training efforts - yet it has proven to be a formidable 
challenge. Although the research literature has become voluminous, there is a 
legitimate concern that the transfer problem remains acute. U.S. corporations 
spend enormous amounts of money - some $356 billion globally in 2015 
alone - on employee training and education but they could be getting a better 
return on their investment (Beer et al., 2016). 
 Forscher (  1963  ) famously lamented an emerging ‘bricklayer’ phenom-
enon whereby academic scholarship was becoming fixated on generating lots 
of pieces of knowledge - bricks - but was far less concerned with putting 
them together into a cohesive whole useful to our research consumers. In 
this article, we have attempted to present strategies for future research that 
we believe will enhance the relevant yield of our collective scholarly work. To 
achieve such greater yield will require getting closer to our trainees, trainers, 
and learning contexts, examining ways to specifically optimize transfer, and 
being more expansive in our measurement of transfer. These approaches will 
hopefully induce research scholars to ask different and ultimately more useful 
questions than simply ‘what happened’ in a transfer context. Our research too 
often has concluded with something akin to ‘here are some good findings you 
need to use’ - with the onus solely on practitioners to make sense of research 
and to figure out how it applies to their work. The grand challenge (Banks

et al.,  2016   ) for transfer of training scholars, therefore, is to begin to shift 
our focus to a more consumer-centric mind-set. We hope that the articles in 
this issue, including the provocative editorial by Poell ( 2017   ), will serve to 
advance the field in this direction.
