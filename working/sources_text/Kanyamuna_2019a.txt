To my mother, Elizabeth Siandizya Kanyamuna, and to my late father, Tyson Kanyamuna 
Zambo, both of whom saw my intellectual gift at a  very young age and unconditionally 
nurtured it. To the clans of my mother and my father. Intended to be  a direct inspiration of 
focus and hard work to my children. Further, to the Zambian child in particular and to the kids 
of Africa in general —especially those who will propel the subject matter of monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) as a pillar of good governance and decent life for all.

It was a long process of conceiving, initiating, doing, and in the end actualising this doctoral 
degree. Truthfully speaking, the process had all possible combinations of emotions – happiness, 
intellectual fulfilment, subject emptiness, loneliness, rejection, success, confusion, and 
impatience. In staying afloat and keeping my eyes on the goal, several support factors – without 
number - worked to my advantage. To my supervisor, Professor Derica Kotz é, I say a million 
thanks. In the fullness of the study, you attended to my learning needs promptly. Even when 
you disagreed with my line of thought, you always made your point clear without making me 
feel that usual student-professor ‘rough’ guidance. Your constructive guidance was ‘top-notch’ 
and I admire it—continue blessing others. T o the rest of the staff at UNISA , especially those 
in the Department of Develo pment Studies and student help office, thank you for the support 
before and during my study period.  
 
Further, I appreciate the partial financial support from the Government of the Republic of 
Zambia through the Ministry of Finance  (MOF) and the Ministry o f National Development 
Planning (MNDP), where I worked for almost 10 years . Government permission and funding 
towards my studies is recognised and held in high esteem. Many thanks to Mr. Felix 
Nkulukusa, the then  permanent secretary in charge of Economic Management and Fina nce 
(EMF) at MOF, Dr. Simon Miti—former permanent secretary for Development Planning and 
Administration (DPA) at M NDP, Dr.  Auxilia Bupe Ponga —former permanent secretary in 
charge of the Development Cooperation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division at MNDP and to 
Mr. Chola J. Chabala, the current permanent secretary responsible for DPA at M NDP for 
believing in my abilities to pursue this degree in the subject matter of ‘monitoring’ and 
‘evaluation’. To the staff and colleagues at MOF and MNDP, I say thank you for their positive 
encouragements and pushing for me to finish this project. Dr. Richard Banda (Director—
Monitoring and Evaluation), Mr. Mulele M. Mulele (Director—Development Planning) and 
other colleagues at MNDP —I can still hear  several of their  voices of encouragement to me. 
Equally, I wish to give special gratitude to all government officials who supported my  field 
research at all levels—national, line ministry, provincial and district. Without obtaining current 
evidence about the pr actice and culture of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) throughout 
government structural level, this study would have not come to a conclusion. Officers from 
non-government institutions are similarly appreciated for the information given in support of 
my research study. Dr. Willard Lumoma Bboonko Simukali, thank you for the valuable, critical

and inspirational  feedback during the research  proposal process. His insistence on the 
uncompromising clarity of the research questions and topic helped to shape this wo rk. Many 
thanks go to my colleagues at the University of Zambia (my new career & professional home), 
particularly Dr. Moonga H. Mumba for providing critical feedback on my research process. 
The Head of Department Mr. Wisdom Kaleng’a for the support and encouragement during my 
data collection and thesis write-up.   
 
Special thank you to my family and friends for being there for me at all seasons. To my wife, 
Sylvia, thanks for the support, without which overcoming this mammoth task would have been 
difficult. Times too innumerable to count, Lubomba  my emphatic daughter would storm my 
study table and say: Hi Daddy, how is the PhD going? ….. all the best, Daddy. Many thanks 
also to my daughter Chuma—brilliant girl , nieces Sekani, Muchimba, Sharon  and in -law 
Doreen as well as Trevor my nephew for including me in their prayers during our daily evening 
prayer devotions. To Mr. Geofrey Sibalwa, thanks for his fervent encouragements and unique 
belief in my abilities to complete this landmark project. To my siblings, t heir warm appeals 
and love is greatly appreciated. All the praise and glory to God for keeping me healthy, focused, 
resilient and determined, even when it seemed gloomy several times.

Abstract 
This research study aim ed to investigate and provide a comprehensive analysis of Zambia’s 
whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation system (WoGM&ES) in the context of 
national development plans (NDPs) within the broader agenda of good governance and poverty 
reduction. The study considered the period 1964 to  2021—a period covering all the seven (7) 
NDPs for Zambia since independence. The study focused on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
arrangements in the public sector as articulated in these NDPs and other government policies 
as well as structural operations . The research was centred on f ive (5) secondary objectives, 
namely a) justifying the theoretical significance of Zambia's WoGM&ES to improve public-
sector good governance and poverty reduction agenda  through the theory of change; b) 
presenting Zambia as a case study in terms of the results -based WoGM&ES; c) identifying 
gaps inhibiting the implementation of a results -focused WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public 
sector; d) establishing cornerstones necessary for bui lding a results -based WoGM&ES for 
Zambia’s public sector ; and e) proposing a new model for the enhanced WoGM&ES for 
Zambia’s public sector.  
 
Striving for functional M&E systems is a global phenomenon that requires commitment by all 
stakeholders and M&E of development interventions has become a vehicle that assists 
development agencies globally to demonstrate results to show to their stakeholders and 
beneficiaries. Thus, the starting point was to contend that M&E had increasingly become a 
useful tool towards good governance and that more institutions and governments had adopted 
it. The study then demonstrates how an M&E system, and, more so, a WoGM&ES, was crucial 
to implementing a thriving M&E culture for any country or organisation. In terms of scope, the 
study drew respondents from across government functionaries at national, line ministry, 
province and district  level. Respondents from non-state institutions and M&E practitioners 
were also part of the study.  The research  was exploratory and investigatory a nd used the 
qualitative research approach to guide its design, data collection, collation and analysis, 
conclusion, recommendations and presentation. Further, purposive sampling was used to select 
respondents from these various institutions. Data collection benefited through the use of closed 
and open -ended questions  from both secondary and primary sources. Nvivo software, t ext 
analysis as well as the analytical tool called LEADS comprised of a 5-point scoring scale were 
adopted and used for discussion and analysis of field data and information.
<<<PAGE=15>>>

The analytical instrument adopted to guide the research comprises of six components, namely: 
i) policy, ii) methodology, iii) organisation, iv) capacity, v) participation of actors outside 
government, and vi) the use of information from M&E. These components form the diagnostic 
checklist (analytical framework) used to assess the current status of Zambia’s WoGM&ES. In 
many ways, Zambia’s public sector system for M&E was found to be weak.  At all levels —
national, line ministry, provincial and district, M&E arrangements and practice were found to 
be poor. Both the supply side and the demand side of Zambia’ s country level M&E system 
were unable to provide stakeholders with required and adequate information to inform critical 
development processes, such as policy -making, decision -making, planning,  budgeting, 
resource allocation and advocacy. Gaps were identified in all the six components of the 
diagnostic checklist and improvements will be necessary as suggested and recommended under 
each one of them to make the WoGM&ES viable to meet the expectations of stakeholders . 
While the supply side of the system was relatively found to be well developed, the demand side 
was worse off. On the supply side, the study found that the polic y and methodology 
components were fairly well developed. However, the component on the use of information by 
stakeholders, on the demand side, was found to be poorly developed. Further, various capacities 
in M&E were acknowledged as lacking across the WoGM &ES. The participation of actors 
outside government in strengthening the country system for M&E was also found to be weak, 
in many cases presented with lots of parallel and fragmented stand -alone systems. The policy 
environment in support of M&E strengthen ing and expansion was equally reported as one of 
the key areas that required attention from both political and technical powers that be. Although 
Zambia’s WoGM&ES was found to be weak in many aspects, it is noteworthy to mention that 
it has the necessary features for success. The study established that at national level, there were 
currently efforts to make M&E work in government. Such activities as creating a structure 
responsible for coo rdinating M&E across government , automating data management and 
information flows as well as developing a national M&E policy were reported to be ongoing 
efforts.  
 
To improve and enhance Zambia’s WoGM&ES, this study has proposed a model.  Firstly, the 
new model recommends a structural shift in the manner M&E is coordinated at national level. 
The presidency was identified as the most appropriate location or entity to hold the 
responsibility of overseeing the WoGM&ES and in  constantly as well as dedicatedly  
demanding for development results. The model is proposed as a transformational and long term 
strife and commitment by the current and successive governments. It was established that the
<<<PAGE=16>>>
xv 
 
current arrangement where  the Ministry of National Development Planning (MNDP) was 
overseeing the WoGM&ES  had led to operational gaps relate d to weak funding to M&E 
activities and high level policy clout. Generally, there is lack of influence (both political and 
technical) to spur an M&E transformational agenda for the country, let alone within the public 
sector. Therefore, the proposed model advances that the presidency will have the motivation 
and capacity to resolve these weaknesses  a great deal . Specifically, the model suggests the 
establishment of an evaluation structure under the presidency to work as an apex institution to 
drive and champion the cause for a robust results -based WoGM&ES for the Zambian public 
sector. To formalise this arrangement, a well-defined M&E legislation will be needed.  In 
addition, the proposed model has made salient recommendations on how to build and 
strengthen both the supply side and demand side of Zambia’s WoGM&ES. These two sides 
are considered vital for success of the country system for M&E and government and its 
stakeholders and partners will do well to invest in building and sustaining the supply and 
demand sides. In proposing a new architecture for Zambia’s WoGM&ES, the proposed model 
has acknowledged and incorporated the current positive practices and arrangements.  
Finally, the study has among others recommended that all government levels should create 
formal structures mandated to undertake M&E functions. These entities should be equipped 
with skilled staff  in M&E, funding, technologies and relevant equipment. This research has 
also enriched literature on M&E and its relationship with good governance. Equally, a number 
of M&E issues such as political, technical and international best practices have been raised to 
prompt future research and development.

CHAPTER 1 
 
Situating the Research Study 
 
1.1 Introduction  
 
This research study aims to investigate and provide a comprehensive analysis of Zambia’s 
whole-of-government monitoring and eval uation system (WoGM&ES) in the context of 
national development plans (NDPs) within the broader agenda of good governance and poverty 
reduction. The study covers the period 1964 to 2018 , analysing Zambia’s public sector 
development planning, monitoring and evaluation arrangements (covering all NDPs between 
1964 to 2021). Seven NDPs have been implemented during this period and the study focused 
on the functioning and evolution of the monitoring and evaluation arrangements across 
government structures . Therefore, Chapter 1 deals with the contextual information for this 
research study and provides the overall scope under which the research topic in particular and 
the thesis in general are anchored  upon. First, the Chapter presents the geographic al location 
of Zambia within African and the globe at large. Next, the Chapter discusses the rationale and 
background information for the research problem. The background section in a brief synthesis 
contextualises monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in the Zambian scenario and highlights how 
it is embedded in the framework of the government-wide (G-wide) or simply the WoGM&ES 
and as pursued within the scope of the NDPs. In that regard, the WoGM&ES is defined and 
described. The chapter then discusses the statement of the research problem. This aspect gives 
details about the discrepancy being investigated by the study. To have better understanding of 
the research topic and the study itself, the problem statement is presented. It also discusses the 
purpose and significance of the research study and does this by illustrating how relevant the 
findings of the research will be to M&E structures across government and to several non-state 
actors. The chapter provides justification and motivation for using Zambia as a case study 
country for this research.  
 
Further, Chapter 1 discusses the research objectives, broken down into primary and secondary 
objectives. Additionally, it elucidates the overall scope and limitations of the research study 
process. Further, the Chapter gives a brief methodological approach adopted to guide the study. 
This section introduces the qualitative approach as the method used to conduct this research.  
Before the conclusion, the chapter presents a list of key M&E concepts used in this thesis.

1.2 Geographical location of Zambia    
 
Zambia lies in a central position in southern Africa surrounded by eight other countries. It is a 
land-linked country between Angola in the west, Namibia,  Botswana and Zimbabwe in the 
south, Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania in the east, and the Democratic Republic of Congo 
in the north.  In terms of size, Zambia is 752 ,614 square kilometres . The capital city of 
Zambia is Lusaka. It is a member country of a number of continental and regional development 
blocs including the African Union (AU), Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), among others.  
Zambia’s location is between 8 and 18° South, and 22 and 34° East. Figure 1.1 below is a map 
showing the geographical location of Zambia in the African continent.

1.3 Rationale for the research problem  
 
Results, and in particular ‘development results’,  have become more sought after and 
emphasised by those who need the development benefits and those who provide the desired 
development. Because of this increasing demand for  development results, monitoring and 
evaluation pressure seems to be placed on the perceived providers of public goods and services 
to demonstrate some level of result or changes toward improving people’s wellbeing. The call 
for tangible development results has become a global phenomenon as a consequence.  
 
In addition, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development/Development 
Assistance Committee ( OECD/DAC) (2006)  observed that many countries, under the 
development approach called managing for development results ( MfDRs), have embarked on 
ensuring that efforts to manage results need to be top of the development agenda at all levels 
of development activity. The prioritisation and situating of results at the centre of any 
development intervention is on the understanding that decision making and related processes 
should be anchored on evidence-based data and information. Since the Monterrey Conference 
on Financing for Development in 2002, development agencies globally have seemingly rallied 
behind the common agenda of pursuing development results as a product of well -clarified 
intervention goals. Essentially, the Monterrey Conference was demanding shared global 
responsibility regarding management strategies towards the achievement of d evelopment 
results. This was to be attained through a new partnership for development, and increased 
commitment from developing and developed countries. While the developed countries were 
encouraged to fashion their policy support towards more effective ai d and trade with poor 
countries, the developing nations were challenged to increase their commitment to policies and 
actions that promoted economic growth and poverty reduction (World Bank, 1998; Schacter, 
2000; Cammack, 2007; World Bank, 2007c). 
 
Further, to have a clear context as to why and how this study would add value to Zambia’s 
public sector management and to the body of knowledge of M&E, it is important to appreciate 
the M&E function at global, continental (African) an d national (Zambian) level. This is 
important in situating the problem and in appreciating the holistic evolution of M&E in the 
broader development discourse and particularly in Zambia. A number of development 
stakeholders and practitioners today believe t hat well-functioning systems for M&E could be
<<<PAGE=23>>>

the link between unlocking the growth potentials of countries and organisations and realising 
desired poverty reduction goals. Segone (2010:22) states: 
 Within the social policy reform  debate occurring in several countries [….] it appears that the real 
challenge is in implementing policy reforms to translate policy statements into development results 
for vulnerable populations, including children and women. Strengthening national social  systems 
to implement policies is therefore paramount. For this, a strong country monitoring and evaluation 
system is crucial to provide essential information and analysis. A strong system will help to ensure 
such policies are being implemented in the most  effective and efficient manner; to review policy 
implementation and design; and, to detect bottlenecks and to inform on adjustments needed to 
enhance systemic capacities to deliver results. 
 
Striving for functional M&E systems has thus become a global phe nomenon that requires 
commitment by all stakeholders. Therefore, monitoring and evaluation of development 
interventions has become a vehicle that assists development agencies globally to demonstrate 
results to show to their stakeholders and beneficiaries. According to OECD/DAC (2010) and 
Williams (2016) , what constitutes a development ‘ result’ is a describable and measurable 
change that emanates from a cause -and-effect relationship. Simply put, a result denotes an 
output, an ou tcome or an impact, which may be intended or unintended, and positive or 
negative, that pertains to a given development intervention. Today, development agencies are 
undertaking major efforts to implement a results-based M&E agenda. This results approach is 
being pursued by many developing and transition countries using mechanisms such as their 
national strategies, plans, policies, programmes and projects (Bedi, Coudouel, Cox, Goldstein 
& Thornton, 2006; Görgens & Kusek, 2009; World Bank, 2014).  
 
Systems for M&E have been developed by governments and non -government actors as 
powerful management tools. According to Vietnam (2007), M&E systems ar e used by 
governments and organisations to show performance in terms of achieving desired outcomes 
and long -term development impact, more so in enhancing the function of accountability, 
feedback and learning. However, those who have made efforts to build M &E systems have 
stated that doing so is a long-term endeavour that demands a diversity of capacities from those 
who pursue such robust man agement and governance systems. Equally, Görgens and Kusek 
(2009) observed that governments and organisations around the world  seem to be under 
constant and growing pressure from their internal and external stakeholders, who demand that 
there should be focused attention on good governance, accountability and transparency. More 
evidently, in the developing world, where governance systems are viewed as weaker and 
characterised by increasing poverty levels, inequalities, disease burden, poor educational 
services and corruption, the question of good governance has been top of the development
<<<PAGE=24>>>

agenda for a long time. Other overarching s ocio-economic dilemmas in which these poor 
countries find themselves include broken -down justice systems, high unemployment levels, 
especially among the youth and women, weak institutions to deliver desired development, food 
insecurity and deteriorating political systems, leading to threatened democracies and economic 
stability. In Africa, these problems are rife, and governments and stakeholders are working 
towards resolving many of these problems. M&E functions are considered to be among the key 
ingredients to help resolve the dilemma.  
 
Therefore, contemporary thinking and practice suggests that functional M&E systems, if 
implemented well, have the potential to achieve development effectiveness and delivery of 
tangible results towards poverty alleviation and sustainable development. In support of this 
view, the World Bank (1999)  pointed out that through the use of effective M&E systems, 
tracking of performance for on-going activities at every level becomes feasible. This function 
makes a strong case for M&E as a cruci al results-based management tool (RBM) that could 
promote feedback loops, learning and improved performance for development intervention s. 
Table 1.1 gives details of the benefits that can be realised from functioning M&E systems. The 
M&E systems here are p osited as tools that promote RBM not only in public sector services, 
but in all processes of development, whether state or non-state.  
Table 1.1. Significance of monitoring and evaluation systems in the development process 
Why results-based M&E systems? Political conundrum of M&E systems 
M&E can be conducted at local, regional and national 
level. A functioning M&E system, at any level, provides 
a continuous flow of information that is useful internally 
and externally. Internal us e of information from the 
M&E system is a crucial management tool that helps 
managers ensure that specific targets ar e met. 
Information on progress is all vital to managers who are 
striving to achieve results.  
 
Likewise, the information from an M&E system  is 
important to those outside the public sector (or other 
organisations) who are expecting results and want to see 
demonstrable impacts. The information can build trust 
in a government or any other organisation that is striving 
to better the lives of its citizens or clients. M&E systems 
can help identify promising programmes or practices. 
They can help identify unintended, but perhaps useful, 
project, programme and policy results. M&E systems 
can help managers identify programme weaknesses and 
take action to correct them. M&E can be used to 
diminish fear within organisations and governments and 
to foster an open atmosphere in which people learn from 
mistakes, make improvements, and develop skills along 
the way. 
Implementing results -based M&E systems can pos e 
political challenges in developed and developing 
countries. It takes strong and consistent political 
leadership. Making results -based information 
available to the public can change the dynamics of 
institutional relations, budgeting and resource 
allocation, personal political agendas, and public 
perceptions of government. Strong, vested interests 
may feel threatened. There may be counter reformers 
within and outside the government/organisation who 
actively oppose M&E efforts. This makes the role of a 
strong champion key to ensuring the 
institutionalisation and sustainability of a results -
based M&E system. 
 
Results-based M&E systems are essential components 
of governance structures, and thus are fundamentally 
related to political and power systems. They prov ide 
critical information and empower policymakers to 
make better informed decisions. At the same time, the 
information may limit the options that can be justified, 
constraining decision makers’ room to manoeuvre.

According to Mackay and Gariba (2000) , aside from governments, other stakeholders are 
demanding for results-based performance and good governance. These include civil society, 
parliaments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), citizens, private se ctor, media houses, 
academia, international organisations and cooperating partners. In affirmation of this argument, 
Naidoo (2011) observed that for decades, there has been increasing demand for functional and 
performing governments and organisations from stakeholders across developed and developing 
economies. These demands have been uniform among stakeholders. At the centre, there have 
been increasing calls for more transparency, greater accountability and good governance from 
those who provide development interventions. The pressures have been around the desire to 
develop, implement and sustain results -based M&E systems. More specifically, governments 
and development agencies require sy stems that support the prudent management of policies, 
programmes, and projects ( Görgens & Kusek, 2009; Mosse & Sontheimer, 1996 ). A further 
contention is that functional M&E systems are irreplaceable, just as governments require 
human resources, and financial and accountability systems to assist in improving performance 
in service delivery and in enhancing development feedback mechanisms and processes 
(Mackay, 2006a; Smith, Nutley, Davies & Smith, 2009).  
 
Consequently, M&E systems can be viewed as tools of management that may bring about 
improvements in the performance of the public sector and other players in development spaces. 
Kusek and Rist (2004)  assert that owing to heightened and unprecedented demand, the 
functions of M&E have become a new phenomenon t hat has been developed and pursued to 
contribute to the betterment of public service management and to help attain good governance 
and sustainable development. It therefore stands that the functions of ‘monitoring’ and 
‘evaluation’ are effectively meant to determine the progress and performance of development 
policies and other interventions such as programmes and projects (World Ba nk, 2007c; 
Edmunds & Marchant, 2008; Hardlife & Zhou, 2013). 
 
When M&E is properly initiated, developed, owned and sustained, it can lead to the realisation 
of development aspirations (Development Bank of Southern Africa, 2000; GRZ, 2017b; 
UNAIDS, 2009). Therefore, although governments are implementing various socio-economic 
reforms, including public finance, strategic planning, judicial systems and investment profiling, 
reforms in M&E are also fundamental. For example, in pursuit of good governance practices, 
many governments have embarked on strengthening their M&E functions.
<<<PAGE=26>>>

Country-led systems of M&E are a concept whose time has come. A growing number of 
developing and transition countries and most , if not all developed countries are devoting 
considerable attention and effort to their national M&E systems. Many do not label it as such—
it may be called evidence-based policy-making, performance-based budgeting, or results-based 
management for example —but at the core is an evidentiary system for public sector 
management that relies on the regular collection of mon itoring information and the regular 
conduct of evaluations (Segone, 2009:169). 
 
Segone’s view  makes a strong case for M&E reforms and does so by linking the global 
economy’s preoccupat ion with enhancing good governance and poverty reduction to the 
phenomenon of M&E. There seems to be serious rethinking among countries in the developed 
world and their counterparts in the developing world about using M&E to improve their 
performances. Hardlife and Zhou (2013)  also contend that the emerging consensus on 
institutionalising and embracing M&E comes from ex tensive discontentment in the 
performances of the majority of development programmes at the present moment. In particular, 
the emerging and seemingly deteriorating living standards of the masses, which constitute ill 
health, illiteracy, malnutrition, economic deprivation, among other challenges, have prompted 
governments and other development agencies to create systems for M&E. These unwanted and 
unwarranted vices are making the need for M&E greater across the globe (GRZ, 2017a; 
Mackay, 2006b; Kusek, 2011).  
 
Hence, there seems to be an overarching point of decision by development practitioners that 
M&E requires attention at the core to achieve increased country growth and development. To 
that extent, Segone (2010) adds that broad-based consensus seems to have been reached among 
key stakeholders, including countries, donors and i nternational agencies. The common 
agreement is that M&E systems for national development strategies and the implementation of 
policy reforms need not only to be spearheaded by the developing countries, but owned, 
controlled and sustained by them. While thi s was being achieved, the international 
development agencies and cooperating partners (CPs) were expected to assist in building the 
M&E capacities of developing countries. Consequently, the M&E crusade is believed to have 
swept through the globe, cascading  down to Africa, to individual governments and single 
organisations (Naidoo, 2011; Kusek & Rist, 2004; ABSA, 2000 ; Asian Development Bank, 
2011).

From the discussion about the possible benefits from stronger M&E systems, a case has been 
established for Zambia’s quest to build, implement and sustain a functional M&E system for 
the entire public sector. The government today is challenged to rise to the occasion and pursue 
an ambitious reform agenda. Such a system is needed to enhance the good governance system 
of the country. In response, the Zambian Government is already implementing an M&E system 
that is aimed at providing evidenc e-based management and decision making information for 
development stakeholders. Creating M&E functions embedded in the framework of the public 
sector management has become inevitable because of internal pressure from civil society, 
parliament, academia, ordinary citizens, etc ., which includes increased demand for 
transparency and accountability and external pressure, such as calls  for effectiveness and 
efficiency in the utilisation of donor aid from multilateral and bilateral donors. The system for 
Zambia is referred to as the government -wide (G -Wide) M&E system, which is being 
implemented to track deliverables and results from across the public sector (GRZ, 2017b). 
 
The government is optimistic that the G -Wide M&E system will work as a significant tool in 
enhancing the management of public resources and related development processes (GRZ, 
2014a, 2017b). However, as to whether the G-Wide M&E system is currently fully functional 
is the reason that this research study has been commissioned. In this thesis, a disclaimer is made 
by this author that the name ‘whole -of-government M&E system’ (WoGM&ES) is preferred 
to the ‘government-wide M&E system’ (G-Wide M&E system). Thus, although the two names 
mean the same thing, ‘whole-of-government M&E system (WoGM&ES) is preferred and will 
be used in this thesis to refer to the Zambian G-Wide M&E system.  
 
Hlatshwayo and Govender (2015)  define a WoGM&ES as a comprehen sive system that 
represents an integrated all -encompassing framework of M&E principles and practices and 
standards to be used throughout government to improve poverty reduction interventions, which 
include policies, programmes, projects, processes and practices. Such a system operates at the 
highest level, but draws its information from lower -level functional components and 
government structures to deliver useful M&E products for its users. A functional WoG -M&E 
system should sustain development through appr opriate and timely information for use to 
improve programme design and decision  making in order to foster enhanced development 
impact and good governance (Bedi et al., 2006; Elkins, 2006; World Bank, 2007c; Guzman, 
2014; Simister, 2009; Engela & Ajam, 2010). In other words, Edmunds and Marchant (2008) 
emphasise that an M&E system that is fully evolved not only fulfil s the function of tracking
<<<PAGE=28>>>
9 
 
and measuring development results, but represents a central aspect in the holistic poverty 
reduction agenda.  
 
Therefore, around the world, M&E has increasingly become popular in the implementation of 
poverty reduction strategies. This has been due mainly to the anticipated benefits that are 
associated with it ( Kanyamuna, 2013; ADB, 2014 ). Similarly, Morra Imas and Rist (2009)  
observed that owing to internal and external pressures and demands to improve public 
management, many governments have employed results-based M&E to help track progress by 
demonstrating the effect of development policies, programmes and projects. For Naidoo 
(2011), M&E has become an evolutionary field of specialisation, especially in the past two 
decades. Suffice to say, there is a growing body of literature with a broadening community of 
practice in which professionals such as ‘evaluators’ are being recognised. 
 
Therefore, given the importance of Zambia’s WoGM&ES to the country’s good govern ance 
crusade, it becomes crucial that the system should be fully developed to provide the much-
needed information for all stakeholders when they require it. As a relatively new phenomenon 
in the public sector and in mainstream national development planning , the Zambian 
WoGM&ES may be functional in i ts current form, but is potentially  lacking in particular 
critical areas. This suspicion led to the research study to make a comprehensive assessment of 
the WoGM&ES and an analysis to offer insight into what need s to be improved. It was 
important to undertake this research because the findings and recommendations could go a long 
way towards building, strengthening and sustaining Zambia’s public sector WoGM&ES.  
 
1.4 Background to the research study   
 
The contemporary evolution of M&E in the Zambian public sector can generally be traced back 
to the beginning of the new millennium in 2000, and in particular to wards the end of the 
twentieth century in 1999. In that period, the World Bank, working alongside the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), launched the Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRSs) as an alternative to 
the controversial Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) of the 1990s, which saw most poor 
countries plunge into unsustainable external debt (Booth & Lucas, 2002; Hauge, 2001; Serra 
& Stiglitz, 2008).
<<<PAGE=29>>>
10 
 
In 2000, Zambia developed its Interim Poverty Reduction  Strategy Paper (I -PRSP 2000 —
2002) and progressively, the full PRSP (2002—2004) was launched and implemented, together 
with other reforms in 2002. After the successful implementation of the full PRSP, Zambia 
qualified for external debt relief in 2004, as prescribed for a country that reached the Heavily 
Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative1 completion point (David Booth, 2005; DBSA, 2000; 
GRZ, 2006; World Bank, 1999, 2005b). 
 
In addition, some reforms were made and in 2005/6, Zambia reverted to the National 
Development Planning Approach, which was previously, discontinued from 1991 to 2001 with 
the change of the pol itical regime from the United Independence Party (UNIP) government 
under Kaunda to the Chiluba regime of the Movement for Multi -Party Democracy (MMD). 
Essentially, Zambia had no national development plans (NDPs) for that ten -year period and 
favoured the ma rket-led liberalised economy in which government was expected only to 
provide macroeconomic and fiscal policy stability frameworks (GRZ, 2006; Mulungushi, 
2007). After Zambia’s political independence from the British government in 1964, four NDPs 
were formulated up to 1991, of which the first three were implemented fully, while the fourth 
was implemented partially and cut short to make way for multiparty politics in 1991. Thus, 
after the general elections of 1991, NDPs were discontinued.  
 
However, the Mwanawasa regime re verted to national planning in 2005/2006 to break away 
from the ten years of no NDPs under the Chiluba regime. The Fifth National Development Plan 
(FNDP 2006 –2010) continued from the four NDPs that had been implemented under the 
Kaunda regime (1964 -1991).2 After the FNDP, Zambia implemented the Sixth National  
Development Plan (SNDP 2011 –2015), which was revised (Revised Sixth National 
Development Plan (R -SNDP) 2013–2016) soon after the government of the Patriotic Front 
(PF) assumed power in 2011. Currently, the country is implementing the Seventh NDP (7NDP) 
covering the period 2017 to 2021 under the theme ‘Accelerating Development Efforts Towards 
Vision 2030 Without Leaving Anyone Behind’. 
 
                                                 
1 Under the World Bank and IMF guidance, many developing countries were required to implement country -led 
poverty reduction strategy papers as a conditionality to access pardon of external debt from the late 1990s until 
the end of the 2000 decade. That meant reaching agreed-upon macro-economic and fiscal benchmarks under what 
was coined the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Completion Point (HIPC). For Zambia, the completion point was 
attained in 2004 and US$4.8 billion external debt was pardoned. 
2 The fourth NDP was not fully impl emented owing to economic instabilities that rocked the country during the 
entry of the multiparty system. This confusion led to the premature discontinuation of the fourth NDP in 1990/91.
<<<PAGE=30>>>
11 
 
Nonetheless, Zambia’s return to national development planning in 200 5/6 came after a fairly 
successful implementation of two poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), which were 
prepared under the guidance of the World Bank and the IMF. PRSPs, however, in their original 
version are no longer implemented in Zambia. NDPs ar e the current national development 
vehicles to tackle poverty and are designed to help realise the country’s nat ional long-term 
vision (NLTV), currently Vision 2030 —of becoming a prosperous middle -income nation by 
2030, which is being pursued as the aspira tion of the Zambian people (GRZ, 2006). Thus, all 
other development frameworks are anchored on the NLTV (GRZ, 2014b, 2017b).   
 
The fundamental differences between PRSPs and NDPs lie in their formulation and 
implementation. Intrinsically, these strategies have a common objec tive, that of poverty 
reduction and citizenry empowerment. However,  PRSPs in Zambia were medium -term plans 
that were prepared and implemented strictly under the guidance of the two Bretton Woods 
institutions, Word Bank and the IMF (Booth, 2005; Booth & Lucas, 2002; GRZ, 2006) The 
emphasis was for stakeholders such as the civil society, academia, parliament, ordinary people 
and interest groups to take part in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation 
of those PRSPs. Country ownership was the focus, whether perceived or realistic (GRZ, 2006).  
 
NDPs are a significant shift from the PRSP concept, in that NDPs are first prepared within the 
context of fulfilling a n NLTV (GRZ, 2005b & 2014a) . Second, NDPs are formulated, 
implemented, monitored and evaluated by local stakeholders who agree on a common national 
development agenda. NDPs are not regulated by the World Bank, IMF  or other external 
stakeholders, but the views of such cooperating partners are welcome in the planning, 
budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation processes. Further, NDPs contain 
public investment programmes or simply capital investments, while  PRSPs were targeted at 
funding recurrent expenditures that directly or indirectly supported poverty reduction, to the 
extent that programmes in the annual budgets were tagged Poverty Reduction Programmes 
(PRPs), hence ring-fenced (GRZ, 2000, 2002 & 2016).  
 
Table 1.2 provides a summary of all the NDPs that have been implemented since independence 
in 1964. The key focus area for each plan is highlighted to indicate the effort pursued to reduce 
poverty and improve the lives of the majority of Zambians.

Table 1.2. National Development Plans for Zambia from 1964 to 2021 
NDP PERIOD STRATEGIC FOCUS 
First  1966–1970 Elimination of obstacles to economic and social development through 
establishment of conditions for dynamic and sustained growth  
Second  1972–1976 Building up of the country's economic and social infrastructure while laying 
the foundations for a more balanced economic development of the country 
Third  1979–1983 
 
To address the sluggish growth performance and foreign exchange difficulties 
attributable mainly to disruptions caused to the country’s supply routes, oil 
crisis, world recession and the collapse of copper prices experienced during 
the Second National Development Plan 
Fourth  1989–1993 Growth with own resources: The focus was to restore the economic equilibria, 
achieve a more efficient allocation of human, financial and material resource, 
expand the productive base and capacity of the economy. This plan was 
discontinued in 1991  
Liberalisation 1991–2001 No NDPs for the whole period. Economic growth was determined by the 
market forces while Government provided a thriving policy environment for 
the private sector. This approach was rescinded and NDPs were later re -
introduced in 2005/2006  
I-PRSP 2000–2001 The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I -PRSP) briefly outlined 
Zambia’s past efforts towards poverty reduction. The I -PRSP mapped out 
Zambia’s development goals and indicated the strategies that were to be 
employed to attain those goals. I-PRSP was done through the guidance of the 
World Bank and IMF  
PRSP 2002–2004 The PRSP focused on measures to achieve a strong and sustained economic 
growth. A growing economy that creates jobs and tax revenues for the state 
was deemed a sustainable powerful tool for reducing poverty. Growth was to 
be broad-based, thereby promoting income -generation, linkages, and equity. 
The World Bank and IMF were at the centre of implementing the PRSP 
through various conditionalities. In 2004, Zambia was forgiven of its external 
debt in excess of USD5 billion  
TNDP 2002–2005 The Transitional National Development Plan (TNDP) drew heavily on the 
invaluable work of the PRSP Working Groups by converting PRSP chapters 
into TNDP format. The theme of the TNDP was ‘Sustained Growth, 
Employment Creation and Poverty Reduction’. The plan focused on 
agricultural development as the engine of income expansion in the economy.  
FNDP 2006–2010 The theme of the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) was ‘Broad based 
wealth and job creation through citizenry participation and technological 
advancement ‘. The focus of this plan was wealth and job creation. The FNDP 
was the first plan to be implemented after the economy was liberalised in 2001  
SNDP 2011–2015  The theme of the SNDP was ‘Sustained economic growth and poverty 
reduction ‘. This plan h ad a focus on accelerated infrastructure and human 
development, enhanced economic growth and diversification, and promotion 
of rural development. The main thrust was to promote policies, strategies and 
programmes that will contribute significantly to addre ssing the challenges of 
realising broad -based pro -poor growth, employment creation and human 
development  
R-SNDP 2012–2016  The Revised Sixth National Development Plan 2013-2016 (R-SNDP) was the 
revision of the Sixth National Development Plan 2011-2015 to take on board 
the priorities of the Patriotic Front (PF) Government. The theme of the R -
SNDP was ‘People Centred Economic Growth and Development ’ and 
focused on public capital investments biased towards rural development and 
job creation so as to achieve inclusive growth 
Seventh  2017–2021  The 7th NDP theme is accelerating development efforts towards the Vision 
2030 without leaving anyone behind. Using an integrated multi -sectoral 
approach, the plan focuses on five (5) pillars of Economic diversification and 
Job creation; Poverty and Vulnerability Reduction; Enhanced Human 
Development; Reducing Development Inequalities; and Creating a conducive 
governance environment for a diversified economy

M&E has been a core component in all the NDPs from 2006  (FNDP). However, none of the 
four NDPs under the Kaunda and UNIP r egime articulated M&E functions, n or were there 
designated M&E chapters and sections in the manner we understand M&E today. To that 
extent, all these recent development plans (2006 to date) carried separately elaborated chapters 
on M&E, outlining the details of how the government and other stakeholders were going to 
holistically tackle the issue of NDP M&E arrangements. As a result, over the years the country 
has seen a lot of interest by stakeholders in public sector performance vis -à-vis the 
WoGM&ES. M&E seems to have become significant not only to the Zambian government, but 
also to the citizens and other stakeholders. Invariably, M&E  is understood to be an effective 
instrument towards the determination of the extent to which outputs were achieving expected 
outcomes and impacts (Görgens & Kusek, 2009; GRZ, 2017b; Mackay, 2007 ; Pitman, 
Feinstein &  Ingram, 2005). It would therefore b e desirable that the Zambian Government 
should benefit from these positive attributes that accompany a functional M&E system across 
the public sector. 
 
In addition, it could be observed that the development of a country -level system for M&E in 
the Zambian government is a relatively recent undertaking that emerged only in the early 
2000s. OECD/DAC (2005, 2007, 2009, 2011)  and World Bank  (2005a), under its 
Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF), undertook some assessments to review how 
responsively Zambia’s monitoring mechanisms 3 functioned. In all the assessments, they 
allegedly found that Zambia had weaker monitoring arrangements against the targets set under 
the 2005 Paris Declaration (PD) and CDF. The CDF and PD are both international development 
agreements that represent an e volution in the roles of governments, donors, civil society, 
academia and the private sector in global development through empowering people to take 
charge of their lives; reaffirming that poverty is a phenomenon that results from lack of basic 
individual and social rights that allow people to lead the kind of lives they value (DBSA, 2000). 
 
The findings from these assessm ents, coupled with local Zambian reports such as annual 
progress reports (APRs) and economic status reports, all claimed that Zambia’s M&E 
arrangements were not functioning as desired. This overall assertion of a weak position for 
Zambia’s national -level M &E arrangements is the motivation for this research study. The 
                                                 
3 The phrase ‘monitoring mechanisms’ here was used to mean the ‘monitoring and evaluation systems’ for a 
given country.

conclusions by these reviews need to be interrogated further with a scientific approach, 
deserving meticulousness and rigour. Undoubtedly, the OECD/DAC and World Bank are 
credible and authentic  world-class institutions, whose findings are appropriate to be used as 
basis for a much deeper investigation, a local and critically inward -looking study to bring out 
underlying issues that could help build and sustain a stronger WoGM&ES for the Zambian 
public sector. Details of these study findings by the OECD/DAC and World Bank are discussed 
in section 1.4 below. 
  
More efforts and reforms will be required to improve Zambia's WoGM&ES. The M&E 
problems that currently face the system come in various forms and scales and are spread across 
all levels of the civil service. Further, these M&E problems spill -over to non-state actors who 
have a stake and are partners in the provision of public goods and services (GRZ, 2015, 2016, 
2017a, OECD/DAC, 2007, 2011 & World Bank, 2005a ; Chigunta & Matshalaga, 2010 ). For 
instance, many government reports and other institutional findings have shown that Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES is not sufficiently developed to offer the kinds of data, information and knowledge 
that are demanded to assist in decision -making processes such as in policy making, planning, 
budgeting and implementati on of development interventions at many levels (GRZ, 2010, 
2011b, 2012, 2013, 2014a, 2015, 2016 & 2017a). Thus, these obstacles pose a practical threat 
to the holistic re-engineering and strengthening of the WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2016 & 2017a).  
 
In the absence of a detailed study to provide a comprehensive diagnostic invest igation and 
analysis of these complex problematic aspects, attaining a stronger WoGM&ES becomes far -
fetched. The motivation to pursue this study was to contribute to a functional WoGM&ES that 
would contribute to a better managed Zambian public sector, anch ored on a sustained good 
governance culture, through the provision of quality stakeholder -specific, relevant and timely 
data and information for better governing. Given such a holistic system, there would be clear 
linkages and information flows among stakeholders that would inform all development efforts 
towards poverty reduction. Therefore, this research study was motivated to find out the M&E 
challenges that face Zambia's public sector. In addition to the broader challenges identified in 
reports, this study sought to undertake an in -depth and holistic assessment of M&E issues on 
which innovative insights and recommendations for future improvements and sustainability 
would be provided. The diagnosis was instituted to probe the root causes and provide holistic 
and targeted and appropriate suggestions for resolving the problems facing the WoGM&ES.
<<<PAGE=34>>>

The pursuit of a robust, functional and sustained WoGM&ES for Zambia will be recommended 
to build a results -based information system that generates and makes availa ble to all 
stakeholders a wealth of information and knowledge that is key to transformational sustainable 
development for the country. Such a process will be undertaken with a long -term horizon in 
mind, knowing the complex nature of building one WoGM&ES, especially implemented under 
limited resources.  
 
The entry point for contributing to a strengthened WoGM&ES was to undertake a research 
study to establish to what level of development the M&E system for Zambia has evolved in 
relation to its expected functi onality and support to the national governance system. As 
expressed by World Bank (2000:1), “readiness assessments can help countries diagnose their 
M&E capacity and thereby determine the resources available to support such systems in terms 
of where in government to begin from, what incentives are in place, and what demand exists 
for such information”.  
 
Currently, no known research study has been undertaken at the level of doctorate degree in 
Zambia to offer a cr itical analysis and to suggest recommendations for improvement of a 
WoGM&ES. In addition, not only does this discrepancy exist in the academi c fraternity in 
Zambia, but there is  a dearth of structured and focused studies and holistic assessments that 
give thorough insight into the status of Zambia’s WoGM&ES. For example, a few years ago, 
an ad hoc exercise was conducted, with assistance from donors, to assess the gaps and 
challenges in implementing a good WoGM&ES in Zamb ia. The major limitation of that  
exercise in 2014 was that although it brought out important aspects pertaining to the country 
M&E system, the scope and audience were narrow, covering only a few stakeholders as 
respondents, drawn mainly from line ministries based in the capital city, Lusaka (GRZ, 2014d). 
Such approaches, which were undertaken in a context of weak scientific methodological 
designs, were constrained in producing evidence-based data and information that would prove 
crucial to reforming the M&E architecture in the country. That is why this study is crucial for 
Zambia. It will not only enhance current efforts, but will also work as a solid foundation for 
future studies in research and practice in the broader discipline of development studies , 
particularly under M&E specialisations.  
 
This research study therefore sought to examine Zambia's WoGM&ES, identified gaps, and 
suggested salient improvements in building and sustaining stronger M&E arrangements for the
<<<PAGE=35>>>
16 
 
government. It was also interested in establi shing best practices embedded in the current 
WoGM&ES. It was important to establish the positive aspects and gaps in the national system 
before suggesting new ways of strengthening the holistic system of M&E in Zambia.  
 
1.5 Statement of the research problem    
 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) have been supported by experts and practitioners of 
development management as important ingredients in the pursuit of good governance and in 
enhancing the achievement of poverty reduction objectives by governments and  other 
development agencies. More so, stronger systems for M&E have come to be understood as 
fundamental requirements in good governance crusades around the globe (Kusek & Rist, 2004 
& Mackay, 2007) . Therefore, this research study strongly upholds this view and establishes 
that building and sustaining a stronger WoG M&ES for Zambia is the  bedrock for a positive 
strife towards a better Zambia.     
  
Despite many public sector reforms being implemented by the government to strengthen 
Zambia's public sector management, especially M&E arrangements and practice, more work 
remains to be done to make Zambia’s country -level M&E system functional to meet the 
expectations of stakeholders across the economy and beyond. There are currently some notable 
indications suggesting that Zambia’s WoGM&ES had a number of gaps which required fixing 
at various levels. The findings of the OECD/DAC surveys (OECD/DAC, 2005, 2007a, 2011b) 
and the assessment by the World Bank’s CDF (2005) alleged that Zambia’s WoGM&ES was 
weak. According to the OECD/DAC (2011) Monitoring Survey on the implementation of the 
Paris Declaration (PD) as measured under Indicator 11 (Managing for results4), Zambia scored 
a ‘D’ for its results-oriented frameworks in 2005, improving to a ‘C’ in 2007, and maintaining 
its ‘C’ score in 2011. This led to a shortfall in reaching the 2010 target of B or A. Despite this 
failure to reach the PD set target, the trend suggested that Zambia had made significant strides 
over the years towards bettering the M&E at national level. The scores of ‘C’ for 2007 and 
2011 could be translated as Zambia having improved frameworks of M&E across the public 
sector. By implication, this could mean that Zambia was  on course in terms of satisfying the 
PD agreement of having results frameworks that could be monitored.  
                                                 
4 ‘Managing for results’ refers to expected programme results and delivering programmes or services, monitoring 
and evaluating performance, and making adjustments to improve both efficiency and ef fectiveness and also it is 
about functional feedback mechanisms.
<<<PAGE=36>>>
17 
 
In addition, World Bank (2005a) in its CDF report noted that Zambia’s monitoring framework 
was insufficient. After monitoring the four CDF principles, namely long-term holistic vision, 
country-led partnership, country ownership, and results focus, although there were signs of 
advancement for all, the principle of focus on results showed the least progress. This conclusion 
is crucial to Zambia’s country-level M&E reform agenda. 
 
Further, particular problematic areas identified concerned the quality of final reports, which 
contained many analytical gaps and inconsistencies in information flows. Su ch challenges 
emanated from weak data collection and analysis arrangements at all levels, and functional, 
coordination and linkage gaps between the national level M&E and line ministry M&E systems 
(Kanyamuna, 2013; Chigunta & Matshalaga, 2010; OECD/DAC, 2011a).  
 
The challenges faced by Zambia’s WoGM&ES have been evident in APRs. Evaluation and 
economic reports have highlighted problematic areas faced by the M&E arrangements in the 
public sector. These included limited evidence -based policy making and programme design; 
weak linkages between programmes in the medium -term NDPs and annual budgets; 
fragmented systems of data collection, analysis and dissemination; uncoordinated M&E 
activities; and multiplicity of IT systems arising partly from limited coordination between 
government and cooperating partners (CPs). The status of M&E across government is 
understood to be at different levels of development and application. This is coupled with erratic 
or no resources being allocated to M&E activities (GRZ, 2007, 2011b; 2015; AfCoP-MfDRs, 
2014). 
 
Therefore, there is a no scientifically grounded research study that offers sound process and 
record of the problems, and identifies wh ere the problems are situated and what practical 
solutions and recommendations may help to strengthen the WoGM&ES. Although informative 
and insightful, the information from these assessments and reviews was not analysed succinctly 
and packaged for remedial improvements. At most, the reports and observations could be used 
only as pointers to the problems in the WoGM&ES. In their current situation, the broader 
problematic areas and recommendations in the assessments by the World Bank and 
OECD/DAC require further analysis and detail so that action points for improvement could be 
identified. Thus, to meaningfully reach the root causes of these purported weaknesses and 
challenges, a study should be undertaken that is holistic and comprehensive. A research study 
is needed to produce implementable recommendations aimed at bettering M&E practice at all
<<<PAGE=37>>>
18 
 
levels of government for Zambia’s public sector. It was the aim of this study to achieve that 
objective. This research study was initiated and commissioned to provide this gap analysis. The 
results and findings offer a myriad of options to improve the general and specific challenges 
and aspects of the WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector. To undertake this broad-based task, 
the study interrogated the functionality of the WoGM&ES in the context of NDPs and within 
the ultimate pursuant of objectives in Vision 2030. 
 
The gaps in practice and the literature need to be bridged with new information from a 
contemporary study. Since the OECD/DAC and the World Bank are principally multilateral 
international organisations, their assessments of the Zambian M&E system and its functionality 
could have not been as intensive as possible to reach a ll aspects of the public sector —
Ministries, Provinces and other Spending Agencies (MPSAs). Small samples of government 
and non-state institutions and structures were considered in the assessments at the expense of 
key aspects of the M&E arrangements at district, provincial and sector level (OECD/DAC, 
2005, 2007a; World Bank, 2005a) . Neglecting assessments at such structures denies an 
appreciation of the action  points for improvement at those levels. Despite the shortfalls, 
however, the results of these assessments by the OECD/DAC and World Bank provided useful 
signs of gaps that demand more research to find means of remedying the weaknesses in the 
M&E arrangements.                
 
Certainly, and with the obtaining socioeconomic hardships, the country was experiencing such 
as the high and fluctuating inflation rates, worsening exchange rates, high unemployment, and 
high inequalities, the Zambian government would be in a hurry to build and sustain a stronger 
WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2014a, 2017a). The M&E function in public administration is paramount 
in promoting poverty alleviation, gender e quality, democratisation and equity, human rights, 
infrastructure development, thriving public service performance, urban development and 
environment. For that reason, many stakeholders are calling for strengthened M&E (Booth & 
Lucas, 2002; DBSA, 2000; Mackay & Gariba, 2000). Such a system would be vital for Zambia 
in bringing prudence and sanity to public resource management, in arresting wastage by public 
servants and systems, and ultimately in promoting accoun tability, transparency and good 
governance. Therefore, this research study undertook an in-depth investigation to ascertain why 
such weaknesses have been predominant over the years and to innovate ways of improvement.
<<<PAGE=38>>>
19 
 
The study sought to answer such core questions as: 
 Why is it significant to implement a WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector?  
 Why is monitoring and evaluation important in good governance?  
 What are the gaps that inhibit the implementation of a stronger WoGM&ES for 
Zambia’s public sector?  
 What ingredients are necessary for building a stronger WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public 
sector?  
 Why think differently? Does Zambia’s WoGM&ES require an overhaul or a re-
engineered framework for M&E? 
 What are the recommendations for improvement at different levels of Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES? 
 
It is aimed that the research findings should assist in driving the reform agenda of building a 
robust, user friendly and sustainable WoGM&ES for the Zambian Government. It is also the 
goal of the study to contribute to the wealth of knowledge on the subject matter of M&E with 
regard to public sector M&E practice and holistically to good governance public management 
reforms. 
 
In Zambia, particularly among public sector institutions, M&E systems are relatively new. 
Hence, there is not much literature on the evolution of M&E systems in government. However, 
the demand for results -based management and performance -related management by 
stakeholders has necessitated functional M&E systems at various levels of government (see 
section 5.7). A WoGM&ES has also been demanded for the public sector, on which all other 
M&E arrangements should be anchored. 
 
Hence, this study should add to the limited body of literature on the evolution and functionality 
of M&E systems in Zambia’s public sector. For the government of Zambia and interested 
stakeholders, the results of the study might set benchmarks to assist in designing and 
strengthening M&E systems. Knowledge of the importance of functional M&E systems would 
eventually reach the citizens, who should appreciate such systems as useful management tools 
in development programming as the country moves towards good governance and stable socio-
economic stability (Palumbo, 1987; Hardlife & Zhou, 2013).

1.6 Research objectives    
 
The following objectives have been formulated. 
 
1.6.1 Primary objective  
To analyse Zambia's public sector monitoring and evaluation  arrangements in the context of 
national development plans to bring about a strengthened results -based whole-of-government 
M&E system. The analysis covered Zam bia’s National Development planning  for the period 
1964 to 2021 (Independence to date).    
 
1.6.2 Secondary objectives  
i. To use the theory of change to ju stify the theoretical significance of Zambia's 
WoGM&ES to improve public-sector good governance and poverty reduction agenda. 
ii. To present Zambia as a case study in terms of the results-based WoGM&ES.  
iii. To identify gaps inhibiting the implementation of a resu lts-focused WoGM&ES for 
Zambia’s public sector.  
iv. To ascertain cornerstones necessary for building a results -based WoGM&ES for 
Zambia’s public sector.  
v. To propose a new model for the enhanced WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector.  
vi. To suggest and recommend imp rovements at different levels of Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES. 
 
1.7 Significance of the study   
 
The question ‘Why build a strengthened results -based WoGM&ES?’  as a public sector 
management tool for Zambia is crucial for several reasons. Fundamental questions to help 
policy and decision makers determine whether development promises were kept and outcomes 
achieved could be provided by a functional results -based M&E system. To demonstrate 
whether these improvements have occurred and the reasons that certain results have been 
achieved, governments and organisations use M&E systems (Davies, Nutley & Smith, 1999; 
Mackay, 2008; Laguna, 2011).  
 
As in many other African countries, this study is topical in Zambia and is being undertaken at 
a time that there is heightened i nterest in the assessment of government performance, locally 
and internationally (Kusek & Rist, 2004:2; see also GRZ, 2017b). Hardlife and Zhou (2013:72)
<<<PAGE=40>>>
21 
 
stress that “there has been an evolution in the field of M&E involving a movement away from 
traditional implementation -based approaches towards new results -based approaches ”. The 
importance of national systems for M&E in helping governments to impr ove their service 
delivery to the public has been established, and an effort to link M&E to good governance 
practices has been made. According to GRZ (2014b), that is why NDPs have detailed M&E 
arrangements to emphasise the linkages between the plans and the desired results. When 
implemented successfully, the performance of all government policies, programmes and 
projects would be measurable using a well -organised and functioning M&E system (Mackay, 
2010; Schultz, 2009; Gomez, Olivera & Velasco, 2009). Therefore, this research study will be 
significant at various levels of the Zambian WoGM&ES particularly at national, line ministry 
or sector, provincial and decentralised district level. Also, the study will provide M&E-related 
information to quasi government and non -state actors such as civil society, academia, 
cooperating partners and research institutions. The Zambian citizenry will utilise the findings 
of this research in appreciating the role of M&E in nation building and the ways in which the 
systems for M&E can be instrumental to the development cycle.  
 
Past studies by the World Bank and OECD/DAC showed a gap in Zambia's WoGM&ES. These 
studies attempted to identify missing areas, but their conclusions and recommendations were 
too broad, making it difficult to use them practically for targeted improvements. For example, 
the studies identified general coordination weaknesses within the government -wide M&E 
arrangements and lack of analysis of information, without providing details about causes and 
possible remedies. Additional unclear aspects include non -specificities about the locations of 
the problematic areas in the WoGM&ES, and vague or no suggested actions for improvement. 
The findings were reported broadly and the absence of details led to problems in effecting 
corrections. 
 
The literature does not specify what needs to  be done at various levels of Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES. Other areas that are not discussed in the literature involve M&E arrangements in 
parastatal and quasi-government institutions and among non -state actors. There is a problem 
with the way in which M&E issues are coordinated at these structures of government and with 
supporting institutions. Although it is understood that some efforts to have M&E activities in 
most of these structures are already in place, it has yet to be proven how adequately articulated 
and harnessed these developments could be in contributing to the evolutional agenda for a 
modern WoGM&ES in Zambia. In the current literature, the roles of research institutions and
<<<PAGE=41>>>
22 
 
the central statistical office (CSO) are not clear in promoting the evolution of  M&E culture. 
Again, if such efforts exist, the literature has not shown these interlinkages among critical 
government and non-state stakeholders in the Zambian economy.        
 
This research study is aimed at bridging the lacuna in the literature. The res earch rationale 
contends that in the absence of a robust and functional M&E system across government and 
beyond, it is not feasible to track performance and learn lessons in future as a country (section 
1.2). As a consequence, the country is more likely to  spend public resources on a 'business as 
usual' basis, where poor accountability, corruption and bad governance prevail because a 
comprehensive M&E system that gives early warning signs is not in place. Table 1.3 
demonstrates the significance of M&E in measuring development results. 
 
Table 1.3. Power of measuring results 
If you do not measure results, you cannot tell success from failure 
If you cannot see success, you cannot reward it 
If you cannot reward success, you are probably rewarding failure 
If you cannot see success, you cannot learn from it 
If you cannot recognize failure, you cannot correct it 
If you cannot demonstrate results, you cannot win public support

Therefore, this research study is significant and justifiable in many ways.  
 
1.7.1 Transforming and promoting the results culture in Zambia  
In conformity with the African Community of Practice (AfCoP) on Managing for Development 
Results (MfDRs) pursued under the Africa for Results (AFRIK4R) initiative, this research will 
help to inculcate a results culture in Zambia and enhance the results agenda that the African 
continent is currently promoting.  All African countries are expected to vigorously adopt the 
MfDRs approach in all their development endeavours that are implementable through these six 
pillars:  
i. Leadership for results

This study has come at an appropriate time to link Zambia’s reform agenda with that of the 
continent in building stronger systems for M&E by focusing on results to help transform the 
lives of the impoverished and attain good governance for sustained socio-economic growth and 
development (AfCoP-MfDRs, 2014; IEG, 2007; Prennushi, Rubio & Subbarao, 2001).  
 
1.7.2 Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation function at national level  
At national level, this research study will provide clarity about why and how M&E 
arrangements are necessary to assist the government achieve its good governance and poverty 
reduction agenda. For the WoGM&ES to operate functionally, there must be an apex institution 
with systemic and expert capacities to play the role of oversight and champion for M&E 
regime. A nchored on a stable national policy, institutional, organisational and legal 
frameworks, this study aims to give guidance and suggestions for a capable national -level 
structure to be in full charge of lower -level M&E structural linkages (horizontal and ver tical) 
(GRZ, 2017b).  
 
In addition, the findings of this research will be useful in informing high -level structures of 
government, such as Cabinet Office, Ministry of National Development Planning, Ministry of 
Finance, Parliament and the Presidency of the benefits of investing in a functional M&E system 
across the public sector.  
 
1.7.3 Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation function at sector level 
Another crucial contribution of this research study will be at sector or line ministry level. The 
envisaged scope and functionality of the WoGM&ES is in such a way that the M&E linkages 
of all line ministries with national -level structure, lower -level structures of government and 
other stakeholders are clear and streamlined in terms of data flows and information sharing (c 
GRZ, 2014c & 2017a) . To that extent, the study has made  innovative suggestions about 
strengthening relationships and operations of M& E at all those levels, so that together, the 
arrangements are complementary and robust enough to support a functional WoGM&ES for 
Zambia.
<<<PAGE=43>>>
24 
 
1.7.4 Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation function at provincial level 
The ten provinces of Zambia make up the greater part of government’s mainstream structures 
of public goods and services provision. All provinces draw development resources from the 
national treasury. Therefore, the M&E arrangements at those levels are critical to the overall 
success of the WoGM&ES. The study therefore investigates and provides analysis for bettering 
M&E arrangements at provincial level in the context of the WoGM&ES. Operationally, 
provinces have designated development plans that contribute to the achievement of NDPs and 
subsequently in meeting national long -term visions, currently Vision 203 0. Therefore, this 
research has  provided implementable M&E recommendations for improvement, given the 
widespread locations and diverse functionalities of these provinces. The information f low to 
higher- and lower-level structures is another i mportant aspect this study sought  to clarify and 
improve. 
 
1.7.5 Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation function at district level  
The districts constitute an important component of national development for Zambia. Currently 
110 districts are spread out in the 10 provinces. Each one is a centre of development activity 
for those geographical boundaries. Like the provinces, district centres obtain their development 
resources from the national treasur y under decentralised policy arrangements . However, 
planning and budgeting for most of the district developments, especially capital investment 
projects and programmes, are mainly done centr ally. Therefore, this study  investigated the 
existing M&E arrangements at district level and analysed how linkages with higher levels are 
being implemented and coordinated. Being the lowest structure in terms of development action, 
this study has investigated the kinds of M&E opportunities and challenges districts experience, 
thereby, provided suggestions and recommendations for improvement.  
 
This analysis is crucial to streamlining, building, strengthening and sustaining a stronger and 
more robust WoGM&ES  for the Zambian public sector . And so the good practices of M&E 
and the challenges that exist at those levels will be important to inform targeted improvements. 
Thus, to the extent that gaps exist, innovative suggestions for improvement are provided.

1.7.6 Strengthening monitoring and evaluation functions in other state agencies 
Aside from the line ministries, provinces and districts, quasi -governmental organisations or 
simply parastatals contribute to the attainment of national long-, medium- and short-term goals 
and objectives. The operations of these institutions are guided by government, even when they 
have some level of autonomy. They too receive resources from the national treasury and fully 
implement government policies and reforms. M&E arrangements in these institutions are 
crucial and the ways in which such practices of M&E fit in the larger context of the WoGM&ES 
are important. The information flow to and from these institutions becomes a matter of concern 
in the broader context of nation building. The work of parastatals therefore also falls within the 
overall framework of Vision 2030 and the development agenda. To that extent, this research 
was relevant by bringing on board the M&E functionalities of these quasi -government 
institutions. In pursuit of a robust, functional and sustainable WoGM&ES, this study attempts 
to clarify potential challenging aspects that require developing and strengthening.  
 
1.7.7 Strengthening monitoring and evaluation linkages 
The NLTV and medium-term five-year NDPs are not designed to guide government operations 
alone, but to provide development direction and aspirations to all stakeholders in the country. 
This means all development players in Zambia are required by policy to plan and implement 
interventions that are meant to achieve the overall objectives of these national policy 
documents and aspirations.  
 
Thus, parliament, CSOs, academia and research institutions and cooperating partners (CPs) 
become key stakeholders in the success of the WoGM&ES. Additionally, the private sector 
represents a significant segment of development con tribution to the economy  as well. Like 
other stakeholders, the private sector helps to realise national goals as set out in the vision (that 
is, Vision 2030) and NDPs.  
 
This research should be valuable in articulating M&E functionalities at these levels a nd 
assessing the linkages and coordination arrangements among them and with the rest of the 
WoGM&ES.

1.7.8 Promoting good governance in public service delivery for results  
This study analyses how well the WoGM&ES is structured to support the good gove rnance 
agenda to reduce poverty. The stud y findings  help to clarify the challenges affecting the 
development and sustainability of a functional WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector. The 
study also builds a case that a well -functioning M&E system is a useful requirement in 
promoting popular participation by stakeholders in the governance system of the country.  
 
To the extent that Zambia is on course for achieving a thriving public sector management 
reform agenda, a functional M&E system at country level would  be inevitable. A system that 
will operate as a sound governance feedback -loop is what the government of Zambia would 
require. The system will be a tool to promote a culture of results and practice intended to 
transform how outcome and impact level information is used as a contribution to the ongoing 
processes of good management of development interventions (Kusek & Rist, 2004; Stame, 
2004).   
 
Finally, the entire process of this research study was guided by the theory of change (ToC) as 
the anchor theoretical construct (see Chapter 3). Ultimately, t he findings have  inspired 
practically and theoretically sound suggestions for improvements in Zambia’s WoGM&ES.  
 
1.8 Justification of the choice of Zambia as a case study   
 
Zambia was the case study country chosen to undertake this research. The topic of ‘Analysing 
Zambia’s whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation system in the context of national 
development plans’ was carefully selected to explore the notion of M&E in a country that is 
striving to remain afloat developmentally. M&E is relatively new in theory and practice in 
many countries, particularly developing countries. In Zambia, which is a typical sub -Saharan 
country, M&E has been an emerging phenomenon and the government has pursued it as an 
important reform agenda in supporting good governance and poverty reduction.  
 
Zambia, like most African countries, is putting most of its efforts into fighting poverty, which 
affects its citizens. Good governance reforms are being pursued as a way to attain this aspiration 
and M&E stands as one of the prioritised areas of reform that is perceive d by the government 
(GRZ) to be a requirement in that process of transformation (GRZ, 2013, 2017a) . For that
<<<PAGE=46>>>
27 
 
reason, Zambia was chosen as an appropriate case study country to investigate the subject 
matter of M&E evolution and assess its linkages with good governance and poverty reduction 
in a broader perspective. Further, being domiciled in Zambia, the author considered the country 
suitable to make a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the nation’s WoGM&ES, using 
expert and experiential factors and insights.  
 
1.9 Scope of the study    
 
1.9.1 Research coverage  
This study covered Zambia’s public sector planning, monitoring and evaluation arrangements 
for the period startin g at independence in 1964 to the Seventh National Development Plan 
(2017-2021). Thus, the  scope of the research was  confined primarily to public sector 
institutions of the Government of the Republic of Zambia. The units of analyses consist ed of 
the designated levels of government structures, namely those at : i) national, ii) sector or line 
ministry, iii) provincial, and iv ) district levels. Selected planning, monitoring and evaluation 
departments, units and sections were  the entities from which the research sample was drawn. 
These four levels were  those under which the implementation of development interventions 
and public resource expenditures take place, thus attracting the need for stronger M&E 
arrangements to help with systematic tracking of performance results.  
 
Further, quasi-government institutions and other non -state actors, including parliament, civil 
society, academia, research institutes, donors or cooperating partners, development 
associations and many others, formed part of the research sample (see Appendix L for a detailed 
list of institutions). Figure 1.1 depicts the institutional scope of this research study. 
 
Figure 1.2. Scope of institutions covered in the study

28 
 
Therefore, in terms of research design and methodology, the various governmen t and non -
state structures were used to inform this study. Respondents were drawn from government 
structures at national, line ministry, provincial and district level. In addition, non -state actors, 
which included parliament, civil society and academia, pr ovided feedback about the ways in 
which the WoGM&ES needed to function in providing information for improved decision 
making at all levels of governance (see Chapter 6).   
 
1.10 Methodological approach   
 
The study design for this research was broad-based taking on board elements that were deemed 
key to answering the primary and stated secondary objectives. In that regard , the research 
design was investigatory and descriptive in nature. Particularly, the qualitative approach was 
adopted to guide the overall data collection, collation, analysis, interpretation and suggestions 
for improvement. The choice of the qualitative approach to inform this study was considered 
the appropriate one given the nature and dynamics of the research aim and scope itself. To meet 
the research objectives, a rigorous process was adopted involving desk-based research through 
consulting a wide range of literature on the topic as well as field-based research which meant 
acquisition of hands-on information  (primary research) . Among man y others, secondary 
sources of data for the study comprised key government policy documents such as the NDPs, 
NDP Annual Progress Reports (APRs), evaluation reports, line ministry, provincial and district 
strategic plans and reports, Vision 2030 and variou s management reports and policies. In 
addition, a wealth of related M&E literature was used from international development 
organisations and development agencies as well as scholarly books, discussion papers, journal 
articles, working papers and research papers from experts and practitioners of M&E.  
 
Furthermore, primary data were collected through key informant interviews and focus group 
discussions (FGDs) with stakeholders, particularly those concerned with public sector 
planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. To undertake analysis for the research 
findings, a number of techniques were employed. The major analytical tool called LEADS 
which is comprised of a 5 -point scoring scale was  adopted in this research study to guide 
collation and analysis. In addition, t he Nvivo software and t ext analysis were too utilised for 
synthesising and enriching the research discussion.

1.11 Definition of key concepts    
 
This section provides definitions of commonly used concepts. These definitions are given to  
provide a standardised understanding of the terms. Where there are several definitions for the 
same concept, alternative definitions are given in the document, but these definitions are given 
here for a common understanding of the concepts.  
i) Monitoring   
‘Monitoring’ refers to the continuous process of systematic collection of data on specified 
indicators in order to track progress made towards planned objectives and to assess the use of 
resources available (OECD/DAC, 2002:27). 
 
ii) Evaluation 
OECD/DAC (2002:21) defines ‘evaluation’ as the systematic and objective assessment of an 
ongoing or completed development intervention, be it a project, programme or policy, to 
ascertain the relevance and fulfilment of objectives, development efficiency, effectiveness, 
impact, and sustainability. 
 
iii) Results-based management 
Results-based management (RBM)  means a management strategy with clear framework, 
methods and tools for strategic planning, performance monitoring and evaluation and risk 
management which is aimed at achieving desired changes in the way organisations function 
(Hauge, 2001; CIDA, 2000). 
 
iv)  Managing for development results  
‘Managing for development results’ ( MfDRs) refers to a management strategy based on 
sustainable development performance enhancements in a given country’s outcom es. RBM 
achieves this by utilising practical tools, which include strategic planning, progress monitoring 
and outcome evaluation and risk management. Through these, RBM tries to offer a coherent 
framework for development effectiveness, whereby performance information is used in various 
processes of decision and policy making of key stakeholders (OECD & World Bank, 2006).
<<<PAGE=49>>>
30 
 
v) Public sector 
‘Public sector’ refers to the general government sector and public operations. In the 
context of Zambia, key public sector institutions include all ministries, provinces 
and other spending agencies (MPSAs) (GRZ, 2006, 2014b).  
 
vi) Monitoring and evaluation system 
An M&E system denotes an institutional or organisational set -up comprising management 
plans, processes, strategies, informat ion systems, indicators, reporting lines, standards and 
accountability relationships, which allow development structures at national and provincial or 
regional levels such as departments, municipalities and other institutions to effectively perform 
their M&E functions (Republic of South Africa, 2007:67). 
 
vii) Whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation system  
The Republic of South Africa (2008)  defines a WoGM&ES as a robust system that not only 
provides an integrated and all -encompassing framework of M&E practices, principles and 
standards to be used thr oughout government institutional structures, but also functions as an 
apex-level system for information and draws from the component systems in a framework 
meant to deliver essential M&E products tailored to satisfy information needs of users.   
 
viii) Results-based monitoring and evaluation system  
Hardlife and Zhou (2013)  regard results -based M&E systems as tools for managi ng and 
tracking progress in the implementation processes of development interventions ( that is , 
policies, programmes and projects). All the information pertaining to the successes and failures 
of development interventions in attaining desired outcomes is c aptured through a systematic 
reporting mechanism, which tracks progress towards desired development results. 
 
ix)  Result 
A ‘result’, as defined by the OECD/DAC (2002), refers to changes in a way, state or condition 
resulting from a cause -and-effect relationship. These possible changes are at three levels of 
output, outcome and impact, whenever undertaking a development inte rvention, regardless of 
whether it is a project, programme or policy.
<<<PAGE=50>>>
31 
 
x) Good governance 
Good governance means  “the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a 
country’s economic and social resources for development” (International Fund for Agricultural 
Development, 1999:1).  
 
xi) Results chain 
A ‘results chain’ may be understood as an intervention logic or framework that stipulates the 
necessary sequential steps towards the achievement of desired objectives, starting with inputs, 
moving through to activities, outputs and culminating in a high level results of outcomes and 
impacts, and providing regular feedback to the affected or concerned stakeholders (OECD & 
World Bank, 2006, 2007).  
 
xii)  National long-term vision   
The NLTV is a written long -term plan, with a 25 -year horizon, that expresses Zambian s’ 
aspirations. The vision seeks to articulate possible long-term development scenarios at various 
points, which would ultimately contribute to the attainment of citizens’ commonly desired 
socio-economic objectives and goals. Invariably, the NLTV provides a crucial anchor and 
linkage upon which medium-term plans are prepared (GRZ, 2014b).  
 
xiii) National development plan  
This concept refers to a five -year development strategy used to operationalise the long -term 
plans. It is a two -pronged process involving top -down and bottom -up approaches (GRZ, 
2014b).  
 
xiv) Poverty reduction strategies  
Poverty reduction strategies are development plans that are  or were meant to provide crucial 
links between the public sector policies bring implemented, cooperating partner support and 
the overall desired development outcomes pursued to achieve national and global poverty 
alleviation objectives such as the MDGs (Booth, 2003; Booth & Lucas, 2002; Edmunds & 
Marchant, 2008; World Bank, 2003).

1.12 Outline of the thesis and chapter layout   
 
This thesis is organised in nine chapters.  
 
Chapter 1: Chapter 1 is the introduction and situates the research study within the broader 
problem. This is where the rationale and background to the research problem are discus sed. 
Other aspects include the problem statement, research objectives, significance of the study, the 
scope and limitations of the study. The chapter ends by providing definitions of core concepts 
in the document.  
 
Chapter 2: Chapter 2 is about monitoring  and evaluation (M&E) for poverty reduction. The 
notions of monitoring and evaluation are discussed, starting with a historical perspective. The 
importance of M&E is also discussed and the chapter shows the linkages between M&E 
systems and good governance.  
 
Chapter 3: In Chapters 3 and 4, the thesis presents the theoretical framework and conceptual 
framework, respectively. Under the theoretical framework, key theoretical constructs upon 
which this study is anchored are discussed. These include the theory of change (ToC), Results-
based management (RBM), managing for development results ( MfDRs) and the logical 
framework approach (LFA). Chapter 3 provides a theoretical synthesis, which settles for ToC 
as the theory that informs this research study.  
 
Chapter 4: The focus is on bringing out the foundational components that form the basis for 
the conceptual framework of the research study. To that extent, the thesis discusses the two 
crucial sides of an M&E system, that is, the supply and demand sides. Also, Chapter 4 outlines 
the three cornerstones of a functional WoGM&ES, namely political , technical and ownership 
aspects of M&E systems. 
 
Chapter 5: Chapter 5 discusses national planning, monitoring and evaluation arrangements in 
Zambia. It introduces Zambia as a country and discusses national development planning in that 
context. Thus, types of plans are outlined. Additionally, Chapter 5 discusses the 
implementation and coordination frameworks for the NDPs. After a discussion of the M&E 
arrangements in Zambia, the  thesis describes under this chapter the roles and responsibilities 
of key institutions in managing NDPs.
<<<PAGE=52>>>
33 
 
Chapter 6: In Chapter 6 , the thesis discusses the research design and methodology. Aspects 
include the choice of and justification for the research t opic, research design, data sources, 
population and sample parameters, data collection instruments and data analysis techniques 
used. The last aspect looks at the ethical considerations of the study.  
 
Chapter 7: Chapter 7 addresses the research findings. A systematic presentation of the findings 
is given and this is coupled with discussions of the findings.  
 
Chapter 8: Chapter 8 presents  the proposed model for the enhanced whole -of-government 
monitoring and evaluation system (WoGM&ES) for Zambia’s public sector. This is a core 
component of the thesis. It represents the desired way of organising M&E in the public sector 
if success was to be attained and sustained.  
 
Chapter 9:  Chapter 9 involves conclusions , summary  and recommendations for the way 
forward in building, strengthening and sustaining Zambia’s WoGM&ES.    
 
1.13 Conclusion    
 
Chapter 1 set the overall scope in terms of rationale and the problem being investigated under 
this research study. The research topic, namely ‘ Analysing Zambia’s whole -of-government 
M&E system’, was discussed and contextualised within the ambit of NDPs and Vision 2030. 
It provided analytical information to justify the case for Zambia’s WoGM&ES for the public 
sector vis-à-vis its importance towards the good governance agenda and ultimately its role in 
helping to achieve poverty reduction and improved living standards of Zambians. Further, the 
objectives have been clearly outlined, and so the study had a direction and designated aspects 
to investigate to bring forth suggestions  and recommendations for improvements. Lastly, the 
chapter outlined the structure of the entire thesis for ease of navigating through the document 
and appreciating the brief summary of what each chapter covers.  
 
The following chapter, Chapter 2, explores the concept of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
by giving details of the importance and relevance of M&E in enhancing good governance. The 
significance of systems for M&E in providing development information is also articulated.

CHAPTER 2  
 
Monitoring and Evaluation for Poverty Reduction 
 
2.1 Introduction   
 
Chapter 2 deals with the concept of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and provides a 
comprehensive discussion of ways in which M&E could be linked to the good governance 
agenda so that development ag encies contribute to poverty reduction. The chapter articulates 
the general overview of M&E as a contemporary phenomenon that governments globally and 
other development organisations have pursued rigorously in their bid to implement results -
based sustainab le development. Here, the meanings of the terms ‘monitoring’ and 
‘evaluation’ are defined and discussed. Further, the chapter considers a historical perspective 
of the notion of M&E by discussing the evolution of the concepts as they are currently 
understood.  
 
Further, Chapter 2 discusses the reasons for governments to build and sustain stronger whole-
of-government M&E systems (WoGM&ES). This section elaborates reasons that successful 
systems for M&E are inevitable for good governance and sustainable devel opment. The 
conclusion summarises the issues covered in the chapter.      
 
2.2 The notion of monitoring and evaluation   
 
Today there is greater demand for M&E from many aspects of development spheres than ever 
before. The push for functional M&E has been pursued mainly to achieve development results. 
According to Bamberger (2010), policy makers and M&E practitioners in developed countries 
and other donor agencies need to evaluate, for instance, whether enhancements are taking place 
as a consequence of the intervention. In addition, M&E supports stronger governance systems 
across all government structures, thereby enhancing accountability relationships among 
development stakeholders (Mosse & Lewis, 2005; UN, 2013; Ahem et al. 2012). Further, when 
implemented successfully, M&E has the potentia l to build a stronger basis for achieving 
intended development results. Thus, M&E is considered a good tool for enhancing anti -
corruption crusades in public sector institutions and bringing about a positive performance
<<<PAGE=54>>>

culture that promotes better policy m aking, national planning and budgeting processes 
(Chabane, 2013; World Bank, 1999, 2000).  
 
The two notions of 'monitoring' and 'evaluation' are significantly distinct, but complementary 
in application. The concepts are not synonymous, although many people use them 
interchangeably. Nonetheless,  the intrinsic value is embedded in their differences. For 
monitoring, Kusek and Rist (2004) contend that it is about providing information on ‘where’ a 
given development intervention is  in terms of its implementation status against targets and 
outcomes. On the other hand, evaluation is about the ‘why’ of development interventions, 
especially whether planned targets and desired outcomes have been realised. To that extent, 
evaluations concern themselves with attribution and causality (Hauge & Mackay, 2004; Smith 
et al., 2009) . Patton (2003)  also asserts that monitoring entails continuously observing the 
progress in a given development intervention, while Twersky and Lindblom (2012) consider it 
a process of tracking milestone s regularly, measuring progress against expectations, and 
determining the purposes of compliance and improvements. Evaluations, on the other hand, 
are meant to systematically and objectively assess ongoing or completed development 
interventions, such as pr ojects, programmes or policies, in attaining their design, 
implementation and results (Farell et al., 2002; Kahan & Goodstadt, 2005; OECD/DAC, 2002; 
Scriven, 2007; UN, 2013).  
 
Therefore, evaluation results complement monitoring exercises in many ways. For example, 
when a monitoring system reveals that a certain intervention is off track, an appropriate 
evaluative information would provide clarity on the realities and trends observ ed through the 
monitoring system (Kusek & Rist, 2004) . Table 2.1 presents a conceptual illustration of the 
complementary relationship between the functions of monitoring and that of evaluation. 
Table 2.1. Complementary roles of monitoring and evaluation 
Monitoring  Evaluation 
 Clarifies programmes objectives   Analyses why intended results were or were not achieved

them to problems

‘Monitoring’ refers to a process that offers management and stakeholders of any development 
intervention under implementation with indicator information, but also a continuous function 
that uses systematic collection of data on specified indicators ( OECD/DAC, 2002:27). On the 
other hand, ‘evaluation’ refers to the systematic and independent assessment of a policy, 
programme or project that is ongoing or has already been completed. In particular, evaluations 
aim to meet major objectives, including determining whether a given intervention was relevant, 
efficient, effective, impactful and sustainable, and ultimately whether the decision -making 
processes incorporated lessons learned. Görgens and Kusek (2009)  view the evaluation 
function as the worth, value and significance of an ongoing or complete d project, programme 
or policy. Furthermore, the functions of monitoring and evaluation are self-reinforcing. While 
monitoring refers to a management function that is ongoing, the notion of evaluation denotes 
the post -event function and gives feedback to management. Typically, when undertaking 
monitoring exercises, one is also carrying out some form of evaluating function because one is 
making an assessment about progress achieved and, based on this judgement, providing 
possible solutions. On the other hand, when conducting an evaluation, monitoring data are 
being utilised, upon which judgements are made based on the in sights from the continuous 
process. Therefore, the complementary nature of the two concepts is not linear. Instead, the 
relationship is more dynamic, depending on the situa tion (Ravindra, 2004; UN, 2013; 
Hlatshwayo & Govender, 2015).  
 
2.3 Historical perspective of monitoring and evaluation  
Historically, monitoring and evaluation can be traced to various points in the past. However, 
one still has to distinguish between modern -day M&E and traditional M&E, which are 
practised by different generations and societies as the world continues to evolve. Every society 
in the past seems to have implemented some form of performance -tracking system. In other 
words, M&E systems have always been on the development reform agenda of many 
governments and institutions. In giving a more distant historical perspective of the importance 
and usefulness of M&E practice, Kusek and Rist (2004: 11-12) recounted: 
there is tremendous power in  measuring performance. The ancient Egyptians regularly 
monitored their country’s outputs in grain and livestock production more than 5,000 years 
ago. In this sense, M&E is certainly not a new phenomenon. Modern governments, too, have 
engaged in some form of traditional M&E over the past decades. They have sought to track 
over time their expenditures, revenues, staffing levels, resources, programmes and project 
activities, goods and services produced, and so forth.
<<<PAGE=56>>>
37 
 
From the days of the Ancient Egyptians, there has been a great deal of evolution in the 
philosophical orientation and conceptualisation of M&E. For example, in the 1960s, M&E 
practice underwent a substantial paradigm shift, which was predominantly quantitative in 
focus, reflecting the social sci entific trend of the era. This domination continued in the social 
sciences in the 1970s, putting more emphasis on empowerment evaluation. The emphasis on 
empowerment approaches was based on lived experiences to represent and provide a voice to 
as many stak eholders as possible (Chambers, 1994). However, in the decades that followed, 
M&E methodologies shifted from an emphasis on quantitative to more participatory 
approaches and empowerment techniques (Chambers, 1994; Estrella & Gaventa, 1997 ; UN, 
2013).  
 
The increasing demand for M&E, even in contemporary governance syst ems, has resulted 
because of the critical benefits associated with the two notions. For example, benefits such as 
the provision of relevant information embedded in good feedback -loop systems are what 
results-based M&E systems offer decision makers and other stakeholders. Many governments 
and organisations have tracking systems that form part of their management toolkits: financial 
systems, accountability systems, and good human resource systems (Görgens & Kusek, 2009). 
Earlier development management efforts lacked th e feedback component, which enables the 
tracking of implementation consequences. In that regard, building M&E systems has leveraged 
decision makers in the provision of much -valued feedback on policy, programme and project 
performance as a basis for future improvement (Lucas, Evans, Pasteur & Lloyd, 2004; Mackay, 
2006b; Segone, 2008). 
 
In addition, Hardlife and Zhou (2013) assert that contemporary M&E systems have their roots 
in the Results Based Management (RBM) approach, which is a management strategy centred 
on performance and achievement of outputs, outcomes and impacts f or a policy, programme 
or project. OECD/DAC (2002) view M&E systems as toolkits of management meant to help 
institutions of development to realise intervention effectiveness through the delivery of results. 
Typically, RBM employs traditional tools such as strategic planning, results frameworks, 
monitoring, and programme evaluation to improve organisational performance (Castro, 2009; 
Kusek, Rist & White, 2004 ). The approach was popularised first among private sector 
organisations, development agencies and multilateral organisations, and later moved on to the 
public sector as part of reform efforts in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, most development 
interventions have adopted the RBM approach to inform processes such as planning, budgeting

and monitoring and evaluation (Chambers, 1994; Mackay & Gariba, 2000; World Bank, 
2003a).  
 
2.3.1 Monitoring and evaluation trends at global level  
The evolution of contemporary M&E at global level could be traced back to the 1980s and later 
the 1990s. Globally, the desire to produce results -oriented M&E systems and frameworks 
emanated from the need to determine a country’s progress towa rds its development goals. 
According to the World Bank (2004), initiatives such as the UN’s Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper policy, and Country Assistance Strategy 
mushroomed, each with a focus on results. Through these initiatives, it was desired that citizens 
of countries should obtain accountability feedback from their governments in terms of evidence 
from the implemen tation of public development interventions, especially resource allocation 
and expenditure and expected results.  
 
For these reasons, it became common in the 1990s and increasingly in the 2000s for poverty 
reduction strategies (PRS) to be implemented by ma ny countries, especially among the 
developing ones. The PRS approach was designed to provide a strong linkage between public 
sector policies, support from donors and the development outcomes required for meeting the 
MDGs (Booth & Lucas, 2002  and World Bank, 1999, 2004; Bollen et al., 2005 ). Five key 
principles characterised the PRS approach, namely promoting national ownership of strategies 
through broad-based participation of civil so ciety, country driven; results focused and based 
on outcomes that would be of benefit to the poor; partnership oriented concerning coordinated 
participation of cooperating partners; recognising the comprehensive and multidimensional 
nature of poverty; and based on a long -term perspective or horizon for poverty reduction. 
Another prominent feature in the PRSP approach involved the recognition that the 
implementation of the strategy would demand close monitoring, with the national statistical 
office (NSO) playing an important role. The wider role of statistics in informing the upstream 
undertakings of problem identification, policy design, setting quantitative targets, and 
allocating resources among competing priorities was inevitable (Booth, 2005; Talbot, 2010 ; 
Raimondo, 2016 ). Additionally , the PRS approach demanded that countries created, 
implemented and sustained viable M&E systems and arrangements, not only at national level, 
but at sub-national level too. However, this was an extremely challenging proposition, given
<<<PAGE=58>>>

the low technical ca pacity obtaining at lower levels in most developing countries (Booth & 
Lucas, 2002; DBSA, 2000; Kusek & Rist, 2004; OECD/DAC, 2007b). 
 
This M&E evolution in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s escalated in 2005, when the Paris 
Declaration (PD) was signed by developed and developing cou ntries, including key bilateral, 
multilateral, civil society and other development agencies. The declaration obligated countries 
and the donor community to aid effectiveness and strengthen their management approaches 
towards development results (OECD/DAC, 2005; IEG, 2009). All these efforts were meant to 
enhance the achievement of high-level development results (that is, outcomes and impacts) as 
opposed to focusing on lower level processes ( that is, inputs, activities or physical outputs) 
(Mackay, 2011; Wong, 2012; World Bank, 2012).  
 
The PD was followed by the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action (AAA), another resol ve by the 
globe to make results orientation through functional M&E mechanisms a stamp of sound 
practice for good governance and sustainable development (OECD/DAC, 2008, 2011b ; 
Chianca, 2008). The global development agenda for both the PD and the AAA focused on aid 
effectiveness. The common agenda was anchored on the five principles of alignment, 
harmonisation, ownership, mutual accountability, and managing for results.  
 
A more recent global effort to promote strengthened M&E was the Fourth High Level Forum 
(HLF4) in Busan, Korea, in 2011. Like the PD and AAA, the Busan Partnership for Effective 
Development Cooperation focused on aid effectiveness under the principles of ownership, 
focus on results, partnerships, transparency and shared responsibility. The principle of focus 
on results promoted working towards a sustainable impact, and adopting this as a motivating 
factor behind investments and efforts in the process of policy making (OECD/DAC, 2011b; 
UNDP, 2015). These initiatives set a high tone on the global requirement for functional M&E 
development, strengthening and sustainability. The efforts have continued to provide a basis 
for enhancing M&E to even higher levels across the globe. Table  2.2 highlights the evolution 
of M&E globally.

In Busan, Korea, on the occasion of the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness 
(HLF4, 29 November to 1 December 2011), over 3000 delegates met to review progress 
on implementing the  principles of the  Paris Declaration . They also discussed how to 
maintain the relevance of the aid effectiveness agenda in the context of the evolving 
development landscape. The forum culminated  in the signing of the Busan Partnership

spent and that it helps build sustainable economies that lift people out of poverty. 
Organised by OECD and the World Bank, and hosted by the Government of Ghana, the 
forum brought together ministers, heads of development agencies and civil society 
organisations from more than 100 countries. Examining the results of development aid, 
they examine what needs to change and how the international aid system could  deliver

development. These global aims are reflected in the eight Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), with their 18 targets and 48 performance indicators. The MDGs provided 
specific, measurable targets that were gradually being adapted at the country level as the 
basis for country outcomes and then monitored over time to help gauge progress. In a

2.3.2 Monitoring and evaluation trends in Africa  
Similar to M&E trends globally, the African continent has made notable positive experiences 
in the spread of M&E. Generally, the emergence and growth of M&E in Africa has been 
gradual, to the extent that even today a number of countries are still in the initial stages of 
building their designated systems for M&E. For a long time in Africa, M&E was viewed as 
agenda driven and controlled by donors. However, this view is phasing out and countries are 
working towards building and sustaining their own practices and systems. Currently, man y 
African countries have joined their counterpart countries in Latin America, including the 
Caribbean, and Asia in establishing systems for M&E in pursuit of good governance and 
poverty reduction based on evidence (Kanyamuna, 2013; OECD/DAC, 2011c; World Bank, 
1999; El Baradei et al., 2014).  
 
In addition, although formal traces of effort s to demand results and accountability in the 
contemporary understanding of M&E on the African context began in the late 1980s, more 
evidence can be traced in late 1990s onwards. In particular, an ambitious seminar was convened 
in Abidjan in 1998. One of the top priorities on the agenda was to take stock of progress and 
M&E capacity status in Africa in the context of public service delivery and overall 
performance. In fact, the 1998 conference was a follow -up to the earlier meeting of 1990 in 
Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Suffice to say, it was a ground -breaking event in the effort to articulate 
M&E in Africa by bringing together participants from twelve African nations and 21 
international donor agencies. The seminar sought to appreciate the status of M&E capacity 
development in Africa with a view to re -engaging in innovative ways to grow the M&E 
function across the continent (Hwang, 2014; Mackay, 1998 & Mackay, 2006 ; Chouinard & 
Cousins, 2015). 
 
However, other efforts in M&E had been advanced much earlier than the 1998 conference. In 
March 1987, OECD/DAC convened a conference in Abidjan, whose agenda was to have 
donors and beneficiary countries discuss the evaluation function in development. Thus, the 
1987 conference birthed the 1990 and 1998 conferences, whose focus was on clarifying the 
needs of evaluation as considered by African member states and to explore opportunities for 
enhanced self-evaluation capacity (World Bank, 1999; DBSA, 2000; Mouton, 2010).
<<<PAGE=61>>>
42 
 
Conclusively, the 1998 conference, which was organised by the Development Bank of 
Southern Africa (DBSA), in col laboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and 
World Bank, had these key objectives, which are historic in the evolution of M&E on the 
African continent (World Bank, 1999:2): 
 Providing an overview towards the progress made regarding the 
development of M&E c apacities in Africa within the specific ambit of 
the public expenditure management framework and broadly the public 
sector reform regime  
 Achieving a common continental position on key purposes, elements, 
including processes of M&E that support development  
 Strengthening the M&E supply and demand sides by identifying 
strategies and supporting resources for building stronger M&E systems 
in African countries 
 Promoting sharing of lessons learnt and experiences concerning M&E 
capacity development such as concep ts, successes, challenges, and 
approaches 
 Investing in tools for use in developing country M&E action plans and 
frameworks – by taking into account different circumstances in each 
individual country 
 Creating stronger and effective country -specific and regi onal-
collaborative integrated networks to encourage feedback and learning 
for all countries 
 
In addition, the conference report indicated how participants were anxious to see African 
countries take a leading role in building their own sustainable systems for M&E, which would 
inform government resource allocations, permitting greater clarity in decision making in the 
planning and budgeting processes. Further, this demand for stronger M&E arrangements in 
Africa was not made by external stakeholders such as de velopment partners and civil society 
alone, but by common citizens who perceived governance systems as being negative (Brushett, 
1998; Burdescu, Villar, Mackay, Rojas & Saavedra, 2005; World Bank, 1999, 2011).  
 
Bad experiences in most African governance systems included economic and political 
disasters, absence of a culture of accountability, lack of ownership, corruption, the poor quality 
of financial and other performance mechanisms, and the critical lack of M&E feedback loops 
to inform decision-making processes (Naidoo, 2011; World Bank, 1999, 2004). As a result of 
these negative perceptions, from relative obscurity the pursuit for good governance has risen 
to the top of Africa’s development policy agenda with M&E reforms taking centre stage (AUC, 
2015; DBSA, 2000; Briceno, 2010; Goldman et al., 2012).
<<<PAGE=62>>>
43 
 
An additional critical aspect of the evolution of M&E in Africa has been the constant demand 
by participants and stakeholders for more conferences and increased knowledge sharing forums 
at continental level as well as within member countries. There was a proposal to establish 
platforms to be used for building the M&E capacity in countries across the continent (Booth & 
Lucas, 2002; World Bank, 1999, 2003a) . The seminar in 2000  for instance emphasised the 
urgent requirement for every African country to develop a national evaluation association. 
Further, the conference challenged countries and development partners to explore other 
regional and international opportunities, especially strategi c cooperation and collaborations 
aimed at strengthening the transformational M&E agenda in Africa (DBSA, 2000; AUC, 2015). 
 
The Third African Evaluation Association (AFrEA) Conference, whose theme was ‘Evaluation 
Matters, Africa Matters, Joining Forces for Development’, was held in 2004 in Cape Town, 
South Africa. In terms of attendance, 450 participants were brought together from 61 countries, 
with a large representation of members from among African governments. As part of the 
capacity-building initiative, this conference offered over 20 pre -conference training sessions 
on M&E -related capacity topics. In 2005, another development evaluation roun dtable 
conference was held in Tunisia, which was attended by representatives from up to 21 African 
countries. The Third AFrEA conference was followed by two other events, one in Niamey in 
2006 (AFrEAIV) and the other in Cairo in 2009 (AFrEAV). The AFrEAV e vent was 
momentous in that here, the AFrEA was formally constituted, with the potential to transform 
into a more vibrant African results-oriented association functioning beyond the biennial events 
in which it was most visible (Naidoo, 2010; 2011).  
 
Under the AFrEA umbrella, many meetings and conferences have since been convened, all 
focusing on M&E evolution and strengthening in Africa. The latest, the Eighth AFrEA 
Conference, was held in March 2017 in Kampala, Uganda. Its aim was to encourage exchanges 
between academia, researchers, emerging evaluators and M&E practitioners on demand and 
supply of credible evaluative evidence in support of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) in Africa. The conference also built the capacity of participants in designing, managing 
and utilising evaluation findings to help governments achieve their national and international 
development agendas around the SDGs and Africa Agenda 2063 (GRZ, 2017b) (OECD and 
World Bank Source Book, 2008; MfDRs, 2017).
<<<PAGE=63>>>
44 
 
Therefore, the core purpose of AFrEA is to commit to developing and strengthening indigenous 
evaluation capacities by providing high -level training across Africa by way of national 
professional associations that conducted peer -to-peer training exercises (DBSA, 2000) . 
Consequently, it is anticipated that these associations would work with their own governments 
and other stakeholders to articulate national evaluation policies and functional frameworks and 
operational structures. In addition, AFrEA works to support the creation and strengthening of 
M&E policies at country level, and promotes awareness of and demand for development 
outcomes and impacts. Other objectives were focused on building infrastructural capacity and 
promoting the utilisation of M&E systems and information to meet the increased expectations 
from stakeholders. Through AFrEA, African member states are challenged to produce 
collaborative strategies and infrastructure capacities to support a functional pan-African M&E 
network, particularly one focused on reviewing good standard evaluation culture and practices 
for implementation in Africa (DBSA, 2000 ; AFrEA, 2017). Although there were several 
additional efforts at domesticating and localising M&E among African governments and other 
development stakeholders, these initiatives are the notable ones. Africa is therefore on the right 
track with regard to evolving M&E demand and growth.  
 
2.4 Importance of monitoring and evaluation systems   
 
An M&E system is a set of organisational or insti tutional arrangements comprising 
management plans, standards, strategies, processes, information systems, indicators, reporting 
lines and accountability relationships, which enable national and provincial departments, 
municipalities and other institutions to perform their M&E functions successfully ( Naidoo, 
2011; Republic of South Africa, 2007). Thus, the question is: Why would governments bother 
to invest, develop, build and sustain stronger whole -of-government (WoG) M&E systems?  
Obviously, this question is complex, but requires a comprehensive answer with appropriate 
justification for undertaking ambitious steps towards spending and committing huge public 
resources to building such systems. Kusek and Rist (2004:21)  contend that “it is difficult to 
build strong economies based on weak governments ”. Thus, results-based M&E systems are 
considered key to strengthening such governments by reinforcing the focus on demonstrable 
development results. Governments of developing countries may be overwhelmed in 
implementing policies, programmes and projects, without functional M&E systems to show 
what was working effectively and what was not (De Renzo, 2006; World Bank, 2007a).
<<<PAGE=64>>>
45 
 
In reality, there are several reasons for governments to invest in building functional 
WoGM&ESs. Factors such as internal organisational and political pressure, including potential 
external factors, to build effective M&E systems have been critical in demanding for such 
systems ( Morra Imas & Rist, 2009  & Kanyamuna, 2013) . Further, combating corruption, 
expanding the authority of the auditor general, and strengthening the role of the parliament 
have been cited as fundamental internal reasons for the demand for M&E systems. Other 
internally generated pressures may arise from political parties in opposition to the sitting 
government, who demand reforms in the public sector. External pressures from the 
international aid community, civil society and other stakeholders may also compel public sector 
reforms and create demand for M&E systems as tools for better management of public affairs 
(Bedi et al., 2006; Mackay & Gariba, 2000; World Bank, 2012b).  
 
Another reason that it is critical to embark on building stronger public sector WoGM&ES s is 
that once such systems have been suitably institutionalised, they serve as an integral aspect of 
the dev elopment policy, programme or project cycle. Systems for M&E therefore bring 
improvements in the public sector performance (Hardlife & Zhou, 2013:72) . Kusek and Rist 
(2004) add that good governance is more critical for less developed countries to pursue than 
for their counterparts in the developed world. Therefore, for many developing countries, M&E 
presents an opportunity to correct the problem and begin to build systems that will contribute 
to reduced poverty. In fact, it is regarded as an emergency for developing countries to create 
and sustain a strong and accountable governance environment. That is why Castro (2009:67) 
stresses that governance mechanisms are strengthened by functiona l M&E systems through 
improved transparency, accountability relationships, and by building a performance -based 
culture in support of better policy and budget decision making and management. 
 
An example from India is apposite. Recently, India made an effort  to pursue M&E from a 
practical angle and lessons can be learned for other developing countries such as Zambia. 
According to Mehrotra (2013), a surge had occurred in India’s public expend iture, driven by 
growth in the national economy, which resulted in increased demand for M&E and 
performance management from central government (mainly ministries of finance and 
planning), programme implementers, international donor organisations, and civil society.  
 
Arising from the economic growth, the government of India embarked on building a 
countrywide M&E system. This effort was undertaken to establish a firm and more
<<<PAGE=65>>>
46 
 
institutionalised nationwide setting for results -based M&E activities, which were c ontinuous 
and tied to the planning, budgeting and accountability processes. The ministry of finance 
instituted outcome budgeting, and the planning commission created an independent evaluation 
office, which would subsume the commission’s pre -existing progra mme evaluation 
organisation. Similarly, the cabinet secretariat created the performance management and 
evaluation system (Goldman, 2012; Chabane, 2013; Mehrotra, 2013) . Indeed, the role of 
government becomes vital in leading the process of building a WoGM&ES that will be used to 
inform public management processes in the poverty reduction agenda. Such a commitment , 
though, seems to demand consistencies in terms not only of institutional capacity, but also of 
political will even in changes of regimes.   
 
National M&E systems whose focus is to provide all concerned development stakeholders with 
credible information are complex and require careful attention by governments that incorporate 
them. In support of this view, Bedi et al. (2006) added that M&E systems involve institutional 
activities that take th e form of data and information collection, analysis, dissemination, 
reporting and feedback into policy processes , among others.  There are many actors on the 
supply and demand sides of M&E systems and these create motivation and incentives to create 
and sus tain successful systems. Key actors that benefit from M&E information include 
government-wide line ministries, CSOs, NGOs, parliaments, the donor community and private 
consultants. Others are research institutions, universities and the general public.  
 
Essentially, building and sustaining a functional M&E system should be understood as a 
process and one that takes relatively longer. Acevedo, Rivera and Rivera (2010)  add that 
creating an M&E system should be considered a means, and not an end in itself, and is best 
linked to the process of public policy planning and management. Such a system would enjoy a 
balanced supply of quality information ( that is, on the supply side) and its utilisation  in such 
processes as planning, budgeting and management (that is, on the demand side). 
 
A summary of reasons for building and sustaining stronger WoGM&ESs is now given.   
 
2.4.1 Tools for poverty reduction  
The implementation of stronger M&E functions is understood by many stakeholders as being 
key to enhancing poverty reduction efforts because they assist inculcating good governance,
<<<PAGE=66>>>
47 
 
transparency and accountability tenets in development institutions. Castro (2009) and World 
Bank (2007) argue that M&E systems have been demonstrated to be useful tools in supporting 
poverty reduction efforts for most governments and development organisations. The 
implementation of results-based M&E systems plays an important role in providing a feedback 
loop, which, according to Görgens and Kusek (2009) , offers a systematic way of tracking 
progress of any given intervention, thereby strengthening policy and decision -making 
processes.  
 
2.4.2 For informing national planning  
Planning is a fundamental requirement for successful organisations. When all planning 
processes are well grounded on evidence, development institutions tend to thrive by achieving 
their organisational objectives. In addition, when such planning is anchored on clearly defined 
results, stakeholders show support for such institutions. Therefore, results-based M&E systems 
are designed to strengthen the planning function (Booth & Lucas, 2002; World Bank, 2007c; 
Burdescu et al., 2005; Segone, 2008). 
 
Mackay (2007) observed that ordinary citizens had gone to the extent of exerting pressure on 
their governments to demonstrate development results for their work, which was often 
perceived to fall short of people’s expectations. In many cases, goods and services delivered 
by go vernment institutions were taken to be of poor consumption quality and products of 
misappropriation of public resourc es causing mass deprivation and poverty. In that regard, 
systems for M&E are meant to enhance the planning function so that priorities and sequencing 
of development choices are done in the most appropriate manner, in the spirit of doing more 
with less ( Görgens & Kusek, 2009 ; Khan, 1990 ). Therefore, it has become difficult for 
governments of developing countries to avert these pressures, and the incorpo ration of M&E 
systems in their mainstream operations has opened hope for better implementation of public 
development interventions (Mackay, 2007; Mark & Pfeiffer, 2011; World Bank, 2007b).  
 
Further, since national planning does not start and end only with local citizens of a country, 
additional pressures arise from the civil society and the donor community. Civil society 
demands that governments should be open to a ll forms of public accountability through the 
creation of forums in which the general public are told how public resources are being utilised. 
Donors also want governments to show through results how foreign aid is being utilised to
<<<PAGE=67>>>
48 
 
improve human lives (Booth, 2005; Booth & Lucas, 2002; Liverani & Lundgren, 2007; 
Mackay & Gariba, 2000).   
 
Thus, in all these situations, M&E systems would help governments to generate inclusive 
development policies, strategies, plans, programmes and projects centred on national priorities, 
based on evidence and incremental learning.  
 
2.4.3 For enhancing government transparency and accountability  
Good M&E systems promise enhanced transparency and accountability on the acquisition, 
distribution and utilisation of public resources (UNDP, 2002). Similarly, Mackay (2007) argues 
that governments are able to demonstrate to interested stakeholders the attainment of desired 
development results. A further viewpoint is that without strong accountability relationships, 
there would be minimal incentives to stimulate performance improvement by organisations and 
governments.  
 
However, for M&E systems to serve as instruments of public transparency and accountability, 
dissemination channels such as regular stakeholders’ forums, reports and Internet should be 
used to increase the accessibility of M&E informat ion produced by the systems (Zaltsman, 
2006; Trucano, 2005 ). In many cases, k ey stakeholders such as CSOs and donors press 
governments to demonstrate how public resources are being utilised in relation to poverty 
reduction plans. Governments may find such stakeholders’ demands problematic in the absence 
of well-functioning M&E systems. Booth and Lucas (2002) assert that un-negotiated demand 
for M&E information by different stakeholders is the basis for a successful crusade towards 
meaningful accountability and transparency. That way, it is considered an effective approach 
to make those responsible for policy to account.  
 
Consequently, M&E systems can be used as powerful platforms for stakeholders to hold 
government leaders accountable for the mobilisation, allocation and utilisation of public 
resources. Clements, Chianca and Sasaki (2008)  also noted that the donor community and 
taxpayers in aid -dependent poor countries have limited means to ho ld to account those who 
allocate and manage donor resources, even when it is clear that such officials have incentive s 
to enhance the wellbeing of the poor. In such cases, functioning M&E systems would provide 
performance-based incentives and enable donors  and other stakeholders to overcome the
<<<PAGE=68>>>
49 
 
challenges and learn what approaches were suitable for certain contexts (Mackay, 1999;  
Naidoo, 2011; Shadish, Cook & Campbell, 2002).  
 
Further, when information from M&E systems is used properly, internally and externally based 
stakeholders will have a clear appreciation of policies, projects and programmes statuses 
(Hauge & Mackay, 2004 ; Hwang, 2014). As a result, the re could be increased popular and 
political support arising from such a demonstration of positive development outcomes and 
engagements. Görgens and Kusek (2009)  subscribe to the idea that while there may be risks 
associated with the implementation of results-based M&E systems such as organisational and 
political costs, there are crucial undesirable implications and risks in doing away with such 
systems.  
 
2.4.4 For informing budget allocation and fighting corruption  
Budgets are the main instruments that are used t o invest in poverty reduction programmes in 
developing countries and elsewhere. Thus, it is important that M&E systems should collect 
complete budgetary data and information to inform other development interventions and 
decision-making processes. When M&E system findings and budget allocations are not 
integrated, it is difficult to make proper linkages between the intended outcomes of agencies 
and programmes and the budget classification (Zaltsman, 2006; World Bank, 2007c; Robinson, 
2009). These challenges arise from lack of causal chain links between M&E and budget 
processes. One way to  address this disconnect is to adopt a programme or objective -based 
budget classification. 
 
Increasing cases of corruption are among the major hindrances to the development efforts of 
many aid-dependent poor countries ( Mackay, 2006a). The resources that are supposed to be 
invested in transformational policies, projects and programmes that are targeted at reducing 
poverty and improvin g the welfare of the poor majority are sometimes mismanaged. Such 
corrupt practices are of concern not only to the stakeholders and citizens of developing 
countries, but to the international community  as well . Therefore, because of this, many 
stakeholders have regarded M&E systems as important tools in the anti -corruption crusade 
(Mackay, 2007; Abraham & Torres, 2004). This kind of information tracking may lead those 
in charge of public resource management to avoid misapplication and focus on operatives that 
enhance human development.

2.4.5 For supporting policy-making and improvement   
In the same manner as  projects and programmes are used as instruments of development, 
policies are significant vehicles upon which governments and other institutions deliver their 
development aspirations. Liverani and Lundgren (2007)  state that M&E systems produce 
valuable information that feeds into development policy and organisational learning , and 
ultimately improves the effectiveness of development cooperation. Therefore, governments of 
aid-dependent developing countries would do well to build functional M&E systems and use 
the information to formulate public policies that are pro poor and evidence based (Goldman et 
al., 2012; Talbot, 2010; World Bank, 2007b).  
 
Socio-economic policies are supposed to be products of a well -informed government process 
to generate positive effects on poverty reduct ion and national growth ( World Bank, 2003b) . 
Since developing countries may not have well -functioning M&E s ystems, their policies may 
be the products of less informed processes (Booth, 2005; World Bank, 2009 ). It is therefore 
important to build systems that seek to provide this needed information to feed into 
development policies and programmes. Despite the weaknesses faced by many developing 
countries with regard to building and sustaining coherent and functional M&E systems, there 
is hope for improvement. Like most developed and transition countries, it will be possible for 
aid-dependent countries to show evidence of their social and economic achievements.  
 
In addition, the essence of successful designing of results -based M&E systems is to assist in 
monitoring and evaluating development interventions at all levels of their implementation. 
Information and data from a given intervention could therefore be collected with matching 
analysis at any stage to offer regular feedback. Consequen tly, M&E functions should be 
conducted institutionally all through the life cycle of a programme, project or policy, and after 
completion of an intervention (Görgens & Kusek, 2009; Saasa, 2003). 
 
2.4.6 For management information  
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems support the management function of devel opment 
institutions by providing valuable information that is critical to decision-making processes. The 
systems are used as management toolkits for tracking and demonstrating progress of a given 
policy, programme or project against expected results. Systems for monitoring and evaluation
<<<PAGE=70>>>
51 
 
should both be implemented successfully because a mismatch between them may lead to the 
managing of programmes and projects being derailing, hence, failure to track progress becomes 
a norm (Hardlife & Zhou, 2013 ; Simson, Sharma & Aziz,  2011). According to the DBSA 
(2000), M&E is a development management tool whose ultimate objective is to promote a 
culture of futuristic learning and improvement of organisational policy and decision maki ng 
for various users through the utilisation of evidence-based information.  
 
Developing countries have become aware that to achieve meaningful social and economic 
development, prudence in the management of resources is essential. Therefore, M&E systems 
have become important factors in the development processes of aid -dependent developing 
countries. This is a ‘management challenge function’ that M&E systems are designed to offer 
governments and other institutions of development. For Mackay (2007), it is for that reason 
that M&E systems have been created and strengthened by a growing number of governments. 
Thus, the ultimate motivation for creating such systems is anchored on performance 
management for development results.  
 
Smith et al. (2009)  add that M&E systems help in identifying the most efficient use of 
resources. This represents another management function that is attributed to systems for M&E. 
The information about performance indicators may be used at various management levels to 
direct resources to needy activities. M&E information allows performance comparisons such 
as benchmarking among government structures ( that is, administrative units, provinces and 
districts) (Grun, 2006; Görgens & Kusek, 2009; Lopez-Acevedo, Krause & Mackay, 2012). 
 
2.4.7 For enhancing organisational learning and feedback  
Feedback constitutes an essential component of M&E processes through the provision of 
linkages between activities of the past and those in future (Lahey, 2011; Srivastava et al., 2003; 
OECD/DAC, 1991). In that context, well -developed feedback loops are needed for results of 
evaluations to be utilised in future policy and programme developments. When well 
strengthened and developed, the learning aspect is fundamental to the attainment of 
sustainability and improvement of M&E systems themselves. Usually, this kind of feedback 
occurs during the utilisation of M&E information, especially when results are presented 
(Fereday & Muir -Cochrane, 2006; Holvoet & Rombouts, 2008) . Therefore, feedback from 
M&E systems helps managers to promote institutional learning, following a cycle that involves
<<<PAGE=71>>>
52 
 
reflecting on progress and perfecting the course of projects or programmes where need is 
required (Kusek & Rist, 2004; Simson et al., 2011). 
 
A well-functioning feedback mechanism operates as an early warning s ystem to development 
management in that when problems are identified, questions about the assumptions and strategy 
behind a development intervention are raised and possible solutions put in place. In that aspect, 
providing pointers forms the primary function of M&E and this improves the understanding of 
what works and what does not work and to some extent why (Savedoff, Levine & Birdsall. 
2006; Baum & Tolbert, 1985; Hardlife & Zhou, 2013; Naidoo, 2011).  
 
However, Pitchett, Samji and Hammer (2012) caution that sustaining the learning function of 
M&E is usually not easy, particularly given its complex nature, which involves a process of 
cultural and political dynamics of continuous and systematic management of public affairs. 
These authors contend that although it has been demonstrated implicitly that M&E functions 
result in some desired learning and reflection, it is not always so, and this requires that 
organisations regularly integrate information in such complex development situations 
(Bemelemans-Videc, Marie-Louise, Rist & Vedung, 2007; Naidoo, 2011).  
 
Similarly, Mayne and Zapico -Goni (2007) argue that the utilisation of evaluation in 
organisations remains unpredi ctable and hard to sustain for several reasons, among them 
political or contextual, technical ( that is,  methodological) and organisational bureaucratic 
dynamics. All these factors are necessary if the learning function is to take place successfully. 
In that way, Mackay (2006) and Pollitt (1998) regard M&E as a management tool that supports 
the quality of information for use in decision-making processes, thus helping to build learning 
organisations (see also Carlsson & Engel, 2002; Savedoff et al., 2006; Carrier, Bonnet-Laverge 
& Dixon, 2017).  
 
2.5 Linking monitoring and evaluation systems to good governance  
 
There is an increasing linkage between M&E systems and good governance, which comes from 
providing governments and other stakeholders with the desired information on the relevance, 
efficiency, effectiveness and quality of government policies, projects and programmes (DBSA, 
2000). Information from M&E systems contributes to the enhancement of the public sector’s 
accountability, feedback and learning functions. Here , good governance refers broadly to
<<<PAGE=72>>>
53 
 
aspects such as accountability, transparen cy, combating corruption, inclusiveness and 
participation, and legal and judicial reforms (World Bank, 1999; Naidoo, 2011; Simson et al., 
2011). This increase in demand for M&E informati on can be attributed to the  increasing 
demand for good governance from providers of goods and services.  
 
For the past two decades , internal and external development stakeholders have pushed their 
governments for results, demanding outcomes and impact of implemented policies, 
programmes and projects. These stakeholders are asking for evidence -based feedback on the 
status of current and ongoing development interventions. For example, since the mid-2000s, 
M&E has become more popular among international development organisations and the focus 
has since been on results and impact of development assistance (INTRAC, 2011; Kusek & Rist, 
2004).  
 
An M&E system provides evidence -based information that is important in informing 
development policy processes such as planning , targeting, prioritisation, budgeting and 
expenditures (Valadez & Bamberger, 1994). A similar argument is posited by Segone (2009) 
and  Mehrotra (2013) that M&E systems are important and relevant not only to individual 
development agencies, but to many institutions and at different level s of development 
interventions and processes, regardless of their size and location. 
 
As a result, countries around the world seem to have consensus on the urgent need for 
functional WoGM&ES as useful tools for promoting good governance and poverty reduction. 
To that extent, observations have shown that many countries are building and implementing 
M&E in pursuit of satisfying growing needs from their citizens and other interested 
stakeholders (Mackay, 2007) . Although these efforts are justifiably being implemented at 
various levels of development owing to divergent in -country dynamics, that something was 
being done signified how M&E has been accepted globally as an essential ingredient towards 
improved public sector management, poverty reduction and overall sustained good governance 
practices. The benefits associated with M&E come from the use of a range of to ols that are 
supposed to be applied appropriately, depending on the nature of an intervention. DBSA (2000) 
points out that M&E uses ongoing or continuing performance monitoring, real-time evaluations 
supporting continuous learning at all levels of development, performance and financial audits 
and ex -post e valuations. Furthermore, one of the collectively agreed positions in the 2000 
report titled ‘Can Africa claim the 21st century?’ was that improved governance among African
<<<PAGE=73>>>
54 
 
countries was one of the most basic requirements for fast -tracking the African devel opment 
results-based agenda. The report argued in support of improved management, better 
distribution of economic resources, stronger institutions and programmes that make it possible 
to compel governments accountable to their citizens  (Gomez et al., 2009; World Bank, 2000; 
Casley & Kumar, 1988). 
 
Good governance is not an abstract notion; it is a way of conducting affairs that are in the public 
interest and should be democratically enriching (Weiss, 2000; Chevalier & Buckles, 2013 ). 
Good governance relates to a way of doing things or conducting activities that are proper, 
transparent and accountable. Furthermore, r esearchers at the World Bank distinguished six 
dimensions of good governance, namely v oice and accountability, government effectiveness, 
lack of regulatory burden, rule of law, independence of the judiciary, and control of corruption 
(Kaufmann, Sanginés & Moreno, 2015).  
 
M&E thus plays a significant role in the transformation process of public sector management 
systems by inherently advancing the ideals of good governance . Naidoo (2011) affirms that 
M&E strengthens concepts of transparency, accountability and improvement at strategic and 
operational levels and that these resonate well with the tenets of  good governance. Further, 
according to Krause (2010) , M&E has been known to support performance management at 
various levels, thereby contributing to a results-focused approach by providing methodological 
options in support of the performance management process itself. In addition, Figure 2.1 shows 
fundamental conditions that are useful for supporting and measuring good governance, of 
which effective M&E systems is a crucial aspect.

2.6 Conclusion  
 
Chapter 2 discussed the concepts of ‘monitoring’ and ‘evaluation’. Its focus was on articulating 
M&E in the context of good governance in pursuit of a results-based sustainable development. 
In particular, the chapter discussed reasons for governments to invest in building and sustaining 
functional and results -based WoGM&ES s to give a holistic picture of the perceived and 
experienced benefits of embracing M&E at various levels of governance. If governments and 
their development counterparts fail to develop functional systems for monitoring and 
evaluation, the cost would be huge. The point was made that governments need to dedicate 
more time and resources to strengthening institutional and human capacities towards building 
stronger and more sustainable WoGM&ES s. For the Zambian government and other 
development stakeholders, the chapter presented a solid foundation on which not only to 
inculcate M&E skills in a few technical people, but to reform the entire culture of governance, 
one that would be driven by a strengthened WoGM&ES.  
 
Chapter 3 focuses on the theoretical framework, which deals with the guiding principles of the 
study. It discusses four theoretical perspectives: theory of change (ToC), results -based 
management (RBM), managing for development results ( MfDRs) and the logical framework 
approach (LFA). These theoretical constructs are discussed as anchors of the subject matter of 
M&E and upon which M&E systems are promoted.

CHAPTER 3  
 
Theoretical Framework  
 
 3.1 Introduction  
 
Chapter 3 articulates the theoretical framework, which provides the fundamental guiding 
principles for this research study. It clarifies from the theoretical perspective the basis on which 
the concepts and practice of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are built. To do so, it discusses 
four contemporary theoretical perspectives that explain the logic and practice behind M&E. 
Thus, theory of change (ToC), results-based management (RBM), managing for development 
results (MfDRs) and the logical framework approach (LFA) are discussed as constructs that 
form the broader theoretical basis a nd guidance for this research. The chapter starts by 
discussing the ToC phenomenon as the overall theoretical framework that has been adopted to 
guide this research study. It then discusses the phenomena of RBM, MfDRs and the LFA. For 
each, it provides background information and definitions and then discusses how the paradigm 
is linked to and helps to understand M&E. These discussions are regarded as important because 
the whole-of-government M&E system (WoGM&ES) for Zambia is expected to be developed 
and guided by the principles entrenched in clearly defined theoretical foundations  (GRZ, 
2017b; Mackay, 2007).  
 
Theory of change (ToC) was adopted to guide this study. However, Chapter 3 describes the 
other theoretical approaches ( that is, RBM, MfDRs and LFA) to provide a broader 
understanding of ToC and the relationships and linkages between the concepts and practice of 
M&E. This is to demonstrate how a functional and a well -institutionalised WoGM&ES 
contributes to the attainment of good governance towards the achievement of higher-level goals 
of poverty reduction and sustained socio -economic development. A cause -effect relationship 
between a country-level WoGM&ES and the ultimate desired development results of poverty 
reduction and improved wellbeing of people is presented in the framework of the ToC. Chapter 
3 also provides a synthesis of the theoretical framework of the research. It clarifies that although 
the ToC provides the overall theoretical perspective for the study, RBM, MfDRs and LFA help 
to amplify the understanding of the need, relationships and linkages between M&E and the 
good governance agenda of governmen ts and development agencies towards poverty 
reduction.

3.2 Theory of change  
 
The field of M&E strongly inspires the theoretical foundations of the ToC, which equally 
provides the theoretical basis for M&E (Weiss, 2000). There seems to be a chicken- and- egg 
dilemma relationship. In the literature of development studies and materials on management of 
development interventions, ToC is the predominant contemporary theory guiding phenomenon 
in pursuing the success of such efforts.  
 
Consequently, ToC, also known as programme theory, forms the theoretical framework for this 
research study. Many theorists and M&E practitioners and scholars have attempted to provide 
meaning to the concept of ToC. Rogers (2008:30) describes it as follows:  
Theory of change, variously referred to as programme theory, programme logic (Funnell, 1997), 
theory-based evaluation (Weiss, 1995, 1998; Albert et al., 1998), theory -driven evaluation (Chen, 
1990), theory -of-action (Schorr, 1997), intervention logic (Nagarajan & Vanheukelen, 1997), 
impact pathway analysis (Douthwaite et al., 2003b), and programme theory -driven evaluation 
science (Donaldson, 2005) refers to a variety of ways of developing a causal modal linking 
programme inputs and activities to a chain of intended or observed outcomes, and then using this 
model to guide the evaluation. 
 
ToC denotes a systematic visual way of pre senting and sharing an understanding and 
perspective of the relationships among the resources available to operationalise a programme, 
planned activities and changes or desired results (W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 2004) . Many 
development commentators have advocated for the adoption and utilisation of the ToC. 
According to Brousselle and Champagne (2011)  and Rogel (2012), ToC has received a great 
deal of attention in programme evaluation for over two decades, signifying its important role 
in the implementation of development interventions and to the poverty reduction agenda. 
 
Figure 3 .1 illustrates the thinking behind the ToC, demonstrating how a development 
intervention’s inputs lead to executing activities and how these activities help to achieve the 
high-level results of outputs, outcomes and desired impacts. The main thrust of the ToC is the 
cause-effect relationship of development results  (that is, inputs -activities-outputs-outcomes-
impacts).
<<<PAGE=77>>>

To understand the concept of ToC, it is perhaps important to appreciate the concept of the 
‘black box’, which was popular before ToC became ‘the buzz words’ in M&E. For many years, 
black box theory  was used to initiate, desi gn, implement and evaluate development 
interventions such as projects, programmes and policies (Rey, Brousselle  & Dedobbeleer, 
2012). It did not concern itself fully with the understanding or clarification of the cause-effect 
relationship in development programming, but the focus was on the resources or inputs 
required to undertake a development action. As described by Jacob and Ferrer (2000:1) , ‘the 
black box is a plan -of-work programming that assembles the inputs, delive rs them, then 
proceeds to measure the outputs. Thus, if the black box represents the real world, we find 
ourselves on the outside, trying to look in. We stand outside the black box, delivering the 
“inputs” and expecting the “outputs”. We have no idea why t he programme may be a success 
or failure, it all happens inside the black box.’ The main interest in the black box approach was 
to mobilise inputs or resources, deliver them, and expect immediate results. This was done 
without a deliberate well-conceived understanding of the interlinkages and causal relationships 
between inputs and the anticipated outputs. Because of the absence of linking aspects or 
elements that help achieve the intended development results, rethinking became inevitable. 
ToC was therefore a new way of looking at the efficient conceptualisation and achievement of 
development results, hence going beyond black box thinking.
<<<PAGE=78>>>
59 
 
Vogel (2012) regards ToC as an approach based on outcome -level results in which critical 
thinking is applied to designing, impleme nting, monitoring and evaluating development 
initiatives. Worldwide, ToC is used by stakeholders such as multi -lateral and bilateral 
development agencies, civil society organisations, governments, international non -state actor 
organisations and research programmes to support development outcomes. Rogers (2011) adds 
that ToC refers to the process by which change comes about for an individual, organisation or 
a community, while Sridharan and  Naikama (2010)  agree that a programme theory should 
ideally describe the hypothesised processes by which a programme can bring about change. 
For W. K. Kellogg Foundation (2004) , a programme logic model represents a roadmap of 
programme highlights in terms of how it is expected to work and the required activities, 
including how desired outcomes and i mpact will be achieved. Thus far, the ToC has much to 
offer to development discourse. As long as there is full stakeholder participation when 
developing development interventions, ToC may guarantee shared planning and understanding 
of organisational and pr ogramme goals. In addition, rigorous testing of assumptions may be 
made in the process of planning, budgeting and implementing such deliverables, thereby 
improving accountability and learning functions (Bickman, 1987; Leeuw, 2003; McLaughlin 
& Jordan, 1999; Rossi, Lipsey & Freeman, 2004; Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, 2012; 
White, 2009; Wholey, 1983, 1987). 
 
TOC has been used for a long time by stakeholders to define their intended development 
interventions. Provided that a programme or any development intervention has been described 
in terms of the logic model,  Chen (2012) , Funnell and Rogers (2011)  assert that critical 
measures of performance can be identified and determined. A sequence of cause -and-effect 
relationships could effectively be illustrated using logic models, which represent  a systems 
approach to communicating pathways to achieving desired development results. Furthermore, 
Rogers (2014) and the International Network on Strategic Philanthropy (2005) simply sees the 
ToC as a clear explanation of how activities are perceived in ter ms of producing the intended 
higher-level outcomes and impacts for any given development effort. 
 
This research study intends to demonstrate that M&E are important functions of good 
governance and that building stronger WoGM&ESs by governments becomes inevitable and a 
much-desired undertaking. That way, development decisions at all levels would be enhanced 
because they would be informed by timely and relevant information. For that reason, results of 
this research will be useful towards the improvement of Za mbia’s public sector M&E
<<<PAGE=79>>>

arrangements. The ToC is a helpful construct to conceptualise success by using a clear path -
way to realising desired results and overall improved living standards of the people, especially 
the poor and marginalised majority. 
 
Governments a nd development agencies often have ambitious goals, and so planning and 
implementing specific on-the-ground strategies to those goals is not an easy undertaking . In 
such instances, theories of change  are vital to development programming and evaluation 
success for a number of reasons. To gain desired results, development programmes need to be 
grounded in good theory. Therefore, by developing a ToC based on good theory, managers and 
implementers can be better assured that their programmes are delivering the right activities for 
the desired outcomes. Thus, by creating a ToC programmes are easier to sustain, bring to scale, 
and evaluate, since each step—from the ideas behind it, to the outcomes it hopes to provide, to 
the resources needed—are clearly defined within the theory. Figure 3.2 below shows a flow of 
how different results for a development programme  can be achieved —desired vision can be 
attained through putting in place appropriate inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and impact.

Figure 3.2 below provides an illustration of the ToC for building a national-level M&E system 
that is meant to contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development. The 
representation is significant in that success is conceived in a simplified manner. ToC signifies 
a results-chain that brings together fundamental elements of development action, harmonising 
and connecting them to achieve higher-level goals and objectives, in this context, the outcomes 
and overall development impact.

M&E systems are not only directly related to, but are important determining elements in the 
poverty reduction agendas of successful countries. The cause -effect relationship is a strategic 
theoretical way of appreciating long -term results from the planning point of view. Figure 3.2  
demonstrates that a country’s M&E system should be able to capture data and information from 
all activities of government interventions to impact level. However, the M&E system should 
be a public system that allows non-governmental actors such as the civil society, academia and 
donors to take an active part in analysing government operations and utilising M&E 
information. Other key arms of governance such as parliament should be strongly linked to the 
M&E system in utilising the M&E information.  
 
M&E systems fulfi l an important functio n in the good governance agenda  of aid-dependent 
developing countries, especially in their bid to reduce poverty for citizens. Mackay (2007:9) 
asserts that M&E can provide unique information about government performance of projects, 
programmes and policies. Because M&E provides performance information of donors that 
support the work of governments, it assists in identifying what works and what does not work, 
and in making us understand the reasons. Thus, ToC becomes a crucial and appropriate 
theoretical phenomenon for this research study to provide a pathway to the attainment of 
development results through a stronger WoGM&ES for Zambia.       
 
3.3 Results-Based Management  
 
The evolution of the Results Based Management ( RBM) approach from the 1990s onwards 
seemingly contributed to the effective and efficient delivery of goods and service s by public 
sector and other development agencies. Today, the RBM approach is being used widely in the 
developed and less developed countries (LDCs)  as a practically oriented management 
approach, including results frameworks or logic models, results -based strategic planning, risk 
management, results-focused budgeting, and results-based M&E (OECD & World Bank, 2006, 
2007, 2008) . In line with the ToC, the concept of RBM is based on the cause -and-effect 
relationships in which inputs and activities of an intervention lead logically to higher orders of 
results. In this context, development results entail well -sequenced and time -bound changes 
connected to a series of management phases in the programming cycle for a development 
policy, project or programme (Mackay, 2007; Raimondo, 2016). The main emphasis of RBM 
is the realisation of higher-level outcomes that are meant to improve the wellbeing of people. 
In other words, RBM is concerned with how accountable development interventions and their
<<<PAGE=82>>>
63 
 
programming are in attaining desired medium and long -term results (World Bank, 2007b ; 
OECD & World Bank, 2006, 2007, 2008).  
 
RBM represents a management strategy that is characterised by clear and distinctive 
framework and tools for organisational strategic planning, performance monitoring and 
evaluation, risk management meant to measure and attain significant changes in the way 
development agencies operate ( Hauge, 2001) . The main purposes of RBM include the 
fulfilment of accountability obligations through performance reporting and improving the 
organisational learning function (Mackay, 2007; Meier, 2003; World Bank, 2007a; OECD & 
World Bank, 2006).  
 
RBM is a management strategy that is used widely by private, public and non -profit making 
organisations around the world. For instance, as a result of the popularity and positive gains 
anticipated from M&E systems, several international initiatives have sprung up to enforce the 
implementation of the RBM approach. Such initiatives as the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) and their successor the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Highly Indebted Poor 
Country (HIPC) Initiative under the Poverty Reduction Strategy approach spearheaded by the 
World Bank and IMF, Paris Declaration (PD), World Trade Organization (WTO) membership, 
International Development Association (IDA) funding, European Union Structu ral Funds and 
Transparency International, European Union (EU) enlargement and accession have embraced 
M&E (World Bank, 2012a) . These provide strong backing for functional M&E systems. In 
fact, the MDGs were pioneers in adopting the most ambitio us global initiative of using a 
results-based approach to poverty reduction and improving people’s living standards (Hardlife 
& Zhou, 2013:72).  
 
At best, therefore, RBM emphasises the performance of a development intervention and results. 
It is holistic and futuristic in practice and intent in that it endeavours to provide current evidence 
and future information about development interventions under implementation (UNDG, 2010; 
UNESCO, 2015).  
 
Thus, RBM is a tool that is implementable through the development and usage of fu nctional 
M&E systems. These systems are meant to enable governments to plan and meet the aspirations 
of their citizens and other stakeholders in terms of results such as improvements in human 
development and economic growth. Therefore, in view of implement ing a results -based
<<<PAGE=83>>>
64 
 
management system for better governance, a country or institution may build and sustain 
functional M&E systems by strengthening existing ones or building new ones.  
 
In addition to defining and describing the concept of RBM, linking RBM  to the functions of 
M&E is an important aspect. Thus, the linkages between RBM and M&E are inevitably 
stronger. M&E refers to the systematic collection of performance information pertaining to a 
given intervention against stated desired objectives  (OECD & World Bank, 2007) . 
Consequently, such information is then used as input in internal and external organisational 
management decision - and policy -making processes for purposes of improvement. To that 
extent, M&E offers strong operation al models, frameworks and tools that are useful for 
measuring performance, which ultimately and comprehensively leads to increased 
effectiveness and efficiency in the implementation of development interventions (Astbury & 
Leeuw, 2010; Coleman, 1987; Rogers, 2008; World Bank, 1997) . Hence, it can be observed 
that the two notions of M&E and RBM resonate, despite the practical challenge of a seemingly 
chicken-and-egg dilemma5 relationship, which tends to exist between the concepts. Schultz 
(2009) and UNDG (2010) , in affirming this view, assert that RBM represents a strategy for 
enhancing the M&E function and its culture, particularly in the context of strengthening a 
country’s WoGM&ES, while the activities of M&E could effecti vely assist in realising the 
objectives pursuable under RBM.  
 
More precisely, M&E has been increasingly adopted to assess the achievement of development 
results since the 1990s. This was the period in which RBM approaches came into wider use by 
public ins titutions and international development agencies. In the same period, the RBM 
approach became predominant. Thus, the application of M&E could have brought about the 
emergence and popularisation of the RBM approach among development agencies, including 
governments (Schultz, 2009).  
 
Therefore, the relationship between RBM and M&E is intrinsic and the two are a fundamental 
way of achieving great development results. In that sense, it is crucial to ensure that M&E is 
pursued within the broader context of RBM, and vice versa, and that practitioners and learners 
                                                 
5The chicken or the egg causality dilemma is commonly stated as ‘which came first: the chicken or the egg?‘ The 
dilemma stems from the observation that all chicke ns hatch from eggs and all chicken eggs are laid by chickens. 
‘Chicken-and-egg’ therefore is a metaphoric adjective describing situations where it is not clear which of the two 
events should be considered the cause and which one is the effect.
<<<PAGE=84>>>

of both take this important relationship into account. The conceptualisation of success in 
development management in the context of RBM and M&E is significant, thus, building and 
sustaining a stronger WoGM&ES is essential for the Government of the Republic of Zambia.  
 
3.4 Managing for Development Results  
 
Managing for development results ( MfDRs) is another concept that has become common 
among practitioners of M&E around the globe. Like the ToC and RBM approach, MfDRs has 
become a widely adopted and practised paradigm among public sector and non -state 
development actors. Like the RBM approach, MfDRs is understood broadly as a management 
strategy whose emphasis is the achievement of devel opment results at all levels of an 
intervention. The approach uses performance information to support enhanced decision -
making processes through the utilisation of technical tools for strategic planning, progress 
monitoring, outcome evaluation and risk management (AfCoP-MfDRs, 2014). At the core of 
the MfDRs strategy is the concrete and continuous utilisation of evidence to inform all phases 
of development processes. Typically, the approach involves shared tenets of good governance, 
which include objective setting, transparency, evidence -based decision making, and constant 
adaptation and improvement (World Bank, 2007a; OECD & World Bank, 2006, 2007).  
 
The utilisation of results in informing development processes is the central focus of the MfDRs 
strategy. This is so because governments and other development agencies usually find 
themselves undertaking efforts to alleviate poverty without using evidence generated from 
systems of monitoring and evaluation or indeed any accountab ility feedback. In that regard, 
the MfDR strategy puts an emphasis on the acquisition of evidence by those in charge of public 
policy and decision making and directly utilise such information for development purposes. 
The strategy contends that in the midst of sca rce resources in the custody of development 
agencies, including governments, it is incumbent upon public managers and agencies to seek 
and use evidence for planning and designing development interventions.    
 
Table 3.1  below illustrates the significance a nd historical evolution of MfDRs as a good 
governance strategy for effective development management towards poverty reduction.
<<<PAGE=85>>>

Table 3.1. Managing for development results – a historical perspective 
At the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico (2002), the international 
community agreed that it would be important to provide more financing for development – but more money 
alone was not enough. Donors and partner countries alike wanted to know that aid would be used as effectively 
as possible, and they wanted to be able to see that it was, in fact, making a difference. This threw into sharp 
relief the need to measure results throughout the development process, and the need to demonstrate that results 
were achieved. Soon afterward, the World Bank convened an  International Roundtable on Measuring, 
Monitoring, and Managing for Results (2002) , at which d evelopment practitioners grappled with concepts, 
approaches, and practical issues related to getting development results.  
At the  Second International Roundtable on Managing for Development Results, in  Marrakech, Morocco 
(2004), more than 60 representatives of partner countries met with representatives of bilateral and multilateral 
development agencies to discuss the challenges of managing for development results ( MfDRs). Participants 
endorsed a set of  core principles on how best to support partner countries’ efforts to manage for results, and 
agreed on a costed and time -bound action plan for improving national and international statistics – without 
which baselines cannot be established and progress cannot be measured.  
At the  Paris High -Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (2005) , 60 partner countries and 60 donor agencies 
endorsed the Paris Declaration, committing to spec ific action to further country ownership, harmonisation, 
alignment, managing for development results, and mutual accountability for the use of aid.  
In 2007, the Third Roundtable on Managing for Development Results in Hanoi, Vietnam, focused on country-
to-country learning. Representatives from 45 countries, 32 development agencies, and 30 civil society and 
private sector partners shared experiences and charted a course for continuing efforts.   
In 2008 the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness took place in Accra with the participation of about 
1,700 participants, including more than 100 ministries and heads of agencies from developing and donor 
countries, emerging economies, UN and multilateral institutions, global funds, foundations, and 80 civil society 
organisations. The high -level engagement at Accra helped bring about the  Accra Agenda for Action  which 
expressed the international community's commitment to further increase aid effectiveness.

The historical perspective in Table 3.1 shows how MfDRs as a concept has emerged over the 
years and how it has led to the transformation of the global development agenda. 
 
Furthermore, there has been an evolution at global level of the adoption and utilisation of the 
MfDRs approach by development agencies and governments in their efforts to lower poverty 
levels, attain equitable and sustainable economic growth, and improve the definition and 
measurement of development results. In its broader scope, development effectiveness refers to 
countries and agencies being able to meet their collective development outcomes using the 
right tools to measure progress towards desired results, report on them, and  improve 
performance by continuously using the lessons learned (Mackay, 2007; OECD & World Bank, 
2006).
<<<PAGE=86>>>
67 
 
MfDRs, like related concepts such as the RBM and LFA, is focused on the achievement of 
development results. S ince the Monterrey 6 Conference of 2002, there has been a focus on 
managing the work of the development community (which comprises partner countries and 
donors) to achieve the maximum development results. Thus, although there were efforts before 
2002, the new era of a shared and strengthened understanding concerning the need to think 
about results and ways to sustainably realise them from the beginning to the end of an 
intervention has become the emphasis. However, this demands regular monitoring of progress 
in order to continue shaping  the effort so that the expected results were achieved as planned 
(Mackay, 2007; Meier, 2003; World Bank, 2007b).  
 
In 2004 at the Second Round Table Meeting on Managing for Results, principles for the MfDRs 
were agreed by development stakeholders. MfDRs has stipulated principle s that guide its 
practice and these include aligned programming results -based M&E; keeping simplified 
measurement and reporting; managing for results, not managing by results; and learning and 
decision making using information from results (Schacter, 2000 & Mackay, 2006). 
 
OECD and World Bank (2006, 2007, 2008)  and Kusek and Rist (2004)  add that although in 
the current understanding, RBM is synonymous with MfDRs, accountability has been the only 
core focus of some approaches to RBM. Instead, MfDRs departs from this basic undertaking 
by incorporating newer and more innovative ideas about country ownership, harmonisation, 
collaboration, partnership, and alignment. In addition, MfDRs focuses continuously on country 
outcome performance, which is a higher management standard than giving prominence to 
short-term results only. Table 3.2 shows the three core focus areas for MfDRs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
6 The Monterrey Consensus was the outcome of the 2002, United Nations International Conference on Financing 
for Development in Monterrey, Mexico. It was adopted by heads of state and government on 22 March 2002. 
Over fifty heads of state and two hundred ministers of finance, foreign affairs, development and trade participated 
in the event. Governments were joined by the heads of the United Nations, International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
World Bank  and World Trade Organization  (WTO), prominent business and civil society leaders and other  
stakeholders.

Table 3.2. Core areas for Managing for Development Results 
Areas of Action  
In the global community, action on MfDRs is taking place in three broad areas: 
1. Strengthening Country Capacity to Manage for Results.  The quest for development results begins with 
developing countries, which must manage their development processes to achieve the outcomes they want. 
They need to define the results they want to attain and  – working in partnership with development agencies, 
civil society, and other stakeholders – design policies and programmes to achieve those results. Countries need 
information on which to base this work, and statistical capacity and monitoring and evaluation systems to 
generate the information. The role of development agencies is to support developing countries in strengthening 
their capacity to manage for development results 
2. Improving the Relevance and Effectiveness of Aid.  For most development agencies, managing for 
development results means going beyond their tr aditional focus on input delivery and output quality to focus 
on the achievement of outcomes  – that is, a more explicit consideration of the contribution that an agency 
makes to country results. To this end, agencies are introducing results frameworks into  their coo peration 
strategies and programmes , shifting their internal incentives to focus on sustainable country results, and 
developing reporting systems on results 
 
3. Fostering a Global Partnership. Some of the greatest challenges in managing for development results can 
be best addressed through a global partnership  – for example, a global effort is needed to support countries in 
generating reliable and timely data to assess progress on the Millennium Development Goals and other country 
goals; to strengt hen international reporting mechanisms; and reduce the burden on countries of multiple, 
agency-driven reporting requirements and monitoring and evaluation systems. Through partnership, the 
international community can make it easier for developing countries to manage for results

(Online at: http://www.MfDRs.org/Sourcebook.html) 
  
The information in Table 3.2 illustrates how the MfDRs approach has emerged as a centrepiece 
of efforts at global level to improve public management. At best, MfDRs is broadly considered 
an example of best practice in development management. Unequivocally, in an attempt to 
achieve desired development results, MfDRs focuses on improving all financial, technological, 
human, and natural resources, internal and external. In that regard, it becomes inevitable to 
view MfDRs not only as a methodology, but as a way of thinking and acting, built and linked 
on a practically oriented toolbox for enhanc ed public management (OECD & World Bank, 
2007, 2008).  
 
Therefore, to achieve success, it is crucial to invest in the development and nurture of a 
‘performance culture’ that could be attained operationally through full implementation of the 
MfDRs approach. Nevertheless, this kind of development achievement can come effe ctively 
by creating incentivising results -focused management systems and internal preconditions 
through targeted human resource and organisational development (AfCoP-MfDRs, 2014) . 
However, cap acity development alone would not be enough, thus requiring a stronger and 
sustained leadership and political buy -in, of which both are essential ingredients in pursuing 
the fuller benefits of institutionalising a MfDRs approach. Consequently, the role of leadership 
remains central to constantly clarifying the essential organisational objectives and functions
<<<PAGE=88>>>
69 
 
through setting the development course. Additionally, a visionary leadership provides a clear 
model of operation and works to inculcate a transformational development agenda at individual 
and institutional levels pursuant to a results orientation. In that regard, sound leadership 
develops and seeks to sustain an incentive structure that assists in realising a change in 
institutional and cultural conduct  (Meier, 2003) . Further,  Hauge (2001)  affirmed that  the 
MfDRs approach is essential in that it represents an essential shift in such key aspects as policy 
process, predominantly in the nature of thinking, acting and overall management in the wider 
scope of the public sector . In the absence of prudent publi c management approaches like 
MfDRs, governments will tend to perform poorly in good governance tenets of accountability, 
transparency and reward mechanisms.    
 
Therefore, MfDRs denotes a strategy for prudent management and measurement of 
development performance, and emphasises sustainable improvements in country -specific and 
organisational results . In that context, a result is a describable or measurable development 
change emanating from a cause and effect relationship (OECD/DAC, 2004). According to the 
World Bank (2007) and Mackay (2007 ), MfDRs contributes to processes of policy - and 
decision-making improvement by making available evidence -based information on results. 
This is achieved through a range of tools and techniques, which include strategic planni ng, 
progress monitoring, risk management, and outcome evaluation. To a large extent, MfDRs is 
aimed at holding development actors such as governments, international agencies and 
individuals accountable for delivering desired results to the citizens they se rve. Therefore, 
country systems are required to promote the managing for results agenda in order to have an 
improved and sustainable country development results  (OECD & World Bank, 2006, 2007, 
2008). 
 
MfDRs has recently evolved to incor porate a range of policy issues, including country 
ownership, harmonisation and alignment of donor efforts, international goals and standards, 
accountability for development results, and the participation of civil society and other interest 
groups (Davies et. al., 2009; Hassan, 2005). Therefore, advocates of good governance see this 
approach as a way for governments to be accountable to their own citizens and to donors. 
Further, as can be seen in Figure 3.3, MfDRs ensures that all development efforts must b e 
informed from inception by the end result. Such a long -term planning horizon is useful in 
allocating all forms of resources and efforts in a focused and meaningful way.
<<<PAGE=89>>>

Figure 3.4. Managing for Development Results cycle: importance of results at all levels 
 
MfDRs interrogates a number of critical development aspects and these assist in achieving  
results. Information flow, mainly in terms of its supply and demand, is a central aspect of the 
MfDRs approach. In particular, the capacity of a country to provide credible and well-analysed 
statistical data and information, and ultimately how these are p ut to use by users, becomes 
pertinent to success (Hauge & Mackay, 2004; Lucas et al., 2004). 
 
The linkages between MfDRs and M&E can be demonstrated in a number of ways. Like ToC, 
RBM and LFA, MfDRs is premised on the elements of a results chain, namely the inputs, 
activities, outputs, outcomes and im pacts, as illustrated in Table 3.3 . It is also upon these 
elements that M&E is conducted properly and thus the linkages between MfDRs and M&E 
could be easily appreciated.

the desired results under MfDRs, the results of the MfDRs approach become a significant 
feedback for strengthening and undertaking M&E exercises successfully (Mackay, 2007; 
World Bank, 2007b). 
 
M&E offers a strong foundation for anchoring performance measurement tools and models, 
which ultimately contribute to increased effectiveness in the development and management of 
interventions (Brushett, 1998). For instance, since the 1990s, M&E has become the most used 
way of assessing the achievement of results. This was at a time that approaches for results -
based management (RBM) came into wider utilisation in country-level public institutions and 
international development agencies. This evolution of adopting and using results -based M&E 
continues today and is a major component of the MfDRs toolbox, helping governments and 
agencies to systemat ically measure project and programme outcomes (Hauge & Mackay, 
2004). In that regard, M&E is viewed as an important component in helping achieve the 
objectives of MfDRs.  
 
To practically embrace and institutionalise MfDRs as a re sults-oriented and management 
strategy, leaders of development institutions and governments should propagate and promote 
the agenda. At the same time, leaders are supposed to develop transformational systems of 
M&E, which provide relevant information for o ther development processes. Lopez-Acevedo, 
Krause and Mackay (2012) and Hwang (2014) caution that a lot of challenges are faced by 
national leaders in putting in place stronger M&E systems under the broader MfDRs reform 
agenda. Instead of focusing on the utilisation of lower-level traditional process results of inputs, 
activities and outputs, it is important for agencies of development to have a long-term horizon 
of desired development results (Mackay, 2007; World Bank, 2007a). 
 
3.5 Logical framework approach  
 
In addition to the theoretical understanding of the efforts that contribute to clarifying the 
practice and meaningfulness of M&E in the development discourse, the Logical Framework 
Approach (LFA) is a key management tool. Simply put, a n LFA is a technical management 
technique that comprehensively summarises significant information associated with given 
development interventions.  In other words, it is a  matrix or simply a table covering such 
categories as inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts ( that is, objectives); indicators 
(or objectively verifiable indicators); and the means of verification; and assumptions/risks
<<<PAGE=91>>>
72 
 
(Coleman, 1987) . According to the World Bank (1997) , LFA is practised by  many 
organisations in project planning and management.  
 
Further, World Bank (1997)  asserts that the evolution of the LFA is traceable to the 1970s. 
Since then it has been u tilised widely by managers in processes such as planning, budgeting 
and management of development interventions. Other attributions state that it originated from 
the US military planning approach. May et. al (2006)  explain that before being adopted and 
used by USAID for development projects over fifty years ago, the LFA was adapted for the US 
space agency NASA. Logical frameworks are thus widely used to strengthen the internal logic 
of activity design, implementation and evaluation. In other words, a logical framework matrix 
(often simply called the ‘logframe’) serves to transla te this broader LFA theoretical 
understanding into action, and as a document forms the basis of an actionable work plan to 
guide implementation through the project or programme lifecycle. In that regard, the LFA 
becomes a critical management tool upon which M&E could be premised.  
 
Through a thorough LFA, once a project has been described in terms of the logic model, critical 
measures of performance can be identified. The logframe thus assists directly in establishing 
the development pathway by which: 
 Objectives will be reached  
 The potential risks to achieving the objectives are identified  
 The ways in which outputs and outcomes might best be monitored and evaluated 
are established 
 A summary of the activity is presented in a standard format, and  
 Suggestions are made for M&E activities during implementation  
 
In addition, a logical framework could be understood as a set of concepts that are interlinked 
and used conjointly to elaborate a well-conceived project or programme, described in terms of 
objectives and from which it will then be possible to evaluate the results (World Bank, 2007b; 
May et al., 2006; Engela & Ajam, 2010; World Bank, 1997). According to Coleman (1987:56), 
an LFA was described by its developers as ‘a set of interlocking concepts which must be used 
together in a dynamic fashion to permit the elaboration of a well -designed, obj ectively 
described and evaluable project’. Further, the  International Finance Corporation, Germany 
Technical Cooperation and Department for International Development state that the LFA is a 
management tool that identifies strategic elements of inputs, acti vities, outputs, outcomes and 
impact (IFC, GTZ & DFID, 2008). These elements are regarded as having causal relationships
<<<PAGE=92>>>
73 
 
with indicators and assumptions or risks that may influence success and trigger failure of an 
intervention. The LFA therefore facilitates the key processes of effective planning, budgeting, 
implementation and monitoring and evaluation of policies, programmes and projects. 
 
Therefore, the LFA can be considered a tool that supports RBM in systematically managing 
projects and programmes and by  focusing on high -level results.  Further, the LFA not only 
logically establishes project objectives and defines their cause -effect relationships, it also 
fundamentally describes external factors that influence success, namely assumptions and risks 
that require critical attention to safeguard the smooth implementation of development 
interventions. Thus, through the identification of performance indicators that help determine 
the status of implementation and progress for a given intervention, the LFA can effectively be 
attributed to supporting the enhancement of regular monitoring and evaluation (M&E). T able 
3.4 illustrates an LFA by showing the linkages and interlinkages of key concepts.

Further, the simplicity of the logical framework seems to be deceptive. On the one han d, a 
logframe can be described as a 4 x 4 matrix, characterised by rows representing the levels of 
project objectives, including the means necessary for their achievement ( that is, the vertical 
logic). On the other hand, it has columns that indicate how th e achievement of these various 
objectives could effectively be verified (that is, horizontal logic).
<<<PAGE=93>>>
74 
 
a) Vertical logic  
Vertical logic refers to the factors that a stated project intends to achieve. This is done by 
clarifying relationships between project means and ends. The causal relationships are made in 
the context of uncertainties that concern the project itself and associated environmental factors 
such as social, physical and political. Much of the work is embedded in the process of ensuring 
that all concepts in the logframe are considered holistically to give the kind of vertical logical 
explanation that is expected. These vertical linkages and explanations would include checking 
the hierarchy of project objectives, the causal linkages across the hi erarchy and whether the 
important assumptions have been taken into account. The vertical logic include these elements, 
as shown in Table 3.5:  
 
Table 3.5. Elements of vertical logic 
Objective/element Description  
Goal The reason for undertaking the project: the ultimate objective of the programme to 
which the specific project will contribute 
Impact The broader and high-level result of a programme over a longer term. Are people’s 
lives improved? Is public health improved as a res ult of the intervention (e.g. the 
availability of drugs to combat HIV/AIDS? Is asthma reduced as result of the drop 
in carbon emissions in a country (or in a particular region/city? 
Purpose/Outcome  What the project is expected to achieve in development t erms once it is completed 
within the allocated time. What behavioural changes have occurred in the population 
as a result of the intervention? 
Output The physical outputs produced by the development intervention (the kilometres of 
all-weather paved roads built, the number of power plants constructed, the number 
of health clinics built and quantities of medicines distributed) 
Activity  The activities to be undertaken and the resources available to produce the outputs  
Input  The financial, human, and material resources used for the development intervention 
(amount of dollars, the number of teaching staff, the number of textbooks delivered 
to schools). 
Source: Adapted from Coleman (1987) and World Bank (1997)  
 
b) Horizontal logic 
The primary significance of horizontal logic is to provide some measurement of resources and 
results of development interventions. These measurements are done using what are known as 
objectively verifiable indicators (OVIs) together with the means of verification (MoV). 
Horizontal logic provides details about results to be obtained at each of the higher levels of the 
hierarchy of objectives, namely the output, outcome and impact. Table 3.6  provides a 
description of the elements for the horizontal logic:
<<<PAGE=94>>>
75 
 
Table 3.6. Elements of horizontal logic 
Element   Description  
Objectively verifiable indicators These are referred to as OVIs and represent a set of criteria that indicate 
in concrete terms that the expected results have been achieved. Their 
content adds precision to the statement of intent given in the narrative 
summary. For each level of the vertical logic there is a set of OVI s that 
are appropriate to the objectives at that level and constitute proof of 
achievement at that level 
Means of verification Means of verification (MOV) ensure that the previously defined OVI 
can be measured effectively. They confirm that the indicators are 
realistic, since they specify how the indicators can be verified. MoV are 
the sources of information  
Important assumptions/risks The important assumptions concern conditions that could affect the 
progress or success of the project, but over which the project manager 
has no control. This lack of control may arise from many sources. One 
of the most important is that projects take place in a natural environment 
(rather than in a laboratory where ‘external’ elements can be controlled) 
and are therefore subject to natural variations 
Source: Adapted from Coleman (1987, p. 256) 
 
LFA does not comprise an integrated set of procedures or guidelines for evaluating a particular 
form of project. Instead, it focuses on providing a clear structure for project planners and 
evaluators to specify the components of their activities and to help in identifying logical 
linkages between sets of mean s and corresponding ends  (Engela & Ajam, 2010). For that 
reason, it is imperative to view the LFA as a mechanism that supports logical thinking and as 
a means through which a project may be structured and described for analytical purposes 
(Coleman, 1987; World Bank, 1997). 
 
The relationship and linkages between the LFA and the concept and practice of M&E are clear 
and sustainable. At best, the  LFA could be understood as functionality within the broader 
practice of M&E. In that event, M&E becomes the overall platform under which one may 
design and fully implement the LFA. In that case, the logframe becomes a technique that is 
useful in actualisi ng the results clarified in an M&E framework. M&E focuses on the 
attainment of results using a clear pathway informed by evidence. Through that, the LFA assists 
in making this important development aspiration a reality, and practitioners and implementers 
of interventions for development pursue the LFA seriously. Hence, the logframe matrix 
summarises key information that feeds into M&E processes: 
 What the project should achieve, from the level of an overall goal to specific 
activities 
 The performance questio ns and indicators that are used to monitor progress and 
overall achievement 
 How these indicators are monitored or where the data can be found
<<<PAGE=95>>>
76 
 
 The assumptions behind the logic of the way in which activities will contribute to 
the goal, plus associated risks for the project if assumptions are incorrect 
 LFA deals with seven key questions: Why? What? To whom? How? Who? When? 
How much? (World Bank, 1997:9). 
 
3.6 Theoretical synthesis  
 
In this chapter, Chapter 3, a number of concepts were discussed with the intention of anchoring 
M&E on a solid theoretical foundation. Therefore, as theoretical constructs that are linked to 
M&E—ToC, RBM, MfDRs and LFA were also discussed. However,  although these 
approaches were discussed contextually, ToC is the theory on which this research is built. It 
articulates in a systematic way how strategies, projects, programmes and policies contribute to 
a set of outcomes through a series of intermediate  results (Vogel, 2012). Consequently, the 
pursuit for a strengthened WoGM&ES for the public sector in Zambia is theoretically made 
relevant. Inherently, the ToC describes the pathway through which change will come about 
(Astbury & Leeuw, 2010; GRZ, 2017b). 
 
With well-developed and sustained WoGM&ES, governance profiles of many governments 
would stand high chances of improvement as long as the information from such systems is 
embedded appropriately in decision -making processes. Strengthened M&E activities for any 
country would lead to a sustained economy and reduced poverty for the majority poor 
(Clements et al., 2008; Kusek et al., 2004).  
 
Therefore, the point of departure is that M&E, and more so meaningful and predictable 
investment in strong and sustainable WoGM&ES, is a theoretically critical choice for 
governments in their long-term bids for good governance and poverty reduction. This resonates 
well with what Burdescu et al. (2005)  observed, namely that countries such as those in Latin 
America, with documented evidence of struggle in building and institutionalising functional 
systems for M&E, had leveraged thems elves from implementing interventions that were not 
informed by evidence-based results. Thus, it becomes crucial for governments to always have 
a long-term horizon of strategic thinking and planning, one that is based on the theory of change 
and on the app roaches of RBM, MfDRs and LFA (Castro, 2009; Segone, 2008;  De Renzo, 
2006).

3.7 Conclusion  
 
Chapter 3 gave the theoretical framework on which this research study is premised. The chapter 
aimed at demonstrating that M&E notions are not abstract and arbitrary concepts that agencies 
of development around the globe are pursuing, but are well founded and gr ounded on sound 
theoretical perspectives. ToC was identified as the appropriate theoretical cons truct to anchor 
M&E and is the basis for building and strengthening WoGME systems for countries, and in 
this case for Zambia’s public sector M&E arrangements.  
 
In addition, the chapter discussed salient concepts that support and clarify the theoretical 
relevance of M&E as an instrument that contribute s to good governance and ultimately to the 
poverty reduction agenda of governments. Hence, RBM, MfDRs and LFA were discussed in 
relation to M&E. Collectively, these concepts were articulated to bring home the point that 
when well developed and sustained, stronger WoG M&E systems would predominantly assist 
nations to achieve the much-desired higher development results.  
 
Finally, the chapter established that M&E has a longer historical perspective, embedded in 
theory and practice, and would provide a rare opportunity to development actors globally to 
generate information that was useful to improving processes such decision and policy making. 
Therefore, the aim of this study is to ascertain whether Zambia is on the right path for 
developing and strengthening its WoGM&ES within the broader context of the country’s 
national long-term visions and NDPs.  
 
The next chapter, Chapter 4 discusses the conceptual framework, which provides a stronger 
basis for M&E in broader dimensions of effective development management in pursuit of good 
governance and sustained poverty reduction.

CHAPTER 4 
 
Conceptual Framework  
 
4.1 Introduction  
 
Chapter 4 discusses the conceptual framework for this research study. In general terms, Chapter 
4 is about understanding the conceptual underpinnings of monitoring and evaluation systems 
and how these systems are supposed to be organised if they are  to provide information that 
would help to transform a country’s good governance reform agenda. The conceptual 
framework therefore represents a significant section of this study by clarifying areas of success 
that need to be embraced as Zambia works to dev elop and sustain its whole -of-government 
monitoring and evaluation system (WoGM&ES). In addition, the framework provides a basis 
on which the overall assessment and analysis of the research objectives and findings are 
anchored.  
 
Therefore, Chapter 4 gives an overview of and background information about the framework, 
focusing on the two sides of an M&E system, in the context of this thesis, the WoGM&ES. 
These are the supply side and demand side. In addition, the chapter artic ulates the essentials  
deemed crucial to a successful WoGM&ES. These include the political and technical issues 
associated with implementing syst ems for M&E. Another essential  is the ownership of M&E 
systems. Further, the chapter presents a comprehensive section showing the fundamental t en 
steps for developing a functional WoGM&ES. The conclusion stresses the importance of 
these aspects.  
 
4.2 Overview and background  
 
The case for a stronger WoGM&ES has been stressed (see section 2.4). The Zambian 
Government must build a functional and r obust WoGM&ES that seeks to comprehensively 
provide the much -needed information to support development processes at all levels of 
governance, namely a system that will meet the development expectations of players and 
stakeholders in the economy and beyond.
<<<PAGE=98>>>
79 
 
The significance of functional national level M&E systems is that benefits are widespread, 
including giving crucial decision making information in the course of policy, programme and 
project implementation. When used properly, information from these sys tems could help to 
stimulate development debate through constructive brainstorming on challenges affecting an 
intervention. In that regard, development managers obtain valuable information for 
improving their deliverables, thereby assuming control and owne rship of development 
processes (Bamberger, 2010; OECD/DAC, 2005) . 
 
Since government business is generally implemented across the country, a functional 
WoGM&ES is needed to help with resource allocation to the neediest areas through evidence-
based data and informat ion and results -focused feedback loops (Castro, 2009) . Once this is 
achieved, it is envisaged that the Zambian Government’s predictability in terms of positive 
public service deli very should be well anchored on a results -based management approach 
and the capability of sustaining the desired national development path should be pursuable 
realistically. 
 
A strong view is held among M&E advocates and practitioners that countries should  always 
deliberately try to lead and sustain the building of their WoGM&ES s. It is even preferred that 
such systems should be owned and led by key stakeholders in the country so that external 
stakeholders such as donors do not enforce their interests (Segone, 2010) . Elements such as 
determining what is to be evaluated, which evaluation questions must be asked, which 
methods should be used and which analytical approache s should be employed are important 
for countries to own and control. In addition, the manner in which M&E findings are 
communicated, shared and used is supposed to be in the jurisdiction of the government and 
its internal structures.  
 
4.3 Demand and supply sides of monitoring and evaluation systems  
 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems comprise two parts: the supply side and demand 
side. From the supply side, information that feeds into decision -making processes is 
generated and disseminated to those th at use it on the demand side of the system. Therefore, 
a good match is required between the supply and demand sides when building and sustaining 
systems for M&E (Engela & Ajam, 2010; Feinstein & Zapico-Goñi, 2010; Porter & Goldman, 
2013).
<<<PAGE=99>>>
80 
 
The supply side involves human skills and capacity development , including adapting 
appropriate technologies and tools and supporting institutional frameworks (DBSA, 2000). 
In other words, the supply side of an M&E system generally refers to a range of systemic and 
institutional aspects such as data collection, capacity, sequencing, leadership , coordination, 
regulation and oversight (Naidoo, 2011). Further, the demand side is concerned with the use 
of M&E information by actors that include governmental agencies, parliaments, NGOs, civil 
society organisations, research institutions, universities , the donor community and the 
general population ( Kanyamuna, 2013; Naidoo, 2011 ; Kanyamuna et al., 2018 ). Similarly, 
this means that the ways in which these entities are involved to stimulate demand for 
information could be useful in strengthening the dema nd side of an M&E system (Bedi et al., 
2006; Picciotto, 2008) . Therefore, care should be taken by ensuring that M&E standards, 
procedures, tools and principles conform to local requirements. For instance, indicator 
choices are be tter developed when they are anchored on country -specific values and norms. 
Where they are employed from international agencies, indicators must be appropriate and 
adapted to local conditions (DBSA, 2000; World Bank, 1996) . 
 
 However, d eveloping M&E systems that respond to the expectations of stakeholders  is not 
easy. For that reason, governments and stakeholders must have solid plans and incentives to 
compel them to invest in such systems. Building an M&E system is not a one-off activity, but 
a long process that requires focus and commitment from government and stakeholders. Section 
4.4 outlines some of the key aspects that governments must address when building M&E 
systems. These are considered essentials  for building successful M&E systems for the public 
sector. This is followed by a discussion of the ten steps for building a robust WoGM&ES. 
 
4.4 Essentials of a functional whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation system  
 
4.4.1 The political aspect of monitoring and evaluation  
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) issues are predominantly politically motivated. This aspect 
is usually embedded in the nature of information that M&E systems provide. Monitoring 
information and evaluation findings tend to give detailed indications of how public resources 
are being utilised. However, most implementers do not lik e to place such information in the 
public domain for fear of being victimised or condemned by the public and other stakeholders 
for possible misappropriation. Kusek and Rist (2004:20-21) concluded that when results-based
<<<PAGE=100>>>
81 
 
information is brought into the public arena, it could change the dynamics of institutional 
relationships, personal political agendas, planning, budgeting and resource allocations, and 
general public perceptions of government effectiveness. As a consequence of these strong and 
deep-rooted vested interests, counter -reformers may emerge in and outside government to 
oppose all efforts to build systems for M&E.  
 
Governments need to ensure that there are strong institution al arrangements so that the M&E 
function is implemented with the expected quality. But this requires a long-term M&E system 
characterised by sustained strategising and planning. M&E systems are often considered threats 
to government officials and project m anagers because staff reductions, budget cuts and 
criticism from higher levels such as donors and civil society groups may arise after poor 
evaluation findings ( Valadez & Bamberger, 1994 ; Lahey, 2010; Briceno, 2010; Bamberger, 
2013). These political dynamics in the management of M&E systems, if no t managed well, 
could lead to poor governance with a broken-down public accountability system allowing vices 
such as corruption and misapplication of resources. As a result, developing countries have to 
address this aspect if their WoGM&ESs are to function well (Mackay, 2011; Leiderer, 2013). 
 
4.4.2 The technical aspect of monitoring and evaluation  
The technical issues surrounding the functionality of M&E systems are crucial  aspects that 
require good care by governments and organisations. The areas of concern when designing and 
building an M&E system include producing relevant, trustworthy and timely information about 
the performance of government projects, programmes, and po licies. Relevant and adequate 
institutional capacities and skills are also significant in determining a well -performing M&E 
system. For instance, capacities of successful and comprehensive construction and utilisation 
of performance indicators denote an important competence (Kusek & Rist, 2004).  
 
Consequently, governments should have well-trained employees who are able to carry out these 
functions effectively. For many developing countries, this may be a challenge, but governments 
need to invest significantly in these areas to ensure M&E responsibilities are handled by 
technically qualified civil servants. The World Bank (2012a)  cautions that failure to have in 
place technically skilled managers and government officers  in building successful national 
M&E systems that are credible and trustworthy to bring high-quality information is a challenge.
<<<PAGE=101>>>
82 
 
4.4.3 Ownership of monitoring and evaluation systems   
The incapability of developing countries to build and sustain their own M&E systems is 
probably the leading factor in creating institutions and systems that promote good governance 
and poverty reduction ( World Bank, 1999 ; DBSA, 2000; Naidoo, 2011 ). There are notable 
levels of satisfaction from among  development actors around the globe that control and 
ownership of M&E systems by governments themselves would provide stable and sustainable 
enjoyment of the benefits offered by such systems ( Kanyamuna et al ., 2018 & Kanyamuna, 
2013). But the reality is that many poor countri es rely on donor support to conduct M&E 
functions and build M&E systems. It is even more problematic because these countries borrow 
almost every aspect of M&E from the developed countries ( Kusek & Rist, 2004). This is not 
to say it is unnecessary to seek improved ways of building M&E systems, but the challenge 
concerns the dependence that poor countries have given themselves to developed nations. 
 
 “Countries in the developing world often l ook to the richest countries, the members of the 
OECD, and adopt the public sector management tools that these countries typically employ, 
such as M&E and performance budgeting” (Mackay, 2007:1). This situation is obviously going 
to lead to more problems regarding the sustainability of these M&E systems in developing 
countries. As a better and more sustainable alternative, Kusek and Rist (2004:32) contend that 
developing countries first need to create greater demand for M&E information and to utilise it 
proactively to inform policy and decision-making processes. Through such use of M&E, these 
countries would then inculcate a culture of building and strengthening their own results-based 
M&E systems in their institutions, and this would lead to stronger ownership of these systems. 
This will be unavoidable because the experience of creating these M&E systems would differ 
in dynamics and scope between the developing countries and their counterparts in the 
developed countries, despite the practical lessons that could be drawn from successfully  
implemented systems in developed countries (Mark & Pfeiffer, 2011; Wong, 2012).  
 
4.5 Ten steps for building a whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation system   
 
The work that goes into building and sustaining a functional WoGM&ES is immense and 
long term in  nature. The clear steps on how to build such systems are still matters of debate 
among practitioners because countries are at different stages of developing M&E systems. 
However, M&E practitioners and experts in the field have elaborated stages that are c rucial
<<<PAGE=102>>>
83 
 
to developing functional M&E systems. It is therefore important in this research study to 
bring out the general aspects that comprise steps towards building and sustaining a country’s 
WoGM&ES. When assessing and analysing Zambia’s WoGM&ES, appreciat ing the stages 
the system has undergone or requires to undergo becomes significant. Kusek and Rist 
(2004:39-161) have elaborated a classical ten -step process to consider when buil ding a 
national M&E system for governments . Figure 4.1 below elaborates . 
 
This study therefore adopts the ten steps and uses them to establish a basis for understanding 
the process of building and su staining a successful WoGM&ES  for Zambia’s public sector .  
 
 
Figure 4.1. Ten generic steps for building a country monitoring and evaluation system 
Source: Kusek and Rist, 2004, p.39 
Step 1: Conducting a readiness assessment  
A readiness assessment is the first critical aspect that needs to be considered when building any 
strong and sustainable M&E system ( Kusek & Rist, 2004 ; Shepherd, 2011 ). Likened to the 
construction of a building, the readiness assessment stage represents an important part, beneath 
the ground, not seen, yet critical in holding all that is above it. The focus of this stage is on 
undertaking a thorough assessment of a country’s current status in terms of understanding, 
capacity, and use of existing M &E arrangements. The readiness assessment is therefore the 
analytical framework on which the holistic status of a country’s M&E capacity is determined 
and a plan for improvement is drawn and implemented (Mackay, 1999; Schultz, 2009; World 
Bank, 2012a). Therefore, the undertaking of a readiness assessment is not intended to examine 
whether a country may develop a WoGM&ES, but to assess the current status of that country’s 
M&E arrangements.
<<<PAGE=103>>>
84 
 
To that extent, a readiness assessment usually considers such aspects as existing organisational, 
political, policy, legislation and cultural factors and  contexts. In other words, a readiness 
assessment addresses issues such as whether M&E champions were present, the barriers 
threatening the creation and building of M&E systems, ownership issues and who was likely 
to oppose the systems (Görgens & Kusek, 2009; Talbot, 20 10). For Goldman et al. (2012) , 
these complexities and nuances of the wider country contexts are usually ignored, yet are 
critical for the rest of the preceding stages. Hence, Kusek and Rist (2004)  observe that many 
approaches recommend governments and organisations to go straight into building systems for 
M&E, disregarding the critical step of readiness assessment. Thus, without first taking stock 
of what is working and what is not leads many development agencies into bui lding systems 
that fail to give expected information, thereby becoming redundant and unsustainable in the 
long run ( Mackay, 1999; World Bank, 2003b; Liverani & Lundgren, 2007; Segone, 2008).   
 
Further, the readiness assessment step is explicit in what it aims to achieve. This stage advances 
a strong argument against most experts, who l ook only at the ‘what’ questions: for instance, 
What are the goals? What are the indicators? Such experts forsake the critical ‘why’ questions, 
for example, why do we want to measure something? Why is there a need in a particular country 
to think about these issues? Why do we want to embark on building sustainable results -based 
M&E systems? It is because of these pertinent ‘why’ questions on which the readiness 
assessment step is premised (Kusek & Rist, 2004). There is more work to actualise this kind of 
objective, yet the results of such efforts are key to the development of a successful results -
based M&E system ( World Bank, 2003a; Kusek & Rist, 2004; Castro, 2009).   
 
Step 2: Agreeing on outcomes to monitor and evaluate  
Governments imp lement development interventions with the aim of achieving results that 
influence citizens’ living standards positively. Otherwise, without being certain of the intended 
outcomes, government efforts would not be challenged for quality assurance by stakehol ders. 
In Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll (1865) stated: ‘If you do not know where 
you are going, any road will take you there’ (Bamberger, 1991). Step 2 builds on the first and 
assumes that a country or organisation is in a position  to move forward in building a results -
based M&E system. The second important undertaking is to agree on the outcomes so that 
where the country is going in the long term is known.
<<<PAGE=104>>>
85 
 
For a given WoGM&ES to be built and sustained, it is essential that outcome  setting is done 
appropriately. Such results -based M&E systems are developed according to a deductive 
approach in which inputs, activities, and outputs are all derived and flow from the setting of 
outcomes and the ultimate desired impact(s). Kusek and Rist (2004)  add that indicators, 
baselines and targets (covered in subsequent steps), including all crucial elements of the 
performance framework are derived from and based on the setting of clear outcomes. Thus, the 
setting and articulation of outcomes first provides a good platform for designing measurable 
performance indicators ( UNDP, 2002; World Bank, 2003b; Görgens & Kusek, 2009).  
 
A government, in consultation with stakeholders, thus has the task of ensuring that appropriate 
outcomes are well chosen and defined. A WoGM&ES that is developed with good outcomes 
has a high chance of collecting, analysing and providing information (feedback) that is use ful 
to influence various processes for stakeholders positively ( Mackay, 1999; Hwang, 2014).  
 
Step 3: Selecting key performance indicators to monitor outcomes  
A successful M&E system is supposed to have a well -chosen and collectively shared set of 
performance indicators to serve as the basis for change or result measurement. ‘Indicators’ 
refer to variables that are quantitative or qualitative, simply and reliably de signed to measure 
achievement of a given intervention under implementation (Kusek & Rist 2004; WHO, 2012). 
The tracking of performance changes is made in relation to an organisation’s state d outcomes 
(Kumar & C asley, 1988; Mackay, 1999; World Bank, 2012b) . After the outcomes are 
determined in the process of building a WoGM&ES, the next task is to choose and define the 
indicators. Essentially, indicators should be developed for all levels of a results -based M&E 
system to have certainty that those indicators are in place to monitor and measure progress 
against all the elements of a results chain ( that is,  inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and 
impacts). This kind of indicator tracking and measurement is critica l to providing evidence-
based feedback, on which transformational improvements would be made ( World Bank, 1996; 
Kusek & Rist, 2 004; May, Shand, Mackay, Rojas & Saavedra, 2006; Ongevalle, Huyse  & 
Boutylkova, 2012).  
 
Indicator selection and definition are important requirement s for a successful WoGM&ES. 
Otherwise, it becomes challenging to recognise success or achievement when it occurs. Also, 
the assurance as to whether institutional effort is leading towards achieving outcomes is not
<<<PAGE=105>>>
86 
 
certain in the absence of clearly defined indicators ( Kusek & Rist, 2004; Görgens & Kusek, 
2009; World Bank, 2012a). Governments need to be precise and committed to the process and 
type of overall and specific indicators adopted in their WoGM&ES (Brushett, 1998; World 
Bank, 2012a; GRZ, 2015).  
 
Step 4: Setting baselines and gathering data on indicators  
When the identification and selection of key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor 
outcomes are done, the next crucial phase is establishing baseline data ( Step 4). During this 
step, the present s tatus of a given indicator relative to the overall outcome is measured and 
appreciated. For Kusek and Rist (2004), the significance of this stage is that no one can project 
progress or a ny form of performance into the future (target setting) without establishing an 
appropriate baseline. According to Talbot (2010), the first measurement of an indicator is what 
denotes a baseline. Thus, this condition assists in determining or projecting future changes and 
upon which progress tracking is anchored. Therefore, by using well -measured baselines, 
decision makers and other development actors get to know about current circumstances long 
before they project targets for an intervention. In this way, setting realistic targets works for all 
development efforts, giving governments an edge in leading the process of nation building and 
inclusive development because they understand the recent levels and patterns of performance 
(Karel & Holvoet, 2000; Kusek & Rist, 2002; Kusek & Rist, 2004). 
The process of determining the baseline starts by i) establishing or generating baseline data on 
selected indicators; ii) building information for each indicator baseline; iii) identifying data 
sources for indicators; iv) designing, planning and comparing chosen data collection methods; 
v) establishing the significance of conducting pilots; and incorporating vi) data collection and 
use of lessons from successfully implemented WoGM&ES ( Kusek & Rist, 2004 ; Görgens & 
Kusek, 2009). 
 
Step 5: Planning for improvement and setting realistic targets  
A target is “a specified objective that indicates the number, timing and location of that which 
is to be realized” (IFAD, 2002 sited in Kusek & Rist, 2004: 91). In other words, targets are the 
quantifiable and qualifiable levels of the indicators that a country, society or organisation wants 
to achieve by a given time (Kusek & Rist, 2004; Mackay, 2007) . The process of determining 
targets against stated indicators is another significant task for a successful WoGM&ES. To be
<<<PAGE=106>>>
87 
 
precise, target setting is the final step in the proc ess of building performance frameworks. 
Target setting follows a deductive process of breaking down the selected indicators into what 
is achievable in a specified period towards the attainment of a given outcome (Burdescu et al., 
2005; Castro, 2009). 
 
Hence, an M&E system with indicators whose targets are not well selected and defined will 
not provide credible information for use in decision making. Targets are vital for measuring 
changes against the agreed -upon indicators throughout the process of implementing an 
intervention ( World Bank, 1997; Mackay, 2007).  
 
Step 6: Monitoring for results  
Step 6, monitoring for results, follows the selection of targets and completion of the 
performance-based framewor k. In this step, a system that ensures that the data required to 
inform various processes of decision making are described and collated. Thus, the data from 
this system are used as evidence for performance tracking and measurement of changes for 
development interventions. The primary intention of this step is to appreciate requirements for 
a results-based M&E system. Such a system is understood to be necessary to inform and better 
manage all governmental and organisational resources (World Bank, 2003c ; Kusek & Rist, 
2004; Görgens & Kusek, 2009). In addition, at this stage it becomes significant to acquire and 
critically manage all programme and project inputs, activities, outputs and the intermediate 
outcomes. Stern et al. (2012)  share this view when they emphasise that often development 
implementers use a variety of organisational tools such as inputs, s taffing plans, budgets and 
activity plans. However, for this kind of management to work, a results -based WoGM&ES 
would require appropriate alignment with annual plans and other organisational strategies.  
 
The crucial aspects of emphasis under Step 6 include: i) identifying key monitoring types and 
levels; ii) providing linkages between implementation -monitoring and results-monitoring; iii) 
incorporating key principles in building an M&E system; iv) identifying the needs of every 
system for M&E; v) taking into account the data quality triangle; vi) performing data analysis; 
vii) attaining results using partnership; and viii) conducting pre -tests for data collection 
instruments (Kusek & Rist, 2004).
<<<PAGE=107>>>
88 
 
Step 7: Evaluative information to support decision making and results culture  
In the previous steps, the focus was on ‘monitoring’, and not on ‘evaluation’. The emphasis 
was on articulating the need to organise a robust M&E system that could pro vide continuous 
tracking of performance to help managers administer their duties informatively (Kusek & Rist, 
2004; Mackay, 2007; World Bank, 2012a, 2012b) . However, since monitoring data do not 
provide the basis for ascribing causality and attributions for change, evaluation findings 
become critical to bridge this gap. OECD/DAC (2002) defined evaluation as an assessment of 
a planned, ongoing  or a completed interventio n with a view to determining its relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability. The incorporation of lessons learned into 
decision-making processes is the major intention of commissioning and undertaking 
evaluations for development inter ventions. Thus, it is now appropriate to examine the 
evaluation function in M&E systems. The emphasis should be on the complementarity of 
evaluation to monitoring exercises. Therefore, as complementary and methodologically 
different undertakings, it is imp ortant that governments that should seek to develop their 
results-based WoGM&ES should attend fully to both monitoring and evaluation. More 
importantly, these systems need to be built with a known intention, that of obtaining evidence-
based evaluation find ings and information for use by government officials and partners on 
informing decisions such as those pertaining to public resource management (Kusek & Rist, 
2004; Castro et al., 2009; Harry, 2010).  
 
Step 8: Analysing and reporting findings  
“Reporting is too often the step to which ev aluators give the least thought”  (Worthen et. al., 
1997 cited in Kusek & Rist, 2004:129) . To that extent, analysis and reporting ensure that 
performance information, which is derived from monitoring and evaluation, is utilised as a tool 
for management. The undertaking and commitment to in -depth analysis and reporting 
performance findings is supposed to be given prominence since they determine a number of 
success factors, such as the content of reports, periods of reporting, and the targeted audience 
for disseminating the reports. In addition, the technical capacities of government and 
organisations are assessed based on the methodological dimensions of gather ing, assessing, 
analysing and reporting (World Bank, 2012a; 2012b).
<<<PAGE=108>>>

Aspects of focus under Step 8 include: i) utilisation of monitoring information and evaluation 
findings; ii) identifying the audiences and providing them with appropriate information; iii) 
presenting performance data in a non -technical and understandable format; and iv) managing 
poor performance results appropriately ( Kusek & Rist, 2004; Görgens & Kusek, 2009). 
 
Step 9: Using the findings  
The fundamental aim of building and sustaining a stronger WoGM&ES is to utilise the results 
and findings generated from it. Such results -based M&E systems are crucial to performance 
improvement by development agencies, including governments. Organisations and 
governments endeavour to create M&E systems not only to produce continuous results -based 
data and information, but ultimately to have those results and feedback in the domains of 
appropriate users in a timely manner to inform public management processes ( Kusek & Rist, 
2004; Görgens & Kusek, 2009; Lahey, 2010). 
 
In summary, therefore, the focus of Step 9 is on: i) the way in which performance findings are 
used; ii) the added be nefits of utilising the findings: and iii) the availability of strategies for 
information sharing (Kusek & Rist, 2004).  
 
Step 10: Sustaining the monitoring and evaluation system within government  
Step 10 is the final stage of the model and has to do with sustaining the WoGM&ES. The 
emphasis is that instead of being regarded as short-term undertakings, M&E systems should be 
seen as long-term efforts (Kusek & Rist, 2004). Thus, sustaining such systems in governments 
and organisations recognises the long -term process involved in ensuring M&E data and 
information uptake.  
 
Of particular interest under Step 10 are i) six critical components of sustaining WoGM&ES s, 
which are results oriented (de mand clear roles and responsibilities, trustworthy and credible 
information, accountability, capacity, incentives); ii) the role of incentives and disincentives; 
iii) challenges in sustaining a results-based M&E system; iv) evaluation and validation of M&E 
systems and information; and v) positive cultural change experienced or stimulated by M&E 
in governments and organisations ( Kusek & Rist, 2004; Görgens & Kusek, 2009).

4.6 Conclusion  
 
The main aim of Chapter 4 was to p rovide the conceptual framework of this research study. 
Accordingly, it articulated the most important aspects by providing an understanding that 
M&E systems are crucial to keeping up with good governance tenets of transparency and 
accountability and inclu sive and participatory sustainable development towards the 
attainment of poverty reduction and improved living standards of people. Conceptually, the 
chapter highlighted elements that governments must address if their WoGM&ES s are to be 
robust, sustainable  and relevant to their development processes and aspirations.  
 
Chapter 4 discussed the need for governments to ensure that the supply and demand sides of 
their M&E systems were fully developed in a balanced manner. Should an M&E system have 
a more developed supply side than a demand side, it risks being redundant for non -uptake of 
its results. Another challenge involves a strengthened demand side, while the supply side is 
weak. In such instances, stakeholders or users may continue to make decisions informed  by 
information without evidence, thereby implementing failed policies, programmes and 
projects (Booth & Lucas, 2002;  Booth & Lucas, 2005 ; Bedi et al., 2006; USAID, 2009 ). In 
addition, the chapter cautioned tha t political and technical issues and ownership of M&E 
systems constitute central determinants of success.  
 
Chapter 4 listed the ten steps that are significant when building a robust WoGM&ES (Kusek 
& Rist, 2004;  Görgens & Ku sek, 2009;  Naidoo, 2011) . Therefore, it is on this conceptual 
framework that this research study is anchored when undertaking the data collection and 
analysis and providing recommend ations to improve the WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public 
sector.       
 
In Chapter 5, Zambia is discussed as a case study country for this research. The context of 
the chapter is situating M&E arrangements in the framework of Zambia’s National 
Development Plans  (NDPs) and poverty reduction agenda.

CHAPTER 5 
 
Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements in Zambia 
 
 5.1 Introduction  
 
Chapter 5 represents the arrangements for national planning, monitoring and evaluation in the 
Zambian public sector. It introduces Zambia as a country and as a case study and gives reasons 
for choosing Zambia as a suitable case study for this research. Two aspects are considered 
crucial here—firstly to express the geographical composition  of the country showing its ten 
(10) provi nces that yearn for equal socio -economic development from public resources. 
Secondly, the section situates Zambia within the Southern African Development Community 
(SADC) region so as to contextualise this research study conducted in Zambia within the 
African and global geo-political perspective.    
 
Chapter 5 shows the types of plans that the government implements for poverty reduction and 
sustained socio-economic growth. These plans are explained comprehensively because they 
form the bedrock on which monitoring and evaluation (M&E) theory and practice are anchored. 
However, although many development plans are being pursued at various levels in Zambia, 
this chapter focuses on the National Development Plan (NDP), which is the basis for 
implementing the whole-of-government (WoG) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. In 
addition, the NDP is the poverty reduction strategy, a policy document that pronounces the 
nation’s development aspirations for a stipulated five-year period.    
 
Further, Chapter 5 articulate s the core aspect of this research study, which is M&E 
arrangements in Zambia. It discusses the evolution of M&E in t he country in the context of  
NDPs. This section gives details of how M&E functions and their implementation are being 
undertaken. It conclu des by highlighting salient issues pertaining to the national planning, 
monitoring and evaluation arrangements for the Zambian public sector.

 5.2 Zambia: An overview   
 
Zambia is a land-locked or in other views land-linked country, centrally situated in the southern 
Africa region. Eight countries share borders with Zambia.  These include Malawi to the east, 
Tanzania to the north -east, Angola to the west, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, and 
Mozambique to the south, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north. In terms of 
location, it is situated between latitudes 8° and 18° south and longitudes 22° and 34° east and 
has a total surface area of 752,612 square kilometres.

Zambia is a member of the SADC region and shares common development prospects with 
neigbouring countries. In that regard, the country enjoys social, economic, political and cultural 
relationships with these countries and a stronger M&E culture and practice in Zambia would

increase Zambia’s development engagements with them . Figure 5.2 below is the locational

On 24 October 1964, Zambia gained independence from Britain through its first republican 
president Dr Kenneth David Kaunda. Upon gaining political independence, the new 
government embarked on a structured approach to national growth an d development through 
the Interim National Strategic Plan in 1964, which was succeeded by the First National 
Development Plan (FNDP 1966  – 1970). Other successive NDPs were implemented, but the 
first NDP yielded positive results and to date is regarded as having presented a successful 
development story that led to Zambia being classified as a middle -income country in 1969. 
During that period, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for Zambia became one of the 
highest in Africa, and exceeding those of S outh Korea, Malaysia, Brazil, and Turkey. This 
came at a time that Zambia was the third largest world producer of copper (after the Soviet 
Union and the United States) and largest producer among the developing nations by producing 
12.2 per cent of total wo rld copper (Bostock & Harvey, 1972 cited in Haglund, 2010:84). 
Despite these gains in the early years of Zambia’s political emancipation, economic growth

and development prospects continued to dwindle. The living standards of the majority of 
Zambians leave much to be desired and this is happening in the advent of democratic tenets 
and more budgetary allocation to public projects and programmes. As at the close of 2017, 
national socio-economic statistics for Zambia looked gloomy (see Human Development Index 
(HDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Corruption Index, per capita income, national poverty, 
rural/urban poverty, etc ). Since independence, Zambia has implemented seven NDPs, 
including the current Seventh Natio nal Development Plan (7NDP 2017 – 2021). This period, 
covering the NDPs implemented from 1964 to the current 7NDP (2017 -2021) forms the basis 
for this study’s analysis about the arrangements and functionality of Zambia’s public sector 
WoGM&ES.    
 
 5.3 National development planning in Zambia  
 
In Zambi a, national development planning represents the basis for public programming, 
resource mobilisation, distribution and allocation, implementation of development 
interventions and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (GRZ, 2014b). It thus becomes important 
to understand or discuss M&E in the correct context of national development planning. 7 
Therefore, the NDPs become a valuable feature in appreciating the functions and notions of 
M&E in the country’s development process and architecture.  
 
National development planning covers all aspects of social and economic planning in Zambia. 
Thus, several planning streams occur at different levels within the broader spectrum of 
government, be it at national, sector or line ministry, provincial, district and sub-district level. 
This holistic scope of development planning forms the basis on which an understanding of the 
dynamics of M&E operations in Zambia rests. The national planning logic in Zambia flows as 
shown in Figure 5.3.  
 
 
 
 
                                                 
7 National development planning on the part of government has been in existence for a long time – in both pre 
and post -independence epochs. The colonial and post -colonial governments have always prepared and 
implemented definite forms of planning to advance the country’s development agenda. There may be some 
differences in the actual planning architecture, but the fundamentals of national development planning have not 
changed. Zambia obtained its independence from Great Britain on 24 October 1964.

The National Planning and Budgeting Policy of 2014 articulate the national development 
planning arrangements for Zambia. The policy outlines the types of plans that are crucial to the 
overall poverty reduction agenda of Zambia (GRZ, 2014b, 2015). Therefore, since M&E is a 
function that is anchored on the national planning architecture, the plans that the Zambian 
government implements become paramount and are discussed in the sections that follow.  
     
5.4 Types of development plans   
 
National development planning in Zambia comprises of: 
 long-term,  
 medium-term, and  
 short-term plans.  
 
a) Long term  
Long-term plans consist of the development of t he National Long Term Vision (NLTV) and 
the integrated district plans (IDPs).  
 
b) Medium term  
In the medium term, five -year National Development Plans ( NDPs) are developed, which 
operationalise the attainment of long-term plans.  
 
c) Short term 
For the short term, annual budgets and work plans are prepared and implemented to attain the 
medium- and long-term plans.  
 
Table 5.1  below shows a comprehensive scope of various types of plans in the Zambian 
national development planning architecture or arrangement.

5.4.1 National-level planning  
Plans at national level include the NLTV, NDPs and sector investment plans (SIPs). The NLTV 
is the highest development aspiration of the Zambian people on the long -term horizon, while 
the NDPs are the next highest targeted strategies for the medium-term category. Both are meant 
to provide a unified development strateg ic position. Essentially, the NLTV is operationalised 
by the NDPs, through which the SIPs are operationalised, under an appropriate coordination 
mechanism to ensure consistency and coherence.
<<<PAGE=116>>>
97 
 
a) National Long-Term Vision 
NLTV is a written long -term plan, wi th a 25 -year horizon, which expresses Zambia’s 
development aspirations. It articulates possible long-term scenarios, which would contribute to 
the attainment of socio -economic objectives and goals. It also provides the basis on which 
medium-term plans are prepared.  
 
The process for the preparation of the NLTV commences four years before the expiry of the 
existing vision. In the first two years, an evaluation of the existing vision is undertaken to 
inform the formulation of the subsequent vision. In the thi rd year, the evaluation report is 
shared with all stakeholders to solicit proposals for a new vision. This process is followed by 
the preparation of the successor vision, which is submitted to cabinet for approval and launch 
in the final year (GRZ, 2014b). 
 
b) National development plans and sector strategic plans  
The NDP is a five-year development framework, which is used to operationalise the long-term 
plans, in this case the NLTV and the IDPs. The preparation of the NDPs is undertaken in a two-
pronged process involving top-down and bottom-up approaches. 
 
The top-down process commences two years before the expiry of the existing plan, with a mid-
term evaluation of the current plan, complemented by  the final evaluation of the preceding 
plan, annual NDP progress reports, government policy pronouncements and sector 
performance reports. These review processes provide evidence on which the development 
priorities and policy direction are established. Government then provides policy and 
development guidance towards the development of the plans and budgets at all levels in the 
fourth quarter of the election year.8  
 
In the first quarter after an election year, a concept paper on the NDP is tabled before cab inet 
for approval. After approval, the bottom -up process is finalised with the drafting of district 
plans, which are consolidated into provincial development plans, which form part of the NDP. 
This is preceded by the finalisation of the review of the performance of district, provincial and 
                                                 
8 In the National Planning and Budgeting Policy of 2014, the five -year cycle for the NDPs has been harmonised 
or aligned with the five-year political cycle. This was done to address the sp ecific political manifesto of a ruling 
government – new or continuing.
<<<PAGE=117>>>
98 
 
sector plans and preparation of the situational analysis in the first and second quarters of the 
election year, respectively (GRZ, 2014b).   
 
When approved by cabinet in the second quarter as a draft NDP in the form of a green paper, 
it becomes a policy and strategy document, with costed sector action plans that incorporate the 
plans of districts and provinces for functions that are devolved to them and drafted  in the 
context of the resource ceilings, policy frameworks and service standards provided by central 
government. The programmes to be used in subsequent medium-term expenditure frameworks 
(MTEFs) and annual budgets are fully aligned with the programme cla ssification in the NDP 
(GRZ, 2014b).  
 
The plan is then finalised and launched by the president. The final plan is submitted to the 
National Assembly as part of the documentation used to support the first budget fully prepared 
by the new administration and for use in the subsequent budget considerations throughout the 
plan period. Once the NDP has been launched, draft provincial and district development plans 
are finalised in line with the approved NDP and, each line ministry, province and district then 
prepares a five -year institutional strategic plan, showing how it will contribute to the 
achievement of the development targets as set out in the NDP. These plans then form the basis 
of the MTEF and annual budget estimates of each line ministry, province and district (GRZ, 
2014b).  
 
c) Sector investment plans  
Sector investment plans (SIPs) last from 10 to 20 years, and address issues in the sector at all 
levels. They are used as an inference point fo r prioritising policies and programmes for the 
sector and lower-level structures, which include provinces, districts and sub-districts. SIPs help 
to operationalise the NLTV and NDPs.  
 
5.4.2 Provincial-level planning  
With policy guidance from the Vision a nd the NDP, the province is able to develop the five -
year provincial growth development plans (PGDP) to cover multi -district development 
programmes in their mandates. PGDPs also consider the comparative advantage of the province 
and the districts and its development needs. The province coordinates provincial development 
(GRZ, 2014b, 2014c, 2015, 2017a).
<<<PAGE=118>>>
99 
 
5.4.3 District-level planning  
Development at district level is guided by 10-year integrated development plans (IDPs), which 
draw from the policy guidance of the Vision and the NDP and SIP programme outlay ( GRZ, 
2014b). IDPs are comprehensive development plans for the districts and provide a broad view 
of district physical development structure on which the socio -economic plans are anchored. 
IDPs, NDPs and PGDPs provide programme and policy guidance to the d evelopment of the 
five-year district development plans (DDP s). In that regard, IDPs take care of all sub -district 
level development planning issues.  
 
5.5 Implementation and coordination frameworks for National Development Plans   
 
To attain the NDP develo pment outcomes, an implementation framework and a coordination 
framework must be in place. This entails that institutional arrangements have to be clarified, 
together with assumptions upon which the success of the NDP rests. Ultimately, these 
frameworks pr ovide clear linkages of the Vision, priorities, people’s aspirations and the 
physical institutions. They therefore provide a system for accounting for development results, 
thereby helping in informed decision making (GRZ, 2017b).  
 
5.5.1 Implementation framework  
The NDPs are implemented largely through prescribed institutional arrangements. The 
Ministry of National Develop ment Planning (MNDP) represents the apex institution 
responsible for NDP formulation and coordination. At local level, ward development 
committees (WDCs) have been established, while the district development coordinating 
committees (DDCCs) and provincial d evelopment coordinating committees (PDCCs) are 
responsible for overseeing implementation of development interventions at district and 
provincial level, respectively. At sector level, cluster advisory groups (CAGs), which are an 
assembly of sectors that sha re common objectives, oversee implementation. At central level, 
cabinet, through the National Development Coordinating Committee (NDCC) , plays the 
implementation oversight role (GRZ, 2017a, 2017b).
<<<PAGE=119>>>
100 
 
5.5.2 Implementation plans  
The NDPs stipulate that all sector ministries, provinces and districts should develop their own 
implementation p lans. This process is expected to be informed by the main outcomes as 
articulated in the NDPs. This means that every sectoral strategic implementation plan is 
expected to draw from the programme outcomes in the NDP and as prescribed in the national 
constitution. The same process of drilling down the development deliverables and results is 
supposed to be followed by all the provinces and districts (GRZ, 2013, 2016, 2017a) . Thus, 
provincial implementation plans and district implementation plans are drawn up and guided by 
the implementation plan of a given NDP and the national constitution.  
 
5.5.3 Coordination framework  
GRZ (2017b) ascertains that the coordination mechanism for NDPs is harmonised with the 
NLTV and government’s strategic focus and development outcomes, and is cascaded down to 
physical institutions. In so doing, it will guide organisations in a manner that will deliver 
results. The coordination of the implementation of NDPs is undertaken at broadly f ive levels, 
as shown in Figure 5.3  below. A discussion of each level follows  thereafter. These levels of 
coordination include the following: 
 National level coordination and implementation arrangements 
 Sectoral level coordination and implementation  
 Provincial-level coordination and implementation 
 District-level coordination and implementation 
 Ward development committees
<<<PAGE=120>>>
101 
 
 
Figure 5.4.  Institutional arrangements for coordination of NDP implementation 
Source: GRZ, Seventh National Development Plan, 2017, p. 127 
 
a) National level coordination and implementation arrangements 
The current coordination arrangements for implementation of NDPs reside within the Ministry 
of National Development Planning (MNDP), which has authority over other line ministries to 
oversee the coordination function. MNDP thus has a mandate to coordinate the development 
contributions of government institutions and other development partner agencies involved in 
implementing NDPs. Through this kind of structural arrangement, it becomes feasible to ensure 
that all development benchmarks articulated in the NDPs are put in context and embedded in 
the plans of sectors, provinces, districts and sub-districts. To enhance synergies and galvanise 
the participation of all stakeholders in the development process, regardless of whether they are 
state or non -state institutions, it is critical to have established national -level coordination in 
place. That way, the coordination of planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of 
NDPs at all levels of development interven tions would be made practical and participatory 
(GRZ, 2016, 2017a, 2017b).
<<<PAGE=121>>>
102 
 
The NDCC is a high-level establishment that is designed to meet bi-annually to consider issues 
emerging from the implementation of the NDPs. Chaired by the secretary to the cabinet  (SC), 
the NDCC has a mandate to make policy recommendations to cabinet and oversee monitoring 
and evaluation of programmes in the NDPs (GRZ, 2016, 2017b).  
 
b) Sectoral level coordination and implementation 
The rationale for sectoral level coordination and implementation is to ascertain that all sectors 
that implement programmes and interventions under a development objective and outcome 
area of an  NDP are grouped as one. Following this shared development agenda, the 
strengthening of intra and inter-sectoral integration to attain a common development strategic 
area of the NDP becomes realistic. To that extent, sectors are encouraged to approach all 
development issues collectively, and invest in means of collaborating and strengthening 
functional synergies among themselves. Such coordination and collaborative efforts can be 
focused on such undertakings as joint planning, harmonising financing plans an d interfacing 
on various programme implementation, monitoring and evaluation exercises (GRZ, 2016, 
2017b). 
 
Therefore, Cluster Advisory Groups ( CAGs) have been formed at sector level. According to 
GRZ (2017b) , a  CAG is a consultative forum, comprising representatives from key 
stakeholders active in a particular sector/cluster (state and non -state actors). Having been 
involved in the NDP processes from the formulation stages, CAGs would have a major role to 
play in the implementation and monitoring stages. By rule, all CAGs are supposed to be 
consisting of M&E sub-committees to give sector monitoring and evaluation strategic guidance 
and provide a coordinated M&E perspective. These sub-committees are expected to stimulate 
utilisation of M&E information across stakeholders, particularly in key decision -making 
processes.  
 
Further, it is significant that sectors are working to interface with structures at lower level on 
related progr ammes to their given mandates through the provision of policy guidance and 
oversight. As a result, feedback from such discussions on development issues will be addressed 
and reported, and work as a basis for further refinement and improvement by platforms such 
as CAG meetings and sector planning departments and units (GRZ, 2016, 2017b).
<<<PAGE=122>>>
103 
 
Within a line ministry or  sector, M&E activities are coordinated and spearheaded by M&E 
personnel, who are also responsible for management information systems (MIS) (GRZ, 2009, 
2017a, 2017b). Thus, every line ministry has a ‘department, unit or section of planning’, whose 
main responsibility is sector -specific planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation 9. 
These departments and sections are designed to work with the national M&E under the MNDP 
and to collaborate with other stakeholders in a line ministry.  
 
c) Provincial-level coordination and implementation 
The roles that provinces play are not restricted to what goes on at their level, but they oversee 
the implementation of district plans in their regions and perform this function by ensuring that 
districts are guided to work progr essively towards meeting the national and district -specific 
development targets, as set out in the NDPs. These provincial and district level linkages and 
cascading of development actions ensure that all average targets and outcomes achieved at 
those levels are implemented to meet set benchmarks, as stipulated in the NDP (GRZ, 2014a; 
2014c, 2014d).  
 
At province level, there are advisory bodies called provincial development coordinating 
committees (PDCC). PDCCs are meant to ensure that monitoring and evaluation findings feed 
into the provincial planning and budgeting processes (GRZ, 2010) . Thus, each PDCC is 
serviced by a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) sub-committee to give strategic guidance and 
provide a coord inated M&E perspective. Further, aside from their oversight function, the 
provincial administrations have the role of implementing programmes and projects derived in 
accordance with their functions as designated in the national constitution and Decentralisation 
Policy10 in an integrated manner. The provincial planning units (PPUs), whose presence is in 
all 10 provinces, provide technical backstopping and progress reporting as secretariats to the 
PDCCs. All provinces have PPUs that are charged with the responsibility of carrying out M&E 
functions in addition to their core planning function. Operating in conjunction with the PDCC, 
the PPUs operate as information bridges between national and district and the sub-district levels 
GRZ (2013, 2017a, 2017b) . In addition, province s are encouraged to have forums at which 
issues of common development undertakings are discussed and implemented jointly. 
                                                 
9 This is however only the ideal situation. Practically, M&E functions or activities have no substantive staff 
dedicated to conducting them. 
10 The Decentralisation Policy, revised in 2013, prioritises fiscal devolution. Negligible progress recorded so far.
<<<PAGE=123>>>
104 
 
d) District-level coordination and implementation 
Unlike provincial level administration, districts implement development interventions 
devolved to them under the tenets of decentralised planning, monitoring and evaluation, 
following the guidelines under the municipal and district councils in the country. Through 
district-specific plans, it is envisaged that development challenges are being  appropriately 
addressed. To that extent, districts are expected to design their own plans, together with unified 
M&E systems, to promote integration of development priorities at local level, while linked or 
anchored to provincial and national strategic ke y result areas (GRZ, 2016, 2017a) . To that 
extent, e very district has an established advisory body called a district development 
coordinating committee (DDCC). A DDCC is a lower-level decentralised structure and plays 
a key role in ensuring that monitoring and evaluation information and findings feed into the 
district planning and budgeting processes. By establishment, each DDCC is supposed to be 
serviced by an M&E sub -committee which provides a coordinated M&E perspective (GRZ, 
2010). Further, IDPs of the municipalities and district councils represent the basis for designing 
district-specific planning, monitoring and evaluation of programmes, while mainstreaming and 
domesticating national, regional and other international development obligations. This entails 
that district strategies and operational systems are drawn from and linked to national and 
international targets and results on developmental issues. This shou ld be achieved through 
provincial administration structures and coordination arrangements (GRZ, 2005a, 2017b).  
 
Therefore, the District Planning Units ( DPUs), working as secretariats to the DDCCs, play a 
crucial role in ensuring that technical backstopping and the coordination of programmes are 
adequately provided. Feedback from other high -level structures to the districts is obtained 
through designated channels at provincial and national level (e.g. PDCCs  and NDCC) (GRZ, 
2017a; 2017b).  
 
e) Ward development committees  
Ward development commi ttees (WDCs) at sub -district level are established advisory bodies 
created under the Decentralisation Policy and have the mandate to plan, monitor and evaluate 
projects that are planned at that level, together with interventions at provincial or national level 
that are being implemented in their localities. Through these lower structures, the citizens at 
community level are expected to channel their input into the national development agenda for
<<<PAGE=124>>>
105 
 
the country and add their voice to the implementation of NDPs and ultimately the attainment 
of Vision 2030 (see Figure 5.3 above which  shows the overall institutional arrangements for 
coordination). 
 
5.6 Roles and responsibilities of key institutions in managing national plans  
 
The results-based management (RBM) approach, whose emphasis is to promote the provision 
of development results by ensuring timeliness in delivery of those results, has been the adopted 
principle or strategy that informs the implementation of NDPs in Zambia ( that is, especially 
the 7NDP). Howev er, it is a requirement that all institutions conform to the provisions and 
guidelines as stipulated in legal and policy frameworks such as the 2014 National Planning and 
Budgeting Policy, 2008 Finance Act, and the Zambian constitution (GRZ, 2017b). 
 
a) Parliament  
In NDP implementation, monitoring and evaluation, the role of parliament is recognised in 
planning and budgeting processes as being overseer of public financial management (PFM). 
To that extent, parliament is expected to play a central role in annual budget approvals and 
through access to annual progress and evaluation reports. It is expected to also closely monitor 
the implementation of NDPs. As representatives of the electorate, parliamentarians are 
expected to be NDP overseers. Overall, parliament plays an oversight role by ensuring that 
government, through the executive arm, pursues all development aspirations and results based 
on the principles of good governance (GRZ, 2010, 2017a, 2017b). 
 
b) Cabinet  
The deve lopment functions of leadership and policy direction are enshrined in the 
constitutional mandates of the cabinet ( GRZ, 2017b). In performing this function, cabinet is 
supposed to establish a developmentally supportive system that is responsive to the political 
and socio-economic environment, leading to a smooth and timely implementation of NDPs. In 
that regard, cabinet is tasked with the important role of spurring national growth and 
development through inculcating a culture of results orientation in the population and in all 
actors in the development space in the country, at the same time, l eading the process of
<<<PAGE=125>>>
106 
 
transforming all national institutions towards the provision of good governance and wellbeing 
for all. 
 
c) Cabinet Office  
The function of the Cabinet Office  (CO) is to provide guidance in the implementation of 
various policies (GRZ, 2017b) . Most importantly, CO  has the mandate to endorse the 
establishment of functional e -government platforms to support t he government -wide M&E 
management information system (MIS). Coupled with this, CO is responsible for endorsing 
the establishment of M&E departments and units with a dequate staff and financial as well as 
physical resources in all Ministries, Provinces and Spending Agencies (MPSAs). 
 
d) Ministry of National Development Planning 
The Ministry of National Development Planning (MNDP) through the Department of 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) has a mandate to coordinate the implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation pr ocesses of the NDPs and to ensure that remedial measures are 
effected on programmes that are not on course at national level. The ministry is responsible for 
the coordination of the work of all advisory bodies by ensuring that they contribute to the 
achievement of development outcomes in the NDPs. In doing so, the ministry, in collaboration 
with Cabinet Office, oversees implementation, monitoring and evaluation processes and 
ensures that the uptake of development results provides remedial measures (GRZ, 2017b). 
 
e) Ministry of Finance 
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is in charge of budget execution and facilitating resource 
mobilisation for financing to support interventions in the NDPs. These functions are undertaken 
in collaboration with the MNDP. In that regard, the MOF remains key to the success of the 
WoGM&ES since it holds and controls the budget function (GRZ, 2017b).  
 
f) House of Chiefs 
One of the constitutional mandates of the House of Chiefs is to work in collaboration with the 
National Assembly through initiating, discussing and making recommendations about socio -
economic development in the province. The House of Chiefs does similar collaborative works
<<<PAGE=126>>>
107 
 
with the local authority, focused on the welfare of communities in a municipality or coun cil. 
In both cases, the role of the House of Chiefs is to ensure that parliament and local authorities 
incorporate development issues from the communities in line with the objectives of NDPs in 
the broader context of decentralisation (GRZ, 2017b).  
 
g) Committee of Permanent Secretaries 
The Committee of Permanent Secretaries  (CPS) comprises institutions that implement 
programmes and projects in the NDPs. The secretary to the cabinet chairs committee meetings, 
whose main agenda is to consider issues that emanate from the implementation of projects 
using information and findings from M&E processes (GRZ, 2013, 2017a, 2017b).  
 
h) National Development Coordinating Committee  
The National Development Coordinating Committee (NDCC) is the apex body for promoting 
a coordinated approach to development programmes. It is responsible for providing overall 
policy direction to the CAGs, PDCCs and DDCCs on the implementation of development 
activities and an established framework for managing and reporting on programmes at sectoral, 
provincial and district level (GRZ, 2017b).  
 
The NDCC’s function is to provide policy direction on recommendations and other matters 
raised by the CAGs, PDCCs and DDCCs and their implementation. It also promotes synergies, 
efficiency and effectiveness in planning, budgeting and the entire development process among 
sectors, ministries, departments, and local authorities. Further, the NDCC ensures participation 
of cooperating partners, civil society organisations and other non -state actors. It defines 
responsibilities of the consultative bodies in  line with the planning, budgeting and 
implementation of developmental programmes to avoid duplication of efforts. In addition, the 
NDCC recommends policy decisions for cabinet approval (GRZ, 2017b). 
 
i) Office of the Auditor General 
The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) has the ultimate responsibility of undertaking 
financial audits and value for money evaluations to provide an independent perspective on the 
utilisation of resources allocated to achieve the goals set in NDPs (GRZ, 2010). Although the
<<<PAGE=127>>>
108 
 
OAG focuses on financial audits and evaluations, the findings are crucial for the overall 
national M&E of the government.  
 
5.7 Monitoring and evaluation in Zambia  
 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of public policies, programmes and projects has been 
recognised as a critical element in Zambia’s development efforts for some time. Among other 
key undertakings, this is demonstrated through the establishment of an M&E advisory function 
in the presidency, and functions for policy monitoring and evaluation in Cabinet Office and the 
recently creation of the Ministry of National Development Planning (MNDP), with a division 
mandated to oversee and promote the M&E function at national level (GRZ, 2010, 2016, 
2017b). Such political support from government is important for success if benefits from M&E 
are to be experienced. M&E thrives on sound political support. It is seldom to be a spontaneous 
uptake by organisations or agencies simply because it possesses rational and persuasive appeals 
(Naidoo, 2011:13).  
 
Suffice to say, in 2016, the separation of the national planning function and the budgeting  or 
finance function through the creation of the MNDP was an eff ort to strengthen M&E 
functionality (GRZ, 2016, 2017a, 2017b). Moreover, since 2006 each NDP has contained a 
monitoring framework to guide the ways in which sector ministries, provinces and other 
government spending agencies undertake M&E for the NDP. Thus, M&E is recognised as 
being useful in facilitating th e timely provision of accurate information on programme 
performance to policy and decision makers and to other stakeholders. M&E is important in 
enhancing development accountability and service delivery, in addition to the financial 
accountability reforms that the government has been implementing since 2005. 
 
Reforms in M&E have therefore been incorporated as a component under the Public Financial 
Management Reform Strategy (PFMRS) on which GRZ embarked in 2013. The M&E 
component includes the enhancement or  establishment of M&E functions in all ministries, 
provinces and other spending agencies (MPSAs) and the establishment of integrated MISs 
(GRZ, 2015, 2016) . Such high -level p olitical pronouncements and policy actions are  
significant internationally, and help to strengthen M&E practice in a country (Kusek & Rist, 
2004; Taylor & Balloch, 2005 ; Mackay, 2007). One role of the MNDP is to collect M&E 
information from the planning departments of the sector ministries and other spending agencies
<<<PAGE=128>>>
109 
 
(MPSAs) each month to produce quarterly monitoring reports on NDP achievements. 
Furthermore, the ministry produces annual progress reports (APRs) and mid -term review 
reports, which compared and evaluated achievements against the targets of NDPs. 
 
In terms of architecture, the WoGM&ES consists of four main components, namely demand11 
for performance monitoring and evaluation information, supply of competent monitoring and 
evaluation services, the practice of utilising M&E results and an institutional framewor k for 
securing confidence in monitoring and evaluation. Therefore, in an attempt to clearly 
appreciate how M&E is arranged in Zambia, it is important to look at trends in the evolution 
of the M&E practice in the country over the years of implementing NDPs.  
 
5.7.1 Evolution of monitoring and evaluation in Zambia  
In 2005, the Government of the Republic of Zambia, under the regime of the late president 
Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, developed the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP), which was 
implemented between 2006 and 2010. For the first time in the history of national development 
planning in Zambia, the FNDP contained a full chapter on M&E arrangements. However, 
before the FNDP, the country implemented two poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs) 
between 200 0 and 2004, after which there was an Interim Development Plan in 2005. 
Currently, Zambia is implementing its Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP) 2017 –
2021 and in line with the NDPs from 2006, it has a full chapter on M&E arrangements. (The 
first four NDPs did not have chapters articulating M&E arrangements.)  
 
The institutionalisation of the concepts and practice of M&E in the Zambian public sector is a 
recent phenomenon compared with other countries in the southern region and in other regions 
on the African continent. But despite the practice of M&E not being old, expectations of M&E 
arrangements to provide information to support processes of planning and budgeting for 
instance are high (GRZ, 2014c, 2016, 2017a, 2017b). However, because of the youthful nature 
of Zambia’s M&E arrangements and practices, practical challenges have been perpetuated with 
regard to obtaining the much-needed information from the arrangements (GRZ, 2012, 2014c, 
2017a).  
                                                 
11 M&E systems consist of two sides, the supply side and the demand side. On one hand, the supply side is 
concerned with the production and provision of data and information. On the other hand, the demand side is about 
the use of M&E information to inform various processes and stakeholders.
<<<PAGE=129>>>
110 
 
Further, to develop a functional government -wide M&E system, governmen t recently 
developed and articulated the National Performance Framework (NPF). The framework 
provides a national strategic direction towards the realisation of the goals of NDPs and 
ultimately the attainment of Vision 2030. 12 The NPF also identified key res ult areas (KRAs) 
with key performance indicators (KPIs), which should enable MPSAs and other stakeholders 
to align their development plans and budgeting with the NDP and the Vision 2030. The NPF 
has been planned to be supplemented with sector performance f rameworks (SPFs) to link the 
outputs of sector ministry plans and programmes with the NDPs and ultimately the NLTV 
(GRZ, 2014a, 2014c, 2015) (see also section 1.6, sub-section 1.6.3). 
 
The development of the NPF goes in tandem with the ToC (see section 3.2). Therefore, in line 
with ToC thinking, the government was able to develop the NPF. Using the ToC perspective, 
it was easier to define the long -term horizon enshrined in Vision 2030. This enabled  the 
identification and determination of the outcomes in the NPF. Therefore, Zambia’s WoGM&ES 
continues to gain from the utilisation of the ToC and the RBM approach. Countries such as 
Canada, Australia, Colombia, Chile and South Africa have used the ToC to  enhance their 
systems for M&E and ultimately improved their governance performances (Booth & Lucas, 
2002; Kusek & Rist, 2004; see also OECD/DAC, 2007b, 2011a). 
 
5.7.2 Current monitoring and evaluation arrangements in Zambia  
The monitoring and evaluation framework for NDPs is premised on the theoretical constructs 
of theory of change ( ToC), results based management ( RBM), logical framework approach 
(LFA) and managing for development results ( MfDRs) (GRZ, 2017b) (see also Chapter 3) . 
Although the earlier plans (that is, NDPs) were not strongly developed with ToC, there was 
sufficient knowledge of the theory, as could be seen from the indicator system  (especially of 
the current 7NDP) . These plans had KPIs for every sector, which were adopted to measure 
performance. Improvements in t he performance measurement framework continued to be 
enhanced from one plan to another . Consequently, there was a significant shift in the 
preparation process of the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP 2017-2021).  
 
                                                 
12 Vision 2030 as defined under the types of planning in Zambia is a 25-year plan that contains the aspirations of 
Zambians. The vision statement is ‘to become a prosperous middle income country by 2030’.
<<<PAGE=130>>>
111 
 
Thus, using the ToC, RBM, LFA and broadly the MfDRs, 7NDP was developed and stipulated 
cause-effect relationships in terms of development interventions (development 
outcomes/pillars, resul t areas, strategies, programmes &  projects). The performance 
measurement framework (M&E framework) there fore has stated indicators at three levels, 
namely outputs, outcomes and KPIs, across all the five development outcomes of the plan: i) 
economic diversification and job creation; ii) poverty and vulnerability reduction; iii) reducing 
development inequalities; iv) enhancing human development; and v) creating a governance 
environment that is conducive to a diversified economy) (GRZ, 2017b:5). Figure 5.4 below

Thus, the emphasis is on clarifying results throughout the plann ing, implementation, 
monitoring, evaluation and reporting stages; defining expected results first and activities later; 
ensuring that all stakeholders are contributing towards the results; and prioritising performance 
monitoring. As such, the NDPs generate their outcomes  also as stipulated in the  NPF, which 
articulates a series of results required to achieve Vision 2030. In addition, SPFs, aligned with 
the NPF, are currently being developed to guide strategies for implementation of programmes 
at sector level. The SPFs are derivatives of the NPF. The SPF represents a measureme nt tool 
to track progress at sector level towards the attainment of medium -term contributions and 
aspirations against the long -term development desires, contained in the national vision. To 
operationalise the NPF and the SPFs, there is a government -wide M& E system ( that is,  
WoGM&ES). This is a whole -of-government system that transcends all government 
institutions and informs decision making at all levels of governance (see Figure 5.5 and Figure 
5.6 below).  
 
a) National Performance Framework 
The ToC and RBM were used to guide the articulation of the NPF for Zambia (see GRZ, 2016). 
The government is working to enhance the establishment of a results -oriented WoGM&ES to 
improve tracking of what is being done, and whether various efforts – including reforms, 
policies, programmes, projects, and capacity development – are making the improvements and 
changes in the lives of those they are intended to benefit. In that regard, the NPF has been 
developed to effectively coordinate a government-wide system of tracking progress toward the 
achievement of development goals (GRZ, 2016). Figure 5.5 below illustrates the way in which 
the NPF breaks down Vision 2030 into meaningful and im plementable objectives and goal  
results at various levels.
<<<PAGE=133>>>
114 
 
 
Figure 5.2. Cascading Vision 2030 into implementable objectives and results 
Source: GRZ, National Performance Framework, 2016, p. 10 
According to GRZ (2016), the specific objectives of the NPF include these aspects:  
1. To articulate the strategic objec tives to realise the Vision 2030’s long -term goals and 
aspirations 
2. To state the long-term objectives and appropriate key performance indicators to be used 
in tracking progress 
3. To outline the medium -term measurements or sub -outcomes to be tracked through 
National Development Plans with clear linkages to Vision 2030 objectives and 
outcomes 
4. To provide a framework within which the medium-term development plans would link 
to the long-term development goals for the country 
 
The aim of the NPF is to coordinate policies, programmes, and projects to achieve the medium-
term efforts necessary to attain Vision aspirations. It has been designed to translate Vision 2030 
into Strategic Objectives (SOs) and KRAs or simply long-term outcomes (LTOs), which are to 
be achieved through a stated set of medium-term outcomes (MTOs). The NPF was elaborated 
only in 2016, meaning that the earlier NDPs were implemented without the clarified outcomes 
for the Vision. Therefore, in the absence of an NPF, each NDP was formulated in ways tha t 
were not logically linked to the Vision. The absence of an explicit performance framework at 
national and sector level also posed a challenge for government in implementing entities to 
review the realisation of Vision 2030 objectives.
<<<PAGE=134>>>
115 
 
The NPF is develop ed to support the planning, monitoring, evaluation, and budgeting of 
medium-term NDPs from 2016 to 2030. The NPF adopts four SOs, seven LTOs, and 30 MTOs, 
the achievements of which are to be measured by 41 KPIs and 180 NMIs (GRZ, 2016).  
 
Therefore, depend ing on the level, there are differences in the manner in which M&E 
arrangements for the NDPs are set up. For instance, national level institutions consistently 
report on higher level indicators such as KPIs, outcomes and impacts.  Further, the 
implementing institutions generate, collect and document performance data that are useful for 
measuring progress and reporting on the basis of their functions and do so in an interrelated 
and integrated manner towards the attainment of NDP outcomes. This is a governmen t-wide 
M&E framework with set -out stakeholder roles and responsibilities in the practice of M&E 
undertakings to contribute towards the measurement of overall development pr ogress in the 
country. Figure 5.6 demonstrates the linkages between the NPF and the NDPs in the broader 
perspective of achieving the development aspirations in Vision 2030.  
 
 
Figure 5.3. Linkages between National Performance Framework and National Development Plans  
Source: GRZ, National Performance Framework, 2016, p. 44 
 
LTOs are drawn from the Vision’s SOs, upon which the NDP’s MTOs are identified and 
defined (see Figure 5.6). The NDP outcomes then inform sector, provincial, and district level 
plans and strategies. From these, the lower -level results of out puts and activities are defined 
and implemented. RBM, through the broader ToC, then provides guidance on the overall
<<<PAGE=135>>>
116 
 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the NPF and NDPs. Once these take place, the 
objectives of the NLTV have been attained.      
     
b) Government-wide monitoring and evaluation system  
To effectively monitor, evaluate and report on results generated by the implementation of 
NDPs, a WoGM&ES system has been developed by the Zambian Government. The 
institutional set ups for M&E in this system are organised to ensure that processes of planning 
and M&E are interconnected, standardised, fully internalised and applied by the key 
institutions to generate coordinated development results that feed into decision -making 
processes. Further, the M&E processes for the NDPs ensure that there are synergies between 
the existing M&E systems and those to be developed in the various sectors during the 
implementation periods of NDPs. These include the institutionalisation of the NPF and the 
SPFs; establishme nt of M&E management information systems; strengthening the national 
statistical system  (s); developing M&E standardised and structured tools and systems; 
developing a dissemination and communication strategy for sharing M&E products; and 
strengthening relevant institutions through capacity development. The WoGM&ES is therefore 
considered a robust system that provides an integrated, all-encompassing framework of M&E 
principles, practices and standards to be used throughout government; and functions as an apex-
level information system, which draws from the component systems in the framework to 
deliver useful M&E products for its users (Republic of South Africa, 2008 & Castro, 2009) 
 
The WoGM&ES for Zambia has been developed and is currently being strengthened using 
ToC and the RBM approach. These theoretical constructs inspired the articulation not only of 
7NDP, but the NPF an d SPFs as well (see Chapter 3 ). Together, the NPF and SPFs are 
considered crucial aspects in operationalising the WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2017b).    
  
c) Monitoring function  
The government facilitates the monitoring of activities and programmes of NDPs, including 
the intended and unintended impact of development interventions on the economy and 
population. Implementation of NDPs is clo sely monitored using reports on budget execution 
and monthly and quarterly tracking of output indicators, while annual progress is measured 
through agreed KPIs. The government ensures the establishment and implementation of a
<<<PAGE=136>>>
117 
 
WoGM&ES, which include setting up and strengthening M&E and management information 
systems in MPSAs. Further, CAGs offer a structure to monitor progress towards the realisation 
of NDP outcomes and ultimately the long-term objectives of Vision 2030 (GRZ, 2017b).  
 
The Committee of Permanent Secretaries ensures integrated implementation and monitoring of 
development interventions under NDPs, and provides regular cluster updates to the secretary 
to the cabinet. In addition, the NDCC at national level, PDCCs at provincial, DDCCs at district, 
and WDCs at sub-district level support the enhanced function of monitoring. Other institutions 
that implement interven tions under the NDPs also provide systematic updates and data for 
monitoring the projects and programmes. Further, parliament provides oversight on 
implementation processes through various mechanisms, including committees of parliament 
and requests for ministerial statements and updates.  
 
d) Evaluation function  
NDP implementation and impacts are evaluated at mid -term and end -term intervals ( GRZ 
(2017b). Evaluation exercises involve analyses of process and impact to create evidence 
towards informing the development, strategic focus and execution of future development plans. 
The government commi ssions evaluations, which are usually conducted by independent 
entities or experts in evaluation competencies of NDPs. 
 
Key strategies utilised in evaluation include building capacities among the staff members 
across government and in research and academic  institutions to support the increased 
evaluation needs of NDPs. In addition, implementation guidelines and evaluation plans are 
developed to deliver a framework within which development interventions in NDPs are 
evaluated.  
 
Further, the research and acad emic institutions are among the key stakeholders in providing 
complementary programme and policy evaluations and strategic research. Together, these 
processes assist in generating evidence that constitutes valuable input into the review and 
reorganisation of NDP interventions to enhance the accomplishment of planned results.  
Censuses and surveys conducted by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and other research 
institutions are the basis for generating evidence for direct and indirect evaluations of the 
NDP’s impact on the economy and population. Surveys, such as the Living Conditions
<<<PAGE=137>>>
118 
 
Monitoring Survey (LCMS), post -harvest surveys, Zambia Demographic and Health Survey 
(ZDHS), and the censuses of population and housing give socio -economic, demographic and 
health indicators of population wellbeing, attributable to development programmes under the 
NDPs. Several other indicators, such as those from economic surveys provide indicators that 
are attributable to the impact of NDPs on the national economy. In addition, strong stakeholder 
collaboration towards evaluations and research should be promoted between the CSO, the 
government’s planning and M&E agencies, research institutions and the academia. This 
involves the development of strong governance mechanisms for  data generation, analysis, 
storage and dissemination to promote and support collaborative efforts of divergent 
stakeholders involved in M&E processes. This is done to assure high credibility to the evidence 
produced through this collaboration, and provide s opportunities for uptake of development 
results (GRZ, 2017b). Figure 5.7 illustrates information flows for decision-making processes.

The collaborative process for the uptake of development results is entrenched in the effective 
utilisation of results. In the NDPs, national, provincial and district indicators are expected to 
be aligned with national level outcomes. These indicators are then measured at all levels of the
<<<PAGE=138>>>
119 
 
results chain – inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and imp acts. Further, policy 
recommendations from the reports are produced with feedback and are given to implementers 
for action, while those who make policies and the general public are similarly provided with 
information using appropriate channels and modes. 
 
5.7.3 Recent efforts to improve national monitoring and evaluation  
In 2014, the government approved the National Planning and Budgeting Policy aimed at 
strengthening the planning and budgeting functions, and providing for effective coordination 
between pl anning and budgeting for national development. To improve on the financial 
governance and accountability in accordance with the Public Financial Management Reform 
(PFMR) objectives, the government has computerised budget execution (procurement and 
payment) by implementing the Integrated Financial Management and Information System 
(IFMIS) and Treasury Single Account (TSA). 
 
The government has developed the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics 
(NSDS), which aims at strengthening the National Statistical System (NSS), to support among 
others the WoGM&E/MIS functions. The government has also established Smart Zambia 
Institute (SZI) to coordinate and harmonise IT systems in government. In addition, as part of 
the wider PFMR programme launched in 20 14, the government, with support from CPs, 
embarked on M&E reforms to strengthen ‘development accountability’. This included the 
phased-out approach of setting up of the WoGM&E/MIS, starting with selected line ministries.  
 
Further, the government has developed the NDP and Vision 2030. The NPF has also identified 
KRA with KPI that should enable MPSAs and other stakeholders to align their development 
plans and budgeting with the NDP and Vision 2030. The NPF will be supplemented with sector 
performance frameworks (SPF) to link the outputs and outcomes of sector ministries plans and 
programmes to the NDP and Vision 2030. 
 
Since 2017, the government embarked on the formulation of the National Monitoring a nd 
Evaluation Policy (NM&EP). The NM&EP  is being developed  to provide a framework to 
measure and track progress in the implementation of policies, plans, programmes and projects. 
The policy will help to institutionalise and standardise M&E principles, procedures and
<<<PAGE=139>>>
120 
 
guidelines in all development processes. Once i n place, it will provide for the establishment 
and strengthening of institutional M&E structures and capacity development. 
 
The policy will also be a tool for facilitating and strengthening accountability among all 
development stakeholders, and promoting g ood governance based on transparency and 
information sharing in development undertakings. Thus, the policy will contribute towards the 
attainment of value for money for all development policies, programmes and projects and help 
in improving service delivery to the Zambian population. 
 
5.8 Conclusion  
 
Chapter 5 presented details of Zambia’s national planning, monitoring and evaluation 
arrangements in the public sector. It described how M&E functions are expected to be executed 
across government institutions , that is, national, line ministry/sector, provincial and district 
level. The key aspects included the introduction of Zambia as a country of choice upon which 
this research study is premised. Zambia has been identified as appropriate to undertake an in -
depth investigation of the topic under study.  
 
The chapter presented details of Zambia’s national development planning dispensation. In 
doing so, the chapter showed the types of plans that form the holistic planning architecture in 
Zambia. These plans exist at various levels of government. Although there are plans at various 
levels, the NDP is the strategy  together with the NLTV  upon which the WoGM&ES is 
anchored. The other key components articulated in the chapter were the two frameworks of 
implementation a nd coordination. These frameworks have been deemed significant in the 
overall success of Zambia’s WoGM&ES. In addition, the chapter looked at the roles and 
responsibilities of key institutions to the implementation of the WoGM&ES.  
 
Further, the chapter ex pressed in detail the M&E arrangements in Zambia’s public sector. 
Linked to the NDPs, the chapter illustrated the evolution of the M&E phenomenon over the 
years. Similarly, the chapter discussed how the theoretical framework of the study is related to 
the theoretical constructs on which the country’s WoGM&ES is anchored. In that regard, ToC, 
RBM and the LFA were used to inform the design of the 7NDP 2017–2021. At the same time, 
the chapter discussed and put in context the concept of MfDRs by explaining their influence in 
the positive evolution, building and strengthening of Zambia’s WoGM&ES.
<<<PAGE=140>>>

Finally, the chapter showed how existing M&E arrangements in Zambia are structured. In all, 
Chapter 5 represented how M&E is currently implemented in Zambia. This forme d the basis 
for this research study, which is to ascertain the functionality of the WoGM&ES, and identify 
gaps, on which suggestions and recommendations for improvement are based.  
 
Chapter 6 discusses the research design and methodology for the study. It focuses on broader 
and specific aspects of the research design, discussing elements such as the choice of and 
justification for the area of study, data sources, target population, sampling design, data 
collection and analysis parameters.

CHAPTER 6 
 
Research Design and Methodology  
 
 6.1 Introduction  
 
Chapter 6 concerns the research design and methodological dimensions of this study. It gives 
reasons for the choice of and justification for pursuing a research study in the field of 
monitoring and evaluatio n, in analysing Zambia’s whole -of-government M&E system 
(WoGM&ES). It then provides the research design for the study, which is guided by the 
qualitative approach. The qualitative method is justified as being the most appropriate approach 
to investigate the chosen research topic and questions.  
 
In addition, Chapter 6 describes the data sources for the study, the target population, study units 
and the sampling design. Data collection procedures and instruments are also discussed. Four 
assessment checklists have been articulated by practitioners for use in assessing any given 
WoGM&ES. Of the four, the diagnostic checklist articulated by Holvoet and Renard (2005), 
Holvoet and Inberg (2012) and Holvoet, Gildemyn and Inberg (2012 ) was used as the 
instrument of data collection, compilation, collation and analysis for the research study. The 
idea of discussing the four checklists was to illustrate that several diagnostic checklists have 
been elaborated by M&E practitioners, but that it is important to choose the one appropriate to 
a given diagnostic analysis, in this case Zambia’s WoGM&ES. In addition, the adopted 
assessment checklist formed the basis for the analytical framework for the research study.  
 
The chapter ends by stipula ting how data analysis was undertaken. The use of qualitative 
techniques to analyse data from primary and secondary sources is discussed. The LEADS 
system of analysis is presented alongside the text -analysis technique. Further, ethical 
considerations are d iscussed to show how ethically sensitive the study procedures had been 
throughout the research process. Finally, the chapter presents limitations experienced during 
the study.
<<<PAGE=142>>>

6.2 Diagnostic checklists to assess Monitoring and Evaluation systems 
 
A number of practitioners and protagonists of M&E have developed analytical tools to assess 
M&E systems (Holvoet & Renard, 2005; Holvoet & Inberg, 2011; Holvoet et al., 2012). Three 
diagnostic checklists were added to that of Holvoet et al. They are discussed here, but the choice 
of the diagnostic checklist by Holvo et et al is justified for this research study. Thus, four 
checklists are discussed: 
1. Assessment checklist for country -level M&E System by Holvoet and Renard, 2005; 
Holvoet and Inberg, 2011; and Holvoet et al., 2012. 
2. Country Readiness Assessment Framework by the Managing for Development Results 
(MfDRs) and Africa for Results Initiative (AfriK4R) (2013) 
3. Checklist of topics to consider in preparing a monitoring and evaluation diagnosis for 
a country by Lopez-Acevedo, Krause and Mackay (2013) 
4. Monitoring and evaluation diagnostic and guidance tools for practitioners b y Bedi et. 
al. (2006)     
 
The reason for discussing these diagnostic checklists is to illustrate that a great deal of effort 
was utilised to find practical ingredients to assist in building and strengthening country level 
M&E systems for governments. It i s world practice to undertake diagnostic assessment or 
needs assessment to identify areas that needed scaling up and those that need to be introduced 
(Mackay, 2007).  
 
6.2.1 Diagnostic checklist for country-level monitoring and evaluation systems  
There are comprehensive and distinct vital elements that may be presented in form of a 
checklist and used in con ducting rigorous country assessments for M&E systems ( Holvoet & 
Renard, 2005; Holvoet & Inberg, 2011; Holvoet et al. 2012) . In their work, these authors 
undertook a wide review of published and unpublished literature on elements that would 
constitute a critical checklist for determining a successful M&E system,  especially for public 
institutions ( that is, governments). Expert consultations were undertaken with M&E 
practitioners from various countries and institutions before they decided on what they 
considered the fundamental ingredients to look for in a governm ent M&E system (Holvoet & 
Renard, 2005).
<<<PAGE=143>>>
124 
 
Consequently, the country level M&E checklist comprises six criteria or components, namely: 
i) policy, ii) methodology, iii) organisation, iv) capacity, v) participation of actors outside 
government, and vi) use of information from M&E. Each criterion has a set of questions that 
are necessary to understanding the M&E issues pertaining to it. The checklist has been prepared 
and articulated with a view to helping governments and other development stakeholders 
concerned with public sector -related M&E systems to examine the areas of weakness and 
strength and use such information to have targeted M&E reform agendas. For that reason, this 
candidate found the checklist appropriate for use i n this resear ch study. Table 6.1  below 
presents a summarised checklist for use to assess country level M&E systems as presented by 
Holvoet and  Renard (2005); Holvoet and  Inberg (2011); Holvoet et al. (2012) . See also 
Appendix F for a complete checklist.  
 
In order to fully appreciate the dynamics considered in assessing the functional status of a given 
country’s M&E system, there are several sub-components under each component. At the same 
time, there are many questions which are asked under each sub -component to bring o ut 
different aspects of a government-wide M&E system. It is this kind of structure that makes it 
comprehensive to give meaningful information regarding how strong or weak a national system 
for M&E would be assessed.  The questions under each sub-component are quite exhaustive in 
terms of the issues considered and the responses are ta ken seriously to determine the courses 
of action with regard to strengthening a WoGM&ES. For instance, when gaps are identified 
under the ‘methodology ‘component, remedial actions are recommended.

Details about the aspects of concern under each of the six components or ingredients are now 
discussed.  
 
a) Policy   
Under this component, the proponents of the checklist present a number of aspects that need to 
be in place for a functional M&E system for a government (Holvoet & Renard, 2005; Holvoet 
& Inberg, 2011 & Holvoet et al., 2 012). The presence of a clearly elaborated M&E plan is a 
required ingredient, one that is comprehensive, and indicates what to evalua te, why, how and 
for whom. Such a policy plan should acknowledge and distinguish the differences between 
‘monitoring’ and ‘evaluation’ (simply the ‘M’ and ‘E’). Another key aspect is the existence of 
autonomy and impartiality of the M&E practice and a stro ng commitment to the principle of 
accountability. The checklist therefore asks whether the need for autonomy and impartiality is 
mentioned explicitly in the government policy? Are tough and sensitive issues allowed to be 
analysed? What about an independent budget for M&E? (Holvoet & Inberg, 2011).  
 
Further, the checklist seeks to assess feedback loops across government and non -state 
institutions. Here, it is asked whether there is an explicit and consistent approach to
<<<PAGE=145>>>
126 
 
coordination, reporting, disseminatio n and integration. Lastly, under this component, the 
checklist assesses the evidence of alignment between planning and budgeting. The interest is 
to determine whether M&E results are integrated into the planning and budgeting processes.       
 
b) Methodology 
This component deals mainly with questions focused on indicators, data collection and the 
methodologies used to define and undertake these parameters and processes. The selection of 
measurement indicators is one aspect that the checklist seeks to have clar ified. Is there clarity 
on what to monitor and evaluate? Are indicators clear for monitoring and evaluation purposes? 
Is there a clear indicator list? Is there a harmonised indicator system (or indicators themselves) 
for sectors with those in the NDPs? The quality of indicators is another concern. To that extent, 
does it assess whether indicators are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and 
time-bound)? Additionally, the checklist analyses whether baselines and targets for these 
indicators are attached.  
 
Additional aspects are important for assessment under the topic of methodology. The 
disaggregation of the selected indicators into categories such as sex, region, and socio -
economic status is diagnosed as well. Other aspects include the indicator selection criteria and 
whether there is a priority setting strategy for indicators at various levels of government. Is 
there evidence of the need to set priorities and limit the number of indicators to be monitored? 
(Holvoet & Renard, 2005, Holvoet & In berg, 2011). Also, the checklist seeks to establish the 
appreciation and utilisation of ToC thinking and the RBM approach by assessing whether the 
causality chain is followed. So some questions are asked, for example , are different levels of 
indicators (input-activity-output-outcome-impact) explicitly linked (vertical logic). Similarly, 
for the data collection ingredient, the checklist inquires whether the sources are clearly 
identified and the indicators are linked appropriately to the sources of data coll ection 
(horizontal logic). The methodologies used to conduct ‘monitoring’ and ‘evaluation’ are 
significant aspects of assessment under this checklist. Therefore, a check is done to ascertain 
whether ways in which to monitor and evaluate are clear. This is coupled with the assessment 
of the way in which the methodologies were identified and mutually integrated (Holvoet & 
Renard, 2005).
<<<PAGE=146>>>
127 
 
c) Organisation  
The topic of organisation has two components, structure and linkages. Key questions under the 
structural organisation are centred on coordination and oversight, joint sector reviews at line 
ministry level, sector working groups, ownership and incentives. Thus, the checklist asks 
whether there is a suitable institutional set-up for coordination, oversight, support, analysis of 
data and feedback at national and sectoral level and with different stakeholders? What is its 
location? Further, do the joint sector reviews (JSRs) cover accountability and learning needs 
for systemic and substance issues? Are secto r working groups active in monitoring and what 
is their composition? What incentives stimulate data collection and use of M&E information? 
Importantly, does the demand for strengthening the M&E system come from line ministries, a 
central ministry or from e xternal actors (e.g. donors)? Is there a highly placed ‘champion’ in 
the sector ministry who advocate  for the strengthening of the M&E system? (Holvoet & 
Renard, 2005; Holvoet & Inberg, 2011).     
On the topic of organisational linkages, the checklist cove rs a wide range of aspects. Unlike 
the structural organisation component, this topic looks at the linkages with statistical office(s), 
horizontal and vertical integration, and assesses linkages of various projects implemented 
within the ambit of government . Several questions are asked to determine the status of these 
important M&E aspects. For instance, is there a linkage between sector M&E and the statistical 
office? And is the role of the statistical office in M&E at different levels clear? Further, are 
there M&E units in different sub -sectors and semi -government institutions, and are these 
relayed properly to the central sector M&E unit of ministry? Are there M&E units at 
decentralised levels, and are these relayed properly to the sector and central minis try M&E 
system(s)? Is there evidence of efforts to coordinate with donor M&E mechanisms for project 
and vertical funds (Holvoet & Renard, 2005; Holvoet & Inberg, 2011)? These are critical 
questions the checklist attempts to have answered so that the respon ses may be used to build, 
strengthen and sustain Zambia’s WoGM&ES.  
  
d) Capacity  
Building capacity in M&E is an important ingredient for a successful WoGM&ES (Holvoet & 
Renard, 2005; Kanyamuna, 2013). Therefore, the checklist is explicit in seeking aspects that 
need capacity building. In terms of present capacity, these are some of the questions: What is 
the present capacity of the M&E unit at central line ministry, sector level, sub-sector level and
<<<PAGE=147>>>
128 
 
decentralised levels, particularly in skills, financial resources, etc? Also, are the problems and 
weaknesses of M&E capacity across government clearly acknowledged? Another crucial 
aspect is the capacity -building plan. Are there plans or activities to address remediation with 
regard to identified capacity defici ts such as training needs and appropriate salaries? The 
checklist brings out these questions to identify opportunities and problematic points that would 
then lead to an informed approach to building strengthened and sustainable systems for M&E.  
 
e) Participation of actors outside government  
Holvoet and Renard (2005) and Holvoet and Inberg (2011) identified three stakeholders that 
are important in building a strengthened WoGM&ES. These are parliament, civil society and 
donors. Under each, questions are asked principally about their contribution, or lack of it, to 
the overall success and failure  of a given country’s WoGM&ES. The checklist assesses 
whether the role of parliament is properly organised and there is alignment with parliamentary 
control and oversight procedures. Does parliament take part in joint line ministry reviews and 
in activities of sector working groups? Similar questions are asked of civil society and donors. 
Responses are used to identify areas of improvement in terms of how best to engage with these 
stakeholders.  
 
f) Use of information from monitoring and evaluation  
The use of information from M&E is the sixth and final topic under this checklist by Holvoet 
and Renard, 2005; Holvoet and Inberg, 2011 and Holvoet et al., 2012. It is the most definitive 
aspect in determining the creation and s trengthening of any given WoGM&ES. What the 
checklist seeks to achieve is who demands and who uses the information and results from M&E 
products. For example, is there a presentation of M&E results? Are results compared to targets 
and does the analysis of discrepancies exist? Are M&E results differentiated to different 
audiences? In addition, the checklist assesses the utilisation status of M&E information by 
donors, central level institutions, local levels and by actors outside government. Consequently, 
are donors using the results of the WoGM&ES for their information needs? Also, are the 
demands for M&E data from donors coordinated? Are the results of M&E activities used for 
internal purposes and is the M&E system used as an instrument of policy making, po licy 
influencing and advocacy? The checklist also examines whether the results of M&E are being 
utilised to hold government accountable (Holvoet & Inberg, 2011).

6.2.2 Country Readiness Assessment Framework for Africa 
The Africa for Results (AfriK4R) initiative readiness assessment framework was developed by 
the African Community of Practice on Managing for Development Results (AfCoP-MfDRs, 
2014). Like the checklist articulated by Holvoet and others, the assessment framework has six 
pillars, namely: i) leadership for results, ii) planning for results, iii) results -based budgeting, 
iv) institutional capacity to deliver goods and services, v) information systems, statistics 
capacity and monitoring and evaluation, and vi) accountability for results. 13 Table 6.2 shows

13 Although the two checklists each have six components, the elements are not the same. The contents in each 
checklist are similar in many respects, but their presentation is different. The diffe rence in presentation also may 
affect the way information can be collected and analysed.
<<<PAGE=149>>>
130 
 
Briefly, this checklist covers these issues: 
 
a) Leadership for results 
Three aspects are critical under this criterion, namely policy leadership, open ness and 
transparency, and change management. Here, the framework assesses whether leadership for 
results is in place. Policy leadership is concerned with the delineation of the three arms of 
government, that is, legislature, executive and judiciary, for example which arm drives strategic 
planning and which coordinates government policies. Openness and transparency is concerned 
with the availability of permanent structures for public involvement in decision making and 
the participation of such stakeholders as civil society and parliament becomes paramount. 
Equally, this element is about whether there are legal frameworks to support registration and 
free participation of NGOs. Another issue concerns the freedom of decision-making processes.  
 
Change managemen t involves regular structured organisational changes to improve 
performance. Does the government have comprehensive civil service reform and a 
performance improvement programme? A leadership for results would be interested in putting 
in place initiatives to support human capacity development, especially in RBM.   
 
b) Planning for results 
Planning for results has four components, namely government strategic plan, operational 
planning, participatory planning, and sector planning capacity. In terms of government 
strategic plan, one concern is whether there is a long-term plan that articulates the vision of the 
government and is backed by a legal framework. The assessment framework is concerned with 
the availability of a government line ministry or entity that is d irectly mandated with the 
preparation and implementation of a comprehensive strategic plan. Undertaking evaluations 
for projects and programmes and their contributions to the attainment of government objectives 
are also assessed. 
 
Operational planning and participatory planning are the types of focus under the planning for 
results criterion. Operational planning establish  whether the government strategic plan has 
identified clear programmes that help to achieve objectives. The participation of parliament, 
civil society and the general public in the preparation and execution of the government strategic
<<<PAGE=150>>>
131 
 
plan is significantly assessed. In what ways do these key stakeholders access the government 
strategic plan? 
Sector planning capacity examines the availability of comprehensive strategic sector plans that 
are approved and in execution. These plans are supposed to be products of stakeholder 
participation and to contribute to the attainment of the overall government strategic plan.  
 
c) Results-based budgeting 
The co mponent of results -based budgeting has five aspects, namely programme -based 
budgeting, medium -term budgetary perspective, fiscal discipline and credibility, budget 
transparency and information dissemination, and financial controls.   
 
The results-based budgeting component is concerned with whether public budgets are based 
on prioritised programmes and objectives as identified in the government strategic plan. It 
assesses whether every programme budgeting for future years is based on results of past 
performance. Under medium-term budgetary perspective, the focus is on establishing whether 
there is a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), which is a three-year rolling financial 
plan. In addition, the relationships among programmes, projects and objectives i n the 
government strategic plan, annual budgets and MTEF are assessed.  
 
Further, the fiscal discipline and credibility element among other issues looks at whether there 
is a fiscal responsibility law that sets the limits to debt growth and current expenditure growth. 
The component on budget transparency and information dissemination examines whether the 
budget information is available to the public through the Internet when the budget proposal is 
presented to parliament. Another concern is whether this inf ormation on the budget makes it 
possible to identify budget allotments according to categories based on programmes and 
objectives in the government strategic plan.  
 
The financial controls component involves checking whether the national audit agencies are  
capable of verifying the accounts of all line ministries, local governments, and public agencies. 
The public audits are assessed to see whether they conform to international standards. The 
component is also concerned with how rules and regulations that go vern public procurement 
are organised. The component also scrutinises whether the legislative branch of parliament has
<<<PAGE=151>>>
132 
 
an accounts committee or other mandate to provide oversight on government expenditures, for 
instance through review of audited financial statements of public agencies.  
 
d) Institutional capacity to deliver goods and services 
The fourth pillar is the institutional capacity to deliver goods and services. It has three 
components, namely departmental work planning, human resources capacity, and g oods and 
services delivery and client satisfaction. The departmental work planning component assesses 
whether the goals in the national strategic plan and sector strategic plans have been broken 
down into annual goals. Are line ministries required to have clearly articulated and intra -
departmentally shared mission statements? The other assessment is to check whether policies, 
programmes and projects are clear and logical, and based on cause -effect relationships. Thus, 
departmental plans are assessed to establish whether they are linked to higher order outcomes. 
The verification of whether cost -benefit-analyses are conducted as part of preparing projects 
and programmes and government strategic plans is also important.  
 
With the human resource capacity compon ent, the focus is on assessing whether government 
institutions have contracts to measure the performance of their employees in their sector 
departments and units. This component also checks the availability of clear policies and 
meritocratic systems to pro mote and reward senior officials with bonuses. Do government 
institutions hire senior officials within transparent competitive processes? What about clear 
and up-to-date terms of reference (ToRs) or job descriptions for each position in government 
institutions? Further, the component checks whether or not senior officials’ prompt capacity 
building and training of civil servants in quality delivery of goods and services existed. 
 
For goods and services delivery and client satisfaction, the main concerns are the clarity of 
outputs that the departments in the line ministries should implement in their contribution to the 
national outcomes. These come in the form of targets and benchmarks against agreed KPI s. 
Another crucial aspect concerns the existence of forums for coordination among interdependent 
public institutions, such as line ministries. Are public consultation mechanisms in place to 
introduce improvements to the delivery process of goods and services?
<<<PAGE=152>>>
133 
 
e) Information systems, statistical capacity, and monitoring and evaluation 
The fifth pillar addresses three aspects, namely statistics framework and capacity building, 
MIS, monitoring results framework, and th e evaluation results framework. The statistics 
framework and capacity building concern whether gov ernment has a legal and operational 
framework for its statistical activities. Also the availability of technical standards and 
guidelines with methodologies is assessed for all entities and units in charge of producing 
statistics. Other aspects include verifying whether the statistical data that is generated is broad 
enough to measure all indicators related to government’s programme goals. Further, the 
component on statistics assesses whether there is a legal mandate, funding base, and pool of 
skills for the national statistical office. This is coupled with examining government’s capacity 
to analyse statistical data for forecasting and to feed into other decision-making processes.  
 
MIS is another aspect of interest. An assessment is made of whether there ar e household and 
other comprehensive socio -economic surveys, for example for five years; whether line 
ministries MIS s capture data on client satisfaction and the impact of service delivery; and 
whether these service delivery surveys show trends in client sa tisfaction. Line ministries are 
assessed as to whether they produce quarterly or annual reports against their plans and budgets. 
A critical factor is the availability of the MIS to the public through the Internet.  
 
In addition, M&E results frameworks form an important aspect. An assessment is made of the 
existence of legal frameworks that carry out mandatory M&E of the government strategic plan. 
Is a government entity in charge of monitoring the implementation of the government strategic 
plan using KPIs? Does this entity possess formally established guidelines with methodologies 
and technical standards? Is the monitoring information of the objectives and goals of the 
government strategic plan available to the public? Further, the evaluation results framewor k 
seeks to assess whether the legal framework establishes responsible agencies, their objectives, 
and resources for the evaluation of the government strategic plan and its programmes. Is there 
an official public document that establishes the evaluation guidelines with methodologies and 
technical standards? The component similarly assesses whether the evaluation reports are made 
available to the public and how widely the evaluation findings are disseminated. Are 
government policies, programmes and projects s ubject to regular independent evaluation and 
other reviews of effectiveness?
<<<PAGE=153>>>
134 
 
f) Accountability for results 
Accountability for results has four elements, namely participation, effective accountability 
institutions, feedback to decision making, and partnerships.  Under participation, an assessment 
is made regarding whether the civil society and the private sector have been able to provide 
meaningful inputs to formulating government strategic plans. Equally, are media independent 
and able to investigate and pro vide critical judgements that can deter illegal and unethical 
behaviour? Stakeholders’ perceptions of the level of public dissemination of information by 
government are important.  
 
Is there an independent ombudsman with powers to adjudicate disputes? Is t he legislative 
branch able to monitor the executive branch of government effectively? Is the judiciary 
independent and free of the influence of politicians and powerful business interests? To that 
extent, the component assesses whether government has an an ti-corruption agency backed by 
appropriate legislation, financial resources and technical skills.       
 
Another important element is feedback to decision -making processes, which probes the 
utilisation of output and outcome information in decision making. This process questions 
whether policy objectives and priorities are revisited regularly in the light of research, statistics, 
and other facts and analyses regarding changes in the status of development outcomes. It also 
considers whether lessons are learne d from reviews and evaluations and are systematically 
embedded in new project and programme designs. Are options for improved effectiveness of 
service delivery sought, considered, and acted upon? Do progress and performance reports lead 
to changes in servi ce delivery strategies? In addition, is feedback on service delivery from 
clients acted upon? Are there learning networks domestically or internationally that are sought 
for lessons and experiences?  Partnerships form the last aspect under this pillar. This component 
assesses government’s functional partnerships with donors. It examines whether donor 
priorities are derived from national planning processes. Are there formal government -led 
mechanisms for donor-to-donor coordination? Also, government’s capacity to ensure effective 
alignment and coordination of donor projects and programmes with those in the government 
strategic plan is assessed. Another aspect of interest is to ascertain whether donors’ 
mechanisms are aligned with national reporting procedures and standards.

6.2.3 Monitoring and evaluation diagnostic checklist  
The third checklist for conducting diagnoses of M&E systems and capacities was developed 
by Lopez -Acevedo, Krause and Mackay in 2012. It has a number of components that are 
considered instrumental to understanding the status of a country’s  M&E system. Table 6.3  
outlines the diagnostic checklist.

Lopez-Acevedo et al. (2012)  identified three components that are critical to a ssessing and 
strengthening a country’s M&E system. They framed them as ‘blocks’ and these include Block 
A: National environment for M&E; Block B: M&E systems, and Block C: Findings.   
 
Block A: National environment for monitoring and evaluation  
 
The topic  of concern in Block A is the national policy and institutional framework for a 
country’s M&E system. Do national policies exist and what processes are followed? 
Stakeholders involved in developing such policies are assessed to appreciate whether 
inclusivity is a common requirement. For example, the role of donors and civil society in policy 
formulation is assessed. Issues of political biases and interests are also assessed. Further, 
overall policy formulation and implementation is diagnosed as to whether t he processes 
demand M&E functions. Decentralisation of a country and how the policy environment have 
evolved over time are issues of interest under this block.  
 
Block B: Monitoring and Evaluation systems  
 
Block B describes the M&E systems, and probes the historical development of these systems. 
How and why did the M&E system develop? Who championed it and who opposed it? What 
kind of implem entation strategy was adopted? I t assesses the objectives of an M&E system. 
Was it developed to enhance budget suppor t, to support policy making or for programme 
improvement and accountability?   
 
In addition, Block B examines processes, tools and products that emanate from M&E systems. 
Issues include the types of indicators and their selection criteria. The way in which information 
from these M&E systems is controlled for quality and utilised to inform other development 
processes is of interest. The appropriateness of the M&E information is assessed from the tools 
that are used to collect it and its management to analysi s and dissemination. Another matter 
regards the relationship of a country M&E system with other systems that may be running in 
parallel, for instance M&E and quality -management systems; ministry and sub -national 
monitoring systems with national systems? 
 
Another topic is the institutional architecture of M&E systems in a country. Structurally, the 
diagnosis checks the harmonisation and fragmentation of M&E components in a country’s
<<<PAGE=156>>>
137 
 
WoGM&ES. This also refers to semi -autonomous government institutions. Thus, issues 
pertaining to the manner in which the coordination and cooperation of information exchange 
in a national M&E system are also examined. Whether a given M&E system is centralised also 
forms the basis for assessment.  
 
The results represent another component of the M&E systems block. What are the credibility, 
quality, and accessibility of the products of M&E? What are the impacts of these M&E 
products? Where there are multiple objectives, are there multiple development impacts? 
 
Block C: Findings 
 
Bock C represents the M&E findings. Interesting topics are conclusions and recommendations. 
Issues of what works and do not work make up core aspects. In addition, the block is concerned 
with reform areas to enhance M&E systems and practice. The three blocks therefore, constitute 
the complete assessment checklist that is used to diagnose the functionality of a given country 
level WoGM&ES (Lopez-Acevedo et. al., 2012).   
 
6.2.4 Monitoring and evaluation diagnostic and guidance tools for the practitioner  
The fourth assessment checklist is called ‘Monitoring and evaluation diagnostic and guidance 
tools for the practitioner’ by Bedi et al (2006). Its authors listed important elements to consider 
when assessing a country’s M&E system for purposes of building and strengthening (see Table 
6.4).

Three categories are crucial in diagnosing a country’s M&E system, namely i) institutional 
context and design of the monitoring and evaluation system; ii) ability of the monitoring and 
evaluation system to supply information; and iii) demand for and use of the  monitoring and 
evaluation system information.  Each component is meant to assess areas of strength and 
weakness. This information i s used to enhance the practice of M&E arrangements across 
government structures.  
   
(i) Institutional context and design of the monitoring and evaluation system  
The M&E system for a national development plan (NDP) should consist of a well -developed, 
supportive and sustained institutional context and design (Bedi et al., 2006). Issues that require 
assessment include a record of a clear design process that was followed to develop the existing 
M&E system. Thus, this component is concerned with checking whether the system underwent 
thorough diagnosis before being designed and developed. Stakeholder analysis, needs 
assessment and data diagnostics are important elements to assess institutional suitability for a 
functional M&E at national level.  
 
Other items are des igned to assess the national leadership capacity to support the design and 
strengthening of M&E. To that extent, the availability of political leadership and champions 
that drive the M&E agenda are assessed. The existing leadership environment then leads to an 
analysis of M&E coordination issues across government. The element of coordination covers 
a range of issues such as assessing coordination mechanisms; oversight; liaison with local
<<<PAGE=158>>>
139 
 
government, line ministries, civil society and development partners  (DPs). Legislation and 
regulation, outputs, how they are linked to policy making and the role of the national statistics 
are among the core aspects that are assessed under this component.                       
 
(ii) Ability to supply monitoring and evaluation information  
The second aspect involves the ability of an M&E system to supply information that is relevant 
to stakeholders. The issues here are capacity related. An NDP monitoring system need to be 
checked for its capacity for holistic data production (Bedi et. al., 2006). Aspects of concern are 
capacities for data collection , definitions, sources, relevance, standards, coordination, 
workforce, resources and dissemination.  
 
In addition, this component assesses the capacities to track government business  and services 
rendered at levels such as national and sub-national. Other important elements are the capacity 
to analyse M&E data and information and to undertake evaluations. The capacity to analyse 
data and information is crucial because the credibility and reliability of M&E products are 
dependent on this process. And the capacity to evaluate development programmes, projects 
and policies is pertinent to the success of any country M&E system. To that extent, the entity 
that undertakes the data and information analyses and evaluations becomes a matter of interest.       
 
Other elements include a catalogue of development outputs and a dissemination strategy for 
these outputs. ‘Outputs’ refers to important M&E results that are supposed to be tracked and 
information disseminated in a structured manner to stakeholders using a functional 
communications strategy (Bedi et. al., 2006). Capacity building and funding are other 
important aspects. Human capacity issues such as skills and financial capacities for M&E 
activities at all levels of government are assessed. These aspects then form the basis for 
contribution towards the sustainability of country M&E systems (Mackay, 2007) . Capacity 
building is assessed at various levels such as the involvement of stakeholders as development 
partners, in-country training institutions and other government agencies.    
 
(iii) Demand for monitoring and evaluation system information 
Bedi et al. (2006) identified the component of demand for and the utilisation of a country M&E 
system information as a significant aspect towards building and sustaining such systems. The
<<<PAGE=159>>>
140 
 
need for M&E information in the development processes of programmes, projects and policies 
has been discussed as a desired element throughout this thesis. Under this component, an 
assessment is required to check the type of information needed for the preparation of NDPs 
and sub-national plans, particularly indicator information. Similarly, the component is 
concerned with the use of M&E in budget processes such as resource allocation, releases and 
other appropriations, for example whether the ministry of finance, local govern ment and 
agencies, line ministries, parliament, development partners and civil society all demand for 
M&E results in their operations. The way in which information flows happen among these 
institutions and how they are linked to the national -level M&E syst em and coordination 
framework are central concerns.     
 
6.3 Choice of the country-level monitoring and evaluation diagnostic checklist 
 
Four diagnostic checklists that assess the status of country M&E systems have been discussed 
(section 6.2). The discussion showed elements that M&E practitioners consider important in 
understanding the functionalities of M&E systems. Although they differ in presentation and in 
content, the checklists are aimed at giving important information for building and strengthening 
government M&E systems. The four diagnostic checklists were discussed to illustrate that more 
than one diagnostic instrument was available for assessing government M&E systems. The 
checklists are a demonstration by development practitioners around the worl d that M&E is a 
vital ingredient in strengthening institutions for good governance and poverty alleviation. 
Therefore, this research study adopted the checklist articulated by Holvoet and Inberg (2011), 
Holvoet and Renard (2005) and Holvoet et al. (2012) for these reasons. 
o Comprehensive: It covers six broad areas of assessment. Most of the issues covered in 
the other three checklists are incorporated in this tool.  
o Coherent: It has clear topics accompanied by well-formulated questions which, when 
properly administered, would gi ve a holistic appreciation of an M&E system. The 
systematic presentation of the topics and questions renders it easy to administer and 
carry out meaningful analyses, conclusions and recommendations.    
o Specific: The checklist has few or no ambiguities. The topics are clear and the questions 
under each component are attainable. It is easy to apply to Zambia’s WoGM&ES.    
o Simple: It is not complicated. It is expressed in user friendly language, yet is 
comprehensive and concise in content and presentation.
<<<PAGE=160>>>
141 
 
Therefore, the diagnostic checklist was used to collect data and information from all the 
respondents in the study. The application was done in two ways : i) it was administered as a 
complete checklist to collect data and information from the review of secondary documentation 
through a desk research approach, and ii) questions were selected from the checklist and 
appropriate interview schedules were developed, which were administered to key 
informants14and in focus group discussions (FGDs). Participants were drawn from government 
and non-state institutions across structures at national, line ministry, provincial and district 
level. The three other checklists were used to a limited extent to inform questions in the 
interview schedules and questionnaires. Otherwi se, the adopted checklist (by Holvoet et al) 
was used as the instrument of data and information collection for the research study.        
 
6.4 Choice and justification for the area of study  
 
Good governance and a genuine pursuit of poverty reduction remai n imperatives among 
governments, especially those in developing countries such as Zambia (Arora, 2013; Bullivant, 
Burgess, Corbett-Nolan & Godfrey, 2012). Troubled with challenges that include deteriorating 
economic growth, high unemployment levels, especially among the youth and women, a poor 
human development record , and generally weak socio -economic outlay, the Zambian 
Government has been making sustained efforts towards poverty reduction for many years 
(GRZ, 2006, 2017b).  
 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is one of the core tools deemed significant to help contribute 
to the good governance crusade and to put Zambia on a positive path for poverty reduction and 
sustained socio-economic growth and development. To that extent, this rese arch study sought 
to investigate and strengthen the whole -of-government M&E system (WoGM&ES) for the 
public sector, which is supposed to offer a platform for evidence -based decision making and 
policy formulation and implementation. The WoGM&ES is already in existence, but is not 
functioning as desired (see chapter 1). For that reason, it became necessary to undertake this 
study to investigate and suggest salient steps that could be effected to make it robust to benefit 
the economy in future.  
 
                                                 
14 ‘Key informants’ refers to individual people who were considered to have specialised information relevant to 
this study. They hold influential positions in M&E from government and non-government institutions.
<<<PAGE=161>>>
142 
 
The case study of Zambia’s WoGM&ES was a preferred choice of interest for this candidate. 
Case studies are frequently used in programmes, policies and projects, and are useful for 
describing what an intervention look s like in practice and why things happen as they do, and 
focuses on the effects of an intervention (Imas & Rist, 2009; see also Bryman, 2012; Yin, 
1993). Thus, like many developing countries, Zambia requires a stable and predictable 
governance system that tackles poverty issues using evidence from M&E arrangements and 
products across the public sector. Just as the country needs well-functioning systems in public 
finance, public procurements, audit and judiciary, Zambia requires a stronger WoGM&ES that 
will provide quality information for all processes of development ( GRZ, 2017b; Kanyamuna, 
2013). 
 
Zambia’s national long -term vision (Vis ion 2030) of becoming a prosperous middle -income 
nation by 2030 is the focus for government, working alongside its development partners. The 
five-year national development plans (NDPs) are used as vehicles to realise the Vision. Further, 
to achieve this vi sionary status, a number of reforms and efforts by stakeholders have been 
identified and are currently being implemented. For instance, strengthening the public sector 
M&E function is among the prioritised reform areas for government (GRZ, 2017b). This study 
takes keen interest in exploring the M&E arrangements further. The analysis of Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES in the context of nat ional development plans is of interest since it offers an 
opportunity to improve governance, transparency and accountability of public resources and 
public affairs, and creates some high levels of confidence in the populace (see section 1.2 and 
section 1.6).  
 
6.5 Research design  
 
Research design denotes an overall strategy chosen to integrate the components of a research 
study in a coherent and logical way, thereby ensuring the effective address of a given research 
problem ( Babbie & Mouton, 2006 ; Creswell, 2009) . It consists of the overa ll plan for the 
collection, collation, measurement and analysis of data (Black, 1999) . Therefore, a 
representation of the chosen research design for this research study is described in section 6.5.1 
below.
<<<PAGE=162>>>
143 
 
 6.5.1 Qualitative research approach  
The primary objective of this research study was to examine Zambia’s M&E arrangements in 
the context of NDPs to ascertain ways of strengthening the WoGM&ES. To achieve this goal, 
the research design was broad based by taking o n board elements that were deemed key to 
answering the primary and stated secondary objectives (see section 1.5.). To fulfil that 
aspiration, the research design was investigatory and descriptive in nature. This means that the 
qualitative approach was adopted to guide the overall data collection, analysis, interpretation 
and recommendations.  
 
A research design is a plan of the proposed research work and represents a compromise dictated 
by practical considerations (Ghosh, 1992; Yin, 1993; Creswell, 2003). It is the arrangement or 
condition for collection and analysis of data in a manner that aims to combine relevance to the 
research purpose with economy or reasonable flexibility in procedure (Ghos h, 1992). It was 
also understood in this methodology that the research design remained tentative in the sense 
that as the study progressed, new facts, new ideas and new conditions appeared, which 
necessitated changes in the original paradigm. 
 
A two-tier research approach to data collection and analysis was adopted. On one hand, desk -
based research was used, mainly to consult literature (secondary research) on the topic of M&E, 
while on the other hand, the study used field -based research (primary research) to acquire 
hands-on information. Further, the secondary sources of data for the study comprised key 
government policy documents such as the NDPs, NDP Annual Progress Reports (APRs), 
evaluation reports, line ministry, provincial and district strategic plans and reports, Vision 2030 
and various management reports and policies. In addition, the research used M&E -related 
literature from international development organisations such as World Bank, Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Unit ed Nations, non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral and bilateral 
agencies. Equally, scholarly books, discussion papers, journal articles, working papers and 
research papers were consulted to enrich t he discussion, analysis and drawing of conclusions 
and recommendations for improving Zambia's WoGM&ES. Websites and online databases and 
engines were also consulted and provided insightful information for the research study.
<<<PAGE=163>>>
144 
 
Furthermore, primary data wer e collected through key informant interviews and focus group 
discussions (FGDs) with stakeholders, particularly those concerned with public sector 
planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The respondents were divided between 
key informants through the use of interviews, while information from other respondents was 
obtained through FGDs (see sections 6.8 & 6.9). Accordingly, the research design remained 
flexible enough to accommodate any necessary changes in conditions during actual field 
experiences. 
 
6.5.2 Justification for using the qualitative approach  
Qualitative research is based on description and theory telling (Ghosh, 2013). It helps to find 
out the truth about phenomena using various interactive data collection techniques (Ghosh, 
2013; Bamberger, Rao & Woolcock, 2010; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998) . While quantitative 
research depends on experiments and rigorous mathematical analysis of data for making 
generalisations and conclusions, qualitative research focuses on in -depth and descriptive 
information, mostly from the people who experience directly or indirectly the conditions being 
investigated (Adato, 2011) . Therefore, since this study was exploratory and descri ptive, 
qualitative methodology was selected as being suitable to provide the expected information 
and the analysis.  
 
Another benefit from using the qualitative research approach is that it is based on observations 
and utilises the inductive method of enqu iry (Stake, 2000; Wolcott, 2001; Boyce & Neale, 
2006). At best, it covers types of research methods that do not use numerical sophistication for 
the analysis of data. Instead, it is interested in finding conceptual meanings of forms of entities 
and explanations of different types of phenomena (Kanbur, 2001). As a qualitative case study, 
it goes beyond descriptive questions to answer the ‘how and why‘ questions (Yin, 1993). This 
research study thus was exploratory in nature, and sought explanations for questions related to 
the M&E-good governance-poverty reduction relationships. Qualitative research also allows 
researcher’s insights to be fed into the analysis. It allows for analytic generalisa tions, and has 
the potential for theory building (Babbie & Mouton, 2006). To that extent, this study was not 
a hypothetical exercise, but was exploratory in n ature as it assessed the influence of several 
forms of oversight on the case study of Zambia’s WoGM&ES to understand internal processes.
<<<PAGE=164>>>
145 
 
Qualitative research was preferred for this study because it possessed a higher degree of 
validity compared with quant itative research because the data in qualitative research are 
derived from various sources through triangulation (Ghosh, 2013; see also Suri, 2011; Wolcott, 
2001). Baker (1999) describes triangulation as a method of ga thering data from sources using 
different types of techniques.  Triangulation is commonly considered one of the best ways to 
enhance reliability and validity in qualitative research, and can partly overcome the deficiencies 
that flow from using one type of method (Merriam, 2002; Babbie & Mo uton, 2006). In this 
research, triangulation was employed through the use of data collection instruments such as 
semi-structured survey questionnaires, document reviews  and interview schedules . The 
information collected was synthesised to give a richer discussion and conclusions on a 
particular issue than would have been possible if only a single data source or data collection 
instrument had been used.    
 
Therefore, the choice of qualitative r esearch gave an understanding of details concerning the 
current nature and status of Zambia’s WoGM&ES in a comprehensive manner. At the same 
time, qualitative research provided a platform to articulate the notion of M&E in a much more 
expressive and open-ended way.  
 
6.6 Secondary research data sources 
 
The sources of data for secondary information in this research study were obtained from 
published and unpublished sources.  This document literature review was drawn from a wide 
range of sources—from across government and non-government literature sources.    
 
6.6.1 Published sources  
Information from various sources has been used throughout the study. In particular, published 
books, journal articles, periodicals and other literature were consulted to give a r ich literature 
review for the study. In addition, reports from organisations such as World Bank, government 
and individual experts and practitioners in the field of M&E were employed to enhance the 
discussion. For example, the study benefited from a review of key national, regional, and global 
documents that state development aspirations for the world, Africa, and Zambia. Key 
documents included Zambia’s Vision 2030, Zambia’s key policy strategy documents – the 
First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Revised Sixth and Seventh NDPs – and regional and
<<<PAGE=165>>>
146 
 
international development framework documents such as Africa Union Vision 2063, United 
Nations 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the 2030 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). In addition, governmen t and institutional websites and online databases 
constituted a significant source of information.   
 
6.6.2 Unpublished sources  
Several unpublished sources of data were consulted for this research study  as well . These 
included books, journal articles, gov ernment and organisational reports, mainly from World 
Bank, UN, various governments and NGOs. Other sources were reports by individuals, such 
as theses and dissertations, including working and discussion papers. Importantly, Internet -
based information was also used.  
 
6.7 Primary research data sources  
 
Various types of respondents provided information for this research study. Respondents were 
drawn mainly from designated government and non-state institutions, such as government line 
ministries, parliament,  cabinet office, office of the auditor general, provinces, districts, 
academia, civil society, and development partners and donors. In addition, the study benefited 
from respondents who were not initially planned for in the research design. These included 
practitioners in the field of M&E, while others were authorities and experts in the 
implementation of public development, such as non -governmental organisations (NGOs). 
Largely, these respondents provided valuable information that was relevant to the study

6.8 Target population, study units and sampling design   
 
This research was conducted within the confines of the Government of the Republic of Zambia 
(GRZ), the public sector to be specific. In terms of the sample size, Table 6.5 provides the 
numbers of respondents from various structural leve ls of government, quasi-government and 
non-state stakeholders (also see Table 6.6  & Appendix L). To reach a suitable sample size, 
purposeful non -probability sampling techniques were employed in determining the
<<<PAGE=166>>>
147 
 
respondents from the various categories and structural levels of government and non -state 
institutions.  
 
A total of 142 respondents were targeted in the study, consisting of 33 respondents at national 
level, 15 at sector (line ministry) level, 54 from provincial and 25 from district (25) levels. 
Other targets were from civil society (3), cooperating partners (2),  academia and resea rch 
institutions (3), development associations (2) and other assorted stakeholders (5) using the 
same instruments (or adapted). However, the total number of respondents who took part in the 
study increased to 201. Owing to the specialised nature of their M &E related roles and 
responsibilities, the purposive sampling technique was employed to select the respondents.

6.9 Data collection procedures and instruments  
 
Essentially, four (4) data collection methodo logies and three (3) types of data collection 
instruments were used in the entire study. The methodologies included a literature review  of 
various documents , interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) and a survey, while 
instruments for data collection com prised the diagnostic checklist, self -administered (survey) 
questionnaires and adapted interview schedules (used for interviews and FGDs) (see Table 6.6 
for details). Interview schedules consisted mainly of open-ended questions. The survey used a 
self-administered semi -structured questionnaire comprising both open -and-close-ended 
questions. Customised interview schedules were used to guide discussions of seven FGDs, each 
comprising between 5 and 10 respondents. A number of documents (published and 
unpublished) were reviewed using the adapted diagnostic checklist articulated by Holvoet et 
al. (see 6.2 .1). Apart from government officials, additional key informant interviews were 
conducted with respondents from civil society (3), cooperating partners (2), acade mia and
<<<PAGE=168>>>
149 
 
research institutions (3), development associations (2) and other assorted stakeholders (5). For 
those organisations, adapted interview schedules were used to collect responses. The diagnostic 
checklist was used as the major semi -structured questionnaire or tool to assess and analyse 
Zambia’s WoGM&ES ( Holvoet & Renard, 2005; Holvoet & Inberg, 2011  & Holvoet et al.  
2012). Additional tools such as interview schedules and questionnaires were adopted and 
adapted from similar analysis tools in the field of monitoring and evaluation.15 For details about 
the full diagnostic checklist, see appendix F.   
   
For primary data collection, adapted questions  (interview schedules)  were administered to 
research respondents, namely key informants from across government and the standard 
questionnaire assessment checklist used for desk review of various documents. Therefore, these 
choices of methodologies determined the selection of data collection instruments. Further, 
semi-structured self-administered survey questionnaires and interview schedules were used. 
Again, both of these instruments were derived from the adapted diagnostic checklist by Holvoet 
and Renard, 2005; Holvoet and Inberg, 2011;  and Holvoet et al., 2012 . It was important to 
adapt the instruments according to the specific audiences.  See appendices A, B and C for the 
detailed adapted questionnaires to respondents in ministries, provinces and districts.  
 
For the interview methodology in particular, appropriated semi -structured one -on-one 
interviews with  interview schedules were used to collect information from key i nformants 
across government and non -government structures (see append ices D & E ). The schedules  
consisted of closed and open-ended questions. In addition, FGDs undertaken at provincial and 
district level were conducted using the same interview schedules with closed and open-ended 
questions. FGDs were used to help bring together those officers responsible for the function of 
planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation to discuss and highlight issues of M&E 
arrangements and practice in government structures. A total of ten FGDs, comprising of 
between 5 and 10 people in each focus group, were organised and interviewed in the study. In 
total, the number of people who participated in the FGDs in the enti re research was 91 (see 
Table 6.6 below).  
 
                                                 
15 Although the diagnostic checklist by Holvoet and others was used as the main assessment and analytical 
instrument, some questions from similar lists by other authors were adopted and appropriated to the study . For 
example, some questions were used from the assessment checklists by Bedi et. al. (2006), Lopez-Acevedo, Krause 
and Mackay (2013), MfDRs (2013).

Table 6.6  clarifies the data sources for the research stu dy and shows the nature of data 
collection methodologies and instruments used to capture information from the sources. This 
is important in that research findings were supposed to be scientifically linked to empirical 
sources using clearly defined research  approaches and tools (Cousins, 1986; Simelane, 1990 , 
Mackay, 2007; World Bank, 2006). In that regard, the sources of information in this research 
were drawn from various government institutions at national, line ministry, provincial, district, 
selected institutions and from key informants as well as various document literature review.

6.10 Data analysis   
 
6.10.1 Data analysis strategies  
To undertake a thorough discussion and analysis of the research findings, a qualitative analytical 
tool known as the LEADS system was adopted. This tool or strategy goes together with the 
diagnostic checklist by Holvoet et al. which was used to gather data and information for this 
research study. The LEADS data analysis method uses a five-point system of scoring: Little action 
(1), Elements exist (2), Action taken (3), largely Developed (4) and Sustainable (5). 
 
The LEADS system is a matrix with components that correspond to the elements in the checklist 
by Holvoet and Renard, 2005; Holvoet and Inberg, 2011; Holvoet et al. 2012 , namely: i) policy, 
ii) methodology, iii) organisation, iv) capacity, v) participation of actors outside government, and 
vi) use of information from M&E. See appendix K for a complete LEADS matrix with analytical 
details under each topic. 
 
In this research study, the two tools were used together. First, the diagnostic checklist was fully 
administered to all respondents, which included a review of documentation. All the responses 
under each component in the checklist were compiled in readiness for discussion and analysis. 
This included all findings from the review of secondary data sources and information from key 
informants and from FGDs. Second, the LEADS system was used to assess the findings by scoring. 
This was done in accordance with the responses obtained under each topic for the six components. 
Although the scoring exercise was relatively subjective, resulting from the triangulated qualitative 
data and information from the field, value addition to the data was realised. This helped to enrich 
the discussion and analysis of the findings. 
 
When all the questions had been answered and the scoring done, the discussion and analysis of the 
findings w ere undertaken. This involved the identification of aspects of good and poor 
performance in the WoGM&ES for the Zambian public sector. For instance, the research results 
from the LEADS system were tabulated to show which M&E component was well developed 
against those poorly developed. Both aspects of the findings became important in suggesting ways 
of improvement by informing which best practices needed to be replicated, scaled up and
<<<PAGE=174>>>
155 
 
sustained. In addition, the study employed qualitative data -analysis stra tegies such as Nvivo 
software package and text analysis to analyse and interpret the data from the field in an effort to 
understand the dynamics within the data. NVivo, a Q ualitative Data Analysis (QDA) computer 
software package produced by QSR Internation al, significantly improves the quality of research 
through its usability to collate and analyse qualitative data and information (Hilal  & Alabri, 2013).  
 
6.10.2 Ways to ensure validity and reliability  
To ensure that all the research processes – namely preparation, design, data collection, collation, 
analysis, interpretation and presentation of findings maintained high levels of credibility and 
reliability, the scientific process was adhered to throughout the study. Internal validity 16 and to 
some extent external validity17 issues were taken into account by ensuring that the research results 
were recommended for use only in the institutions from which the sampled respondents were 
drawn. This meant using credible data collection instruments and utilising appr opriate 
scientifically proven analytical techniques and overall process. 
 
6.10.3 Plans for pilot studies or testing of data-gathering instruments  
The nature of this study did not warrant pre -testing of data -gathering instruments because the 
instruments we re pre -designed with categories and questions. The diagnostic checklist was 
developed in 2005 and its proponents had administered it elsewhere with success.18  
 
6.11 Ethical considerations   
 
Because the study was conducted on a wide scope from various inst itutions and involved many 
respondents, formal ethnical clearance was obtained by the candidate from the University of South 
Africa (see appendix G). During engagement with the study units and subjects, there were issues 
of concern about confidentiality with regard to the functionalities of several institutions. To ensure 
                                                 
16 Internal validity refers to how well an experiment is done, especially whether it avoids confounding (more than one 
possible independent variable [cause] acting at the same time). The less chance for confounding in a study, the higher 
its internal validity is. 
17 External validity refers to how well data and theories from one setting apply to another.  
18 Since 2005, the diagnostic checklist had been used to analyse the government M&E systems for 13 sub -Saharan 
countries, including Uganda, Rwanda, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Ghana.
<<<PAGE=175>>>
156 
 
that the entire research process was conducted in a scientifically acceptable environment, ethical 
consent documentations were prepared and given to the research subjects and entities that required 
them. However, few ethical issues were raised during the research. 
 
The candidate is a professional M&E practitioner, who for the  most of the period during this 
research study was employed by the Government of the Republic of Zambia .  While working at 
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and later at Ministry of National Development Planning (MNDP), 
the candidate was under the Monitoring and Evaluation Department , whose principal 
responsibility was to coordinate  the M&E function at national level. It was  important that this 
position was not  abused in securing cooperation for personal academic research. Thus, prior to 
conducting the research, letters of permission were sent to the respondents and confidentiality was 
sought and assured. In all the communica tions, it was made clear that the research was not done 
on behalf of government, but for personal academic purposes. A letter signed by the permanent 
secretary in the MNDP was secured to give permission for the research exercise in all government 
and non-state institutions (see details of the letter in appendix J ). For other consent letters, see 
appendices H and I. If respondents decided not to take part in the research study, their choices 
were respected. To uphold high levels of confidentiality, names of respondents were not used in 
the data.   
 
6.12 Limitations of the study  
 
This study was undertaken using two approaches of data collection, namely desk -based research 
and field-based research. Given the nature and methodology of the study, few limitations  were 
encountered during the investigations. At most, challenges had to do with limited access to and 
availability of information from units of analysis. Further, since the research data were collected 
from multiple sources at national, sector/line ministr y, provincial and district level, there were 
difficulties with access to information that required confidentiality clearance. These expected 
limitations, however, were resolved by various means. Triangulation of data sources was used to 
minimise information gaps in the research study (see section 6.5.2 for details on triangulation). To 
that extent, the use of primary and secondary data sources increased the credibility of the research 
findings, analyses and recommendations.
<<<PAGE=176>>>
157 
 
Limitations included irregular communication between the candidate, who is based in Zambia, and 
the supervisor, who is based in South Africa. However, this limitation was resolved through 
communication channels such as email, university interaction forums, telephone and Skype. 
Whenever necessary, the candidate travelled to South Africa (Unisa) to meet the supervisor to 
clarify aspects of the study. Additionally, financial constraints to facilitate the travels of the 
candidate to provinces and districts to collect data were experienced.  However, information was 
obtained from the same sources by other methods through a process of triangulation ( that is, use 
of multiple research methods and techniques). 
 
6.13 Conclusion   
 
Chapter 6 discussed the research design and methodology for this st udy. The focus was on the 
choice of and justification for the research topic. The qualitative approach was adopted as the 
method of undertaking the investigation. The sources of data were identified as primary and 
secondary. Primary sources included inform ation from respondents through FGDs and in -depth 
interviews using intervi ew schedules . Under the secondary sources, information was collected 
from books, reports, articles and other literature references. Further, Chapter 6 described the target 
population for the research and study units. The sampling design was also discussed. This was 
followed by a description of the instruments for data collection. The chapter has presented the 
diagnostic checklist used to collect research information under its six thematic elements, namely: 
i) policy, ii) methodology, iii) organisation, iv) capacity, v) participation of actors outside 
government, and vi) use of information from M&E . For analysis, the chapter also presented the 
LEADS scoring system , an instrument of resea rch data and information  synthesis with its five -
point scores— Little action (1), Elements exist (2), Action taken (3), largely Developed (4) and 
Sustainable (5). Thus, both the checklist and LEADS scoring system where discussed as the main 
tools employed to guide this qualitative based research study. Before the ethical considerations, 
the chapter discussed the methods used to interpret the data from the field. The limitations 
experienced in the entire study were also presented. Chapter 7 presents the research findings, after 
which a discussion and analysis are done.

CHAPTER 7 
 
Diagnosis of Zambia’s Whole-of-Government Monitoring and 
Evaluation System 
 
7.1 Introduction    
 
Chapter 7 presents the findings of the study, which was an in -depth diagnostic exercise about the 
functionality of Zambia’s Whole-of-Government Monitoring and Evaluation System 
(WoGM&ES). Further, it discusses the results by adding analytical value to the findings with a 
view to articulate and offer broad-based alternatives to the building and strengthening of Zambia’s 
public sector WoGM&ES. 
 
The chapter comprises four parts. The first is the introduction. The second part provides a summary 
of the research findings according to the LEADS scoring system. It gives a quantitative 
presentation of the results and the scores are displayed according to the six dimensions of the 
diagnostic checklist. The third section presents a comprehensive discussion and analysis of the 
study findings. Details of the strengths and weaknesses of Zambia’s WoGM&E S as found in the 
study are discussed. The discussion and analysis of what works, what does not work , and the 
reasons are then used to inform suggestions and recommendations for improvements of Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES. The conclusion highlights major aspects and issues covered in the chapter.        
 
7.2 Summary presentation of research findings   
 
In this research study, the main objective was to assess the functionality of Zambia’s WoGM&ES 
by tracking what works, what does not, and why. This was done to produce feasible suggestions 
for improvement and further learning. Data were collected from reviews of secondary data sources 
and primary data sources.  
 
The presentation of findings and analysis follows the six components of the adopted diagnostic 
checklist. The five-point LEADS system of scoring was used as a quantitative way of making the
<<<PAGE=178>>>
159 
 
results analysis and discussion clearer. The LEADS scoring system has five -point categories: L 
(Little action: 1), E ( Elements exist: 2), A ( Action taken: 3), D (largely Developed: 4), and S 
(Sustainable: 5). The diagnostic checklist and the LEADS scoring system were used conjointly. 
Therefore, the assessment tool comprised six components, 34 sub-components and 385 questions 
for guiding the assessment of an M&E system for a government (see Appendix F). These questions 
are then regrouped under the six headings. Using the questions from the diagnostic checklist, data 
collection was done using semi -structured interviews through self -administered (survey) 
questionnaires, FGDs and key informants. Rigorous document review was also used.   
 
Table 7.1 presents the results of the assessment of Zambia’s WoGM&ES to illustrate the status of 
the M&E system. It gives a summary of the Zambian public sector M&E system as diagnosed in 
the study. Although the study used the qualitative approach, this quantitative scoring system was 
employed to provide substance analysis and arrive at areas of improvement for the system.

The level of implementation status for the components of Zambia’s WoGM&ES varies across the criteria 
(see Table 7.2). Although the results in Table 7.1 show variances across the 34 sub -components, it is 
interesting to observe how the overall picture varies from ‘ little action taken’  to ‘ elements exist’  and 
ultimately to ‘action taken’. None of the dimensions scored ‘largely developed’ (4) or ‘sustainable’ (5).

Overall, the diagnostic results indicate that the methodology component of Zambia’s WoGM&ES 
is comparatively more developed with a score of 2.9 (ro unded to 3) out of a possible total of 5, 
while the least developed component is the use of information from M&E outputs at 1.4 (rounded 
to 1). The organisation dimension (structure and linkages combined) had a score of 1.9, which was 
closer to those for capacity and participation of actors outside government (both have a score of 
                                                 
19 For ease of scoring and comparability, the scores have been rounded up to the nearest whole number. For 
example, the 2.2 score for the policy dimension is 2.0, the methodology dimension becomes 3.0, and so on.

2). The policy dimension scored  2.2. Although it was compiled holistically, the results reveal 
important dynamics. For the methodology component, five sub -topics scored 3 points ( that is,  
quality of indicators, disaggregation, selection criteria, causality chain and methodologies), 
signifying that important M&E actions had been taken in this dimension across the WoGM&ES. 
The data collection sub -component scored the highest (4  points), meaning it was the most 
developed under the methodology dimension, while the selection of indicators and priority setting 
sub-components scored 2 points, meaning that only elements of M&E existed for those aspects of 
the methodology dimension.  
 
The next relatively well developed component was policy (with 2.2 score), but a closer look at the 
intra sub-component dynamics gave notable aspects of analytical interest. For example, while the 
topic on feedback has a score of 3 points (action taken), the rest  of the sub -components (M&E 
plan, M&E, autonomy and impartiality, and alignment with planning and budgeting) scored 2 
points each. This may mean that although the policy component seems to be fairly or well  
developed at a 2.2-point score, Zambia’s WoGM&ES fared poorly in its accountability function. 
This is also true of the sub -dimensions of alignment of M&E with planning and budgeting 
processes (a 2-point score).  
 
All three actors, namely parliament, civil society and donors , had a 2 -point score each  for the 
component of participation of actors outside government (with overall score of 2  points). This 
signifies that only elements of M&E existed in these development actors and ultimately could 
mean that their participation and contribution to matters relate d to the WoGM&ES were weaker. 
The capacity dimension also had an overall 2-point score (that is, only M&E elements existed). It 
is worrisome to note that all three sub-components under this dimension (that is, present capacity, 
problems acknowledged and capacity building plan) possessed only elements of M&E and none 
was largely developed (4) or sustainable (5).  The second lowest scoring component was the 
organisation dimension (combining structure and linkages) with an aggregated score of 1.9. 
Organisational linkages scored better, with an average 2 -point score , than the organisational 
structure, with an average score of 1.6.

For the component of use of information from M&E outputs, the diagnostic results show that while 
M&E outputs may be available, their  access and utilisation for management functions remain 
challenging across government structures and institutions outside government. Thus, the effective 
use of M&E outputs at local or decentralised levels scored a dismal 1 point (little M&E action was 
taken). Similarly, the effective use of M&E outputs by actors outside government scored 1 point, 
while the use of M&E at central level had a 2 -point score. Again, these low scores suggest that 
currently the WoGM&ES did not inspire the demand for and utilisati on of M&E information for 
decision- and policy-making processes by key stakeholders in the country.  
 
In all, the presentation of these results opened up a number of discussion points. The positive 
aspects and the gaps would both stimulate opportunities to  identify and strengthen aspects of 
Zambia’s WoGM&ES. Taking time to consider these aspects in the assessment would generate 
critical action points. Section 7.3 attempts to address this concern in a more coherent and 
consistent, yet analytically in-depth way.

The study findings are presented under the 34 sub -dimensions of the six major 
dimensions.  
 
7.3.1 Policy  
According to the diagnostic checklist by Holvoet and Inberg (2011), five sub -components are 
considered when assessing the quality of a country’s M&E system from a policy perspective.
<<<PAGE=183>>>
164 
 
These elements involved checking the existence of an M&E plan, checking whether the difference 
between ‘monitoring’ (M) and ‘evaluation’ (E) was acknowledged and articu lated, and assessing 
whether autonomy and impartiality were prioritised. The diagnosis also assessed the feedback 
mechanisms and checked whether M&E was aligned with planning and budgeting processes.  
 
Sub-dimension 1: Monitoring and evaluation plan  
The total score for this sub-dimension was 2.0, signifying that only elements existed regarding the 
M&E plan for Zambia’s WoGM&ES. The “existence of acceptable national planning, budgeting 
and M&E systems, or at least observable improvements in such systems, an d trust in a recipient 
country’s policy priorities is in principle necessary for the effective and successful move towards 
a shift from don or control to recipient control” (Holvoet & Renard, 2005:7).  Thus, it was 
established that Zambia had a number of doc uments that articulated M&E issues. The National 
Planning and Budgeting Policy of 2014 provided high -level guidance for M&E practice and 
implementation for the public sector. However, the policy did not offer clear and holistic guidance 
on M&E implementati on across government. There was also a draft national performance 
framework (NPF), which articulated strategic objectives and outcomes that were significant in 
realising Vision 2030. NPF is the framework that clarifies the theory of change (ToC), illustrating 
how the implementation of NDPs and the measurement of progress were envisaged to happen. In 
supporting such an effort, Mackay (2007) argued that many governments have realised that 
without a structured results orientation in the manner governments did their business, not much 
development could be achieved. Hence the focus was on development of national performance 
frameworks. In that regard, the NPF could map key result areas and outcomes that are cascaded 
downwards at sector level with KPIs, baseline v alues and targets to guide the implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of programmes (GRZ, 2015). There were also line ministry strategic 
plans that articulated M&E activities at that level (GRZ, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2014 & 2017). 
However, some line ministries, provinces and districts had not developed their strategic plans.  
 
It was acknowledged that a whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation system (WoGM&ES) 
was in place. Nevertheless, the system was not unified. There was no common definition and 
understanding of the WoGM&ES across the public sector  institutions consulted. Zambia has a 
national long-term vision (NLTV), namely Vision 2030, which expresses citizens’ aspirations of
<<<PAGE=184>>>
165 
 
becoming a prosperous middle-income country by 2030. The NLTV is the basis on which all plans 
and budgets should be anchored.  Zambia also has a national development plan (NDP), which a 
five-year medium-term plan is derived from the NLTV aimed at helping to achieve the vision. An 
NDP is a detailed policy strategy from which moni toring and evaluation (M&E) is derived.  
Currently, Zambia is implementing the 7NDP (2017 –2021), which has defined development 
outcomes, strategies, programmes and objectives to be achieved by 2021. Unfortunately, 
government had not defined strategies and objectives to be achieved at province and district level 
by the end of the plan.  
 
Many M&E systems across government were fragmented. Only draft national M&E policy, 
performance frameworks and automated monitoring and evaluation information management 
systems (M&E-MISs) have been formulated so far. Currently there is a mechanism that facilitates 
the tracking of delivery of public services and assessment of impact and appropriateness of policies 
and programmes. However, the system is not effective because of  the lack of management 
information systems (MISs) in institutions that were mandated to provide data and information. 
Therefore, overall, Zambia has an M&E plan in place, but it is not comprehensive enough to state 
what to evaluate, how, and for whom. For instance, no document explicitly indicated the prioritised 
interventions for evaluations (that is, no evaluation plan was in place). However, the M&E plan 
was clear about the reasons for evaluation ( that is,  to enhance accountability, feedback and 
learning) (GRZ, 2010, 2017).  
 
Sub-dimension 2: Monitoring versus evaluation  
The notions of ‘monitoring’ and ‘evaluation’ were acknowledged and differentiated only to some 
extent in all government documents. As a result, a score of 2.0 was given , denoting that o nly 
elements existed. A section in 7NDP was dedicated to defining and describing the meaning of each 
concept (GRZ, 2017). In addition, the two functions were not understood to be different in the 
7NDP, they were also acknowledged as being complementary (GR Z, 2014, 2015 , 2017). While 
this was clear in the NDP, understanding of the differences between the notions at levels such as 
line ministry, province and district was found to be weak. At those levels, there was a tendency to 
put them together as though they were synonymous. Further, there was a great deal of effort at all
<<<PAGE=185>>>
166 
 
levels to describe in detail monitoring tasks to be undertaken as opposed to those concerning 
evaluation.  
 
Policy framework(s) in institutions across the WoGM&ES made M&E of institutiona l plans and 
programmes mandatory. But there was no framework to ensure data quality and relevance. Nor 
were there formal structures to facilitate the use of performance information for programme 
management and evidence-based decision making.  
 
As a consequence, units, section and departments in charge of M&E based their measurement and 
achievement of objectives and goals on performance indicators (KPIs), though in some cases these 
were weak or non-existent. In addition, evaluations were ad hoc and rarely undertaken. Likewise, 
all MPSAs acknowledged that none had an official public (legal framework) document that 
established the evaluation guidelines with methodologies and technical standards to guide 
institutional plan evaluations. Project and programme eval uations were rarely conducted across 
MPSAs, a factor which caused institutions to score poorly in evaluative practice and culture.  
 
Sub-dimension 3: Autonomy and impartiality  
A score of 2.0 was given to this sub-section, entailing that elements of autonomy and impartiality 
existed in the WoGM&ES for Zambia. An assessment was make of whether the need for M&E 
autonomy and impartiality was mentioned explicitly and whether the M&E plan allowed for tough 
issues to be analysed and reported. Additionally, the assessment investigated whether there was an 
independent budget or fund allocation for M&E. It was found that the need for autonomy and 
impartiality of M&E was not mentioned explicitly. In all four NDPs that were reviewed (FNDP, 
SNDP, R-SNDP and 7NDP), autonomy and impartiality of M&E were not mentioned categorically 
or acknowledged as being important for a successful WoGM&ES or for good governance (GRZ, 
2006, 2011, 2013, 2017). The annual progress reports (APRs) did not mention the need for M&E 
functions to be treated with autonomy and impartiality. In all documents and interviews, M&E 
functions were described as being undertaken by ordinary departments, units and sections within 
government structures without any demand for autonomy and impartiality. Perhaps,  the only 
element of autonomy and impartiality that was mentioned in some NDPs and APRs was the need 
for ‘evaluation exercises or processes’ to be led by external consultants or experts – not necessarily
<<<PAGE=186>>>
167 
 
establishing formal external evaluation structures ( GRZ, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016 & 2017).  In 
addition, organisational or structural issues of M&E were not covered prominently in the 
documents. No mention was made of the need to locate the function of monitoring and that of 
evaluation in one place or in different locations.  
 
With regard to the analysis and reporting of tough issues arising from the implementation of 
development interventions, there was no mention of what needed to be done. As a result of weak 
analyses in APRs for instance, details to inform practical correctional actions were lacking. In the 
documents, there was sporadic attention to budgets that were meant to finance M&E functions and 
particular activities. There were no independent and predictable budgets across public institutions 
for M&E activities. Evidence of budget cuts and non -release of funds for M&E-related activities 
in most institutions was repeated. Whenever institutional budget cuts were done, budget lines for 
M&E activities suffered most – signifying that less importance and priority were attached to M&E. 
Except for a few line ministries (National Development Planning, Health, Education, Agriculture, 
Fisheries and Livestock), the budget allocations for supporting M&E activities in most public 
institutions were reported to be small and fragmented. More so, even in those few institutions with 
small budgets for M&E, allocations seemed to be focused only on limited monitoring activities 
and almost nothing for evaluation undertakings (GRZ, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 & 
2017).  
 
Sub-dimension 4: Feedback  
The assessment score of 3.0  was given, implying that action was taken pertaining to feedback 
loops. Feedback mechanisms constituted another element that was assessed. Here it was interesting 
to check whether there was an explicit and consistent approach to reporting, dissemination, and 
integration. The Zambian policy environment and M&E plans and frameworks had mixed 
positions on approaches to reporting, dissemination and integration of M&E (in all four NDPs  – 
fifth, sixth, revised sixth and seventh). The APR, based on the reporting performance of the NDP 
was the main feedback M&E output for the WoGM&ES. Once produced, it was disseminated to 
stakeholders, particularly government institutions, for possible use in organisational development 
processes. Dissemination of NDPs and APRs was done through meetings, workshops and the 
ministerial website (GRZ, 2006, 2011, 2013 & 2017) and occasionally through newspapers, radio
<<<PAGE=187>>>
168 
 
and television. Ministry of Finance (MOF) indicated that budget information was available to the 
public through the Internet by the time that budget proposals were presented to parliament. MOF 
also posted this information on its website for the public. 
 
However, although dissemination to stakeholders and integration of M&E  results into decision -
making processes were mentioned, no details were given on how this was done (GRZ, 2006, 2007, 
2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 & 2017). Quarterly and annual reports were available from MPSAs, 
but dissemination to stakeholders was said to be limited. Further, data dissemination was reported 
to be done through media briefings, posters, reports and postings on the institutional (CSO) 
website. Other disseminations were done at stakeholders’ request. Some products were 
disseminated to MPSAs an d to other non -state actors such as universities and parliament. 
Nonetheless, it was acknowledged that these platforms catered only for urban-based stakeholders, 
while those in rural set-ups had no easy access.  
 
Sub-dimension 5: Alignment to planning and budgeting 
 A total score of 2.0 was given  for this sub -dimension. It means that only some elements of 
alignment to planning and budgeting existed. The integration of M&E products into the processes 
of planning and budgeting was found to be mixed. Some M&E integration was traced or mentioned 
in the process of designing NDPs. For example, APRs, evaluations and reviews were used to 
inform the formulation of the SNDP and 7NDP. But this evidence seemed to end only at the 
planning stage – and not the decision-making level. 
 
However, the most significant problem was with the budgeting. Although there was mention of 
attempting to use the NDPs to inform budgeting, evidence was weak or missing altogether. In 
some cases, budgeted and funded programmes and projects were not contained in the NDPs or line 
ministry budgets (GRZ, 2013, 2014 & 2016). APRs showed that most fund releases from NDPs in 
the budgets were unreleased by MOF. There was no evidence of integration of M&E information 
into the resource allocation. MOF rarely or never used M&E feedback to determine fund allocation 
and release, if so, the link was weak (GRZ, 2014 & 2016). Further, MPSAs were required to 
present M&E information in support of their budget and medium -term expenditure framework 
(MTEF) submissions – but to a lesser extent and it was characterised by a weak management
<<<PAGE=188>>>
169 
 
structure. Every year, MPSAs were asked to submit a policy brief for their previous budget’s 
expenditure performance to MOF. In those briefs, institutions presented their budget performance 
reports with some semblance of M&E information.  
 
Nevertheless, there was no strong evidence of integrating M&E information, for instance in 
informing critical decisions across government processes, such as budgeting and resource 
allocation by MOF. With regard to whether programme/project output information was used in 
decision making across government structures, a number of MPSAs acknowledged that they did 
so, but did not give details of how this was done. At the same time, some institutions stated  that 
the use of output and outcome information in decision making was not regular, coherent or 
consistent. 
 
In addition, Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) were not implemented effectively 
for they were changed or adjusted annually, depending on resource availability. Further, budgetary 
decisions were carried out without necessarily taking into account the results produced by the 
performance indicator -system of the NDP(s). Budget decisions were driven by the resource 
availability in a given year an d based on the guidance of cabinet. No incentives were in place to 
encourage the demand for M&E information by MOF from agencies to accompany their budgetary 
requests or support. MPSAs were not obligated to present their M&E information in support of 
their budgets and MTEF submissions. It was reported that there was no such requirement by MOF. 
The biggest challenge was that most (if not all) MPSAs lacked robust M&E systems to deliver this 
kind of information. There was also a lack of M&E champions in MPSAs to demand M&E results 
to inform planning and budgeting decisions and processes. Lack of incentives was said to have led 
to delays in institutionalising M&E in most MPSAs. Only to a certain extent was it acknowledged 
that MOF engaged line ministries and other MPSAs in dialogue on their policy choices, based on 
performance information. This was done through the policy and budget hearings at which MPSAs 
were invited to dialogue with the treasury on their proposed policies. This gave MPSAs an 
opportunity to jus tify, and seek clarity on their proposed policy priorities. In addition, it was 
reported that, despite such efforts, this did not influence significant policy choices, as did the 
availability of resources in the treasury.
<<<PAGE=189>>>
170 
 
For the limited engagements by th e MOF with MPSAs, it was confirmed that the nature of 
information required when submitting budget proposals included retrospective and prospective 
information on ministry spending; information on ministry outputs; and to a limited extent on 
outcomes and impacts. Also, infrequently information on results of formal evaluations and reviews 
was requested. It was gathered that these engagements were never results or performance based. 
No evidence existed of linking performance information of MPSAs and policy hearings by MOF. 
It was not even clear if MOF had a results approach in the implementation of the short - and 
medium-term financing frameworks. The MNDP was mandated to coordinate national 
development planning and it was reported to demand various types of inf ormation from MPSAs. 
Such information included prospective and retrospective information on ministry spending; 
information on ministry outputs; information on institutional outcomes and impacts; and on results 
of formal evaluations and reviews, though in m any cases outcome and impact level information 
was missing.  
 
7.3.2 Methodology  
In reviewing the quality of the M&E methodology, eight topics or sub -components were 
considered in the diagnostic checklist (Holvoet & Inberg, 2011). Focus was on the selectio n of 
indicators, quality of indicators, indicator disaggregation, selection criteria and priority setting. 
Others included assessing the linkages among the indicators and data sources and the degree to 
which indicators formulated at different levels (input -activity-output-outcome-impact) were 
integrated into one causality chain. Finally, specific M&E methodologies and data collection 
sources were reviewed. 
 
Sub-dimension 6: Selection of indicators  
A score of 2.0 was given to this sub-dimension, entailing that elements existed for the selection of 
indicators. In the NDPs and APRs, what to monitor was clear from programmes that used 
stipulated performance indicators. However, what to evaluate was clear only from the indicator 
information level, and which prog rammes and projects were earmarked for evaluation was not 
indicated in the NDPs or other plans. At national level, a list of indicators was available and it was 
reported that these indicators were not easily changed yearly. Those national-level indicators were
<<<PAGE=190>>>
171 
 
said to be embedded in NDPs. However, at line ministry, provincial and district level, the 
availability of indicators was fragmented. In some cases, performance indicators were missing 
altogether. Further, changes in indicators were reported to arise at times owing to continuous data 
unavailability. R-SNDP and 7NDP contained clearly selected and prioritised indicators in their 
implementation plans (IPs), especially for output level indicators. KPIs were reported to have been 
agreed upon by stakeholders and documented in NDPs. 
 
IPs (usually referred to as volume II of NDPs) are documented indicators that cut across all 
development spheres of focus in the NDP. Lists of indicators in the 7NDP IP were on KPI, outcome 
and output level. These were generated f rom programmes and projects. The unapproved draft 
national performance framework (NPF) also had listed KPIs linking NDP level indicators with 
Vision 2030 strategic objectives. 
 
Sub-dimension 7: Quality of indicators  
A score of 3.0 was given  for the quality of indicators sub -dimension, denoting that action was 
taken. In addition, there was a weakness with sector -level indicators. Several line ministries did 
not have clear lists of indicators, making it difficult to determine what to monitor and evaluate. 
Equally, there were no clear lists of performance indicators at provincial and district level. 
Apparently these were still under development by stakeholders in provinces and districts. Because 
of the weak indicator system at line ministry level, indicator ha rmonisation with NDP level 
indicators seemed problematic. Sector Performance Frameworks ( SPFs) were still being 
developed in a few line ministries (most of them did not have performance frameworks).  Until 
these are well  developed, harmonisation of indicato rs between those in sectors and NDPs will 
remain a challenge. Thus, the harmonisation of indicators between those in sectors, provinces, 
districts and NDPs was weak and, in some cases, non -existent. However, efforts were there to 
strengthen or bridge this gap through encouraging sectors to participate in selecting indicators in 
NDPs and maintaining some at sector level. Nevertheless, at provincial and district level , 
apparently no indicators existed. Hence, linking development progress and performance with the 
NDPs at those levels was reported to be a challenge.
<<<PAGE=191>>>
172 
 
In terms of performance indicators, most of them were SMART, that is specific, measurable, 
achievable, realistic and time bound. To a large extent, indicators in the NDPs were developed in 
a SMART way. Those in the IPs of R-SNDP and 7NDP were SMART to some extent. However, 
some indicators were pitched too low at process (activity) level instead of being pitched to measure 
high-level development results at outcome and impact. In addition, the availab ility of baseline 
information for most indicators in the NDPs was mixed. In most cases, baselines and targets were 
attached and fairly well articulated, but unfortunately for other indicators no such information was 
included. In the 7NDP for instance, some indicators did not have baselines, making it difficult to 
measure NDP progress over time (GRZ, 2017). Most indicators had meaningful baselines and 
targets. However, there were concerns about the realistic nature of some baseline and target 
information. In  some instances, there was too much under -targeting and in other cases over -
targeting. Weak indicator systems were found at line ministry level and this posed challenges in 
ascertaining whether all the indicators were SMART. Also, the lack of indicators at provincial and 
district level rendered the review and appreciation of whether the indicators were SMART 
difficult.  
 
Sub-dimension 8: Disaggregation  
A score of 3.0  was given , indicating that action was taken in indicator disaggregation. The 
assessment endeavoured to establish whether the indicators in the WoGM&ES were disaggregated 
by sex, region, socio-economic status, etc. Some indicators were found to be disaggregated by sex, 
region, socio-economic status and other categories of measurement. For instance, some indicators 
in NDPs (FNDP, SNDP, R -SNDP and 7NDP) were disaggregated by sex and region, and others 
by socio -economic status. Nonetheless, disaggregated data and information were problematic, 
despite the availability of disaggregated indicators. Als o those indicators in the NPF were 
disaggregated in a number of appropriate forms ( that is,  sex, region, socio -economic status). 
However, in the NDPs and NPF, some indicators were not appropriately disaggregated by sex, 
region and socio -economic status (GR Z, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016 & 2017). Specific 
provincial and district level indicators did not exist, yet they were key to measuring poverty 
reduction programmes and projects. Therefore, this mixed status of indicator disaggregation in the 
NDPs and oth er frameworks made performance measurement and the fuller appreciation of the 
impact of development interventions a challenge.
<<<PAGE=192>>>
173 
 
Sub-dimension 9: Selection criteria  
The selection criteria sub -dimension was given a score of 3.0, meaning action was taken. The 
diagnostic checklist involves assessing the selection criteria for indicators in the WoGM&ES. This 
aspect involved these questions: Are the criteria for the selection of indicators clear? And who 
selects the indicators? The criteria for indicator selecti on were said to be clear to some extent, 
while it was not fully clear who was involved in the selection process. Not all relevant data 
collectors and users were involved in the selection process of indicators at various levels. The 
criteria, however, were broadly understood to be participatory, inclusive and done at all levels of 
development results.  
 
In developing the IPs for the NDPs, mention was made in NDPs, interviews and FGDs that only 
ad hoc arrangements existed in terms of who was involved in the s election of indicators. Line 
ministries, research institutions, CSO, civil society, donors, academia, etc, were among the 
instrumental stakeholders in indicator selection for the NDPs (GRZ, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2017). 
Similarly, several consultations were undertaken in developing and selecting indicators in the NPF 
(GRZ, 2017). Further, the review established that the participation of non -state actors was only 
‘fair’ and not too clear. For instance, a few non -state actors, predominantly the UN system in 
Zambia, were involved in the indicator selection process for the 7NDP. The UN’s main interest 
was to ensure that 7NDP domesticated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by including 
indicators for tracking in the entire implementation process (GRZ, 2017). There was also mention 
among respondents that development partners (DPs) or donors who participated (especially the 
UN group) in the 7NDP process put too much emphasis on the adoption of SDG indicators and 
less demand on unique country -specific indicators. Fu rther, the lack of or weak participation of 
provincial and district level stakeholders in indicator selection remained a significant gap in 
Zambia’s WoGM&ES.  
 
Sub-dimension 10: Priority setting  
A total score of 2.0 was given for the priority setting sub-dimension, denoting that elements exist. 
Priority setting in the development and selection of indicators to be included in the WoGM&ES 
and NDPs was another critical aspect.  The key question was: Is the need acknowledged to set
<<<PAGE=193>>>
174 
 
priorities and limit the number of indicators to be monitored in Zambia’s WoGM&ES? These were 
partly acknowledged in the documents and in the interviews  and FGDs. However, the number of 
indicators in 7NDP for example was found to be too high, even when it was said to be a prioritised 
list (that is, 848 at output level, 144 at outcome level & 75 KPIs). It is unlikely that large numbers 
of indicators could be monitored by overstretched public systems. In most cases, however, it is not 
really clear whether all the indicators were effectiv ely monitored, and what was done with the 
monitoring information (McGranahan, Pizarro & Richard, 1985; World Bank, 2008; Manning, 
2009; Cabral, 2009). However, sector, provincial and district level indicator systems remained 
weak owing the lack of specific or disaggregated indicators at those levels. 
 
Sub-dimension 11: Causality chain  
For the causality chain sub-dimension, a score of 3.0 (action taken) was given. The existence of a 
clear causality chain in the methodology component of the WoGM&ES was assessed. This 
characteristic forms the basis on which ToC is anchored. A diagnosis was made to ascertain the 
levels of indicators (input -activity-output-outcome-impact) and how they were explicitly and 
logically linked (or not) horizontally and vertically using programme th eory (Holvoet & Renard, 
2005; Holvoet & Inberg, 2011). Thus, it was found that various levels of indicators were specified 
and linked to some extent, but not explicitly so. Succinctly, indicators in 7NDP were defined at 
three levels of the results chain, that is, output, outcome and impact, with prioritised KPIs. At the 
same time, sector/institutional indicators were specified at input and activity/process levels 
(though evidence was weak) with less attention at outcome and impact levels. In addition, the NPF 
promoted the setting of indicators following  the ToC, particularly the complete causality -chain. 
Thus, the linkages and harmonisation of indicators at various levels was not consistently and 
coherently presented (GRZ, 2015, 2016, 2017).  
 
However, at provincial and district level, no indicators existed (at least in the context of NDPs). In 
the 7NDP, the ToC was acknowledged as having informed the plan preparation process. However, 
there was a lack of details on the complete use of the entire causality chain.

Sub-dimension 12: Methodology  
The sub-dimension of the methodology was scored with a 3.0, representing that action was taken. 
Further, the checklist looked at methodologies to determine whether how to undertake monitoring 
exercises and evaluation processes was clear. Similarly, the identification of appropriate 
methodologies and determining how these methodologies were mutually integrated was important 
in the assessment. Clearly identified methodologies to use when undertaking monitoring and 
evaluation processes , were mentioned to some extent – although this remained mixed. It was 
acknowledged in 7NDP IP that appropriate methodologies needed to be devised at every level of 
the causality chain to collect data and information. For example, monitoring methodologies such 
as field visits, daily entries of data, meetings and reports were proposed as key for success. Others 
included administrative data collection tools for monitoring information and censuses, surveys and 
reviews for evaluation findings. Although various methodologies were mentioned, it was not clear 
whether there was a preference for qualitative or quantitative methods or, better still, mixed 
approaches. However, the challenge was with the integration of methodologies which was less 
emphasised, uncoordinated and mixed.  
 
Sub-dimension 13: Data collection  
A score of 4.0 was given to the data collection sub -dimension. This high score means that the 
aspect was largely developed. It was gathered from the documents and interviews that clearly 
identified sources of data were in place – in some cases with indicators linked to sources of data 
collection. Population -based surveys and day -to-day administrative data from MPSAs were 
identified as sources of data and information for measuring indicators i n the NDP and other 
institutional performance measurements.  The main sources of data for the WoGM&ES, among 
others, were administrative records, budgets, population censuses and household surveys. 
Administrative data was reported as the most used source be cause household surveys were 
expensive and conducted irregularly (GRZ, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017).  
 
Further, the assessment involved checking whether the WoGM&ES was able to supply quality 
data and analysis needed by users and to what extent the M&E framework could provide adequate 
resources and other capacities (finances, skills, etc.) for M&E processes. In addition, the diagnosis
<<<PAGE=195>>>
176 
 
assessed the frequency and periodicity of data collection on particular issues. The WoGM&ES 
was reported not to be fully able to supply the data and analysis needed by users. This was because 
the national system was not yet developed to those levels (it was still in its infancy). For instance, 
the system was not available in some MPSAs (no structures, staff, etc .) and Internet connectivity 
in some parts of Zambia was poor. Equally, the system was reported not to have the capacity to 
provide resources (finances, skills, equipment, etc.). More training was needed for M&E officers 
in MPSAs. There were still challenges of low staffing and weak institutional capacities, which the 
MNDP expected to be resolved once the National M&E Policy (NM&EP) was approved by 
cabinet. Also, there was currently too much dependence on DPs for financial and technical support. 
The periodicity of data collection on particular issues was conducted at different moments. For 
example, population censuses were held every ten years, various surveys were done every two, 
four and five years, while the consumer price index (CPI) , inflation and trade da ta were being 
conducted every month. As for the gross domestic product (GDP), it was collected and computed 
quarterly and annually.  
 
Other aspects of assessment involved checking the length of time between the reference period 
and the distribution and use  of the data and information. The focus was to ascertain whether this 
lag was too long, limiting the utilisation of the data for decision making and improvement. Further, 
checking whether processes and procedures in data compilation adhered to professional and ethical 
standards was of interest in the assessment. Research data revealed that the time lag between the 
reference period of data collection and its use was still quite long with some data, taking almost 
two years from its reference period to the publication time. However, inflation data were published 
within the month that they were produced. Although a time lag was experienced, there were efforts 
to improve, since time lags were usually due to delays by MPSAs to provide data. Further, 
processes and standards in data compilation adhered partially to professional and ethical standards. 
Often, internationally agreed recommendations and principles were used to compile and analyse 
data. In those efforts, CSO was reported to be responsible for enforcing th e standards. However, 
Part IV of the 1964 Census and Statistics Act, Chapter 425 (Chapter 127 in the 2016 amended 
constitution) of the Laws of Zambia was said to be weak and outdated on this aspect of providing 
enough powers to CSO to enforce adherence by actors to data standards. For that reason, it was 
reported to be under revision.
<<<PAGE=196>>>
177 
 
The methodological component included the assessment of the availability of arrangements within 
the WoG-M&E to track poverty-related expenditures. In that regard, government h ad systems in 
place to track poverty-related expenditures through the implementation of the integrated financial 
management and information system (IFMIS) through the MOF. To some extent, government 
institutions had additional forms of public expenditure tracking. The statistical institution (that is, 
CSO) had a unit that was responsible for tracking public expenditure -based information. Line 
ministries and other government agencies also had functions of tracking their own expenditure 
information quarterly and annually. Further, the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) was reported 
as being vital to monitoring, tracking and reporting public expenditures. 
 
The roles of central, sector, provincial and district level governments in monitoring and evaluation 
of decentralised services were also assessed. Focus was on the sorts of data that were collected by 
each actor at these levels. Administrative data was collected by MPSAs as they undertook their 
day-to-day activities. Population censuses and household surveys were mostly undertaken by the 
national statistical institution ( that is, CSO). However, some MPSAs were allowed to spearhead 
undertakings of surveys in collaboration with CSO. Further, the MNDP was reported as doing 
much of the consolidation and analysis ( though this function remained weak within the ministry 
of planning because of incapacities – financial, skills, staffing levels, etc.).  
 
A number of roles in M&E were played by the central, sector, provincial and district governments 
as well. Districts were reported as being responsible for monitoring development implementation 
at district level, and their reports were submitted to provincial level. Likewise, provinces 
consolidated district -level information and transmitted it to sectors and central govern ment 
agencies (Cabinet Office, MNDP, etc).  Similarly, line ministries compiled the information and 
sent it to central government, where it was aggregated to obtain a national picture and used by 
stakeholders. In short, sector, provincial and district gover nments undertook mostly monitoring 
exercises, while in a few cases evaluations and their findings or reports were fed into central 
government, which consolidated and used the results for decision making and to improve further 
evaluations although evidence of this was weak in the study . Each actor was collecting certain 
data. District and provincial officers collected mainly performance data (process indicator level 
information), while sector and national level actors collected indicator data at output, outcome and
<<<PAGE=197>>>
178 
 
impact level, mainly through surveys. In other ways, at sector and national level it was mostly 
administrative and survey data from lower structures, while at province and district levels mostly 
administrative data was collected. Lack of indicators  at provincial, district and to some extent 
sectors still present a practical challenge to data collection, disaggregation and integration at all 
levels.   
 
Data aggregation and analysis occurred at various levels – national, sector, provincial and district. 
MNDP and CSO mainly aggregated national level data in national reports ( for example APRs). 
Aggregation of data was done using statistical software. Some level of analysis was done in 
relation to the achievement of goals and objectives in the NDP and oth er national priorities.   
Methodological aspects included assessing whether there were multiple systems for monitoring 
and reporting at national, sector, provincial and district level and whether there were incentives to 
encourage or distort the data. The availability of data deficiencies or gaps was also assessed. There 
was acknowledgement that multiple systems for monitoring and reporting existed at various levels 
of government. Since the WoGM&ES was still in its embryonic stage, there were a number of 
parallel M&E systems with such actors as DPs and individual government agencies (sectors, 
provinces and districts). These parallel and fragmented stand-alone M&E arrangements were not 
always compatible with each other. Although this was the case, these system s did not conflict in 
other aspects (they complemented each other). In some instances, duplications and redundancies 
were reported. These were coupled with fragmented M&E and statistical arrangements, providing 
inadequate data and information to users. Further, the current M&E mechanisms were not effective 
owing to lack of management information systems (MISs) in the institutions that provided data 
and also irregular surveys for analysis of outcome and impact level performance.  Worse still, the 
data from th e WoGM&ES was apparently not available for the complete elaboration and 
monitoring of the NDP.  
 
There was no evidence of incentives being used to disperse data and M&E information across the 
WoGM&ES. Instead, linkages between the WoGM&ES and budgetary and  public expenditure 
management systems were weak or, worse, non -existent. At the most, budget performance was 
currently being analysed annually and of previous year’s performance informed the formulation 
of the subsequent budgets –though reported to be a weak link currently. Data generated from the
<<<PAGE=198>>>
179 
 
WoGM&ES was acknowledged as being deficient and gaps existed in many ways: i) MIS were 
non-existent in most government institutions, ii) data collection and compilation was not done 
regularly, and iii) lack of re sources to conduct some surveys regular ly. Information at KPI and 
impact levels w as available only after major and expensive surveys were undertaken by CSO.  
Further, the gaps were usually for outcome and impact level indicators, though even for outputs, 
data took more time to be mobilised by most data providers, which made national reporting 
challenging and delayed in many instances.  
 
Owing to differences in methodologies and approaches by agencies, data inconsistencies 
characterised the statistics in the country. However, CSO usually employed intensive training for 
data collectors, field spot checks, monitored field work, and assessed data during field work. There 
was acknowledgement that whenever discrepancies in data were found, investigations were 
effected. This was done through going back in the field or revisiting the definitions, using or 
consulting other staff or experts that had undertaken similar activities.  
 
7.3.3 Organisation  
The component of ‘organisation’ is categorised into ‘structure’ and ‘linkages’. The review focused 
on the institutional flow of information structurally and checked the existence of functional M&E 
linkages.  
 
a) Structure  
The average score of 1.6 was given to all the components contained under the organisation 
dimension. The importance of putting in place a well-institutionalised structure for M&E is based 
on providing credibility of information with a view to satisfying the needs of accountability, 
feedback loops and learning (Kanyamuna, 2013; Cummings, 2003). To assess the M&E structural 
arrangements, five topics were used, namely coordination and oversight, joint sector reviews, 
working groups, ownership, and incentives.
<<<PAGE=199>>>
180 
 
Sub-dimension 14: Coordination and oversight  
A score of 2.0 was given  for the coordination and overs ight sub -dimension, signifying that 
elements exist. Coordination and oversight make up one of the important functions assessed under 
the organisational structure sub -component of the checklist. Critical questions that guided the 
review were: Is there an ap propriate institutional structure for coordination, support, oversight, 
analyses of data and feedback at different levels? With which stakeholders? What is its location?  
 
As a coordination and oversight arrangement for the implementation of NDPs, Zambia h ad three 
major aspects: oversight structures (Parliament, Office of the Auditor General and House of 
Chiefs); policy, coordination and implementation agencies (Cabinet, Cabinet Office, MNDP, 
MOF, sectors, provinces & districts); and advisory or decision -making structures (National 
Development Coordinating Committee (NDCC), Committee of Permanent Secretaries, Cluster 
Advisory Groups (CAGs), Provincial Development Coordinating Committees (PDCCs), District 
Development Coordinating Committees (DDCCs), and Ward Development Committees (WDCs) 
(GRZ, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2017). MNDP provided the coordination oversight role for M&E.  This 
entailed encouraging compliance within the holistic government administration. To that extent, it 
was ascertained that the ministry was  active and had a division that was responsible for the 
coordination of the M&E function and provided guidelines and M&E training and backstopping 
to MPSAs. MNDP was a suitable choice in terms of location and leadership because it held the 
mandate to provide MPSAs with incentives to participate in the M&E system. It was in charge of 
national development planning and worked closely with MOF. MNDP played a pivotal role in the 
coordination of national development planning and implementation, which entailed tra cking 
progress and government performance to ensure achievement of planned outcomes. In fact, the 
MNDP comprised two divisions: Development Planning Division, and Monitoring and Evaluation 
Division, each headed by a permanent secretary (GRZ, 2015, 2017). I n addition, Cabinet Office 
had a custodian role for the national M&E system and was working in collaboration with MNDP. 
However, the role of Cabinet Office in the M&E function was reportedly not distinct as there were 
no apparent frameworks to guide MPSAs in undertaking policy reviews and evaluations. For 
instance, the National Performance Framework (NPF) was still in draft form, yet it was supposed 
to be the guideline for measuring general government performance by function and in line with 
the national objectives or goals articulated in the national vision (GRZ, 2015).
<<<PAGE=200>>>
181 
 
However, at line ministry level, M&E coordination arrangements were not clarified. The diagnosis 
found that only ad  hoc arrangements on undertaking M&E functions existed. Although M&E 
exercises were implied in the line ministerial mandates and structures, much was to be desired on 
the practical side. This scenario existed at decentralised levels at provincial, district and sub -
district. In most sectors, provinces and districts, there were weak or no M&E structures at all. Thus, 
M&E activities were neglected or downplayed at those levels of public service delivery points. 
Strategic plans for line ministries also indicated that M&E activities were merely ad hoc and poorly 
embedded in the planning structures of many sectors – independent structures were never in place. 
Consequently, even when there was a fairly strong apex structure ( that is, MNDP) to support the 
M&E function, a country-wide transformation of M&E remained far -fetched in Zambia with the 
current organisational gaps. This is because the WoGM&ES needed to be operational at all  
levels—vertically and horizontally. Currently, it was acknowledged that weak M&E structures and 
culture characterised line ministries, provinces and districts a cross Zambia’s WoGM&ES (GRZ, 
2016, 2017). 
 
Furthermore, as a coordination and oversight institution, MNDP did not have full staff 
establishment to effectively play the role of leadership and coordination of planning and M&E 
functions across the public sect or. For the ministry to play its role of design, coordination and 
implementation of the WoGM&ES, it was reported that it used mostly technical and financial 
assistance from DPs. This was done by facilitating the engagement of experts to undertake 
assignments and mobilising stakeholders to provide input into the process. In addition, MNDP 
mobilised financial resources necessary for the functioning of the M&E mechanism at national 
level. Weak M&E culture and structures characterised line ministries, provinces  and districts 
institutionally.  
 
It was acknowledged that there was political commitment to the national M&E system from 
government. For instance, Cabinet Office initiated the proposal to develop a government -wide 
performance management system as a platfo rm f or the whole of government  M&E system 
(WoGM&ES). The type of high level political support involved a policy statement from the 
presidency on commitment to establish robust M&E systems across MPSAs. Political commitment 
to the WoGM&ES in line ministries , provinces and districts was reported to be mixed. Some
<<<PAGE=201>>>
182 
 
sectors merely acknowledged having political commitment towards M&E without giving details, 
while others did not indicate whether such commitment existed. Others gave some explanation for 
their polit ical level institutional commitments to M&E. Some MPSAs were reported to have 
planned and provided budget allocations to establish their institutional M&E systems, which were 
meant to help interface with the WoGM&ES. Demand for M&E in MPSAs was reported to  have 
improved in the last few years after government increased the focus on M&E through the planning, 
budgeting and reporting processes, especially by the coordinating MNDP and the presidential 
quarterly reporting. In some MPSAs, one rarely heard top poli tical leadership referring to 
WoGM&ES and even M&E issues pertaining to the possible benefits. Equally, there was lack of 
appreciation by political leaders of M&E information as they pushed for development programmes 
in their institutions. If they did, one would expect the ‘results’ language and emphasis be made by 
top leaderships. This negative situation was found at all levels—national, line ministry, provincial 
and district. 
 
Another aspect was to assess whether champions were making the case for a common M&E system 
across government. It was reported that these champions were present, though to a limited extent. 
Officials from the MNDP, the apex institution coordinating the WoGM&ES, have been advocating 
for a robust and integrated system for M&E at all levels of government operation. Further, officials 
from Cabinet Office and MOF have reinforced the call for a stronger WoGM&ES for the public 
sector. These champions were currently advocating for the approval by cabinet of the draft national 
M&E policy, draft national performance framework, and the M&E G-wide MIS. They also support 
or provide backstopping to MPSAs in the development of M&E frameworks and systems to 
facilitate improved M&E functionality. Further, the champions were pushing for evidence -based 
decision and policy making and reporting on performance to the presidency. However, the M&E 
department at MNDP was under staffed, leading to reduced capacities to oversee M&E functions 
for the public sector.  
 
Further, despite the relatively positive feedback, another aspect revealed that while explicit support 
at high political levels in MPSAs existed, political leadership and champions kept on changing, 
making the case for M&E weaker in most MPSAs. Owing to low or, worse, non -political 
appreciation of M&E information, political leaderships continued to pursue development
<<<PAGE=202>>>
183 
 
initiatives that served only ‘political interests’, even when evidence showed otherwise. Either 
political leaders did not understand the importance of M&E or they simply did not have suppor t 
for evidence-based policy and decision making in their governance pursuits – possibly for their 
own political reasons. Therefore, many gaps in M&E technical know -how and utilisation of 
evidence-based data and information were reported across the WoGM&ES with weaker political 
championship and support for a strengthened system for M&E in the public sector, despite other 
leaders wanting to lead their institutions towards results -based management (RBM) and poverty 
reduction through functional arrangements. 
 
Sub-dimension 15: Joint sector reviews  
A score of 1.0 was given for the sub-dimension of joint sector reviews (JSRs), denoting little action 
taken. The assessment checked whether the JSRs covered accountability and learning needs for 
substance and systemic issues. In Zambia, JSRs also known as joint annual reviews (JARs) were 
reported to take place predominantly in the health and education sectors. In other sectors, JARs 
were rare or there were none at all. However, these JARs did not cover accountability and learning 
needs for substance and systemic issues. JSRs involved activities that were held collaboratively by 
key stakeholders in a sector or development cluster. The presence and functionality of these 
reviews were key to determining a successful M&E sy stem and the diagnostic checklist attaches 
great emphasis to them. There was no evidence of linkages with other M&E tools in sector M&E 
systems. In that regard, the existing JSRs would not promote the 2005 Paris Declaration M&E 
reform agenda (Kanyamuna, 2013).  
 
Sub-dimension 16: Sector working groups  
The sub -dimension of sector working groups scored 2.0 , meaning that elements existed. 
Committees and working groups to facilitate coordination among stakeholders across the 
WoGM&ES were in existence. The 7NDP had clearly defined coordination mechanisms to support 
the implementation of the plan. Cluster advisory groups (CAGs) were in place on the result areas 
of the 7NDP, which played the role of coordinating national planning, implementation and 
monitoring and evaluation (at least as defined). These working groups had been established to 
facilitate coordination among stakeholders across the WoGM&ES. CAGs were said to be
<<<PAGE=203>>>
184 
 
management structures embedded in sectors, provinces and districts to monitor and report on the 
plan performance. Also, the FNDP, SNDP and R-SNDP had referred to the presence and the role 
of sector advisory groups (SAGs). In the 7NDP, the SAGs were reformulated as CAGs. Although 
reformulated and restructured in composition and extended mandate, CAGs were meant to play a 
structured management function in overseeing the implementation of the NDPs. Other working 
groups included technical working groups (TWGs), National Development Coordinating 
Committee (NDCC), provincial development coordinating com mittees (PDCCs), district 
development coordinating committees (DDCCs) and ward development committees (WDCs). All 
these worked to support NDP coordination and implementation. 
 
The composition of stakeholders in these working groups was currently said to be stable, although 
there could be issues around their commitment and active participation. However, there was an 
important challenge concerning lack of appropriate political party representation and participation 
in the CAGs and other bodies. No clear menti on of interests and stakeholder relationships was 
given in the reviews. This caused a problem in implementing what was suggested and 
recommended in these groups, given that political power took centre stage in decision and policy 
making in Zambia. Thus, when political champions are outside these groups, it becomes an issue 
of great concern to the strengthening of M&E practice in the country. In addition, there was a 
requirement for further strengthening in terms of capacities (financial, human, technical, e tc.). 
Currently, the CAGs were reporting progress to the president quarterly, while the other bodies did 
not have fixed meetings and reporting schedules.  In terms of stakeholder representation at 
appropriate levels to reflect and ensure commitment to havin g a functional WoGM&ES, it was 
found that various stakeholders were represented at appropriate levels. For example, membership 
of the CAGs was at director and permanent secretary level and other technical staff from MPSAs 
and partner organisations. However , there was a lack of clearly defined functioning secretariats 
for the M&E function in the CAGs. The only secretariat in place played the role of 7NDP planning, 
implementation and to some extent monitoring. The role of secretariat in the CAGs was weak 
when it came to M&E function. Hard issues about M&E were unlikely to be even discussed (e.g. 
negative results about an ongoing or ended project). If any, they may have been treated as 
secondary to the business of CAGs – leading to a total lack of desired accountability, feedback and 
learning functions in the implementation of the NDPs.
<<<PAGE=204>>>
185 
 
Further, in the APRs, it was reported that only a few SAGs had been meeting consistently. In some 
cases, SAGs had not met since they were created (GRZ, 2007, 2008, 2009, 201 0, 2011, 2012, 
2013, 2014, 2015 &  2016). For those SAGs that did meet, little was mentioned about M &E 
issues/arrangements in the meetings. The CAGs were still being re -organised and nothing could 
be said as yet in terms of their operation and effectiveness vis -à-vis their monitoring activities. A 
further weakness was that currently , meetings were not organised in a way that supported 
coordination. The meetings were not supported by a fixed schedule for a quarter or a given year. 
There was an element of ad hoc management of the process. It was not predictable when the next 
meeting would take place and what issues would be discussed in the next set of CAG meetings. 
Similarly, no substantive and adequate information went to support elements of coordination in 
the WoGM&ES. There was no evidence of cluster coordination mechanisms in the form of clear 
information flow systems among stakeholders. In any case, CAG members reported that the central 
agency (MNDP) was doing some work that was supposed to have been undertaken  by CAG 
members in an attempt to promote broader participation and horizontal coordination and 
integration.  
 
Sub-dimension 17: Ownership 
The ownership sub -dimension was scored 2.0 to imply that elements exist ed. This structural 
organisation sub-component checks whether the demand for strengthening the WoGM&ES came 
from the entire public sector, sector ministries, a central ministry or from external actors. This 
aspect is concerned with ‘ownership’ issues of M&E functions and processes (Holvoet & Renard, 
2005; Holvoet & Inberg, 2011). Thus, the review established that the demand for strengthening 
the M&E system did not come from sector ministries (except in a few cases, such as the health and 
education sectors, where donor influence was predominant), but fro m a central ministry (MNDP 
and to some extent MOF). Some uncoordinated demands for M&E from cabinet, Cabinet Office 
and the presidency also existed. In the period of implementing the FNDP, SNDP and R-SNDP, the 
Department of Monitoring and Evaluation under the MOF was the apex institution that promoted 
M&E across government.  
 
As for the line ministries, although some sectors had internal demands for strengthened M&E 
functions, the majority depended on the ‘push’ from the MNDP. Activities initiated by the MNDP
<<<PAGE=205>>>
186 
 
to propel strengthened M&E function at national, sector, provincial and district level included the 
nomination of M&E focal point persons from across MPSAs, spearheading the development of a 
national M&E policy, articulation of the national and sector p erformance frameworks (NPF and 
SPFs), and the development of a web-based management monitoring system (MMS) (GRZ, 2014, 
2016, 2017).  
 
However, most of these efforts were donor supported and created a risk in sustainability of a 
culture and practice of M&E. In addition, the creation of the new ministry (MNDP) with a division 
mandated to coordinate M&E functions was another important effort at national le vel. However, 
these efforts are yet to manifest in positive M&E practices and growing culture in government and 
beyond. Thus, ownership of M&E systems remains a challenge in decentralised structures and 
across Zambia’s public sector.  
 
Sub-dimension 18: Incentives  
The score given to the incentives sub -dimension was 1.0 (that is, little action taken). Incentives 
form a fundamental success element in an M&E system, particularly in an organisational structure. 
According to Holvoet and Inberg (2011), it is crucial to review whether incentives existed (e.g. at 
central and local/decentralised level), and if they we re used to stimulate data collection and data 
use. 
 
The review of Zambia’s WoGM&ES showed that no incentives were available or used at central 
and decentralised levels to stimulate data collection and data use. The NDPs and sector strategic 
plans (SSPs) that were reviewed did not mention incentivising data collection and data utilisation 
at any level. The only reference was that data collection and utilisation would be done at all levels 
of government with no mention of possible incentives (GRZ, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 
2017). 
 
b) Linkages  
An average score of 2.2 was given for all the sub-dimensions under the linkages component. Thus, 
in terms of M&E organisational linkages, five key sub -dimensions of assessment included
<<<PAGE=206>>>
187 
 
checking the linkages of M&E with the national statistical office; and whether there were linkages 
between separate M&E functions at national, sector, provincial and district level. This entailed 
diagnosing the ‘horizontal’ integration, ‘vertical’ upward integration and the ‘vertical’ downward 
integration, and linkages with projects.  
 
Sub-dimension 19: Linkage with statistical office  
A score of 3.0 was given to the sub-dimension on linkage with statistical office, representing action 
taken. Zambia has a functioning national statistics institution, called the Central Statistical Office 
(CSO), which was formed to provide official statistics in the country. CSO had a mandate to 
produce official statistics for the country’s socio -economic development. Further, CSO is a 
structure or a department under the MNDP, which houses the Monitoring and Evaluation Division 
and Department of M&E. CSO was currently the platform where data producers coordinated their 
activities, common standards and principles and data -related issues. The location of th e M&E 
function and the statistical function under the same apex ministry (MNDP) was crucial because 
linkages of the two would be expected to be stronger. However, there was no national statistical 
master plan in place to provide overall statistical architecture in Zambia. CSO currently had a draft 
strategy, namely the National Strategy for the Develo pment of Statistics (NSDS) 2014 –201820. 
However, with regard to the consistence of the WoGM&ES with other plans and processes for the 
development of the statistical system, this was done only partially. This weakness was attributed 
to the NSDS, which was not fully implemented to provide holistic statistical support function to 
all stakeholders. Therefore, it was stressed that when the WoGM&ES and NSDS were developed 
and fully implemented, consistence with other plans and processes would be possible.  
 
Whether there were linkages between the WoGM&ES and the CSO, the assessment gathered that 
there were notable linkages between M&E units in government and the statistical office. However, 
the role of CSO  in the entire public sector M&E was not entirely clear. Partly, the diagnostic 
exercise found that the role of CSO in the WoGM&ES was that of standard setting. It was currently 
weak, but had to be done because CSO was m andated to produce official statistics. It was also 
                                                 
20 NSDS is a comprehensive strategy aimed at providing overall statistical guidelines and standards in Zambia. It is 
still in draft format but already reported as being partially implemented.
<<<PAGE=207>>>
188 
 
reported that CSO played a technical role in the WoGM&ES. Further, in some line ministries, the 
role of CSO in supporting M&E activities was reportedly clear. For example, in the agriculture, 
health, educ ation, labour and finance sectors , CSO undertook surveys and studies to support 
development programmes. However, in some sectors, the role of CSO in supporting M&E 
functions remained unclear. This also applied to other decentralised structures such as prov inces 
and districts. At provincial and districts level, CSO had a presence in terms of offices but there 
was weak evidence of using CSO information in development -related decision making and 
processes at those levels. No clear evidence was found, particula rly for planning, budgeting and 
implementation (GRZ, 2011, 2013, 2017). There were overlaps between the WoGM&ES and 
CSO. The WoGM&ES collected data and administered it within the system without following the 
fundamental standards of providing official stat istics and information. Further, there was no 
holistic understanding of the way in which the two needed to complement each other. No 
harmonisation and collaboration strategy was in place to guide how the work by CSO would 
systematically inform the WoGM&ES.  
 
In addition, it was acknowledged  that there were potential rivalries and conflicts between the 
WoGM&ES and CSO. As stated, the M&E system generated and consumed statistics solely from 
administrative processes without statistical standards. Integration o f the WoGM&ES and the 
national statistical system (NSS) it was reported that it was weak or non-existent. This was mostly 
alluded to the newness of the WoGM&ES. There was also mention that CSO faced financial, 
technical and skills challenges and hence unab le to supply all the required statistics to the 
WoGM&ES. Thus, the integration between the two systems could be described as partial. Further, 
modern technologies of handling massive statistics remained a challenge for CSO. As a result of 
capacity problems, government funded most of the statistical activities with considerable support 
from DPs on selected statistical activities.  
 
It was also reported that government had a legal and operational framework for its statistical 
activities. The 1964 Census and S tatistics Act, Chapter 127 of the Laws of Zambia was in place 
despite being acknowledged as weak and outdated. This legislation gave powers to the creation 
and functionality of CSO. Mention was also made of a number of suggested frameworks to 
strengthen legal provisions for statistics. Among these were proposals to revise the act and to
<<<PAGE=208>>>
189 
 
implement a statistics strategy, namely the NSDS. However, there were no technical standards and 
guidelines with methodologies for all entities and units in charge of producing statistics within the 
statistical agency (CSO). No such standards existed; instead, there were varying and uncoordinated 
practices depending on the unit (within CSO) and experience.  With regard to the statistical data 
being broad enough to measure all indicators related to the goals of NDPs, it was reported to be 
limited. Although such data was broadly available, administrative data was always needed to 
supplement it. There was cautionary acknowledgement however, that most of the administrative 
data was usually being collected without following agreed standards and procedures.  
 
Further, it was reported that CSO was not mandated to undertake statistical analysis and that 
instead, its role was restricted to providing official statistics. As for the analysis function, the study 
gathered that statistical users were responsible to do it. However, there was capacity for data 
analysis within CSO to some extent, but marketing and education strategies on the importance of 
such information were lacking. In additio n, there was acknowledgement and some evidence that 
government agencies took into account performance indicators from CSO for decision making. 
Nonetheless, the utilisation of statistical data from CSO was seen mainly during the formulation 
of NDPs and less  for informing decision and policy making, except by MOF, though also in 
uncoordinated instances.  
 
In addition , the da ta collection activities of CSO , its  technical platform, its standards, and its 
definitions were reported to be poorly coordinated with t he other activities of the WoGM&ES. 
Support from CSO was given only to selected government line ministries and departments 
(MPSAs). Essentially, it was reviewed that the coordination was not structured though it was in 
place. Thus, it was suggested that th e need to structure and strengthen the coordination function 
was urgently required to implement a robust and stronger WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector. 
CSO was reported not to have an M&E unit, hence no formalised linkage with the WoGM&ES 
existed. Where such elements of linkage existed, it was on ad  hoc basis with mainly only M&E 
focal point persons available. Currently, the linkages were reported to be very weak and in some 
cases almost non-existent across MPSAs. At the moment, there were units for statistics/focal point 
persons in the provinces while planners undertook M&E tasks in an ad hoc manner. Thus, it was 
gathered that some line ministries had M&E units/sections/departments whereby provinces and
<<<PAGE=209>>>
190 
 
districts had planning units (provincial planning units (PPUs) and district planning offices (DPOs), 
respectively). Only plans were reported to be in place to strengthen most of these linkages. It was 
reported that when the WoGM&ES will be fully developed, data from M&E units across MPSAs 
will be automatica lly accessed from the WoGM&ES which will act as central depository. 
Therefore, it was gathered that no well -established linkages between the WoGM&ES with other 
M&E units were currently in place. This was also true of linkages between statistics and M&E 
functions across the public sector. Further, these expectations were only envisaged to be realised 
once the National M&E Policy and other proposed reforms were in effect.  
 
However, it was acknowledged that issues of incompatibility such as differing definitions, systems, 
geographic coverage, and so on did exist in the current M&E arrangements. Most of the M&E 
terminologies and processes were understood differently by different stakeholders – leading to 
some confusion over interpretation in implementation. For instance, under the MOH, catchment 
areas and population vari ed with those reported un der CSO . Plans to harmonise them in the 
WoGM&ES were reported to be in place. 
 
Sub-dimension 20: ‘Horizontal’ integration  
For the horizontal integration sub -dimension, a score of 2.0 was given, meaning that elements 
exist. The assessment checklist also places an emphasis on M&E integration (horizontal and 
vertical). Under horizontal integration, the diagnostic questions of focus are: Are there M&E units 
in different sub-sectors and semi-governmental institutions? Are these properly relayed to central 
sector M&E unit? (Holvoet and Inberg, 2011). The diagnosis has revealed that M&E units in 
different sub-sectors and semi-governmental institutions were hardly linked with sector M&E units 
(in most MPSAs), thereby undermining the promotion or strengthening of the ‘horizontal’ M&E 
integration. In the review of NDPs and sector strategic plans, provincial and  district plans 
(interviews done as well), there was mention of only few a nd weak presence of functional M&E 
in most line ministries, provinces and districts. This was not at variance with other study findings 
which concluded that in most countries, there were sector M&E systems at line ministry and other 
decentralised levels. H owever, these were mostly of very doubtful quality and problematic 
everywhere. Linking up such sector units to the central unit was mostly only partially satisfactory 
and should be one of the major issues on the reform agenda almost everywhere (Holvoet & Renard,
<<<PAGE=210>>>
191 
 
2005). What had come out clearly, though, in many of these structures were the current efforts to 
establish units/sections to fully take up M&E responsibilities. At present, only ad  hoc M&E 
arrangements existed, undertaken mainly by planning units as added responsibility. No incentives 
accompanied these extra M&E duties accrued to the responsible planning staff. Where the M&E 
functions have been developed a great deal (for example in the health and education sectors), the 
efforts were driven by donors (GRZ, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017). These challenges have led to 
weakened horizontal M&E integration in Zambia’s WoGM&ES.  To that extent, M&E units in 
different sub-sectors and semi -governmental institutions were reported as not taking the liaison 
function seriously. This, nevertheless, was despite other MPSAs being moderately active 
stakeholders in the WoGM&ES.  
 
It was reported that the requirement to monitor and evaluate was inscribed in the budgets of some 
MPSAs and in the job descriptions , but only for planning staff, who were expected to undertake 
M&E activities on top of their core planning responsibilities. However, it was established that the 
requirement to monitor and evaluate was never inscribed in the institutional structures. More so, 
the institutional design of the M&E was found to lack explanation of the capacities of MPSAs. 
Furthermore, only weak evidence was acknowledged with regard to whether line ministries utilised 
M&E information as a basis for their own planning and management. In any case, such information 
was reported not to be well structured to inform decision -making. However, there was limited 
evidence concerning the use of data to inform poverty -related policy at sectoral level. Thus, it 
becomes a matter of concern that some line  ministries that were considered  to be doing well in 
M&E functions were lagging in the utilisation of information in their custody. Again, these kinds 
of discrepancies prove the assertion that a lack of results -based management (RBM) orientation 
still affects Zambia’s WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2017).  
 
Concerns regarding data quality and relevance were acknowledged to be very significant elements 
across line ministries and for the entire WoGM&ES. This view was strongly stressed to say that, 
since the M&E processes were ad hoc, unstructured and not guided by strict data quality assurance 
protocols, the data quality and relevance issues could be compromised. It was reported that the 
low funding and implementation of the NSDS was one example of weak statistical base toward s 
supporting a functional WoGM&ES with credible data and information. Also, there was mention
<<<PAGE=211>>>
192 
 
that line ministries lacked trained staff in data methodological issues, hence, weakened 
institutional capacity to raise, know and demand for certain data quality . A data or statistical 
regime change was called upon in Zambia that would produce and assure users of data quality, 
reliability and relevance. In that regard, the approval and realisation of the NSDS under CSO 
remains an anchor to the evolution of nationa l and subnational statistics in Zambia. Only when 
statistical data were credible, would the WoGM&ES make an essential contribution to the 
development process of the country through feeding information into decision- and policy-making 
processes (Mackay, 2007). Further, since the WoGM&ES was reported to be in its infancy, it was 
gathered that line ministries did not rely on it for various reasons and weaknesses. 
 
Sub-dimension 21: Vertical upward integration  
A score of 2.0 was given for vertical upward integ ration – representing elements exist. The 
assessment checklist separates vertical upward integration and vertical downward integration. For 
vertical upward integration, the guiding question is: Are the decentralised M&E units of Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES properly r elayed to the central M&E unit or agency? The diagnostic review found 
that most decentralised M&E units were hardly linked with the central M&E agency. The 
WoGM&ES for Zambia had a fragmented structure. In a few line ministries and provinces, there 
were fragmented and ad hoc M&E arrangements. These arrangements took different forms and 
sizes. In some instances, there were M&E units , while in others only M&E focal point persons 
existed. In many of these structures, officers from the planning units were the o nes who mainly 
carried out M&E activities as mere added responsibilities. Further, several line ministries, and 
almost all provinces and districts had absolutely no established M&E units or structures (GRZ, 
2013, 2017). 
 
As a result, the mix in the presence or availability of M&E functions across structures in Zambia’s 
public sector created a weak and in some cases complete absence of M&E vertical upward 
integration. Thus information flows from district to province and to line minist ry – all the way to 
national or central M&E agency had become weakened. For instance, there was mention of effort 
to implement a web-based management monitoring system (MMS) spearheaded by MNDP to link 
up government business through online and real -time updates by all MPSAs. This  effort was 
commendable, but the commitment by stakeholders had been reported to be weak , giving a
<<<PAGE=212>>>
193 
 
practical challenge to success (GRZ, 2015, 2016, 2017). Furthermore, the assessment found 
isolated, fragmented and uncoordinated efforts all contributing to a weak M&E functions across 
MPSAs. Some individual line ministries , such as health, education, agriculture, and labour , had 
made progress in developing their own stand-alone M&E arrangements. In such cases, these efforts 
were not linked to the central M&E unit/agency in the MNDP (GRZ, 2014, 2015, 2017). 
 
Sub-dimension 22: Vertical downward integration 
 Little action taken, with a score of 1.0 was given to the sub -dimension on vertical downward 
integration. The vertical downward integration was reported that  the M&E units at decentralised 
levels were hardly linked with central or sector level M&E units. As expressed above, weak 
arrangements and operationalisation of M&E function s at various levels of the WoG M&ES had 
led to poor vertical downward integration as well. The M&E linkages and information flows from 
central to line ministry to provincial and all the way to district level were reported to be weak and 
uncoordinated. It was established that coordination in form of liaison with local government 
structures was in place and embedded in the WoGM&ES. Both provinces and districts were part 
of the WoGM&ES. The liaison was reported to be in existence mainly through and within the 
PDCCs and DDCCs and to a lesser extent WDCs , in which the function of M&E was said to be 
embedded. However, it was reported that the coordination of the M&E function across all PDCCs, 
DDCCs and WDCs was not adequately performed.  
 
In particular, local governments were reported not to be participating actively in the WoGM&ES, 
despite the existing linkages through DDCCs and WDCs. Local authorities were currently not 
engaged in the government M&E system, while provinces were engaged remotely or participating 
through PDCCs. This undesirable situation was attributed to the central agency (MNDP ) not 
having sufficient staff capacity to mentor, backstop and offer support to lower structures such as 
local governments. Equally, the lack of decentralised M&E function across the public sector 
hampered the strengthening of the WoGM&ES at those lower bu t critical levels ( that is, district 
and sub-district levels). The role of incentives in M&E is significant, especially in the early stages 
of building and strengthening a WoGM&ES. With correct selection and targeted implementation, 
incentives work as a mo tivational factor for stakeholders to supply M&E information and at the 
same time demand M&E results to inform various decision- and policy-making processes.
<<<PAGE=213>>>
194 
 
To worsen the situation, no form of incentive was reported to be place d in the coordination 
framework at local government and provincial level to support the strengthening of the M&E 
function. Suffice to say, there was no institutional design for the WoGM&ES to elaborate the 
capacities of local governments. The liaisons with line ministries and other agencies in terms of 
their functionality within the WoGM&ES were reported to be weak and ad hoc. The MNDP was 
reported to be currently trying to push for a common framework for M&E at sector/line ministry 
level. This effort was being piloted in the ministr ies of labour and agriculture. Liaison between 
MNDP and line ministries had mostly been limited and restricted to reporting requirements. Only 
when there were activities such as the production of APRs, presidential quarterly reports, and CAG 
reports – did the MNDP M&E department provide some liaison and backstopping to line 
ministries. Coordinated liaison was lacking between the two levels and this created a huge gap in 
terms of capacity to build and strengthen M&E across the WoGM&ES. This signified a lower 
priority attached to M&E within the WoGM&ES. This then posed a huge challenge to building 
and sustaining a stronger system for M&E across the public sector in Zambia. Something different 
had to be done if such gloomy M&E functionality outlooks were to be transformed into positive 
effects in future.   
 
Further, a number of data types were described that they were often requested or would be relevant 
to local agencies and governments. These included district indicators on socio -economic and 
governance sectors, project funding and implementation data and project inventories for various 
sectors. In addition, they needed information on beneficiaries of government interventions at 
provincial and district level. Information relating generally to poverty, water and  sanitation, and 
the prevalence of disease was frequently sought by stakeholders.  Much of such data were 
demanded through the living conditions monitoring surveys  (LCMSs) conducted by CSO ( for 
example revenue generation, land titling, and access to assets by women and youth). Currently, no 
indicators in the NDPs were defined at provincial and district level. This gap had been  
acknowledged for a long time , but little practical effort had been put in place to resolve it. No 
provincial and district -specific in dicators existed in the 7NDP.  In addition, no feedback and 
information flows to local government and service providers from the WoGM&ES were in place. 
However, CSO was reported to have been sharing its statistical data with the local government 
agencies through its monthly statistical bulletin (though only to limited audience). The MNDP
<<<PAGE=214>>>
195 
 
expressed some plans to extend the functionality of the WoGM&ES to local governments. 
Although conceptually, there were indications in the institutional arrangements for NDP  
implementation on how information flows were expected to move horizontally and vertically, there 
were currently no practical steps to actualise the intentions.  
 
As a result, there was no evidence concerning the use of such M&E information at local level as 
an incentive system to improve the performance of service providers. Currently there was 
apparently no comprehensive performance management system that promoted the use of M&E 
information at local government level. In terms of whether there was some adaptation to the needs, 
timing and form of outputs provided to local governments and agencies, it was found that none 
existed. There was no direct interface between local government and line ministries or central 
agencies in sharing information on programme/project outputs.  
 
Sub-dimension 23: Link with projects 
In the sub-dimension of link with projects, a score of 3.0 was given denoting action taken. The last 
aspect considered under the organisational linkages sub -component looks at the M&E linkages 
with de velopment projects implemented at various levels of the public sector. Precisely, the 
checklist asks: Is there any effort to relay/coordinate with donor M&E mechanisms for projects 
and vertical funds in the public sector M&E arrangements? The assessment re sults have shown 
that coordination between sector M&E units and development partners’ M&E mechanisms for 
projects and vertical funds in the sectors did exist, but did not function properly. More concretely, 
sectors such as the education and health had a huge presence of donors whose M&E arrangements 
were unified with those of the donors (though evidence was weak). Nevertheless, these linkages 
were specific and limited to donor-funded interventions (Kanyamuna, 2013; GRZ, 2017).  
 
7.3.4 Capacity  
To assess the M&E capacity needs for the WoGM&ES, three topics are crucial to analyse. These 
sub-components include assessing the present capacity of the WoGM&ES (that is, skills, financial 
resources); ascertaining whether the problem of M&E was acknowledged in terms of current
<<<PAGE=215>>>
196 
 
weaknesses in the WoGM&ES; and lastly checking the availability of M&E capacity building 
plans for remediation focused on training, appropriate salaries, equipment etc.  
 
Sub-dimension 24: Present capacity 
The sub-dimension on present capacity scored 2.0, meaning that elements exist. In terms of holistic 
capacity for M&E in Zambia, some capacity was reported (for example skills, financial resources), 
but not at all levels of government. In all the NDPs and strategic plans for line ministries that were 
reviewed, mention was made that human capacity , particularly in generating, managing and 
utilising M&E information, was constrained at all levels – national, sector, provincial and district 
levels. Equally, APRs identified human, skills, financial, s ystemic and political capacity 
challenges in Zambia’s WoGM&ES. For instance, while there were some negligible government 
financial allocations to undertake M&E activities in a few line ministries, there were hardly any 
budgetary allocations to finance M&E activities at provincial, district and sub -district level. The 
same scenario obtained for human, skills, systemic/technical and political capacities for M&E. For 
resources, it was gathered that financing project or programme evaluations posed a challenge 
across MPSAs.  
In that regard, Zambia’s experiences are similar to the conclusions reached by Holvoet and Renard 
(2005:16), when they stated: 
This is generally acknowledged as being a major issue. Most PRSP countries have weak public sectors 
in general and very limited human resource capacity when it comes to the complex tasks of M&E in 
particular. What expertise there is tends to be dispersed over different organisations (Statistical Office, 
Finance Ministry). Donors try to close the gap with technical assi stance, and through institutional 
strengthening and reforming M&E systems, but in the best of cases the results take a long time to 
mature. The overall impression is that there is, and will be for a considerable time to come, a formidable 
mismatch between the demands put on the system by donors, and national capacity.  
 
As a result, there was a suggestion from the study respondents that a national evaluation fund 
should be established to provide the much-needed financing for various evaluations and necessary 
reviews. To that extent, it was acknowledged that resources for evaluations were neither sufficient, 
predictable nor sustainable. This gap was important to address and for the WoGM&ES to thrive, 
capacity-building will need to be embedded in all instituti ons and local training institutions will
<<<PAGE=216>>>
197 
 
also need to take the lead in providing programmes that equip practitioners to conduct quality 
evaluations. 
 
Further, it was reported that no overall capacity-building programme or plan was in place to help 
strengthen the M&E capacity of staff or evaluation practitioners at national, line ministry, 
provincial and district level. No such arrangement was mentioned to be in place, except for 
trainings, which were ad hoc and came mainly through donor support. However, it  was gathered 
that plans were under way to establish one such programme in collaboration with local training 
institutions. Although DPs provided support to developing aspects of the WoGM&ES, it was 
revealed that challenges sometimes arose in the release of funds, forcing certain activities to take 
longer to be accomplished. Whenever adjustments needed to be made to the contracts, some donors 
tended not to be flexible in incorporating them.  
 
The support from DPs on strengthening the WoGM&ES was acknowledged as being in place and 
considered key, though not adequate to meet the required support across government. The EU, 
GIZ and DFID were currently supporting the WoG -M&E concept and work was being done in 
some line ministries/sectors to develop sector -wide M&E  systems that will be part of the 
WoGM&ES. Funding from DPs was reported to be predictable to some limited extent, while their 
funding sustainability was not ascertained because it depended on their own countries’ foreign 
economic policy dynamics.  Dependence on DP support was said to have led to delays in 
implementing a structured WoGM&ES in Zambia. In addition, it was gathered that DPs were not 
sustainably supporting the overall WoGM&ES. Nevertheless, their support had been to various 
institutions including MNDP and some selected line ministries ( for example labour). No support 
was mentioned at provincial and district level. It was reported that most of the support from the 
DPs was channelled towards the promotion of ICT -based M&E, databases and technical s kills 
(that is, mainly for selected activities). However, even when this was so, IT related skills were 
reported to be on the low side across government. For example, the MMS software was reported 
to be managed by a team composed of subject matter experts , but who did not have sufficient 
technical expertise needed to support and move it forward. As a result, there was no prior IT 
governance plan put in place (GRZ, 2015). For the WoGM&ES to be sustained, provision of 
capacity-building programmes in M&E will need to be institutionalised in local training
<<<PAGE=217>>>
198 
 
institutions. For M&E skills to be readily available to all those who needed them, local training 
institutions were better placed to be equipped and provide such needed knowledge to the general 
public, more so  to the civil service that was charged with the management of the WoGM&ES. 
There was weak evidence as to whether government provided guidance to DPs on supporting 
planning and M&E capacity development in Zambia. In fact, it was gathered that there was no 
framework in place to guide DPs on how to support capacity development for the WoGM&ES. 
Further, it was found that to some extent, DPs supported by funding technical assistance in the 
design and strengthening of the WoGM&ES. In a few line ministries, currently notable technical 
assistance was provided (particularly in skills development). However, there was no framework in 
place for transfer of skills. At times, it was reported that DPs spent lots of money on (expensive) 
international consultants who were acknowledged not to fully transfer skills to locals in MPSAs.  
 
With regard to substantive capacity -building efforts in monitoring, analysis, and evaluation 
currently under way in the country, it was found that a plan was in place to partner with the Zambia 
Monitoring and Evaluation Association (ZaMEA) and other local training institutions. The plan is 
meant to establish an M&E capacity-building programme in the country. In addition,  the Centres 
for Learning on Evaluation and Results—Anglophone Africa (CLEAR–AA) was currently helping 
with the formulation of a suitable curriculum. It was further gathered that in many cases, there was 
no objectivity in selecting staff for capacity building in M&E . Instead, staff who were unable to 
transfer skills within their own M&E units were sent for training. Local academic institutions were 
designing curricula on the subject matter of M&E ( for example University of Zambia  (UNZA) 
currently offer short courses in M&E). The focus of the capacity -building programme being 
proposed at national level was mostly on evaluation capacities. In terms of the sustainability aspect 
of the capacity-building efforts and the ability to retain the capacities created over the medium and 
long term, it was gathered that the model to be adopted will recommend practical ways to achieve 
the desired M&E capacities. If the capacity building programme is established in such a way that 
it is a partnership between government, ZaMEA, academic institutions and DPs, it is expected to 
have a high level of sust ainability. Local training institutions were better placed to lead the 
capacity-building role. In another view, it was mentioned that the retention of current capacity was 
affected by the transfer of staff from one institution to another. Funding limitatio ns affected the 
sustainability of capacity building as well.
<<<PAGE=218>>>
199 
 
It was established that great potential existed for in -country universities and other training 
organisations to provide training in data collection, monitoring, analysis, and evaluation to various 
actors in the WoGM&ES. The University of Zambia (UNZA) for instance currently offers a variety 
of short courses in M&E.  There was great potential and interest , as observed by the infusion of 
M&E training courses in most academic institutions. However, i t was reported that what may be 
missing was standardisation of concepts and M&E approaches and comprehensiveness of the 
training programmes. There was also emphasis on the need for stronger collaboration between 
institutions of learning and MPSAs to transf er M&E skills and experience in the industry. With 
regard to undertaking household and other comprehensive socio -economic surveys to feed into 
M&E, it was reported that this was being done , although always faced with huge financial 
constraints. Thus, in so me cases surveys were conducted every two, four, five and 10 years , 
depending on the type of survey (Living Conditions, Zambia Demographic & Health surveys, 
National Population and Housing censuses, sector specific surveys, etc). The availability of 
survey-based household -consumption data had been noted as having improved in many low -
income countries and this was assisting in monitoring outcomes and impacts (Holvoet & Renard, 
2005). It was reported that there was no clear understanding as to whether ministerial MIS captured 
data on stakeholder satisfaction and impact of service delivery across government and non -
government agencies. 
 
Further, it was revealed that government did not have in place planned service delivery surveys 
that showed trends in stakehol der satisfaction. However, there was mention that in 2008 a 
governance survey was conducted to assess levels of satisfaction by stakeholders through the many 
services offered by government and its partners.  Since then, nothing has happened and no plans 
were reported. It was acknowledged that the only commonly produced quarterly and annual reports 
among MPSAs were usually a summary of output achievements in terms of service delivery and 
their own locations. Nevertheless, there was usually no information on s cope, access, quality and 
client satisfaction of those public service interventions.  
  
Regarding efforts to remove or avoid overlaps in data collection by line ministries and other 
institutions providing services through interconnecting their MIS s, it was  gathered that no such 
arrangements existed. Only plans were under way through the implementation of a unified and
<<<PAGE=219>>>
200 
 
integrated WoGM&ES and a strengthened national statistical function were mentioned. As a 
result, it was revealed that there were currently several duplications in data collection, compilation 
and analysis activities across line ministries and o ther institutions and national  levels. Further, 
MISs were reported as not being include d in many MPSAs and this created mismatches and 
inconsistencies in harmonising possible overlaps and duplications. The availability of information 
systems to the public through internet platforms ( for example  websites) was acknowledged as 
being in existence, but only to a limited extent. For instance, through the CSO website, almost all 
the information and reports were reported to be available to the public using the Internet, but the 
accessibility was usually hampered by poor network connectivity that often interrupted the 
statistical online platform. It was reported tha t the Economic Management  Department (EMD) 
within MOF was tasked with the responsibility of M&E activities. However, this function (M&E) 
was a new mandate given to the department. Thus, it was mentioned that the department was 
currently weak in terms of ca pacity – staffing, skills, finances, technical issues, etc. As a result, 
the MNDP through the M&E department was still relied on to provide M&E information to MOF. 
In that regard, it was acknowledged that no clear linkages on M&E existed currently between MOF 
and MNDP. Only some reports (annual economic reports) from EMD were shared with the MNDP, 
but these were not systematically harmonised with NDP performance tracking, accept for limited 
usage during APR preparations.  
 
Sub-dimension 25: Capacity building plan 
A score of 2.0 was given to the sub -dimension of capacity building plan , representing elements 
exist. It was gathered that no capacity building plan or programme was in place for the M&E skills 
in MOF. This scenario implied weak arrangements for M&E  not only in the ministry, but in the 
entire WoGM&ES. Equally, this lack of M&E capacity was viewed as leading to the non-existence 
of linkages between MOF and MPSAs. In that regard, it became difficult for MOF to demand and 
use M&E information appropriately to inform budgeting processes and decisions. At the same 
time, it created de -linkages between MOF and MNDP in terms of prudently implementing the 
NDPs with a clear focus on development results. It is also for that reason, that no motivation or 
incentives to spur effective M&E were reported to be in place in the entire WoGM&ES and MOF 
in particular. Similarly, it was found that staff from MOF did not belong to any M&E committee 
of MPSAs and no identified role was reported for MOF staff. It was gathered th at with regard to
<<<PAGE=220>>>
201 
 
the availability of resources such as physical infrastructure for the collection and compilation of 
M&E data, only limited human resources were available in selected MPSAs. Mention was also 
made that not all line ministries and government  agencies had established MISs. It was further 
acknowledged that most of the levels had physical space (that is, offices, basic equipment, etc) to 
host M&E activities at national, line ministry, provincial and district level.  
 
With regard to the extent to which data gathering is financed by external development partners, it 
was established that government funding constituted the largest share (approximately 70%) of the 
resources, while DPs had the rest of the support (approximately 30%). Thus, donor funds towards 
supporting data collection were viewed as not sustainable or predictable. Some DPs were reported 
as being interested only in supporting technical assistance or training and not any other (logistical) 
support. For household surveys, data gathering w as sometimes co -financed by government and 
DPs, although this was deemed not to be sustainable and government was gradually increasing its 
share of financial contribution/support. This was also viewed as the only predictable and 
sustainable way of ensuring that M&E data and information were collected in required quantities 
and qualities.  
 
Currently, it was reported that analysis of M&E information was being done fragmentally across 
government and non -government actors.  However, it was established that for some selected 
government agencies, MNDP was analysing M&E information centrally (though with limited 
analytical content due to insufficiencies in staffing, analytical skills, funding and data gaps). In 
addition, some civil society organisations (CSOs) and research institutes undertook independent 
analysis of the information , especially for public development projects and programmes.  The 
function of M&E was still fragmented across institutions within government agencies. In non -
government institutions, the situation was found to be even worse. In that regard, the WoGM&ES 
for Zambia still lacked fundamental requirements particularly in the area of analysis. The problem 
with this scenario therefore, was that reports produced at many levels lacked analytical con tent 
and quality, thereby rendering weakened input into policy- and decision-making processes.  
 
It was acknowledged that the M&E analytical capacity for government and non -government 
institutions was weak throughout the WoGM&ES. Consequently, there was much need to improve
<<<PAGE=221>>>
202 
 
systemic, financial and human capacities. For the current weak capacities, funding was said to be 
done through national budgets (though inadequate and irregular) and insufficient support from 
some DPs. Therefore, the issue of financial capacity was weak across institutions. It was gathered 
that the M&E mandate across state and non -state institutions remained fragmented and weak. 
While it was fairly clear in some institutions among non -state agencies, the situation was poor 
among government agencies. Efforts to address the challenge were under  way through putting in 
place a national M&E policy and other supportive pieces of legislation. It was stressed that funding 
was usually not adequate for the units/agencies to undertake their mandates.  In some cases, the 
funds were erratic and not released on time, which affected implementation  negatively. The 
concerns around data limitations and the objectivity of M&E analysts were serious matters that 
required resolving if the WoGM&ES was to be truste d and owned by many stakeholders in 
government and beyond. The usability and sustainability of such a system will only be attained 
through the completeness of the M&E data/information, analytical content and the neutrality or 
objectivity of the analysis to  give unbiased M&E outputs. Already civil society and DPs were 
reported to be reluctant to use government reports on the basis that the information was 
manipulated to give comfortable positions for government. It was suspected that hard issues (for 
example those bordering on misapplication of resources, corruption, poor services) were left out 
of these analytical reports to avoid attracting tough questions from stakeholders.  
 
Currently, it was reported that most of the work programmes of these state and no n-state 
institutions were drawn from their own development and institutional plans and requirements. 
These plans were then broken down into annual work plans (AWPs). However, it was mentioned 
that there was no stipulated mechanism in place to clearly define activities in light of the needs of 
the end users.  It was also mentioned that efforts were currently under  way for the MNDP to 
circulate standardised formats showing the needs of end-users. Further, it was acknowledged that 
the major challenge that affected the analysis of M&E information pertained to the data gaps and 
limitations. A lot of data were not fully explored. In many cases data constraints limited the extent 
to which quality analysis was done in M&E reports and outputs. Lack of disaggregated da ta, 
especially at decentralised level (district and sub-district) was reported as a major problem. 
However, the issue of the objectivity of M&E analysts was not clearly elaborated, but respondents 
expressed concern that in some reports overzealousness and overstatement of certain aspects of
<<<PAGE=222>>>
203 
 
achievement were common. In other instances, underreporting was also common, thereby raising 
concern about the credibility of analysts. Despite the challenges, however, the quality of the 
analytical work was fairly good,  given the data and information. Owing to understaffing in 
planning and M&E government structures/MPSAs ( that is,  departments, sections, units and 
arrangements), it was reported that analysts were overwhelmed with data (demanding workloads 
for fewer staff).  
 
The demand for the work of analysts in M&E was reported to be high across government and non-
government agencies. Currently, it was mentioned that most of the stakeholders had been 
demanding to know how the country was moving as far as the achievement of set goals in the 
NDPs was concerned. The problem of poor analytics in the Zambian WoGM&ES was a serious 
gap. In particular, as the country sought to build, strengthen and sustain a functioning national 
level system, a growing and sustained capacity -base in M&E analytics would be vital. All levels 
of the WoGM&ES – national, line ministry, provincial, and district – are supposed to be equipped 
with M&E analytical skills and capacities as well as experiences. As to whether analysts for M&E 
information posse ssed the ability to communicate their analyses effectively to end users in an 
appropriately adapted format, it was gathered that this was possible or done only to a limited extent. 
It was revealed that various M&E outputs were available  in the form of inst itutional reports . 
However, these outputs were reported to be suffering from issues of timeliness and standardisation 
in format and content. Report formats also were reported to be changed regularly. 
 
A number of reports (though with low analytical content  and quality) were mentioned as being 
produced by several institutions across government agencies. Socio -economic analyses were 
usually done by CSO on a quarterly and annual basis . To some extent these were used to inform 
planning processes in development agencies. Further, selected documents that apparently 
contained some level of analysis included APRs, census and survey reports and annual ministerial 
reports. For the APR however, it was gathered that it lacked cumulative analysis of the targets 
being ach ieved in relation to the entire planning period instead of focusing only on annual 
achievements. Such an analysis would not only provide a time series dimension of progress, but 
would paint a picture of what remained to be done. Thus, if the analysis point ed to serious 
shortfalls, then a case could be made to change the targets (GRZ, 2015). But the challenge in all
<<<PAGE=223>>>
204 
 
these efforts was non -availability of data disaggregation at provincial and district level. These 
reports were viewed as not being used much in crucial institutional decisions across government 
as a result. The other challenge was lateness in completing and disseminating these reports, in 
some instances rendering them obsolete. Analysis of descriptive statistics was reported to be 
provided on demand. Most of the reports were too technical for other users (especially at district 
and sub-district level) and concerns were raised that the need to innovate ways of simplifying data 
and information products would be key to increased demand and utilisation. In that regard, it was 
revealed that analytical products were insufficient and did not fulfil the specific needs of the users.  
 
With regard to gaps in analysis, it was reported that challenges existed mainly in data availability 
and completeness, analytical skills and financial support. Many MPSAs did not have formalised 
M&E functions, units or sections with staff dedicated to M&E work. This created a situation in 
which in-depth institutional analysis of data and information in various reports to miss . In many 
cases, there were analytical weaknesses in reports related to conclusions that had been reached 
with limited or no credible evidence owing to lack of appropriate and to some extent relevant data. 
No prescribed requirements and procedures existed for  evaluating NDP programmes in the 
WoGM&ES. Further, no guidelines  were provided in NDP M&E framework(s) , except for 
statements of intent . The M&E chapter in the 7NDP articulated the M&E function, but without 
giving clear guidelines for evaluating NDP programmes, as a practical example.  
 
Despite the lack of requirements and procedures, it was acknowledged that  the data and 
information gathered through monitoring activities was used to support evaluations (though 
evidence was weak). However, the use was reported to have been limited or seldom. For instance, 
in the recent Youth Development Fund evaluation, only limited M&E data was used from the 
Ministry of Youth, Sport and Child Development. It was established that only to a limited extent 
were evaluations and reviews undertaken or commissioned by government. The main reason for 
this was attributed to scarce resources. The reality was that even for these limited evaluations and 
reviews, much of the funding had come from DPs and little or none from government a llocation. 
This point was repeated at almost all levels of the research . Although there were episodic 
evaluations of programmes and projects, funded mostly by DPs, and some undertaken by research 
institutions aligned with government, the evaluation aspect was generally not fully developed in
<<<PAGE=224>>>
205 
 
the government sector. In addition, there were no guidelines for undertaking in-depth or summative 
evaluations to ascertain policy, programme and project relevance and impact. Further, there was 
no budgeted multi-year national evaluation plan to support evidence-based policy decisions (GRZ, 
2015). Again, this explains how difficult it could be to build, strengthen and sustain a WoGM&ES 
for Zambia. Unless the financing architecture for M&E functions and systems shifted from donor 
led to country owned, the desire for a robust WoGM&ES will remain a dream/expectation in the 
far future.  
 
As to the limited commissioned evaluations and reviews by government, these were restricted to 
programme reviews, process evaluations and ex -post and mid -term evaluations. For the FNDP, 
SNDP and R -SNDP, mid -term evaluations were not undertaken even when planned fo r. 
Obviously, this precedent was not good for M&E and its evolution in the country. This reflects 
negatively on the value and commit ment the government attached to the notion of results -based 
management (RBM) and managing for development results ( MfDRs). With regard to the 
frequency with which  these ad hoc  evaluations and reviews were performed, it was 
mentioned/reported that they were seldom. For NDPs, mostly, evaluations were conducted after 
the end of the plan (in five years). Although it was stated clearly that government and its agencies 
held the responsibility to commission evaluations and reviews, the conviction and evidence were 
weak (citing mainly resource constraints on the part of government). It was acknowledged that in 
some cases when CPs provided financing for programme evaluation(s), they influenced the choice 
of which intervention to evaluate or review. Nonetheless, the M NDP and other think tank 
organisations commissioned evaluations and reviews , though rarely. Again, this state of affairs 
greatly undermined the role of M&E in the country. If nothing changed to improve the entire 
WoGM&ES architecture, Zambia will be headed for a continued status quo in which a weak and 
fragmented and less utilised M&E information will define the system. Line ministries and other 
decentralised structures of government are better placed to begin to plan, budget, commission and 
implement their own evaluations and reviews to ascertain value for money for their programmes, 
projects and policies.  
 
Whether line ministries undertook or commissioned evaluations and reviews of their own 
performance, it was reported that this was a rare occurrence. At those levels, most evaluations and
<<<PAGE=225>>>
206 
 
reviews were donor  driven. Although it was logical to engage external evaluators to assess the 
performance of government development interventions, the current practices in which DPs hired 
evaluators from outside the country (mainly from their countries of origin), it disadvantaged local 
evaluation capacities. In that case, DPs could be regarded as not only contributing to a weaker 
evaluation base in the country by crowding out local experts, but in ultimately undermining the 
creation and sustenance of the WoGM&ES. Not until the approximated percentage share (20 %–
80%) of involvement was transposed, the evolution and transformation of the evaluation regime 
in the country will continue to be dependent on the donors in an unsustainable way. Mention was 
also made that some of the evaluations and reviews were conducted jointly with the government 
on an involvement proportion of approximately 20% for government and 80% for DPs. In terms 
of the work done, government usually review ed terms of reference (ToRs), data collection tools 
and reports. The DPs’ ultimate responsibility was to undertake the evaluations mainly by financing 
the contraction of (external) evaluators. Similar to DPs, civil society contributed to undermining 
the WoGM&ES. Instead of promoting and supporting the strengthening of the national system for 
M&E, they implement ed fragmented systems without trying to collaborate and finding ways of 
integrating systems. As a consequence, there was lack of synchronised and har monised 
collaboration between government and CSOs in terms of building a structured WoGM&ES. It then 
becomes difficult for the CSOs to play their role of providing checks and balances and ultimately 
demanding transparency and accountability because they were not partners with government. This 
may also be the reason that the government was not usually comfortable when working with CSOs, 
viewing them as only seeking fault with government work instead of being rational opinion makers 
and constructive critics.  
 
Interestingly, it was found that for the evaluations and reviews commissioned by government or 
DPs or both, no evidence existed that civil society demanded or supported such undertakings. 
Other key informants expressly stated that there was no such deman d and support from CSOs, 
academia and other interdisciplinary research groups. Zambia’s WoGM&ES clearly has been 
undermined by many inadequacies. Skilled manpower in terms of in-depth expertise in the area of 
development evaluations was found to be lacking . Yet to thrive as a national -level system for 
M&E, such skills were essential at all levels of government. The study findings revealed that 
capacity problems were not only at individual and institutional level (in terms of the right mix of
<<<PAGE=226>>>
207 
 
evaluation skills), but that capacity to train or transfer evaluation knowledge was  equally a major 
gap in Zambia today.  Fundamentally, there was a lack of established learning institutions in the 
country at which  as many M&E practitioners as possible would possess the knowledge of 
undertaking fuller scales of any evaluation in the country. Currently, it was acknowledged that the 
limited number of local evaluators could not compete favourably in the regional and continental 
markets, let alone the global market.  
 
CSOs wer e also reported to undertake their own reviews, mostly for their donor -funded 
programmes. However, some CSOs only invited government agencies to attend some evaluation 
debriefings and dissemination meetings of selected reports.  In addition, policy briefs w ere not 
prepared by CSOs following their evaluations and reviews. It was established that since CSOs had 
their own sepa rate and fragmented M&E arrangements, which worked in isolation from 
government, they were not mandated to report their findings to any g overnment entity. They did 
not prepare policy briefs to inform cabinet or any other government agency. Regarding adherence 
to good evaluation practices, it was found that the capacities for evaluation are very low in Zambia. 
That was why most donor -funded evaluations and reviews were being undertaken by external 
consultants from outside Zambia. It was reported that there was very little and weak capacity 
building of local actors to undertake evaluations.  
 
Sub-dimension 26: Problem acknowledged 
The problem acknowledged sub-dimension was scored with a 2.0  – elements exist. In terms of 
whether current weaknesses in the WoGM&ES were identified, it was reported that existing 
weaknesses were indeed identified, but not based on a diagnosis. Some APRs indicated tha t a 
number of M&E weaknesses did exist  in Zambia’s WoGM&ES. In p articular, human, skills, 
financial, technical/systemic and political capacities were lacking. The ongoing effort to develop 
the National M&E Policy for Zambia had also identified some of the se gaps. However, all the 
efforts so far had not been categorical and systematic in terms of identifying and documenting the 
exact M&E capacity challenges at national, sector, provincial, district and sub -district level. No 
comprehensive diagnostic exercise  had embarked on bringing out holistic and specific capacity 
gaps which would be key to address in the entire system for M&E in Zambia’s public sector. This
<<<PAGE=227>>>
208 
 
study has made that attempt to systematically document the gaps for possible improvement and 
further research.  
 
The availability of plans and activities that include training, appropriate salaries, etc , for 
remediation formed part of the assessment in this stud y. There were coordinated plans and 
activities for remediation. However, these did not include aspects such as training and appropriate 
salaries. In the NDPs and APRs, there was neither a categorical mention of the need for 
standardised training skills nor a salary proposal for M&E officers in the public service. Nor did 
other government documents and interviews provide clear position s on these matters. The NDPs 
focused on the processes that ‘M’ and ‘E’ were to be undertaken – and not necessarily on the skills 
and financial structures needed to support successful M&E.  
 
However, since 2013 there ha ve been discussions within MOF and Cabinet Office to strengthen 
the function of M&E in government. Before that time, M&E activities existed, but were traditional 
M&E efforts – focused on ‘monitoring’ and not on ‘evaluation’. Currently, the Ministry of 
National Development Planning (MNDP) through the M&E Department was leading a process to 
strengthen the WoGM&ES. This effort has seen the drafting of the national M&E policy for 
Zambia, the articulation of the national and sector performance frameworks and the  development 
of Internet-based M&E solutions. Further, with the M&E department, which was under the MOF 
from 2007 to 2015 , now being a full M&E division under the MNDP, the coordination of M&E 
activities across government is becoming clearer, more streamlined and coherent. Focus is on the 
need to clearly distinguish the functions and role of M&E in all the processes of national 
development. Human capacities through skills training and salary incentives are mentioned in 
many of these processes. Although stil l in the planning stage, these efforts are positive for a 
strengthened WoGM&ES for Zambia.  
 
7.3.5 Participation of actors outside government  
The diagnostic checklist considers three key actors outside government, namely parliament, civil 
society and deve lopment partners and donors. In understanding the role of actors outside 
government, it is critical to diagnose the role played by parliament through checking whether there 
is alignment with parliamentary control and oversight procedures. In addition, the assessment
<<<PAGE=228>>>
209 
 
checked whether parliament participated in joint sector reviews and other working groups. 
Similarly, the checklist investigated whether the role of civil society was recognised in M&E 
activities of the WoGM&ES. The focus here was on the clarity of procedures for the participation 
of civil society and whether their participation was arranged institutionally or was merely ad hoc. 
Further, whether civil society participated in joint sector reviews and other working groups is 
another crucial aspect of assessment. As for donors and development partners, the aspects assessed 
under the parliament and civil society were applicable.  
 
Sub-dimension 27: Parliament  
The parliament sub-dimension was given a score of 2.0, denoting that elements exist. The role of 
parliament was acknowledged in the WoGM&ES as providing legislation and oversight functions. 
However, there was no alignment with parliamentary control and oversight procedures. Further, 
parliament did not participate in JSRs or working groups. As an a rm of government tasked with 
overseeing the legislation system and approval of government estimates of revenues and 
expenditures (that is, national budgets), parliament could play a significant role in the successful 
implementation and strengthening of the  WoGM&ES for Zambia (GRZ, 2016, 2017). However, 
the APRs and other M&E -related documents did not mention the role played by parliament in 
strengthening M&E functions in the public sector. It was not clear how parliamentary control and 
oversight procedures were being undertaken in the context of national M&E (GRZ, 2009, 2010, 
2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017). Further, aside from the mentioning how parliament is envisaged 
to participate in sector working groups ( that is, cluster advisory groups) in the current p rocesses, 
there was currently no clear evidence of its M&E strengthening role. Although parliament 
performed its traditional role of oversight through debates  on the floor of the house, visits to 
selected project and programme sites, and meetings of parlia mentary committees, it was 
acknowledged that there was room to engage parliament in a more innovative and meaningful way. 
These efforts remained uncoordinated and fragmented in terms of their linkages and contributions 
to the functionality and operational arrangements of the WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2015, 2017). In 
addition, it was acknowledged that parliament was involved in the discussions about NDPs, 
although with weak evidence on how it was engaged. In that regard, parliament was reported to be 
participating to a lesser extent in the development planning process through the p articipation of 
parliamentary offices at ward and district levels during the NDP consultative process. Further,
<<<PAGE=229>>>
210 
 
parliament was acknowledged as being critical to providing oversight during the implementation 
of NDPs, especially through annual budgetary hearings and approvals.  
 
It was established that the WoGM&ES did not embrace or have a strategy in place for 
dissemination of M&E outputs on poverty to parliament. Instead, there was only a genera l 
dissemination of poverty data to all national stakeholders through CSO reports and APRs and 
related reports. Presentations and reports to parliament  were not structured and were normally 
voluminous without user-friendly summaries for easier reference by parliamentarians. However, 
only CSO was mentioned as practising the dissemination of statistical data to parliament.  
Therefore, the WoGM&ES was weak in that regard because parliament plays an oversight role in 
the governance system of the country. Thus, fo r parliament not to have access to reports and 
information on how NDP implementation was being undertaken, and more so the development 
results being pursued and achieved, much was left to be desired on the transparency, accountability 
and good governance tenets of the nation. It was revealed that this scenario contributed to weaker 
parliamentary debates in the house on types of legislation needed for growth and development and 
debates on financial resource allocations during budget appropriation hearings. A  stronger 
WoGM&ES would be structured in such a way that parliament and its committees would play a 
duel role of supplying M&E data/information and demanding M&E outputs to enhance its 
participation in the development process of the country.  
 
The WoGM&ES recognised parliament as one of the potentially major M&E information users. 
However, the issues of appropriateness, timing, timeliness and form of M&E outputs to meet the 
needs of parliament were reported as being fragmented. Although general reports were  
acknowledged to be disseminated to parliament, there was a need for innovative data presentation 
and visualisation, rather than the current bulky reports (APRs, etc). Further, M&E data and 
information would be more useful to parliament if it was produced at constituency and ward level. 
But at the moment, it is produced only at provincial and national level in most cases. In addition, 
the WoGM&ES needed a well-defined framework for engaging parliament. It was suggested that 
there should be a way to link wha t happens in Parliament, and also in all constituencies in the 
country. When such information was harmonised and synchronised within a functional 
WoGM&ES, parliament would operate effectively with improved evidence -based policy and
<<<PAGE=230>>>
211 
 
decision-making processes. Parliament needs to demand proper accountability and transparency 
from the executive branch of government based on evidence and real -time information supplied 
by a stronger WoGM&ES. 
 
With regard to the use of information from the WoGM&ES by parliament and its committees, it 
was reported that no clear evidence was available to prove the practice. No such demonstrations 
of the utilisation of information by parliament existed. The debates by parliamentarians were 
guided mainly by popular media subjects and some reports given by the executive. However, with 
regard to the data from the statistical office (CSO), parliament was said to have been using it to 
inform policy and some types of projects being implemented in the country. In the absence of a 
functional WoGM&ES, parliamentarians were reported to be using any source of information such 
as the media and other unsubstantiated sources. This created information decay with credibility, 
reliability and relevance issues. To that extent, creating a stronger WoGM&E S, coupled with a 
robust national statistical system (NSS), would be the sure approach for Zambia (GRZ, 2018).  
 
  
Further, parliament was reported as not communicating its needs formally or informally through 
legislation that required particular information. No such formal or even informal requests were in 
place. Instead, it was reported that some requests from parliament to the executive were available, 
which sought explanations and certain statistics on issues. In such cases, the executive would 
respond by providing responses as requested by parliament. It was acknowledged that parliament 
had the capacity to use M&E information  effectively. However, before being used by 
parliamentarians, such information had to be appropriately packaged, presented, simpli fied and 
consistent. 
 
Sub-dimension 28: Civil society  
On the sub-dimension pertaining to civil society, a score of 2.0  was given, namely that elements 
exist. The role of civil society in the WoGM&ES was recognised. Procedures were in place for the 
participation of civil society, although these were not comprehensively clear. Through some 
institutional arrangements, civil society institutions were reported to be participating in M&E
<<<PAGE=231>>>
212 
 
activities such as JSRs and in technical working groups (TWGs) of various CAGs as implemented 
in the 7NDP (GRZ, 2017). 
 
The FNDP, SNDP and R -SNDP all documented the existence of CAGs  (initially called SAGs) . 
These institutional structures were created to support the implementation of government 
development plans and strategies th rough the participation of state and non -state actors (GRZ, 
2017). Thus, CSOs have institutionally been incorporated in the CAGs as a platform for their 
participation in the development processes of Zambia. Although this existed, clear CAG 
membership issue s regarding CSOs remained vague, hence rendering the institutional 
arrangements ad hoc. Nonetheless, the documents did not state the categorical procedures for the 
participation of civil society. The issues that CSOs were expected to table at meetings of C AGs 
were not stipulated, for instance. Such grey areas could affect participation and overall quality of 
engagement at meetings.  
 
Overall, the participation status of CSOs in the current implementation of government plans and 
strategies remained unclear and fragmented. This was reported to be true of other levels, namely 
national, line ministry, provincial and district. Document review revealed that a limited number of 
CSOs were taking part consistently. No structured reports for CAGs were found to give details of 
issues discussed in meetings. In addition, no incentives were reported to be in place to motivate 
civil society participation in the WoGM&ES.  Some individual CSOs were engaged in selected 
forums regarding monitoring NDP programmes. Civil Society f or Poverty Reduction (CSPR) for 
instance had been consistent in attending NDP stakeholder meetings. However, the voice of CSPR 
alone was not enough to demand accountability and good governance practices by government. 
Consequently, the weakness of CSOs in the country was reported to have led to a poorly 
performing WoGM&ES. Moreover, there was a suspicion among respondents that when CSOs or 
individual CSOs operated too close to government, their objectivity in holding government 
accountable weakened, since they turned into allies of government. This was a dilemma because 
CSOs are believed to be well placed to make government account for public goods and services, 
while these CSOs may be compromised by government.
<<<PAGE=232>>>
213 
 
It was established that civil society was no t represented appropriately in the coordination and 
liaison mechanisms of the WoGM&ES. Findings revealed that there were no civil society players 
in the whole of government implementation framework. While some CSOs were usually consulted 
on their input in the planning and preparation processes of NDPs, there were gaps in their 
engagement in the definition and implementation of M&E functions during the NDP 
implementation. In addition, no CSOs were consulted adequately about the roles they were 
expected to pl ay in the WoGM&ES.  There was no framework to coordinate civil society 
systematically in the country. As a result, it was not clear in the findings whether civil society had 
capacity to participate in the enhancement of the WoGM&ES. It was also found that t here were 
no or fragmented participatory mechanisms in place to obtain information from civil society in the 
formulation of NDPs based on the needs of the citizens. Consultations were held with various 
stakeholders, including civil society, through meeting s, symptoms and workshops. These forums 
were undertaken at national, line ministry, provincial and district level across the country during 
the preparation process of the 7NDP, for instance. However, there were no information 
mechanisms in place to learn w hich programmes of the NDP had received comments from civil 
society before, during and after implementation. Only comments on the holistic objectives of the 
plan were received.  
 
It was reported that the NDPs were made available to the public through the M NDP website and 
that some hard copies were disseminated across the country (MPSAs). Weak evidence was found 
that civil society exerted pressure on government for information about its performance in reducing 
poverty. Currently, there was limited demand for  M&E data from non -state actors because their 
own M&E was not results oriented or evidence based. Civil society in Zambia was reported to be 
fragmented, especially when it came to participation in the WoGM&ES. At best, they were 
working as individual organ isations and lacked collective bargaining in demanding results from 
the government and other development agencies. Even among themselves, CSOs failed to uphold 
high standards and practice for M&E at all levels,  
 
In addition, the WoGM&ES lacked a strategy for disseminating M&E outputs to the public and 
CSOs in particular. APRs were sparsely disseminated to civil society. A fragmented arrangement 
was reported to be in place whereby dissemination of M&E products was done through the national
<<<PAGE=233>>>
214 
 
development coordinating committee (NDCC), provincial development coordinating committees 
(PDCCs), district development coordinating committees (DDCCs) and cluster advisory groups 
(CAGs). There were p lans to strengthen the knowledge and management function to include 
dynamic sharing of information across a broader spectrum of stakeholders and development 
players. Civil society was acknowledged as having participated in the preparation of line ministry 
strategic plans at those levels only to some limited extent. Not all strategic plans were subjected to 
wider consultations outside the sectors.  
 
The wide publication of M&E information in the media was not practised in the WoGM&ES. 
Overall, media data in Zambia (especially among government institutions) was apparently not 
focused on development performance reporting. As a consequence, this led to challenges in 
information sharing across the WoGM&ES. However, only minimal M&E information on a few 
interventions was reported in the media  (many times, restricted to infrastructure r elated 
development). This also happened when there were interests and motivation to pursue on the media 
side. In M&E, all information is expected to be published so that stakeholders may use it to discuss 
ways of improving development interventions. The la ck of media involvement in the M&E 
architecture of the WoGM&ES for Zambia did not resonate well with the broader agenda of good 
governance and popular participation in national development. Furthermore, it was established 
that civil society in Zambia did not communicate its data needs to the WoGM&ES. There was no 
formal mechanism in place for M&E information sharing from CSOs to the WoGM&ES.  
 
Sub-dimension 29: Donors 
The sub-dimension concerning donors was given a score of 2.0  – elements exist. Development 
partners (DPs) and donors are key players in the evolution of M&E. Questions in the diagnostic 
checklist included: Is the role of donors recognised? Are there clear procedures for participation 
of donors? Do donors participate in joint sector reviews and/  or other working groups? (Holvoet 
& Renard, 2005, Holvoet & Inberg, 2011). As with civil society, the role of donors in the 
WoGM&ES was recognised. To some extent, there were clear procedures for their participation. 
Donors were reported to participate in  JSRs and technical working groups (TWGs) to a 
considerable level. In addition, the reviews of NDPs and APRs showed that although the role of 
donors was recognised and their participation institutionalised in the context of CAGs and other
<<<PAGE=234>>>
215 
 
bilateral and mul tilateral arrangements, their role in supporting the sustainability of M&E 
functions was weak and fragmented. Nonetheless, there was considerable acknowledgement of 
donor support to the strengthening of the WoG-M&ES through financial and technical assistance. 
However, this support was mainly conditional and inflexible, leading to ownership and 
sustainability challenges (GRZ, 2015, 2016, 2017; Kanyamuna et al., 2018). But although this was 
acknowledged, there was lack of a structural arrangement with regard to the role of DPs. The 
review showed some evidence of donors participating in JSRs and meetings of CAGs. Surprisingly 
though, separate M&E systems that were implemented by DPs and donors (that is, to serve their 
own interests) were referred to. This was r egarded as undermining the ownership, strengthening 
and sustainability the of country’s WoGM&ES.  
 
Nevertheless, DPs were acknowledged as playing an important liaison role in the coordination 
framework of WoGM&ES. They were reported as providing incentives  in the form of financial 
and technical assistance and encouraging government agencies (e.g. MPSAs) to use information 
from the WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2017). But despite their positive role, DPs were reported as not using 
the WoGM&ES themselves. This was partly because the WoGM&ES was in its infancy phase and 
had not meaningfully incorporated DPs in the system. The se fragmentations and inconsistencies 
are weaknesses in the system. This was also reported as a reason for DPs not fully embracing the 
government system f or M&E.  No strong evidence was found in which DPs consistently used 
information from the WoGM&ES. It was reported that some DPs were not helping to strengthen 
the WoGM&ES, but crowded out or weakened national accountability mechanisms through their 
partial participation and insistence on maintaining their own separate accountability mechanisms 
or M&E arrangements.  
 
The coordination of the demand for M&E data and information from DPs was reported to be weak. 
It was reported that financing from DPs towards M&E related activities was restricted to selected 
line ministries. Therefore, given the fragmented manner in which the M&E activities of DPs were 
coordinated, man y aspects remained undeveloped . In terms of the influence from DPs on the 
functioning of the WoGM&ES, DPs still needed to help by providing (flexible or unconditional) 
financial support for rolling out the WoGM&ES. It was also established that the divergent M&E 
requirements of DPs contributed to a sense of territoriality among government agencies, t hereby
<<<PAGE=235>>>
216 
 
discouraging smooth coordination of M&E activities in the WoGM&ES. There were cases such 
as the health sector in which each development partner wanted to develop its own database to 
provide information on indicators of their subject. When the types of M&E and reporting 
requirements for DPs were assessed, it was gathered that DPs needed government statistics and 
performance data for indicators for their own planning and resource allocation. Usually DPs 
demanded outcome and impact-level information, which the WoGM&ES was unable to generate 
systematically since national surveys were undertaken irregularly. Consequently, DPs used this 
gap to justify the maintenance of their parallel M&E systems for the projects they supported.  
For that reason, government  was currently encouraging DPs to use national M&E arrangements 
and frameworks as a way of harmonising and strengthening the WoGM&ES. Again, this practice 
by DPs could undermine the building and sustaining of the WoGM&ES for the country. Instead 
of working to build and strengthen internal systems for M&E, DPs ultimately weakened the line 
ministry arrangements for M&E and the WoGM&ES. With regard to whether DPs used the 
WoGM&ES for their own monitoring and reporting needs, it was reported that this was not really 
the case.  
 
In terms of other mechanisms used by the DPs, it was reported that they engaged in dialogue 
meetings, which were held periodically, through quarterly and annual reviews (for example JARs 
in health and education sectors). Thus DPs were rep orted to be influencing the operations of the 
WoGM&ES to some extent. For instance, sectors were allegedly influenced at times to focus on 
collecting data that were specific to the needs of DPs. As a result, data needed for the WoGM&ES 
to meet the needs of  a wider audience  was not collected. As to whether the demand for M&E 
information by DPs influenced the WoGM&ES in producing data and information, it was 
established that DPs usually financed the production of statistics and other information types vital 
to their own planning, implementation and reporting requirements. It was also reported that DPs 
did not coordinate their M&E requirements among themselves. There were many parallel demands 
for statistics, data, information and reports from various DPs.  
 
7.3.6 Use of monitoring and evaluation outputs  
The final component is the use of M&E outputs. The topics in this dimension include the 
availability of M&E outputs, effective use of M&E by donors, effective use of M&E at central
<<<PAGE=236>>>
217 
 
level, effective use of M&E a t sector, provincial and district level, and effective use of M&E by 
actors outside government.   
 
Sub-dimension 30: Outputs 
The outputs sub -dimension was given a s core of 2.0, namely that elements exist. The diagnostic 
checklist sought to find out whether there was a presentation of M&E results , based on clear 
targets. The study also checked whether there was an analysis of discrepancies and whether the 
M&E outputs were differentiated according to audience. Further, the utilisation of information 
from the WoGM&ES by donors and whether they demanded M&E data in a coordinated manner 
was assessed. At national and decentralised level, the study sought to assess whether results of 
M&E activities were used effectively for internal purposes and as instruments of po licy making 
and policy influencing and advocacy. As for the effective use of M&E by actors outside 
government, the study assessed whether results of M&E were used as instruments to hold 
government accountable. T he review also checked the availability of M&E outputs in meeting the 
information needs of stakeholders. Questions include d: Is there a presentation of relevant M&E 
results? Are results compared to targets? Is there an analysis of discrepancies? Is the M&E output 
differentiated to different audiences ? These questions were useful in understanding the M&E 
outputs at all levels of the WoGM&ES.  
 
The assessment showed that there is a presentation of M&E results to some extent. As much as 
possible, results were compared with targets. However, the review indicated that there was limited 
analysis of discrepancies. In addition, the M&E outputs were not differentiated for audiences. 
According to GRZ (2017), there was need for implementing agencies to give feedback on the 
implementation of development interventi ons in their jurisdiction. Such information therefore 
would be useful to inform development processes, including policy making and decision making. 
Monthly management monitoring reports, quarterly reports and annual reports were key M&E 
outputs that MPSAs were expected to produce. Apparently not all agencies produced such reports.  
 
The NDPs reviewed singled out APRs as key outputs in the implementation of national plans and 
in the realisation of Vision 2030. In the APRs, performance results were compared with the targets 
as much as possible although in many instances, information was lacking to undertake such
<<<PAGE=237>>>
218 
 
analytical comparison. This was made possible through the use of an indicator system, whereby 
KPIs were agreed upon by stakeholders during the prepara tion of an NDP. Progress was then 
tracked cumulatively and measured against the set targets (GRZ, 2015, 2016, 2017). To some 
extent, analyses of discrepancies were made and possible attributions highlighted. Although 
outputs were prepared to meet the needs  of stakeholders, they were not simplified enough to be 
used by all stakeholders. The reports were reported to be written primarily to meet the needs of 
government institutions (GRZ, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017). APRs were rep orted to have content 
inadequacies in that they were based solely on monitoring information received from the sectors. 
They did not contain evaluation findings (GRZ, 2018). This was attributed, among other reasons, 
to few evaluations being commissioned to supplement the monitoring informati on. Coupled with 
this was the reference to the lack of a dedicated budget to fund evaluations. Further, it was 
mentioned severally that there were no multi -year evaluation plans at district, provincial, sector 
and national level (GRZ, 2015). Therefore, because of the content and analytical gaps in the APRs, 
the utilisation of these documents by stakeholders was low and fragmented.  
 
Catalogues of outputs for the WoGM&ES were acknowledged to be available only at national 
level and in a few line ministries. Lack of a published catalogue of all outputs was acknowledged 
as a weakness that kept away many stakeholders and possible users of M&E information. Such 
information lapses led to policy and decision-making processes being undertaken without evidence 
at all levels of governance (GRZ, 2015). However, this was not a common practice in institutions 
and levels across government, though many MPSAs maintained clearly defined outputs. Where 
output catalogues were available, it was reported that their regular updates  were not easy to 
establish across the MPSAs.  
 
It was reported that calendar schedules for outputs were in place, though irregular, particularly for 
7NDP implementation. Only calendars for selected outputs were acknowledged to be in place. 
This was said to have been developed in MS Excel after the publication of the Implementation 
Plan (volume II of the 7NDP). Whether calendar output schedules were advertised to the public 
and stakeholders was not clear. Only plans to circulate the calendar to stakeholders were stated to 
be in place.  It was gathered that the release of outputs to all interested parties was not done 
simultaneously. For APRs, only a limited audience was reached during the launches, while many
<<<PAGE=238>>>
219 
 
others were not. This was similar to other institutional reports. A few uncoordinated disseminations 
in the provinces and a few districts were also reported. While these outputs were disseminated, not 
all users had equal access. It was acknowledged that not all stakeholders had access to hard copy 
reports. At the same time, not all users across government had Internet connectivity to access the 
reports on institutional websites. This situation limited the accessibility and utilisation of M&E 
information, particularly in advocacy, decision - and policy-making processes. In many cases, it 
was acknowledged that sources, methods, and procedures related to the production of outputs were 
published and available, but only to some users. However, this was done only by embedding these 
elements in the reports. Many st akeholders remained unaware of these reports. Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES did not have an arrangement in which products were available in various formats. It 
was stressed that suitable products to meet the information needs of decentralised structures were 
not available. Therefore, these gaps explained why the WoGM&ES was still in its infancy stage, 
with many aspects needing attention (OECD/DAC, 2007a). 
 
Similarly, no dissemination or communication strategy was mentioned for outputs produced by 
the WoGM&ES. None of th e actors in the system were linked to any such strategies. Currently, 
only ad hoc dissemination arrangements existed, which were determined mainly as and when there 
was a report to disseminate. For instance, there was no national forum on which the dissemination 
of the content of the report would be made and particular issues of public development concern 
clarified. However, the MNDP was creating a strategy to disseminate M&E outputs from the 
WoGM&ES. No systems or arrangements apparently existed to maintai n and disseminate M&E 
information except for ideas and plans within the MNDP (the central agency). Therefore, the aspect 
of whether such systems were friendly did not arise. 
 
Sub-dimension 31: Effective use of monitoring and evaluation by donors 
This sub-dimension was scored 1.0 – little action taken. While the availability of designated M&E 
outputs was an important aspect to take into account, their utilisation was paramount. Therefore, 
the effective utilisation of M&E outputs by donors is a critical element in the diagnostic checklist 
for a successful M&E system. Key questions included: Are donors using the outputs of the 
WoGM&ES for their information needs? Is the demand for M&E data from donors coordinated? 
It was revealed that donors were using the outputs of M&E systems for their information needs, at
<<<PAGE=239>>>
220 
 
least to a limited extent. Further, the demand for M&E data from donors was apparently not fully 
coordinated. APRs were produced from sector reports on progress in the implementation of 
programmes in NDPs.  Thus, donors were expec ted to use APRs and sector reports (which are 
M&E products) to meet their information needs. The review of APRs and sector reports showed 
weak evidence in the utilisation of M&E system information by donors. The demand for 
information by donors was also uncoordinated (GRZ, 2017). According to GRZ (2015, 2016, 
2017), such practices or weaknesses in the WoGM&ES motivate donors to maintain parallel M&E 
systems to satisfy their own information needs.  
 
Sub-dimension 32: Effective use of monitoring and evaluation at central level 
A score of 2.0, namely that elements exist, was given for this sub-dimension. Another significant 
demand for M&E outputs is at central level.  Accordingly, the checklist sought to establish these 
aspects: Are results of M&E activities used for internal purposes? Are the results an instrument of 
policy-making and policy -influencing and advocacy at central level? (Holvoet & Inberg, 2011). 
Central-level institutions herein refer to agencies such as ministries of financ e, planning, and 
cabinet office. The review showed that results of M&E activities were used for internal purposes, 
but in an ad hoc way. To some extent, M&E results were an instrument of policy making, but 
hardly of policy influencing and advocacy at centr al level. The NDPs indicated that results from 
M&E activities were supposed to inform and influence development processes such as pla nning, 
budgeting, decision -making, and policy making. There was some evidence of utilising M&E 
information in the planning process of NDPs ( for example 7NDP benefited from APRs, reviews 
and evaluations). In addition, there was a weak mention of utilising M&E information in the APRs 
to inform budgeting processes  by MPSAs . But no evidence was found of utilising M&E 
information to influence policy or advocacy at central level.  
 
Sub-dimension 33: Effective use of monitoring and evaluation at local level 
For this sub-dimension, a score of 1.0 was given, representing little action taken. The demand for 
and utilisation of M&E information at local or decentralised levels was also deemed important. In 
the checklist, these questions are asked: Are results of M&E activities used for internal purposes? 
Are M&E results an instrument of policy making and policy influencing and advocacy at lo cal
<<<PAGE=240>>>
221 
 
level? (Holvoet & Renard, 2011 ; Holvoet & Inberg, 2009 ). In the diagnosis, it was found that 
results of M&E activities were used for internal purposes, but in an ad hoc way. It was an 
instrument of policy making, but hardly one of policy influencing and advocacy at local level. As 
at central level, NDPs indicated that results from M&E activities were supposed to inform 
development processes. There was evidence of M&E information being utilised in preparing NDPs 
(for example, 7NDP benefited from APRs, reviews and evaluations). In addition, there was a weak 
mention of information being utilise d in the APRs to inform budgeting (at sector and provincial 
level only). However, no evidence was found in the review of utilising M&E information at local 
level, particularly at district and sub-district level (GRZ, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017).  
 
Sub-dimension 34: Effective use of monitoring and evaluation by actors outside government  
The score given for this sub-dimension was 1.0 – little action taken. The effective use of M&E by 
actors outside government was another key aspect under the checklist. This question was asked: 
Are results of M&E used as an instrument to hold government accountable? The question is 
fundamental in providing accountability information tha t is key to further processes such as 
informing decision and policy making at various levels of government. The results of M&E were 
reported to be utilised, but to a limited extent and by only a few actors outside government, such 
as civil society, parliam ent and donors (GRZ, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017). Furthermore, no 
clear evidence was found of the use of  results from M&E by actors outside government in the 
documents (NDPs, APRs, and sector reports). However, there was only an ad hoc mention of a 
few actors outside government using information from M&E (few members of the civil society 
and professional development bodies such as Civil Society for Poverty Reduction, Economics 
Association of Zambia) (GRZ, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017).  
 
7.4 Conclusion  
 
Zambia’s WoGM&ES was diagnosed as being predominantly weak. This overall conclusion is 
consistent with those in other studies (World Bank, 2007, OECD/DAC, 2011, Kanyamuna, 2013). 
Although the study findings indicated that the system had positiv e aspects that were developed 
and functioning fairly well, most components were still underdeveloped and needed more work. 
Six dimensions were used to undertake the in -depth assessment of Zambia’s WoGM&ES. These
<<<PAGE=241>>>
222 
 
components are policy, methodology, organisa tion, capacity, participation of actors outside 
government, and use of information from M&E. Using research results gathered from methods 
such as semi -structured survey questionnaires, interview schedules, focus group discussions 
(FGDs) and review of a wide range of literature, it was established that Zambia had a WoGM&ES 
in place. Sources of data included key informants from across government structures at national, 
line ministry, provincial and district level. Others were from non -state actors. These incl uded 
parliament, civil society, development partners, and academia , among others . Despite various 
structural and systemic challenges being faced  currently, Zambia could be said to be in the right 
direction in terms of building and strengthening its WoGM&ES. However, the results have shown 
that a great deal of focus and investment is needed in dedicating local resources and expertise so 
that ownership and sustainability of the national system for M&E will be possible.  
 
Of the six diagnostic dimensions, the methodology component was the most developed , with a 
LEADS score of 3, signifying action had been taken, while the participation of actors outside 
government was the least developed with a LEADS score of 1, signifying little action had been 
taken. The rest of the dimensions each had a 2-point score, signifying that only elements of M&E 
existed. Although the scores revealed diverse levels of development for each component, it is 
important to recognise that intra -dimension dynamics also exist.  To appreciate w hich M&E 
element needs more attention, it is crucial to consider the entire diagnosis in detail. What came out 
clearly in the diagnostic exercise is that Zambia is responding positively to national and 
international calls to improve governance systems and practices. But general and specific aspects 
require strengthening throughout the WoGM&ES at national, line ministry, provincial and district 
level. Also, non-state actors have many aspects to improve to assist in the building, strengthening 
and sustaining of Zambia’s WoGM&ES.  
 
The next chapter, Chapter 7 is focused at providing holistic remedial actions towards making the 
WoGM&ES for Zambia robust and functionally sound in terms of meeting the information needs 
of various stakeholders in the country’s deve lopment efforts . Guided closely by the research 
findings of this study, the chapter proposes an alternative model to the Government of Zambia 
towards the enhancement of the country’s system for monitoring and evaluation. The model is 
flexible to some exten t possible —decentralised structures for instance may go ahead to make
<<<PAGE=242>>>
223 
 
improvements to their M&E functions without necessarily depending on the national level 
improvements. However, the model makes an emphasis that the efforts should be at all levels if 
the WoGM&ES for Zambia was to be properly functional to meet the expectations of stakeholders 
and contribute to the good governance and poverty reduction agenda of the country.

CHAPTER 8 
 
Proposed Model for Zambia’s Enhanced Whole-of-Government 
Monitoring and Evaluation System  
 
 8.1 Introduction    
 
The diagnosis of the functionality of Zambia’s whole -of-government monitoring and evaluation 
system (WoGM&ES) showed that it is weak, in specific and general terms. In all six dimensions 
that were assessed, name ly policy, methodology, organisation, capacity, participation of actors 
outside government, and use of information from M&E, the results have shown that many aspects 
require to be fixed if the country’s public sector M&E system is to be functional to meet 
stakeholder information needs. Thus, Chapter 8 presents a proposed alternative model of 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements for the improved functionality of the WoGM&ES 
for Zambia’s public sector. In many ways, the model seeks to address the challenges identified in 
this research study and other future improvements to strengthen and sustain the national system.  
  
To begin with, the chapter describes two cornerstones that are essential for a stronger national level 
M&E system. These are the capacities to supply M&E information, and to demand M&E 
information. This section is discussed in the context of the diagnostic results and as key ingredients 
that are critical for any given M&E system. The next section presents the proposed model to better 
M&E for Zambia’s public sector. This model is based on the need to strike a balance between 
developing, strengthening and sustaining the country level M&E system focused on capacity to 
supply M&E information and the capacity to demand for M&E information. It c oncludes with a 
summary of the model and its implication for the enhanced WoGM&ES for Zambia.  
 
8.2 Cornerstones for a stronger whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation system  
Several experts and practitioners in the field of M&E articulated a number of key requirements for 
a successful nati onal M&E system ( see section 6.9 ). These  checklists converge on a few 
fundamentals that have a holistic effect on functional country level M&E systems (see 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 
6.2.3 & 6.2.4). Herein called the ‘cornerstones’ for a stronger WoGM&ES, I used the checklist by
<<<PAGE=244>>>
225 
 
Bedi et. al. (2006) as a framework to synchronise aspects deemed critical to the creation and 
sustenance of a WoGM&ES (see 6.2.4).  
 
Any national system for M&E that seeks to function to the satisfaction of its stakeholders requires 
two aspects to be fully functional (Schiavo-Campo, 2005; Bedi et. al., 2006; Mehrotra, 2013; IEG, 
2013). These are c apacity to supply M&E information, and capacity to demand and use M&E 
information. The contention is that once these two aspects are fully developed, they would help to 
generate country -specific information and assist in identifying roles and responsibilities of 
stakeholders in pursuit of building and sustaining a stronger WoGM&ES. When these two sides 
of an M&E s ystem are strengthened, opportunities, limitations, and options for building and 
strengthening a realistic system for M&E are identifiable and remedial actions are determined. For 
Zambia, all these aspects were found by this research study  to be weak in va rious degrees. 
Although some aspects were reported to be working fairly well, compared with others, the holistic 
status of the WoGM&ES still requires fixing and ownership by government institutions and 
citizens. It is based on this finding that these success cornerstones are presented here as vital to the 
proposed model for a better and strengthened system for M&E of Zambia’s public sector.  
 
Table 8.1. Scope of a poverty reduction monitoring and evaluation system  
A country monitoring and evaluation system should deliver timely and reliable data and analysis to feed into the 
policy process. To accomplish this, it must include a range of functions that are specifically institutional in nature, 
including coordination among data prod ucers to establish a common set of indicators and eliminate gaps and 
redundancies; the development of common standards, procedures, and platforms; a strengthening of monitoring 
capacity across the government administration; the organisation of information flows among stakeholders inside 
and outside government; the compilation and analysis of data from various sources; data analysis and 
program/intervention evaluation; the generation of annual progress reports and other outputs; the provision of 
advice and s upport to policy makers; the dissemination of outputs across government and to the public; and the 
organization of the participation of civil society and parliament. 
 
Conceptually, these elements all form part of the national monitoring and evaluation syst em. However, it is 
important to recall that, at the outset, most of the actors involved will not recognise their activities as part of a 
national system. Whether they will participate vigorously in making the country monitoring and evaluation system 
operational depends largely on their interests and incentives. The rules, both formal and informal, that govern these 
incentives are therefore a key dimension of the country-level monitoring system. 
Source: Bedi et. al., 2006, p. 76-77
<<<PAGE=245>>>
226 
 
A number of aspects need to be in place before an M&E system is functioning to meet the needs 
of stakeholders. The two cornerstones are described briefly. In section 8.3, they are used to show 
what needs to be done for Zambia’s WoGM&ES to be strengthened.  
 
8.2.1 The supply side  
Organising the supply side of a country’s M&E system is not an easy undertaking. It requires a 
great deal  of capacity and determination from those who pursue the task (Bedi et al., 2006; 
Kanyamuna et al., 2018). The complexity of developing and strengthening the supply side comes 
in view of having in place many stakeh olders who are expected to invest resources in building 
M&E systems to serve nationwide information needs. In the process, several systems may be 
created that work in parallel and at times in conflict, leading to problems of duplication and 
redundancies in data collection, gaps or imbalances in M&E, lack of data compatibility, and poor 
information flows (Schiavo-Campo, 2005; Bedi et. al., 2006 & Mackay, 2007). 
 
a) Institutional context and design  
The institutional context and design is concerned with the recognition that for a successful 
WoGM&ES to exist, stakeholders and their buy -in are critical. Positive rela tionships and 
collaborations among these stakeholders in the functionality of M&E are understood to be the 
foundation for a thriving culture of M&E in the country. However, Zaltsman (2006) and Bedi et. 
al. (2006) caution that attaining stakeholder buy-in should be dependent on the nature of the system 
design and its process, which include mapping existing M&E arrangements that identify the main 
stakeholder dynamics. Similarly, the process should involve identifying and analysing strengths 
and weaknesses and providing clear statements of political commitment to effective M&E; having 
transformative champions, who advocate for a shared system across all government administrative 
structures; and putting in place an arrangement to serve as a consultation and facilitation platform 
that assists stakeholders in articulating their needs and expectations.
<<<PAGE=246>>>
227 
 
b) Leadership  
Experience has suggested that the choice of any institutional leadership for the system is critical, 
because the function of leadership is better located close to the centre of government or placed 
under the budget function, de pending on where effective power and authority over the NDP 
process is situated. Regardless of location, the leadership role must be given serious attention in 
every institution and needs to benefit from skilled and dedicated staff and adequate resources (Bedi 
et al., 2006; Kanyamuna et al., 2018; Schiavo-Campo, 2005).  
 
c) Coordination 
Organising a coordination mechanism that is effective from among the development agencies 
could be one of the most challenging undertakings in creating a WoGM&ES. Effective support 
from a secretariat or central agency could ensure that stak eholder meetings were focused and 
substantive (Bedi et al., 2006 and Görgens & Kusek, 2009). However, such an agency or secretariat 
would need to be conversant  with national priorities as listed in NDPs and possess skills and 
experience in mediating stakeholders to find common ground. Thus, the secretariat should be a 
relatively small but highly competent unit at central level. To be effective, such a unit needs strong 
and stable qualified and practically committed staffing that focuses on unifying all state and non -
state M&E mechanisms.  
 
d) Liaison with line ministries 
In practice, a WoGM&ES is dependent on the quality of sectoral and other decentralised 
information systems. The national level M&E system may be required to incorporate strategies for 
promoting M&E among line ministries, provinces and districts, using rules and guidelines that 
demand the incorporation of M&E functions in departmental work plans, budg ets and staff job 
descriptions (Bedi et al., 2006; Bossert, Chitah, & Bowser, 2003; GRZ, 2017b) . To design and 
implement such institutional environments, M&E capacity strengthening programmes across line 
ministries will be needed to produce the data for the system.
<<<PAGE=247>>>
228 
 
e) Links to the national statistical system 
There is a fundamental requirement to ensure that there are functional complementarities between 
the statistical system and the WoGM&ES. It is usually the responsibility of national s tatistics 
agencies to set up quality and technical standards for use by administrative data producers in their 
work of technical capacity building backstopping ( Holvoet & Renard, 2007; Kanyamuna, 2013; 
Mehrotra, 2013). However, owing to poor funding modalities to national statistics institutes, which 
is usually biased towards financing large surveys and statistical operations, support to 
strengthening the M&E function and its complementary roles remains weaker.  
 
f) Involvement of local governments 
The design of local monitoring arrangements depends on the government structure and 
predominantly on the degree of fiscal and policy autonomy given to local governments (Basheka 
& Byamugisha, 2015; Bedi et al., 2006) . In an attempt to develop functional W oGM&E 
arrangements, some countries are continuously encouraging local governments to create, 
strengthen and sustain their own systems so that in the long run will support the objective of desired 
decentralisation (Republic of South Africa, 2006). 
 
g) Information communications and technology 
 On the supply side of any M&E system, it is important to invest heavily in  information 
communication technology (ICT). ICT provides the platform under which information is 
effectively and efficiently collected, stored, analysed, reported and disseminated to stakeholders. 
Management information systems (MISs) that are powered by ICT offer easy solutions to M&E 
and coordination and information sharing faster and more comprehensive. Through ICT, 
integrating individually developed – and in some instances parallel M&E systems – becomes 
feasible and this helps in achieving a WoGM&ES ( Wagner & Kozma, 2005; GRZ, 2017). Thus, 
in a world in which  information technology has spread and become the common way of 
development operation, the  government of Zambia has all the motivation to embark on ICT 
development to support its WoGM&ES.

8.2.2 The demand side  
In addition to putting in place an effective institutional supply side, it is critical to build a robust 
demand side for an M&E system to operate successfully. Even more so, as Bedi et. al. (2006:83) 
warn, “ effective demand is crucial and depends on many factors outside the scope of the 
WoGM&ES and cannot easily be institutionalised” . Certain fundamental elements constitute the 
demand side of an M&E system and are summarised below.  
 
a) Analysis and evaluation 
For an M&E system to have a robust and well-developed demand side, it is necessary to invest in 
the capacities to undertake quality analysis and evaluation of policies and programmes. If these 
practices are still in their infancy, an M&E system may introduce them in phases, for instance 
starting with the collection of quality data, followed by capacity building for analysis of data, and 
finally, the institutionalisation of the practice of utilising the data to evaluate policies and 
programmes (Bedi et al., 2006:84).  
 
b) Outputs and dissemination 
There should be commitment to the compilation and analysis of appropriate outputs of M&E 
information in readiness for their dissemination and distribution to a wider audience within and 
outside government. The ultimate usefulness of any M&E system is really the ability  for its 
information to be utilised by stakeholders (Bamberger, 2008; Fourth High Level Forum on Aid 
Effectiveness, 2011). According to Bedi et al. (2006)  and Mehrotra (2013), a good WoGM&ES 
will generate a range of outputs to meet the information needs of various audiences and will include 
a dissemination strategy that reaches all its intended users. For example, all development issues of 
relevance to local communit ies will be appropriately reported within suitable M&E outputs 
designed for the general public.  
 
c) Linking WoG-M&E system to planning and budgeting processes  
Creating a link between the WoGM&ES and the planning and budgeting processes is a powerful 
way of generating demand for M&E (Kanyamuna et al., 2018; Kusek & Rist, 2004; Kusek & Rist,
<<<PAGE=249>>>
230 
 
2002). For this reason, Pitchett, Samji and Hammer (2012) assert that when agencies bid for public 
resources, this is an opportunity to ask them to just ify their policies and plans, based on evidence 
provided by M&E data. For instance, in linking the WoGM&ES to the budget, care needs to be 
taken to avoid undesired effects. M&E data will not always be satisfactory and used to set annual 
priorities for expe nditure. Attributing the results to spending could be problematic, especially 
when multiple interventions could have influenced the results. For instance, if budget releases were 
unreliable, it could lead to difficulties in holding public sector implementers accountable for their 
performance. Consequently, simply because the responsible agency may have performed poorly 
at M&E, sanctions may be difficult to enforce since they might lead to cuts in funding for some 
interventions (Bedi et al., 2006). 
 
d) The role of parliament 
Parliaments should be key users of M&E information from poverty reduction interventions (Aguja 
& Born, 2016 ; Eberlei & Henn, 2003) . However, in practical terms, parliaments have not been 
proactively involved in the activities of WoGM&ES (Bedi et al., 2006; Kanyamuna, 2013; 
Kanyamuna et al., 2018). Therefore, without a strong committee system, supported by experienced 
research staff, these parliaments are generally unable to engage effectively with the executive on 
policy issues (Holvoet & Inberg, 2012a; Holvoet & Renard, 2007) . As an example,  public 
committee hearings on NDP implementation, based on annual progress reports (APRs) and other 
outputs, would help to raise the profile of a WoGM&ES. This process would be enhanced if the 
role of parliamentary committees was institutionalised in the W oGM&ES or if technical and 
financial support was provided to parliament. To assist in interpreting data, parliamentarians may 
draw on expertise in civil society and academia, thus helping to forge useful alliances and broaden 
the inputs into the policy process (Bedi et al., 2006; Nelson, 2016). 
 
e) Organising civil society participation 
CSOs can play various roles in  a WoGM&ES as producers and users of M&E information. A 
WoGM&ES may therefore provide an opportunity to sustain participation of these actors over a 
longer period.  The extent and nature of civil society participation in a WoGM&ES varies 
considerably. For instance, where civil society is already highly mobilised ar ound development
<<<PAGE=250>>>
231 
 
issues, popular participation in development policy tends to be well institutionalised and 
sometimes supported by legal mandates. On the other hand, where there is little tradition of civil 
society involvement in the policy process, buildi ng up interest and capacity in such involvement 
must be a longer-term goal (Bedi et al., 2006; Guzman, 2014; Mulonda, Kanyamuna & Kanenga, 
2018). 
 
8.3 The new model  
 
For Zambia to build, strengthen and sustain its WoGM&ES, deliberate and consistent steps will 
be inevitable. The transformational improvements and accompanying M&E reforms will be 
needed at two leve ls of the overall WoGM&ES, namely transforming the supply side, and 
transforming the demand side (see section 8.2). In addressing these requirements, building and 
sustaining a functional system for M&E will be a gradual and complex task. It demands detaile d 
knowledge across sectors, and of interactions among planning, budgeting, and implementation 
functions in the public sector. The matter is complicated even further whenever the machinery of 
government is decentralised, with powers and functions shared and spread across the three spheres 
of government —executive, legislature and judiciary. It is precisely this kind of complex 
intergovernmental structure, with diffuse powers and functions, which requires strong M&E 
systems to promote coordination and prevent fragmentation as a country thrives to achieve good 
governance and poverty reduction.  
 
8.3.1 Model synopsis  
The rationale of this proposed model is premised on the need to put in place five (5) functionality 
dimensions meant to improve the M&E coordination function: 
a) Clarity on the common purpose of implementing a WoGM&ES  
b) The Zambian governance structure  
c) Independent evaluation structure  
d) Government-wide integrated ICT infrastructure and arrangements   
e) Decentralised and integrated national statistical system
<<<PAGE=251>>>
232 
 
a) Clarity on the common purpose of implementing a WoGM&ES  
Why is the Zambian government motivated to build, strengthen and sustain a functional 
WoGM&ES? This question is important if the country’s system for M&E is to be built on solid 
ground. Responses to the question will trigger all sorts of operational questions : What? How? 
When? Who? Zambia is among the poorest countries of the world and is plunged in the vicious 
cycle of deprivation and want. Efforts by government and citizens should be towards emancipating 
the country from this dire situation. Poverty levels are currently high and increasing at over 60%, 
as is unemployment, especially among the youth and women, and inequalities, yet the country still 
depends on the mono economy of copper.  
 
In building and strengthening its WoGM&ES, Zambia, like any other country, will need to provide 
a commonly shared justification for embarking on such effort. The purpose must be widely 
appreciated and stakeholder buy -in built so that the implementation process is not a preserve of 
one agency, but of the entire government machinery. For instance, many factors led the South 
African government to recognise the need for a government -wide monitoring and evaluation 
(GWM&E) system. Among other reasons, the government o f South Africa faced an increasing 
emphasis on service delivery and the gathering of non-financial information, in pursuit of greater 
value for money spent ( Republic of South Africa, 2008).  This model contends that while the 
Zambian government may be certain about the purpose of implementing the WoGM&ES (even in 
a fragmented manner, as found in this study), the current weak position must be reconsidered. A 
thorough process of broad-based advocacy among key stakeholders on the need to build a robust 
evidence-based WoGM&ES becomes inevitable. Doing so will be useful in that investing in such 
a system will not only be expensive in terms of resources, but in building consensus among the 
citizens and institutions that are critical to owning and sustaining such a system in the long term. 
This model challenges the status quo of being comfortable in implementing the current 
WoGM&ES in a fragmented manner where key government structures such as line ministries, 
provinces and districts could not show common understandi ng of the WoGM&ES. Various and 
varying definitions of the system (WoGM&ES) were given with misinterpretation and even 
misunderstandings of what it is intended to achieve. For such reasons, when a clearly and 
commonly shared position on the common meaning, rationale, objectives and goal of a functional 
WoGM&ES are attained, Zambia will be on a sustainable path towards a successful system.
<<<PAGE=252>>>
233 
 
b) Zambian governance structure  
It is crucial to appreciate the structure of the Zambian governance system. The development  
process is facilitated by the governance structure as enshrined in the national constitution. Thus, 
the WoGM&E is proposed to be anchored on the Zambian Constitution, backed by all appropriate 
current laws and those to be enacted in future. The system sho uld be well linked to all the three 
arms of government, namely executive, judiciary and legislature, as shown in Figure 8.1.  
 
Figure 8.1. Three branches of the Zambian governance system 
Source: Grade 7 Social Studies, Longman Zambia Educational Limited, 2017, p. 21   
Figure 8.1 shows the three branches of government, which work in complementarity in service of 
the Zambian population. Their core roles are as follows: 
The legislature  makes the laws of the country and controls the executive. The executive runs 
the country according to its laws, and makes decisions for the  country. It is also called the 
government. The judiciary makes sure that the laws of the country are obeyed through the courts.  
 
c) Independent evaluation structure  
This model recommends in the strongest possible way the creation of a separate , autonomous, 
neutral and independent institution mandated with the responsibility of conducting ‘strategic
<<<PAGE=253>>>
234 
 
national evaluations’ in Zambia. Currently, the evaluation role is at its weakest or, worse still, 
‘non-existent’ (see sub-section 7.3.1 & 7.3.4). Yet, the evaluation function is the most critical part 
of any successful WoGM&ES (Cuesta, 2014). For Zambia, it is not surprising that the situation of 
a weak evaluation culture is like this, because the reason for putting an M&E system in place was 
driven mostly by the World Bank and IMF during the implementation of the PRSP programme 
between 2000 and 2004  (see section 1.3) . If the demand had been internally driven and owned, 
probably practices such as embedding a strong ‘evaluative culture’ within the current weak 
WoGM&ES would be addressed. Although this view seems to be far -fetched for Zambia, it 
remains the correct and feasible way to proceed—establishing an independent evaluation office.  
 
Countries that are seen to be implementing successful WoGM&ES with strong ‘eva luation’ 
cultures embedded in them include Colombia, Mexico, Chile, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada 
and Australia (see Lopez-Acevedo et al., 2012; Mackay, 2007; Republic of South Africa, 2008) . 
These countries are report ed to have built strong evaluative functions as a starting point when 
creating their systems for M&E and have invested time and resources to strike a balance between 
strengthening the supply and demand sides of their systems. Similarly, this model proposes  that 
since Zambia’s WoGM&ES was still at its embryonic stage, it is important that the culture and 
practice of evaluation within the system are embraced. But as this effort is being embarked on, 
serious buy-in from the political leadership and the civil s ervice must lead the transformational 
shift. As in these best practice countries, setting up a separate structure for undertaking strategic 
national evaluations would be inevitable and an effort in the right direction. But the location of 
this structure must be given operational and resource independence to give it ‘teeth’ by producing 
evidence for improvement of service delivery in the public sector.  
 
d) Government-wide integrated information technology and communications infrastructure  
To have in place a f unctional WoGM&ES, this model proposes restructuring and strengthening 
the current information technology and communications (ICT) set up across the public sector. 
Accordingly, all the four operational levels of government will need to host ICT portals, wh ich 
will be data and information gateways that feed into the national and provincial databases. ICT 
improvement will serve as a powerful enabler towards integrating systems and sub-systems, which 
will ultimately help create a holistic WoGM&ES. However, the findings in this study have shown
<<<PAGE=254>>>
235 
 
that currently the evolution of ICT to support the WoGM&ES is at its weakest  (see sub-section 
7.3.1). Nevertheless, this model contends that if progress was to be made, government may have 
no alternative but to invest mea ningfully in the ICT sector to support a robust M&E function in 
the country. The Smart Zambia Institute (SZI) initiative is a positive starting point. However, there 
is need for the institution to expand to all operational areas of government to support and host the 
WoGM&ES ICT component.  
 
Figure 8.2 below shows the ICT infrastructural arrangements that need to be introduced and 
strengthened throughout the government structures. The proposal is to have two functional ICT 
aspects, a portal for official data entry, and a database for data and information storage. These are 
proposed to be placed at every operational level of the WoGM&ES ( that is, presidency, national, 
line ministry, provincial and district level). Effectively therefore, these ICT infrastructur es are 
proposed to be synchronised with the statistical functions at all levels. This entails that for all the 
statistical information collected by CSO across the country will need to sit on these ICT platforms 
or be functionally linked. Current statistical arrangements will need to be restructured to meet the 
proposed institutional and information system design, particularly in terms of ICT and other 
resource capacities, such as human, financial, material and skills. 
 
Figure 8. 2. Government M&E and information communication technology portals
<<<PAGE=255>>>
236 
 
In Figure 8.2 the linkage relationships that are portrayed between levels (shown by arrows) are 
important. In terms of the M&E championship, it is proposed that more effort in inculcating  the 
culture and practice of results evolves from the presidency, to national level institutions, to line 
ministries, to provinces, and all the way to district and sub -district level. At the same time, ICT -
aided M&E and statistical portals as well as  databases will flow downwards from district level , 
feeding into provincial, line ministry, national and finally into the evaluation database. In addition, 
institutions at each level will be responsible for maintaining databases and utilising the information 
for their decision-making processes. Through this kind of interaction and operation, it is seen as a 
practical approach to building and sustaining a stronger supply - and demand- side and ultimately 
the WoGM&ES for the Zambian public sector.  
 
e) Decentralised and integrated National Statistical System  
Promising efforts to re-engineer the operations of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) have been 
reported. These efforts are proposed in the draft national strategy for the development of statistics 
(NSDS) 2014-2018 and the National Statistical System (NSS).  However, it was gathered that the 
current linkages and functional relationships between the WoGM&ES and the NSS are weak and 
fragmented (see details 7.3.3) . There are apparently no deliberate structural arrange ments to 
strengthen the desired complementary roles and responsibilities of the WoGM&ES and NSS. Yet, 
a successful WoGM&ES needs to be anchored effectively on a stronger NSS. Data and information 
need to flow between these systems and used in informing dev elopmental decisions and policy -
making processes.  
 
Thus, this model presupposes that not much progress will be made towards building and sustaining 
a WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector without having a corresponding NSS in place. To that 
extent, just as the WoGM&ES is proposed to be strengthened by having functional elements in all 
structures of government at national, line ministry, provincial and districts level, so should the 
NSS. More so, focus should be not only on putting these M&E and statistical fu nctions in place, 
but on their sustainable collaborations and integration. To have a responsive N SS, it should be 
enhanced in terms of possessing critical components such as data suppliers and users, other data 
producers and permanent training facilities for continued capacity building. Therefore, the model 
supports the components of the NSS as proposed in the NSDS (see Figure 8.3).
<<<PAGE=256>>>

The model takes into account the current set up, in which the leadership and coordinating roles of 
M&E and statistics at national level are under the mandate of the MNDP. This arrangement needs 
to exist for better collaboration and to cement both roles ( that is, M&E and statistics). The model 
also proposes strengthening the legislation at all levels to ensure that this relationship and 
functionalities of the WoGM&ES and the NSS are developed and sustained. This will entail having 
in place a common policy and law that spells out these intentions and functionalities. In the absence 
of a common legislation, efforts need to be made to harmonise ex isting ones, because it is only 
when roles and responsibilities are clearly understood from a policy level and through legal 
provisions that the implementation process would be feasible. This model considers that M&E and 
statistical functions need to be se riously defined and harmonised across all structures of 
government as conceptualised in Figure 8.4.
<<<PAGE=257>>>

8.4 The proposed model vis-à-vis the two cornerstones  
 
The proposed model gives salient suggestions on what the Zambian government needs to embark. 
In sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.2, details are given of aspects that need improvement or indeed shifting. 
The emphasis is on the need to transform the supply side and deman d side of Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES.  
 
8.4.1 Strengthening the supply side  
Strengthening the supply side of an M&E system requires investing in the quality and credibility 
of M&E information through augmenting coordination of data production and data standards by 
reducing the costs of data supply, and by growing the volume and breadth of forms of evaluations 
which are conducted (Mackay, 2007:iii). Therefore, a number of aspects need to be considered 
when building and sustaining the supply side of an M&E system. This section discusses details of 
what needs to be done to improve Zambia’s WoGM&ES under the proposed model. Suffice to 
say, the model recognises and retains the four tier government -wide operational structure and 
governance arrangements, which are: 
i. National level 
ii. Sector or line ministry level 
iii. Provincial level  
iv. District (including sub-district) level  
 
With one critical inclusion, the presidency, the model adopts the current NDP institutional set up 
for Zambia’s current WoGM&ES, which consists of these aspects:
<<<PAGE=258>>>
239 
 
 The presidency  
o This is a new inclusion and is needed to spearhead the ‘evaluation regime’ in th e 
country. The culture of results at country level to be institutionalised in the 
presidency through sustained demand and use of evidence in development 
processes.  
 Oversight structures  
o Parliament 
o Office of the Auditor General (OAG) 
o House of Chiefs  
 Policy coordination and implementation  
o Apex institutions, namely Cabinet, Cabinet Office, Ministry of National 
Development Planning and Ministry of Finance  
o Sector level, namely ministries and other implementing agencies at national level 
o Provincial administration  
o District administration  
 Advisory and decision-making structures  
o National Development Coordinating Committee (NDCC) 
o Committee of Permanent Secretaries  
o Cluster Advisory Groups (CAGs) 
o Provincial Development Coordinating Committees (PDCCs) 
o District Development Coordinating Committees (DDCCs) 
o Ward Development Committees (WDCs)  
 
Hence, in working to strengthen the M&E supply side, the significant institutional context design 
issues of focus are discussed now.  
 
a) Institutional context and design  
Although the institutional arrangements for Zambia’s WoGM&ES have been explained, the 
research results showed that th ere are gaps (see 7.3.1 & 7.3.4) . Starting with the national level 
institutions cascading down to line ministry, provincial and district levels, much has to be done to 
make the WoG -M&E function successfully (GRZ, 2017). Championship, in favour of practical
<<<PAGE=259>>>
240 
 
strengthening of M&E, was found to be weak politically and technically across Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES. Thus, there was a situation in which stakeholders were not working congruently to 
support the strengthening of the national system.  
 
Re-engineering is necessary to improve institutional collaboration for a functional WoGM&ES. 
Building, strengthening and sustaining a country -level system for M&E should st art with 
government stakeholders. Political leadership must be seen to be taking the leading role in creating 
a stronger system that would provide solid evidence for policy and decision making at all levels 
of national development. Therefore, it is propose d that the presidency should take up the M&E 
championship role at country level and pull the rest of the stakeholders in one direction. While this 
is happening, the ‘results-oriented’ capacity in the presidency needs to be extended. Further, like-
minded ch ampions will have to be placed in strategic institutions and positions across the 
government structure at national, line ministry, provincial and district level. More importantly, the 
approach of this re-engineered M&E needs to be participatory and stakeholder focused, bearing in 
mind that consensus building is at the centre of ownership and sustainability of the system.  
  
b) Leadership  
Unclear leadership roles and responsibilities across the WoGM&ES were revealed  (see details 
7.3.1). For things to happen in the desired manner, the presidency is recommended to take up the 
country-level institutional leadership role of M&E in Zambia. This should not be done in rhetoric, 
but practically planned, feasible and in an institutionally organised approach. When the presidency 
assumes this mandate at country level, other structures in and outside government would probably 
follow suit in promoting M&E within and across their institutions. It works well when the 
presidency becomes involved in promoting tenets of accountab ility, transparency and good 
governance. Such a culture should at best be accompanied by a system for monitoring and 
reporting progress vis-à-vis presidential goals and the country’s development goals as targeted in 
the NDPs. On the supply side, stronger l egislation such as constitutional provisions for results -
based management would go a long way towards building a successful WoGM&ES (Mackay, 
2007). Further, at national level (particularly among government structures), MNDP, with 
collaborating support from MOF and Cabinet Office, should continue to provide leadership to the
<<<PAGE=260>>>
241 
 
M&E function for the public sector. This national -level M&E function should work in 
complementarity with that at presidency level. 
 
Evidently, the study results of this research revealed weaknesses in the current capacities of MNDP 
and its relationship with MOF and Cabinet Office. Worse, the role of the presidency in advocating 
for a practical shift towards a robust WoGM&ES was not clearly defined in government policy 
and operational documents. Therefore, one of the first steps would be to improve the national-level 
leadership of the WoGM&ES through strengthening M&E championship in these apex 
institutions. In fact, M&E championship must be strengthened not only in these apex institutions, 
but at all leadership levels across government structures. While sporadic pronouncements have 
been made through ministerial and presidential speeches in support of the M&E function, actions 
have been slow in transforming the M&E agenda in the country. 
 
Another issue relates to the capacities in MNDP, MOF, CO and all other government structures. 
The findings showed a huge human resource gap in Zambia’s WoGM&ES. A case in point is that 
currently, the MNDP was understaffed. Of the complement of 22 staff membe rs, only five 
positions were filled at the time of this research. The situation was worse at decentralised levels of 
line ministry, provincial and district. At MOF and CO, hardly any dedicated staff members were 
mandated to support the WoGM&ES. Further, at trition and failure to attract and retain qualified 
and experienced staff because of the poor conditions of government service continued to 
characterise the WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2015, 2016, 2017). Therefore, these ins titutions were unable 
to conduct sound M&E functions which would inform decision-making processes. Thus, coupled 
with a lack of, or at best inadequate quantity and quality of leadership, management, and 
organisational skills in M&E championship, the coordination role was undermined at all levels of 
the WoGM&ES (GRZ, 2016, 2017). 
 
c) Legislation and regulation 
An aspect that is close to that of leadership is M&E legislation and regulation. The study indicated 
that good efforts were being made to strengthen the WoGM&ES. Since 2014, when government 
articulated the National Planning and Budgeting Policy, whose bill has yet to be presented to
<<<PAGE=261>>>
242 
 
parliament, there have been further demands  to strengthen the role of M&E in the country with 
supportive laws and legal systems. These demands have led to the development of the National 
M&E Policy, spearheaded by the MNDP, as an anchor to the practice of M&E in the country. This 
policy would form the basis for further laws to introduce stable legislation to guide M&E in the 
public sector and beyond. However, most of these efforts are still ‘work in progress’. The country 
needs accomplished results towards building a stronger WoGM&ES.  
 
Government needs to take practical steps by ensuring that the evolution and practice of M&E are 
backed by strong laws, possibly the equivalent of those that govern public financial management 
(PFM). Legislation may not be the only determining factor to trigger the M&E supply and demand 
sides, but that first step will be critical in growing the culture and practice of results among 
stakeholders. In any case, such laws would reinforce existing ones so that transparency, 
accountability and good governance tenets are pursued under prescribed legal frameworks and 
M&E practitioners then work freely without fear of punishment.  
 
d) Coordination and oversight  
The coordination of M&E activities among institutions across the WoGM&ES was found to be 
weak, despite efforts to strengthen the coordination framework for the WoGM&ES while 
preparing the 7NDP (2017 –2021). See sub -section 7.3.3 for detailed analysis of weaknesses 
regarding coordination and oversight. To put in place a stronger national -level M&E system, 
engaging stakeholders is a fundamental factor for success. Re-organising the public sector 
coordination and oversight framework would provide an oppor tunity for stakeholders to engage 
meaningfully, thereby assist strengthen the WoGM&ES. In a country that is striving to implement 
a decentralised governance system, the Zambian public sector is presented with the challenge of 
ensuring that M&E coordination and oversight are firmly institutionalised (GRZ, 2002, Engela & 
Ajam, 2010). Coordination and oversight issues are supply side M&E matters and resolving them 
requires that they should be regarded as such.  
 
Increased focus should be on the continued stren gthening of coordination mechanisms, oversight 
roles and overall liaison at all levels. Further, more effort will be needed for instance to lobby for 
donor support for developing the systemic component of the M&E supply side. However, while
<<<PAGE=262>>>
243 
 
this was being pursued, government’s commitment to holistically investing in building M&E 
functions will need to be increasingly evident. Thus, it will be expected that government structures 
should increase the allocation of funds and resource capacities to M&E functions.  
 
However, to make these changes, greater support and collective action from all the key institutions 
is necessary. In the absence of such efforts, especially if MOF and CO held different positions 
from MNDP, it would be impractical to invest in an improved WoGM&ES. Similarly, in the initial 
stages of consultations for the national M&E policy, MOF argued that the treasury would not be 
able to meet the wage bill for the proposed M&E structures across government ( draft national 
M&E policy, 2017). This alone  showed how less valued and prioritised M&E functions were in 
high institutional rankings such as MOF, and thus makes future success doubtful (regardless of 
whether the issue of limitations in national resources was true). Therefore, priority must be given  
to the harmonisation of collaboration among all stakeholders. However, achieving this is not easy 
owing to the complex nature of decentralised government machinery in terms of its powers and 
functions across all levels (Adrien, 2003; Engela & Ajam, 2010).  To that extent, government will 
need to resolve all existing gaps and work hard towards harmonising institutional relationships to 
attain the collaboration levels to thrive the WoGM&ES.  
 
e) Links to the national statistical system  
On the supply side, the national statistical system  (NSS) plays a significant role in enhancing the 
functionality of the WoGM&ES. Currently situated under the MNDP, the CSO was  responsible 
for collecting and publishing official statistics in Zambia. Statistics were collected using data 
collection methodologies and mechanisms such as surveys at national, sectoral and subject -
specific levels. Suffice to say, study findings reveale d that weaknesses existed between the 
WoGM&ES and the NSS. There were gaps in the ways in which CSO supported the functionality 
of the WoGM&ES (see details of gaps under sub-section 7.3.3).  
 
Under this model, current weaknesses should not be tolerated because the relationship between the 
WoGM&ES and the NSS must be self-reinforcing; otherwise it becomes difficult to implement a 
stronger WoGM&ES. Focus initially should be on harmonising the current institutional and 
operational arrangements. There is an adv antage on this front because both mandates are located
<<<PAGE=263>>>

under the MNDP. CSO  need to strengthen their role of backstopping and technical ly supporting 
government institutions and needy non-government actors on statistical issues. This will demand 
immediate capacity building of CSO, which was found to be fragmented and weak. Essentially, 
the availability of the WoGM&ES and the NSS presents a good starting point towards 
strengthening a culture of results in the public sector and among the citizenry. As a priorit y, 
government would be expected to ensure that there are comprehensive synergies (that is, structural, 
systemic, operational, and technological) between the two systems at national, line ministry, 
provincial and district level. To t hat extent, creating com mon, integrated and unified ICT-aided 
portals and databases will facilitate the strong linkages between the two systems. This will demand 
investment commitment on the part of government and other stakeholders. Engela and  Ajam  
(2010) concluded that there seems to be no easier way out than investing time and resources in 
ensuring that multiple capacities are fostered to propel the most sought -after systems for M&E. 
For instance, focus on skills development, ICT-aided solutions, champions, motivation to demand 
and use statistical data and M&E information, and addressing institutional and systemic politics 
will be needed as the country transforms itself towards a stronger and successful WoGM&ES.  
 
Further, government would do well to consider transforming CSO into an independent and 
operationally neutral statistical office, which would be consistent with the study findings . 
Respondents stressed that an independent CSO will probably be effective and efficient, thereby 
meeting the statistical needs and expectations of stakeholders. This independence should involve 
financial autonomy and technical operational rights. To that effect, the drafting of the National 
Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) for the period 2014 to 2018 fits well with this 
recommendation. Overall, the NSDS calls for updated statistics legislation to allow for an 
independent CSO. Therefore, this alternative model to a strengthened WoGM&ES takes seriously 
the many proposed innovations around the N SS. A stronger, integrated and interdependent 
WoGM&ES and NSS would form a solid base for a transformed and sustainable results -based 
culture in Zambia.  
 
f) Participation 
In designing a functional country -level system for M&E, the participation of stakeholde rs is 
fundamental (Booth, 2005; Booth & Lucas, 2002) . Stakeholders become key to building and
<<<PAGE=264>>>
245 
 
sustaining a country’s system for M&E. In Zambia’s WoGM&ES, the participation of stakeholders 
was currently mixed according to study findings of this research (see sub-section 7.3.5 for details). 
Thus, a robust situational analysis was necessary, which will focus on identifying stakeholders that 
currently support M&E functions and those who could support M&E developments. Development 
partners (DPs), civil society, research institutions, academia, and other institutions and individuals 
may be useful participants in strengthening the WoGM&ES through their support mechanisms (for 
example financial, capacity building, systemic, coordination). Once this was done, each 
stakeholder would be appropriately engaged. Overall, the participation will need to be holistic and 
cutting across all functional structures of government at national, line ministry , provincial and 
district level. 
 
g) Capacity for evaluation and analysis  
The capacity for evaluation and analysis embedded in a country’s WoGM&ES is what 
governments would need to invest in in their effort s to improve governance systems towards 
poverty reduction. The analysis of development data to make them readily available to those who 
need them and analytical capacities are requirements on the supply side of an M&E system. M&E 
outputs that are critical in informing developmental processes such as managem ent and policy 
decisions depend on the quality and capacity for data and information analysis. The study results 
showed weaknesses in ‘analysis’ capacities across Zambia’s WoGM&ES. The gaps in analysis 
come in various forms. For instance, in some cases, th ere are shortages of or limited numbers of 
skilled officers to undertake sound analysis. In other instances, the capacity to  evaluate is non -
existent. It was currently  common to find situations across the WoGM&ES in which lack of or 
inadequate evaluation capacities prevailed (see sub-section 7.3.4 on analysis capacity gaps).  
 
While evaluations have been played down because of prioritisation of monitoring by many 
organisations, this study established that countries that built strong M&E systems have stronge r 
evaluative culture ( for example Chile, Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, Canada and Australia). 
These countries invested heavily in building capacities in analysis, so that evaluations of their 
development interventions became easier and cheaper. Alongside  the development of a stronger 
evaluative culture and practice, the Zambian government, working in collaboration with its 
stakeholders, will need to invest significantly in analytical skills. To achieve this goal, the starting
<<<PAGE=265>>>
246 
 
point would be a comprehensiv e diagnosis of analytical skills in the country, particularly among 
institutions in the public sector. Such a study report will then give areas of strength, weakness, 
opportunity and possible threat (SWOT). The diagnosis would need to take a broader view o f 
stakeholders and aspects of analytical capacities.  
 
Analysis capacities will be needed at all levels of the WoGM&ES. In addition, the analytical 
capacities of non-state actors will need to be increased in the country so that their participation in 
the development process will be of value. The role of academia, research institutions and training 
organisations will be critical in the provision of courses in data analysis and interpretation. The 
idea will be to develop and sustain a wide range of capable an alysts to serve the country in 
development evaluations and related tasks, at the same time transforming the WoGM&ES. Further, 
this model contends that there must be an ultimate capacity building plan in the country. Informed 
by the diagnostic study, this master plan should then be cascaded down to all decentralised levels. 
That way, there will be certainty of addressing the existing analysis gaps across Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES as long as commitment through supportive championship and resource allocation is 
available to those structures. An emphasis here is placed on the need to first start with the diagnosis 
of existing capacities in analysis in the country so that the assessment results are then used to 
develop targeted programmes for addressing the identified gaps. This effort however will depend 
on how clear government and its stakeholders will be identifying gaps in analysis pertaining to the 
different development work in the public sector.  
 
h) Outputs and dissemination  
On the supply side, the preparation and dis semination of quality and stakeholder appropriate 
products are essential in the continued promotion and institutionalisation of the culture of results 
in Zambia. Good quality deliverables would then have a positive bearing for the demand side in 
that, stakeholders would increasingly seek to access these informative products for their own use 
in making development decisions. Accordingly, this study identified a number of gaps in the two 
aspects of outputs and their dissemination  (see sub-section 7.3.6). While the number and quality 
of M&E products (for example APR and institutional reports) were limited, disseminating them to 
stakeholders was challenging.
<<<PAGE=266>>>
247 
 
M&E outputs must be produced at each strategic level of the WoGM&ES. These products  will 
need to be identified, prioritised and delivered by stakeholders. Unlike the APR, which is currently 
viewed by stakeholders as a centrally initiated and demanded output, collectively identified and 
consented products will go a long way towards inculcating ownership and sustainability among 
actors. However, this does not mean the APR should be abolished. Instead, its preparation, 
dissemination and utilisation by all development stakeholders should be re -engineered. Further, 
collectively agreed dissemination or communicati on strategy will need to be articulated. The 
strategy should spell out the type of product, its frequency of generation, responsible institutions 
and persons, and indicate how its demand among the broader audience will be induced. 
Additionally, the strategy should show strategic evaluations across the public sector ( that is, past 
evaluations, ongoing and upcoming ones). This would keep the stakeholders and government ‘in 
the know’ and remain forward looking in improving the quality and timeliness of these outputs.  
 
i) Capacity building and funding 
 The research findings in this study have shown that Zambia’s WoGM&ES was characterised by 
fragmented plans and low funding for M&E related activities (see sub-sections 7.3.4 & 7.3.6). The 
problem existed on many levels, including inadequate allocations, delayed or no release of meagre 
resources, and cuts of the already small allocations. Several institutions did not budget for M&E 
activities at all. Another gap was the absence of an M&E funding plan, which could articulate the 
identified and prioritised M&E operatives and functionalities within the broader WoGM&ES. The 
NDPs were silent for instance on resources required to undertake strategic programme and project 
evaluations. In most of the implementing agencies at national, line ministry, provincial and district 
level, there was no predictable funding mechanism towards capacity building in resource 
mobilisation and allocation. These were matters that should be treated with priority and specificity 
if the WoGM&ES was going to be successful and sustainable. Dependency on donors for 
evaluation funding and technical support for systems development will obviously yield poor 
results in implementing a WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector.  
 
To improve funding for M&E activities across the WoGM&ES, a number of basic measures will 
need to be put in place. To begin with, assigning M&E champions to strategic institutions at 
national, line ministry, provincial and district level will be vital. Second, another essential aspect
<<<PAGE=267>>>
248 
 
is ensuring that the legislation in support of M&E functionality is favourable. It should be linked 
to appropriate policies, such as the national M&E policy which is in the pipeline. The national 
policy and similar supportive policies or guidelines will need to be prepared and articulated at all 
levels across the WoGM&ES. The champions who are placed at all these levels will then use such 
legal frameworks to conduct and promote M&E. Third, government should facilitate the 
development of a financial support strate gy for the M&E function in Zambia. This strategy must 
be broad based to include the role of government and non -government actors. The streamlined 
financial supporting role of government, private sector, development partners, civil society, 
academia and training institutions will need to be articulated. The strategy should be tailored to 
address systemic and capacity building gaps across the WoGM&ES. In this model, once these 
critical initiatives have been institutionalised and commitments ascertained, the strengthening and 
sustainability of Zambia’s WoGM&ES will be safeguarded.   
  
8.4.2 Strengthening the demand side    
The utilisation of information from M&E is probably the most important element that every system 
for M&E should seek to attain and maintain.  The demand side of an M&E system motivates 
investments and commitments th at strengthen the supply side. “ The demand side can be 
strengthened by promoting greater awareness of, and confidence in, the monitoring information 
and evaluation findings which the system produces―awareness among ministers, civil servants, 
and in civil society. Greater utilisation of M&E information will require that key m inisters and 
their ministries― especially the presidency and all apex institutions play a leading and even 
forceful role in championing the usefulness of the M&E information produced by WoGM&ES”  
(Mackay, 2007: iii). Once there is evidence and assurance that information from M&E processes 
will be used, the supply side should be incentivised and preoccupied in preparin g and 
disseminating this information for the use by needy stakeholders. Therefore, similar to the supply 
side, the demand side involves a number of aspects. As part of the action points for the proposed 
model, focus is given to prescribing the solutions fo r consideration on the demand side of the 
system.
<<<PAGE=268>>>
249 
 
a) Use of monitoring and evaluation information by the presidency   
The continuous request for and use of M&E information by the presidency forms the basis for this 
model’s success. As a champion of the re sults-based management (RBM), the presidency would 
be expected to play a significant role in supporting a strengthened M&E through consuming 
information from M&E. If the presidency systematically asks for evidence from the 
implementation of NDPs, a culture of results would quickly spread across government and beyond. 
This demand for M&E information from the highest office would strengthen the WoGM&ES. Like 
in Colombia, the President uses M&E information to enhance political control of the executive 
arm of government as well as in his weekly town hall meetings in different municipalities around 
the country (Mackay, 2007: iii). For Zambia, commitment to using M&E information by the 
presidency would necessitate a transformational agenda towards good governance resulting from 
evidence-based, transparent and accountable development process. The findings of this study have 
shown that the Presidency did not have in place an institutionalised way of demanding for high 
quality performance results from MPSAs (see sub-section 7.3.6).   
 
b) Linking monitoring and evaluation to planning, budgeting and policy processes  
The diagnostic review showed that Zambia’s WoGM&ES provides regular information about  
inputs, activities and outputs. This information was provided by institut ions at national, line 
ministry, provincial and district level through monthly, quarterly and annual reports. However, 
this research study found weak evidence for the full utilisation of M&E information to inform 
planning, budgeting and policy -making proce sses. Bedi et.al (2006:159) made a similar 
observation when they stated that “ the challenge lies in generating demand for information in a 
country where information and analysis are  rarely used in decision making” . The use of 
information to inform policy decisions at various levels of government was mixed. While several 
policies were being formulated and others reviewed across government, there was little evidence 
of utilising M&E information. The same result was true for the utilisation of M&E information in 
budgeting processes. For instance, MOF confirmed that it was difficult to obtain information about 
the ways in which MPSAs utilised fund allocations from the previous period. Similarly, although 
many line ministries and other spending agencies made their financial reports available, they were 
incomplete. Surprisingly, no structured sanctions had been implemented to take such institutions
<<<PAGE=269>>>
250 
 
to task. This was attributed mainly to ‘political’ interference from higher offices (that is, according 
to study findings) and the general lack of structured demand for M&E information in government. 
However, for planning processes, the study findings showed scanty evidence of the use of M&E 
information and in a fragmented manner. M&E products such as APRs, NDP evaluation  reports, 
and other institutional reports were reported of being used to inform the preparation of NDPs.  
 
This model therefore proposes serious reconsideration of the manner in which processes of 
planning, budgeting and policy making were done vis -à-vis the use of M&E information. Most 
importantly, these processes are supposed to benefit from the mandatory utilisation of M&E 
information. It is therefore submitted that whenever these processes are undertaken at any level, 
M&E information should be demanded and used to determine progress. This demand for M&E 
products by leaders and users at all levels will continuously pressurise the supply side to provide 
the much needed information for these processes. In the end, Zambia’s WoGM&ES will thrive 
and become dep endable source of evidence for development processes within government and 
outside.   
 
Among others, to actualise the use of M&E, APRs presents an opportunity for MPSAs to undertake 
annual public expenditure reviews. Thus during the APR preparation process, budget expenditure 
data and information could be provided by MPSAs and in -depth analysis done. By so doing, all 
successive APRs would offer M&E information that was readily available for decision and policy 
makers. Thus, the current situation, as found in this study, that M&E information from APRs was 
rarely used to inform budgetary and policy making would be past experience and point of future 
learning. When those changes occur, MOF will be able to state how APR expenditure information 
was feeding into t he subsequent budgeting processes. Regardless of whether the annual 
expenditure information was positive or negative, it would be justified. Furthermore, the APR as 
an M&E product will then provide expenditure information for use by key stakeholders to 
pressurise government to re-engineer the annual budget architecture.  
 
c) Use of Monitoring and evaluation information by parliament  
Parliament plays a significant role in the development process of Zambia through its oversight 
function and mandate to make laws that govern the country. Parliament deliberates and approves
<<<PAGE=270>>>
251 
 
the estimates of expenditures (that is, national budgets) for government. It is therefore prudent to 
have a sound linkage between parliament and the WoGM&ES or better understood, parliament to 
form part of the WoGM&ES . The information generated from the national M&E system should 
feed into the decisions and development processes of the National Assembly. In the same manner, 
the works of parliament should be reported back into the country system for M&E so that evidence-
based management is not the preserve only of the executive and the judiciary branches of 
government, but of all the three arms, including the legislature. To that extent, this model advocates 
for a practically oriented approach to involving parliament in strengthening Zambia’s WoGM&ES. 
On the demand side, parliament will have clearly defined M&E roles and products that are useful 
to its operations and how it will in return give feedback to the WoGM&ES.  
 
Nevertheless, the findings sh owed that the utilisation of M&E information by parliament was 
weak, ad hoc and in many ways non-existent (sub-section 7.3.6 gives details on the weaknesses). 
The lack of institutionalised M&E structures and products in parliament and across the 
WoGM&ES ha s led to these poor findings. Issues of M&E capacity, ranging from systemic, 
technical skills and financial resources, were found to be inhibiting, thus, causing low demand for 
M&E information by parliament. Equally, leadership that consistently promotes f unctional M&E 
at parliament was not in place. Therefore, many critical questions remain unanswered. For 
instance, in the absence of structured M&E information, what evidence guides parliamentary 
proceedings and the business of various parliamentary committ ees? Budgetary considerations 
form a key role of parliament, but, devoid of evidence of high analytical value, how do members 
of parliament and government engage prudently? What information is available for every 
parliamentarian to equip him or her with evidence-based debates and representation of the masses?  
 
In resolving these challenges and in ensuring that parliament becomes a practical stakeholder in 
the WoGM&ES, a number of actions have to be embarked on. An inclusive M&E culture that 
supports a ‘res ults-focused development process’ is required to be put in place. Undoubtedly, 
Zambia will need to complete the formulation and launch of the National Monitoring and 
Evaluation Policy (NM &EP). This policy must be comprehensive in its scope, definition and 
content so that all development stakeholders see themselves as active players in its successful 
implementation. In the same manner, an act of parliament is vital for a sustainable WoGM&ES
<<<PAGE=271>>>
252 
 
for the Zambian public sector. Aside from the national level policy environment, parliament will 
need its own policy position for its M&E functions and practice. Drawing from the national M&E 
policy provisions and the supportive legislation, parliament will be expected to create M&E 
structures at apex level, and at all lev els of its operations, including constitutional offices across 
the country. These decentralised functions will be harmonised and linked up with other structures 
of the WoGM&ES at all levels.  
 
Further, for this to occur, strong leadership that fully suppor ts a transformational M&E agenda 
will be needed in parliament to work as a ‘champion’ to continuously demand for a strengthened 
M&E function with parliament and across the country. Additionally, parliament will require 
investment in skills development pert aining to M&E. This will mean articulating a thorough 
capacity-building plan. This plan would best be a product of a diagnostic process, a needs 
assessment that would holistically benefit from what is currently working, not working and 
possibly why. To tha t extent, such an assessment should cover all aspects of a functional M&E 
system, for instance checking for current ICT support, skills, availability of budget for M&E, 
leadership, M&E information demand, institutional set up, and linkages with other MPSAs.  
  
d) Use of monitoring and evaluation information by civil society  
Civil society is a key stakeholder in the development process of Zambia. The interest of civil 
society organisations (CSOs) is to ensure that government efforts lead to poverty reduction for the 
majority poor citizens. Essentially, CSOs function as checks and balances o n the services of 
government as providers of development services to the people. Most of their work is advocacy 
and championing good governance tenets of accountability and t ransparency. CSOs are believed 
to be fair representatives of the people and their partnerships with government are seen as 
important success factors. When CSOs are involved in key processes such as planning, budgeting 
and policy making, this is regarded as a desired state of participatory and inclusive development.     
 
The role of civil society remains significant in the development process of Zambia. This was 
established in this study. CSOs were reported to have taken part  in development processes of 
Zambia. In a number of processes, most prominently their involvement in the planning process 
and in poverty monitoring featured in the study findings. Recently, CSOs were part of the major
<<<PAGE=272>>>
253 
 
stakeholders in the preparation of  the 7NDP (2017 –2021). In the recent past, they played an 
important role in the constitution -making process for the country. Their continued voice in 
democratic and electoral issues is another aspect in which CSOs have rendered useful input. In 
addition, CSOs were reported to be providing con structive input and feedback for the budget 
process. However, notable aspects needed to be improved if CSOs were to offer a meaningful 
contribution to development efforts. One such area is strengthening the role of M&E across 
government. CSOs have an opera tional presence at all these (government-wide) levels and their 
involvement in M&E issues would go a long way towards building, strengthening and sustaining 
the WoGM&ES for Zambia. For details on the use of M&E information by civil society, see sub-
section 7.3.6.  
 
On the demand side, CSOs are supposed to be key users of M&E information. Their feedback 
should be taken seriously in re -shaping M&E functionalities at any level. The involvement of 
CSOs would best start from the supply side where they participat e in designing all M&E 
parameters such as systems development, indicator choices, methodologies, leadership, planning, 
funding, coordination, reporting and dissemination, and policy formulation. Once that has been 
done, the role of CSOs on the demand side would be streamlined and easy to implement. Currently, 
CSOs belong to major advisory bodies, which include the NDCC, PDCCs, DDCCs and WDCs. 
They also belong to a number of CAGs according to the pillars of the 7NDP. These are key 
platforms in which CSOs cou ld make their M&E contributions. Currently, this role was 
acknowledged as being weak and fragmented and often left to a few civil society member 
organisations. 
 
To ensure effective use of M&E information by CSOs, the WoGM&ES should produce outputs 
that are tailored to their information needs. Thus, CSOs would be required to participate in the 
articulation of those M&E products and dissemination mechanisms. The capacities of CSOs in 
terms of M&E technical skills, financial resources and generally the availab ility of appropriate 
systemic and human resources would need to be in place. In addition, coordination relationships 
between CSOs and all government structures would need to be prioritised. To achieve these, CSOs 
themselves would be expected to be proactive through innovating ways of engaging government,
<<<PAGE=273>>>
254 
 
citizens, parliament, development partners and other stakeholders constructively, particularly on 
matters of improved good governance practices.                 
 
e) Use of monitoring and evaluation information by donors 
While the role of donors in supporting M&E in Zambia was acknowledged and appreciated, the 
results of this study showed that much needs to be improved. Although donors provided technical 
support and funding for selected M&E activities, they had contributed to the weakened state of 
Zambia’s WoGM&ES through maintaining their own parallel M&E arrangements. This scenario 
was rationalised because the WoGM&ES was still in its infancy, and was not able to satisfy all 
stakeholders’ information needs. It was also pointed out that donor support was not flexible enough 
to address urgent challenges such as financing M&E human capacity building plans for MPSAs. 
Much of their support went towards activities that were less impactful in empowering local 
practitioners. The financing from donors was reported to have usually been spent on procuring 
expensive external consultants, whose work had not been easy to sustain. The types of technical 
support that were given, such as those involving ICT strengthening, were re dundant because of 
incompatibilities with local systems and practices.  
 
Therefore, this model proposes a holistic reconsideration of the work of donors in supporting M&E 
functions in the country. After identifying a number of gaps in this diagnostic study , it is crucial 
for the work of donors to be tailored to support essential activities  (see sub -section 7.3.6) . 
Nevertheless, a strategic plan is needed that articulates M&E issues for the whole country, so that 
all donor support will draw their action poin ts from this master plan. Since the involvement of 
donors in strengthening M&E is currently weak and fragmented across the WoGM&ES, 
government will need to spearhead the undertaking of a comprehensive stakeholder M&E work 
plan, which will act as an action sheet for stakeholder participation. In the work plan, which will 
be drawn from the national assessment (also stakeholder based and driven), donors will be 
expected to submit their feedback regarding collective support for a unified WoGM&ES for the 
country. The gaps that were identified in this research will be addressed practically using this 
structured, collective and participatory approach. Therefore, the relationship between government 
and donors will be expected to thrive, since the M&E plan will serve  the information interests of 
both parties.
<<<PAGE=274>>>
255 
 
f) Use of monitoring and evaluation by decentralised structures   
On the demand side, the continued quest for and use of M&E information by all stakeholders 
would go a long way towards building, strengthening and sustaining the WoGM&ES for Zambia. 
As the research findings showed, there were notable weaknesses in the manner in which M&E 
functions were being implemented as one moved from national -level institutions to decentralised 
ones at sector, provincial and district level. While line ministries were performing much better 
comparatively in terms of M&E activities, provinces and districts were the poorest. There were 
many gaps at decentralised level  (see sub -sections 7.3.3 & 7.3.6) . These included lack of 
institutional structures for M&E, no M&E champions, absence of skilled staff in M&E, inadequate 
or in some cases no budget for M&E activities, and a generally weak culture of M&E. Others 
included weak statistical function, lack of systems for information manage ment and fragmented 
coordination and collaboration mechanisms.  
 
For decentralised structures to consistently use information from M&E and subsequently help 
strengthen the demand side, their capacities will need to be enhanced. The starting point should be 
to ensure that units or sections responsible for M&E are established at all decentralised levels, and 
staff skilled in M&E are deployed to these structures. Another aspect of similar importance will 
be to articulate M&E plans, M&E work plans and M&E guide lines at all levels. All these efforts 
will need to draw from the National M&E Policy and the appropriate M&E legislation. It is hoped 
that while these efforts are being made, a wide range of M&E champions will emerge to strengthen 
the M&E function across government and promote a culture of results. However, from the initial 
stages, a cadre of M&E champions will be required who are advocates of RBM and practitioners 
of M&E in their institutions and spheres of influence. Once in place, this type of leadershi p will 
be crucial in defining the medium - and long-term transformational agenda for M&E, not only in 
decentralised structures, but across the WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector. This will mean 
that, instead of the current set -up in which staff responsible for the planning function also 
undertake M&E activities, there should be separate and adequately funded and staffed structures 
tasked with the day-to-day M&E activities. By so doing, the demand for M&E products and their 
dissemination will characterise the M&E practices in all functional structures of government.
<<<PAGE=275>>>
256 
 
g) Incentivising the use of monitoring and evaluation information 
Utilising information from M&E by stakeholders does not occur naturally. If it was so, then many 
countries, organisations and development agencies would have sustained systems for M&E. While 
the significance of using M&E information is seldom contended, practices have shown that 
agencies did not use information from M&E for various reasons. For some, M&E information is 
not available owing to lack of systems for M&E, while for others, information may be provided, 
but is not trustworthy. Further, some M&E information may have come in late for processes such 
as planning and budgeting. The results of this study have shown that the utilis ation of M&E 
information was undermined at all levels (see sub-section 7.3.6). Among the reasons were the lack 
of a variety of and stakeholder appropriate M&E products, poor or limited dissemination strategies, 
lack of linkages of M&E products with strateg ic policy cycle moments, and lack of incentives to 
promote a culture of results through stakeholders demanding and using M&E information.  
 
Incentives can be key ingredients in the enhancement of the demand side of an M&E system  
(Ostrom, Gibson, Shivakumar & Andersson, 2002; Kusek & Rist, 2004). Thus, in an effort to build 
and sustain a stronger demand side of the WoGM&ES, significant investments of time and 
resources will be needed. A national M&E plan will be required that includes list of events or 
moments that use information from M&E. Spearheaded by government and supported by all 
stakeholders, the national M&E plan will need a costed work plan and show the M&E products, 
responsible institutions, the dissemination strategy, users, timelines, the events for M&E 
information, and other aspects. The incentive structure will then be developed in a participatory 
manner, and the responsibility of enforcement will be given to ‘powerful’ agencies, say, the MOF, 
MNDP or the presidency or a combination of them.  
 
This model proposes that a strong incentive structure should be developed if the WoGM&ES is to 
make progress and contribute towards building and sustaining a culture of results. Nevertheless, 
leadership at national level and at other decentralised levels, i ncluding buy -in from non -state 
actors, will be a requisite for the success of this effort. All MPSAs for instance will be required to 
know that funding will not be received for the next period in the absence of evidence of results 
from previous allocations. In the first instance, many agencies may face compliance challenges, 
but ultimately such a structure or arrangement will instil a sense of commitment to the provision
<<<PAGE=276>>>
257 
 
and demand for quality M&E information. The WoGM&ES will make positive strides towards a 
system that is to the satisfaction of stakeholders and promotes overall good governance agenda for 
the country.                            
 
8.5 Conclusion   
 
Chapter 8 presented the proposed model for the enhanced WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector. 
First, the chapter described the two cornerstones that are required for a successful WoGM&ES. 
Both the supply side and the demand side of a country’s M&E system need to be developed, 
strengthened and sustained for it to provide credible information for the dev elopment process. It 
has been underscored that the capacity of Zambia’s WoGM&ES to create high-quality information 
is required. At the same time, the system should be able to stimulate and use M&E information in 
key decision and policy -making processes. Se cond, Chapter 8 discussed the proposed model in 
detail by stating the five foundational elements that are needed for Zambia’s WoGM&ES to thrive. 
These include i) seeking clarity on the common purpose of implementing a WoGM&ES; ii) taking 
into account t he Z ambian governance structure ; iii) establishing an i ndependent evaluation 
structure; iv) building a Government-wide integrated ICT infrastructure; and v) putting in place a 
functional decentralised and integrated national statistical system (see 8.3.1).   
 
The chapter also discussed how the proposed model deals with strengthening and sustaining the 
two sides of M&E. In this section, a number of innovative ways were suggested on how best to 
implement a stronger WoGM&ES. Therefore, it is now incumbent on stake holders under the 
leadership of the Presidency to transform and strengthen the country’s system for M&E. Through 
such a collective and participatory approach, it is envisaged that Zambia’s WoGM&ES will grow 
stronger with a reputable record to satisfy the information needs of key stakeholders in and outside 
government. At that stage, Zambia will be acclaimed as a results -focused country with an M&E 
system capable of supplying high -quality information and capacity to stimulate the demand side 
to utilise M&E information. Chapter 9 is the last part that gives the concluding remarks as well as 
outlining comprehensive recommendations for the improvement of Zambia’s public sector 
WoGM&ES.
<<<PAGE=277>>>

Chapter 9 provides suggestions on how the Government of Zambia and respect ive stakeholders 
would need to work together to build and strengthen the country system for M&E. The chapter 
gives a summary of the thesis or study in general and stresses that the WoGM&ES for Zambia was 
currently weak and fragmented. On that basis, innova tive and transformational recommendations 
for improvements are made at all levels including national, line ministry, provincial, district and 
among non-state actors. Therefore, for comprehensiveness, Chapter 9 should be read jointly with 
Chapter 8 to appreciate the remedial actions recommended to practically enhance Zambia’s public 
sector WoGM&ES.

CHAPTER 9 
 
Summary and Recommendations  
 
9.1 Summary     
 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) has become a tool for achieving enhanced development results 
through promoting transparency, accountability and generally good governance practices. 
Development practitioners around the world are increasingly using M&E to demonstrate progress 
made by their organisations. Governments have also started to invest in building and strengthening 
their systems for M&E in their effort to show desired changes in the utilisation of public resources 
to stakeholders. This study focused on Zambia’s whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation 
system (WoGM&ES), which is a structural tota lity put in place by government to undertake 
functions of M&E, which involves the whole range of data collection, collation, analysis, storage, 
reporting, dissemination and feedback mechanisms (UNDP, 2002, 2009) . The study focused on 
three major aspects, that is, making the linkage between M& E and good governance clear;  
assessing the cur rent status of Zambia’s WoGM&ES;  and suggesting improvements to it.  The 
research study and analysis covered the national development plans for the period 1964 to the 
current 7NDP (2017 -2021) focusing on arrangements and implementation of the functions of 
planning, monitoring and evaluation in Zambia’s public sector.  
 
The lack of a comprehensive research study providing evidence and details on the status of 
Zambia’s WoGM&ES motivated this study to be initiated and  later embarked on. Although the 
available literature only made mention of the broader weaknesses pertaining to the Zambian public 
sector system for M&E, this research was designed to  identify specific gaps and provide detailed 
suggestions for improvement. Thus, the primary research objective was to analyse Zambia's public 
sector M&E arrangements in the context of National Development Plans (NDPs) in order to bring 
about a strengthened results -based WoGM&ES. This main objective was met using five (5) 
secondary objectives, namely a) justifying the theoretical significance of Zambia's WoGM&ES to 
improve public -sector good governance and poverty reduction agenda  through the theory of 
change; b) presenting Zambia as a case study in terms of the results -based WoGM&ES; c) 
identifying gaps inhibiting the implementation of a results -focused WoGM&ES for Zambia’s
<<<PAGE=279>>>
260 
 
public sector; d) establishing cornerstones necessary for building a results-based WoGM&ES for 
Zambia’s public sector; and e) proposing a new model for the enhanced WoGM&ES for Zambia’s 
public sector.  
 
In order to fully address all the objectives, the research study was organised in nine (9) chapters. 
The first chapter has dealt with the introductory aspects of situating the research study within the 
broader problem identified. Chapter two provided the review of literature on the subject of M&E  
and discussed the linkages between M&E systems, good governance  and poverty reduction. 
Further, chapters three and four presented the theoretical and conceptual frameworks, respectively. 
In Chapter five, details are given on the national planning, monitoring and evaluation arrangements 
in Zambia and this is followed by a discussion on the research design and methodology in Chapter 
six. Chapter seven has presented the detailed research findings based on the diagnostic assessment 
of Zambia’s WoGM&ES. Using the established status of the WoGM&ES, particularly the 
weaknesses identified in the diagnosis, Chapter eight has presented the proposed model for the 
enhanced WoGM&ES for the Zambian public sector. Further suggestions and recommendations 
for improving the system have been given in this chapter (Chapter nine).      
 
Based on the diagnostic study, it was found that Zambia’s WoGM&ES was currently weak and 
fragmented. Although several efforts to improve M&E practice were in place, there were many 
gaps across all government levels and structures. In summary, the WoGM&ES for Zambia has a 
weak capacity to supply and demand for credible M&E information. It is suggested that more 
effort should be made to develop the two sides of the M&E system However, these improvements 
should be made at national, line ministry, provincial and district level. As the study findings have 
shown, remedial actions will best be approached using the six dimensions assessed, namely policy, 
methodology, organisation, capacity, participation of actors outside government, and use of 
information from M&E. Since the scope of needs to be done to improve the M&E function is 
broad, using the diagnostic checklist will help to deal systematically with the complex issue.  
 
The WoGM&ES for Zambia is anchored on the national planning structure, which includes the 
vision (currently Vision 2030), national development plans (NDPs) (currently 7NDP 2017–2021), 
medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs), annual budgets, institutional strategic as well as
<<<PAGE=280>>>
261 
 
annual work plans, and all other plans and supportive policies. The NDPs form a strong foundation 
upon which the WoGM&ES is set up. Going forward, it will be important for gover nment to 
continue to perfect the articulation and execution of M&E arrangements before, during and after 
NDP implementation. NDPs need to be developed in a results-oriented manner so that measuring 
performance and learning from them through a robust WoGM&ES becomes feasible. 
 
Finally, this diagnostic study of Zambia’s WoGM&ES represents an important first step in 
identifying what works, and what does not work, and points to some reasons. Thus, with the 
findings, suggestions and recommendations offered here in, the Zambian government and other 
stakeholders have action points to use towards building and strengthening the country’s system for 
M&E. The proposed model articulates ideas which, when actualised, would enable Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES to produce information that is useful to the development processes of the country and 
increase the good governance prospects of government itself. Once this occurs, it is expected that 
the Zambian government would begin to experience the three benefits from M&E of 
accountability, feedback and learning.     
 
9.2 Recommendations     
 
To make it simpler for would -be implementers, the recommendations are given in categories as 
stated below. As strongly contended under the proposed model (see Chapter 8), these 
recommendations are meant to build, strengthen and sustain the WoGM&ES through putting in 
place a developed supply side and demand side of the system. On the supply side, focus should be 
on improving the quality and credibility of information from monitoring exercises, reducing the  
costs of data supply, and increasing the volume and breadth of evaluations. As for the demand 
side, attention would be needed to promote greater awareness of, and confidence in the monitoring 
information and evaluation findings that the system produces (Bedi et al., 2006) . To that extent, 
ministers, civil servants, academia and civil society should be targeted for this awareness. Greater 
utilisation of M&E information  by these and other influential stakeholders would go a long way 
towards creating the necessary leadership and championship in support of M&E. But, as cautioned 
by Mackay (2007:28), such support will need to “go beyond simple advocacy, and include steps
<<<PAGE=281>>>
262 
 
to ensure the utilisation of the M&E information to support budget and national planning decision 
making and social accountability”. Here are the recommendations:  
 
9.2.1 For government institutions  
Presidency level  
1. Institutionalise M&E championship: The responsibility of growing, nurturing and driving 
the culture of results should be rooted in the presidency. Unlike in the current scenario, where 
the appreciation of M&E is ad hoc and fragmented, the presidency is expected to vigorously 
pursue the mandate o f M&E by leading the nation in creating a country that focused on 
results-based management (RBM). This should be pursued under the managing for 
development results (MfDRs) approach. The presidency would then be seen as giving the 
‘sermons’ to incentivise the rest of the stakeholders in the country in supplying quality M&E 
information and creating demand for its utilisation. Sustained over successive political 
administrations, such championship at this level will go a long way towards attaining a 
stronger and successful WoGM&ES. Therefore, the presidency would need to be concerned 
with the functionality of M&E arrangements at national, line ministry, provincial and district 
level. Thus, practically, this transformation would mean that the president, cabinet, Cabinet 
Office, ministers and all the structures operating under the Office of the Pre sident (OP)  
would be expected to be proactive and aggressive advocates of RBM and M&E.           
 
2. Establish an evaluation structure: There is need to introduce an evaluation culture through 
spearheading the conduct of strategic evaluations. The OP is expected to take the lead in the 
transformation towards a results-based and focused Zambia. At the level of the presidency, 
an evaluation structure has to be established to ov ersee strategic evaluations across 
government. Despite being under the president, the structure would be required to operate 
independent of any interference from this office. Instead, it would be expected to receive full 
support in terms of good will and r esources to function properly. Adequate financial 
resources, skilled staff and appropriate infrastructure would be required to make this 
institution functionally relevant in providing the kind of information base the country needs. 
To ensure its viability and independence in its operations, its leader or management should
<<<PAGE=282>>>
263 
 
be appointed by parliament or other professional body through a democratic process. The 
presidency should use the findings from these evaluations directly in its development 
engagements wi th all stakeholders. The results should also be made public in various 
formats, such as electronic and print. However, the challenge would be to make thi s 
institution political proof—meaning that changes in political leadership should not make this 
function vulnerable or threatened with abolition. For this reason, the legislation, through 
constitutional provision and the institutionalisation of evaluation across government, would 
help sustain this important function.         
 
3. Create a feedback mechanism : While a formalised and mandated structure to handle 
strategic national evaluations is extremely important, creating a mechanism that guarantees 
action on recommendations from these evaluations is of equal significance. To that extent, 
the WoGM&ES, particularly the evaluations structure, will be best positioned to clarify how 
all actions from evaluati on reports will be  finally implemented by institutions across 
government and beyond. The motivation of this feedback mechanism will be to improve 
public service p rovision and nation building. For instance, key evaluation findings, their 
remedial recommendations, responsible agency and timeliness of executing the 
improvements could be published, say, on institutional websites, reports and so on.  
 
National apex institutional level 
4. Put in place leadership and ownership of M&E systems : One of the gaps identified in 
this study concerns inadequate or lack of evidence of M&E leadership at national level. 
M&E champions and other capacities are required at national level, p articularly in all apex 
institutions. Powerful ministers and other top leaders in these institutions will be expected 
to offer support towards the M&E function. Therefore, top government leadership will spur 
the spread and development of M&E systems at decentralised levels. At the same time, this 
effort will lead to the strengthening of the WoGM&ES supply and demand sides. Practically, 
this support will come through sequential demand and utilisation of M&E information by 
these institutions. For instance, pa rticular M&E reports and other appropriate products on 
national budget performance and NDP implementation from all MPSAs will be demanded 
and utilised by apex institutions.
<<<PAGE=283>>>
264 
 
5. Introduce stronger laws for M&E: The supreme law of the land in Zambia is the national 
constitution. In addition, several accompanying pieces of legislation are aimed at helping to 
actualise the contents and aspirations articulated in the national constitution. The laws of 
Zambia aim to guide and protect citizens and the national endowm ents from undue loss or 
damages. There is need for a clearer ‘stiffened’ law in support of M&E and results 
orientation. Starting with a national M&E policy, which was reported to be currently in draft 
form, there is need for a constitutionally supportive M &E legislation. This law should be 
able to capacitate and compel all public institutions, including the presidency, national apex 
institutions and decentralised government structures, to adhere to RBM through the 
implementation of a stronger WoGM&ES. This law should include freedom of information, 
which will allow evidence to be reported on all development aspects of public interest. Once 
such a law has been enacted, those whose role is to supply M&E information and those who 
use the information will be fully protected and work freely without fear of being victimised.  
 
6. Create synergies between government and training institution s: Capa city-building, 
especially specialised skills in M&E was found to be a big challenge for Zambia’s 
WoGM&ES. Professionals and practitioners of M&E still face practical difficulties  with 
regard to provision of high quality analysis and complete M&E products  that satisfy 
stakeholder information requirements at all levels. It is suggested that government will come 
up with stronger a nd institutionally sustainable synergies and collaborations with local 
training institutions to provide skills in evaluation analysis and process. In return, training 
and research institutions will be innovative by developing state-of-the-art programmes and 
courses meant to meet the growing M&E industry in the country. In that regard, a policy to 
guide this process may be developed to institutionalise M&E at all critical educational levels 
of the country’s educational system. The private sector can too be c hallenged by policy to 
play a significant role of localising and building a results-oriented culture in Zambia.     
 
Decentralised levels: line ministries, provinces & districts  
7. Undertake institutional level -specific M&E diagnoses: Institutional M&E funct ions 
could be complex. When they involve stakeholders, these functions could be even more 
diverse and complicated. Since line ministries vary in many respects, it would be prudent to
<<<PAGE=284>>>
265 
 
conduct diagnostic exercises for every sector to ascertain the current st rengths and gaps 
before embarking on remedial actions. This would be the first step in an effort to build and 
sustain functional institution -wide M&E arrangements (Kusek & Rist, 2004; UN, 2013; 
Kanyamuna, 2013). Some of the information regarding what works , what does not work, 
and why for the decentralised government structures have been highlighted in this study. As 
with the diagnosis of the WoGM&ES, line ministry, provincial and district -specific M&E 
assessments will need to focus on all the elements that help build and strengthen the supply 
sides and demand sides of those systems.  
 
8. Create information-sharing fora for inter -institutional M&E experiences : This study 
has established that only limited M&E products were in place across the WoGM&ES. The 
prominent one is the annual progress report (APR), which is a compilation of progress 
reports from ministries, provinces and other spending agencies (MPSAs). New innovations 
are required and these could include exchange ministry -to-ministry, province-to-province 
and district-to-district programmes, an annual national M&E symposium, a web-based M&E 
platform to resolve related questions, etc. The Zambia Monitoring and Evaluation 
Association (ZaMEA) could be used as an M&E information platform for practitioners. As 
a community of practice (CoP) for Managing for Development Results (MfDRs) in Zambia, 
ZaMEA presents an opportunity to support knowledge sharing and learning. Other fora on 
M&E include the African Evaluation Association (AFrEA), which is the African Continent 
Community of Practice (AfCoP) on the subject matter of MfDRs and RBM.  
 
9. Establish an incentive structure for the consumption of M&E information : A lack of 
incentives to stimulate the supply and demand of M&E information across the WoGM&ES 
was common. All levels were reported not to have any form of incentive in place to promote 
the use of M&E information. Incentives are significant to a successful M&E system, 
particularly in encouraging the strengthening of the supply and demand sides. Therefore, it 
will be useful to identify stakeholder -appropriate incentives that will spur the use of M&E 
information by stakeholders at all levels across the WoGM&ES. The incentives will have to 
work at all levels. Regardless of whether they are carrots, sticks or sermons , they will need 
to be carefully enforced across the WoGM&ES in a non -selective and discriminatory
<<<PAGE=285>>>
266 
 
manner. A range of incentives such as technical, political, financial management and skills 
training could be developed. 
 
10. Guarantee M&E backstopping support at all levels : Currently, backstopping services 
with regard to M&E capacities across institutions was lacking. Yet, for continuity and 
institutionalisation of M&E across the WoGM&ES, support is required from national level 
institutions down to the decentra lised structures. In that regard, the capacity of apex 
institutions will need to be enhanced to make them practically competent to offer M&E 
backstopping services across the WoGM&ES. Line ministries, provinces and districts will 
be expected to possess appr opriate capacities to allow for vertical and horizontal 
backstopping support. In that regard, M&E support could be obtained from a higher -level 
structure or from within the same level or indeed from training institutions. 
 
11. Leadership and ownership for M&E systems at all levels : At all decentralised levels, 
there is a need to introduce strong leadership that will promote institutional implementation 
and ownership of the M&E function. M&E works well when the top leadership of an 
institution demands and uses M&E information to inform its decision-making processes. At 
the same time, buy -in from institutional leadership can lead to further support towards 
having M&E resources and efforts to strengthen arrangements for M&E. In other words, 
there is need to put in place leaders and managers in all government decentralised institutions 
who are going to vigorously champion for the evolution and transformation of M&E within 
their institutions and overall across the WoGM&ES.  
 
Statistical regime transformation  
12. Reform and transform the national statistical function : The transformation of the 
WoGM&ES will be possible only when an equivalent transformation takes place under the 
National Statistical System (NSS). Although the current CSO was supplying official 
statistics to the country, a number of gaps were identified, among them the lack of timely 
data to help the M&E function provide meaningful and critically analytical reports for 
decision and policy making. Collaboration between the WoGM&ES and the NSS at all levels 
was found to be weak, ad hoc and fragmented. Therefore, the government, working in
<<<PAGE=286>>>
267 
 
collaboration with all its stakeholders, will be required to invest in the statistical f unction 
and ensure the WoGM&ES and  NSS complement each other. Thus, their operational 
structures will need to work in synch, implying that the sections that implement M&E and 
statistics at all levels will need to be harmonised, well linked and coordinated. Legislation 
that links the statistical function and that of M&E will too need to enforced. At best, one law 
should be articulated to support both M&E and statistics.   
 
National-wide indicator system  
13. Create a national and sub -national indicator system : There was notable effort to put 
performance indicators in place in the NDPs. The immediate past two NDPs and the current 
7NDP have demonstrated an improvement in the manner in which indicators were identified. 
However, there is no defined indicator system in Zambia. Given the complex development 
work that government has to do, such a system wo uld clarify which priority measurement 
indicators to track at national, line ministry, provincial, district and sub-district level. At the 
moment, there are no performance indicators at provincial and district level, which makes it 
impossible to measure progress and appreciate development impacts. It becomes a matter of 
guesswork as to what informs decision and policy making at those levels in the absence of 
evidence from an M&E system or a national statistical system.  
 
Community of practice  
14. Re-engineer the Zambia Monitoring and Evaluation Association: Zambia has in place a 
community of practice (CoP) for M&E in the Zambia Monitoring and Evaluation 
Association (ZaMEA). While it is in its infancy and its functionality is fairly good so far, the 
association must be made more robust and inclusive. Although it is a platform for 
practitioners of M&E and those interested in the field, it needs to be anchored on stronger 
national level leadership (that is, state and non-state). National, line ministry, provincial and 
district level M&E practitioners would need to take proactive roles and responsibilities in 
strengthening the M&E function in the country. At best, regional or provincial chapters could 
be established so that these become operational centres for ZaMEA.  Innovative incentives 
could be designed to attract the interest of stakeholders. At the same time, academia and the
<<<PAGE=287>>>
268 
 
media would be expected to ensure that the evolution of M&E is spread and documented. In 
addition, ZaMEA needs strong links with parliament, civil society, research institutions and 
individual citizens, who could be regular users of M&E information. ZaMEA could also 
carry out strategic evaluations of public projects and programmes to demonstrate that quality 
information is useful for national  development. In this case, ZaMEA could provide 
government and other stakeholders with expertise in conducting analytically strong 
evaluations.       
 
9.2.2 For non-government institutions  
Role of Parliament  
15. Enhance the oversight role of parliament at al l levels: The study findings have shown 
that only weak and fragmented linkages existed between parliament and other MPSAs in 
Zambia. Nevertheless, the National Assembly has a constitutional mandate to represent the 
citizens in issues of development and hum an rights. Parliament makes laws and approves 
government spending. These roles and responsibilities give parliament a unique 
development mandate. For that reason, its M&E role across the WoGM&ES will be crucial. 
Efforts through innovations and initiatives will need to be promoted so that functional 
linkages between parliament and all other levels of development are strengthened. In that 
regard, there will be a need to have M&E products in the form of reports and interactive 
programmes to give parliament an opportunity to appreciate development changes across 
the WoGM&ES regularly. Parliament will also be required to restructure itself to respond to 
this challenge function. Practically, this may compel redefining the roles and responsibilities 
of the parliamentary committees and creating new initiatives to support the M&E function 
within the National Assembly.     
 
Civil society  
16. Ensure collaboration and coordination mechanisms are functional : CSOs are an 
important stakeholder partner in the development process of Zambia. The work of CSOs has 
become more widespread as more organisations have come on board in recent years
<<<PAGE=288>>>
269 
 
(Mulonda et al., 2018) . Among others, CSOs are involved directly in implementing 
development interventions in such sectors as education, healt h, agriculture, water and 
sanitation, and community resilience through supporting entrepreneurship among citizens. 
Others are advocates of development in many areas. They lobby government and the donor 
community to act in needy communities so that people h ave access to decent lives. To that 
extent, it will be important that deliberate initiatives should be identified and implemented 
to strengthen the linkages between government and CSOs. In particular, M&E collaboration 
and coordination efforts between government and civil society will need to be strengthened. 
This may be achieved through undertaking a thorough needs assessment to identify practical 
coordination points. CSOs will need reliable M&E information in their advocacy work and 
in implementing develo pment interventions. Such collaboration will best be done at all 
levels. Joint M&E plans and actions will be desired to support a functional WoGM&ES. A 
review and strengthening of the advisory bodies, which include the NDCC, PDCCs, DDCCs 
and WDCs, will be a good starting point.    
 
Donors 
17. Develop a joint national M&E work plan to support the WoGM&ES: An M&E work 
plan is a detailed framework that is fully costed. As the study findings have shown, donors 
are involved in supporting the development of the WoGM& ES through provision of 
financial resources and technical services. However, owing to the lack of a common plan, 
which shows the areas of prioritised collaboration, the work of donors has not yielded the 
desired results (see Chapter 7). Thus, an elaborative joint government and donor M&E plan 
will be needed to work as a guide for current and future collaborations as far as M&E 
enhancement is concerned. Again, such efforts will need to be at all levels of government. 
Financing and technically supporting a common plan for M&E will entail strengthening the 
WoGM&ES.   
  
18. Avoid implementing parallel donor M&E systems: It was found in this study that donors 
were in the habit of maintaining their own parallel M&E arrangements. This practice was 
reported as weakening  the WoGM&ES, whereby, instead of collectively supporting the 
national system for M&E, donors spent money on creating ICT -based systems that catered
<<<PAGE=289>>>
270 
 
only for their work related information needs. In the enhanced WoGM&ES, donors would 
be expected to work with government through a unified national M&E work plan.   
 
Academia 
19. Transform the education system to being results focused: Among the key gaps reported 
in the current WoGM&ES for Zambia are lack of analytical skills, inadequate in-depth M&E 
skills and generally the lack of champions for M&E in government. Even among non -state 
actors, the challenges were reportedly similar. There was also a lack of results-based media 
reporting, particularly media coverage that highlights government achievements against the 
National Development Plans (NDPs) vis -à-vis the attainment of Vision 2030  objectives. 
Therefore, academia has an opportunity to help resolve the gap by vigorously introducing 
programmes and courses with development results-based content. In that regard, the subject 
matter of monitoring and evaluation will require to feature prominently in academic 
programmes of all teaching institutions at all levels. Nonetheless, this will mean developing 
academic level-specific and tailored M&E and RBM programmes and courses to address the 
skill gaps in the country. To produce these, a thorough needs assessment or knowledge-based 
diagnosis should be undertaken so that such curriculum reviews and developments may be 
informed appropriately (see also Wotela, 2017).    
 
20. Create strong competencies in undertaking development evaluations : The findings of 
this study have shown that the culture and practice of evaluation in Zambia remains poor, 
and in many cases non -existent. Not only did government undertake a limited number of 
evaluations, but the skills and expertise needed to carry out quality evaluations were lacking 
in and outside government. Private sector consulting firms and individuals will be needed to 
provide practical M&E services. Evaluation practice and competencies w ill go a long way 
towards supporting and sustaining the country’s WoGM&ES and ultimately in creating a 
culture of results through people’s access to and use of information from the evaluations.
<<<PAGE=290>>>
271 
 
Media  
21. Reform media news towards results-based management: Mass media plays a significant 
and central role in nation building and development. In its effort to implement a 
transformational, robust and sustainable WoGM&ES, the government will be required to 
invest in promoting and supporting a media regime shift. Zambia will need media platforms 
and spaces that are innovative and preoccupied with consistently reporting on development 
results based on evidence from a reliable and credible WoGM&ES. The media is supposed 
to play its double role of contributing to the strengthening of the supply side and the demand 
side of the WoGM&ES. To that extent, the media will be expected to always search for 
evidence on development processes. That is why the freedom of information (FOI) 
legislation would be vital for Zambia in transforming and nurturing a culture of results. 
Therefore, the print, digital and electronic media would be expected to offer a wide range of 
evidence and remedial action to resolve the issues. Such media will not  only help build a 
results-oriented population, but contribute to a strengthened Zambian economy through 
stronger democracy, economic development, human rights and generally in adhering to good 
governance tenets.  
 
9.2.3 For political parties 
22. Develop and i nstitutionalise M&E frameworks in all poli tical party manifestos  and 
constitutions: In Zambia, the executive arm of government is  led by politicians who are  
sponsored by a political party of their choice and affiliation. These political organisations 
are legally registered entities required to ope rate within the confinements of the laws of 
Zambia according to the stipulations in the highest law of the land —the Constitution.  A 
review of manifestos  and constitutions for the major political parties in Zambia indicated 
that none of them had any explicit articulation of an M&E arrangement (e.g. constitutions & 
manifestos of the Patriotic Front (PF), United Party for National Development (UPND) & 
Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) ). Aside from listing many promises of 
deliverables to the people, there was lack of clarity on an organised way of implementation 
and measurement of such promises  if or when they assumed power . Priority development 
areas, impacts, outcomes and outputs expected, indicators as well as targets become essential
<<<PAGE=291>>>
272 
 
elements of success to be clarified in party specific constitutions, manifestos and M&E plans. 
M&E methodologies also need to be explained for the people to make informed choices in 
an election. The absence of an M&E framework then undermines the party message and 
electorates would deem such promises as mere political rhetoric, propaganda and sheer vote-
seeking. Adherence to good governance tenets equally gets compromised.  
 
Therefore, since political parties shall come and go in terms of leading the country at a 
particular time, it is strongly contended that , far before a given party assumes government 
powers, its proposed M&E framework should be very clear. In Zambia for instance, political 
parties like the PF, MMD, UPND and all other parties would have clear and robust pa rty-
specific M&E frameworks and articulations on how they were going to pursue a culture of 
results once elected to power. That way, the proposed model in this study—of anchoring the 
country system for M&E on the presidency can be made feasible. As they pr opound their 
proposed system of governance to the general populace and other key stakeholders, specific 
M&E frameworks of individual political parties would be articulated in their campaign 
messages. Thus, even when a successful party shall find an established WoGM&ES for the 
public sector in place, it will be necessary for such a party to have a clear understanding and 
appreciation of  its own M&E vision and set up. Only when such practices and 
institutionalisation of M&E in intra - and inter- party politics shall exist in Zambia will the 
culture of results based on evidence become the inspiration of good governance and practical 
poverty reduction. This action point will help strengthen both the supply and demand side 
of the country’s WoGM&ES.   
 
23. Ensure the m ain party campaign messages comprise M&E function alities: Political 
elections are all about development promises.  In the tripartite elections, Zambians vote for 
local government representatives, members of parliament and presidential candidates and all 
these offer different development messages. I contend here that, drawing from their specific 
party manifestos and particularly the M&E frameworks and plans, these candidates will need 
to demonstrate how development results will be pursued and attained for the  citizens—in a 
measurable and realistic manner. Such quality, clarity and consistence in the campaign 
messages of a given political party will give an opportunity for people to easily identify
<<<PAGE=292>>>
273 
 
themselves with which organisation best holds a practical strat egy to deliver the desired 
development aspirations. Specifically, campaign messages should carry such important 
information as development priority areas, high level results of focus (that is, impacts and 
outcomes), outputs, indicators, targets and clear time frames. To some extent, details of roles 
and responsibilities should also be articulated. The research findings revealed that a newly 
elected party in power spends much time trying to organise itself to determine which 
structural arrangement would best deliver campaign promises. This should be resolved way 
before assuming state power—through detailed M&E frameworks and plans. In that regard, 
offices of the president for specific political parties will need to drive this M&E agenda as 
they shall be the o nes to foster a thriving culture of results once in leadership. For the 
incumbent party in power, there will be need to practically re -organise and shift according 
to the recommendations in the proposed model (see section 8.3). Therefore, in the long run, 
the people of Zambia will attach importance towards demanding for a results -oriented 
governance system from their various leaders and providers of goods and services. 
 
24. Transform political leaders into M&E Champions, focused and committed to a culture 
of re sults: For M&E to be well institutionalised and used as an instrument of good 
governance, political championship will be a necessary requirement for Zambia ’s 
WoGM&ES. While not every politician may qualify to be called a champion of M&E, there 
will be need for key political players to be transformed into practical results -based leaders 
who shall be at the helm of advancing and growing a culture of development results in the 
public service and beyond. Such leaders as presidential candidates and senior party officials 
for every political party/organisation will need to play the role of M&E champion. That way, 
Zambians will be given an opportunity to get results -based party manifestos and messages 
and engage in meaningful debate as to the direction the country was taking developmentally. 
This however, will call for a pragmatic intra - and inter- party transformation for political 
players to make themselves champions of- results- for- results to improve Zambians’ living 
standards. All these efforts will need to be  anchored on political party constitutions and 
manifestos inspired by a commitment to a culture of results based on knowledge and 
appropriate skills set.

9.2.4 For future knowledge and research  
Future research   
25. Investigate the functional relationships of good governance institutions in Zambia: The 
role of M&E is to enhance good governance through the promotion of transparency and 
accountability by those tasked with the responsibility of utilising public resources. The 
WoGM&ES is expecte d to cut across all three arms of government  (see Figure 8.1 ). 
Therefore, more research will be needed to understand which institutions in these arms of 
government need to be part of the WoGM&ES. For instance, studies will be required to 
determine the roles of various actors in strengthening the WoGM&ES. Institutions such as 
the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), Anti -Corruption Commission (ACC), judiciary, 
and parliament will form a firm basis for creating and sustaining a stronger WoGM&ES.  
 
26. Introduce a nd sustain a culture of streamlined planning and budgeting for results : 
While efforts have been made to simplify the planning and budgeting processes, especially 
through Public Finance Management (PFM) reforms and the launch of the 2014 National 
Planning and Budgeting Policy, more clarity is needed on ways to actualise these policy 
provisions. For instance, practical challenges were reported in linking, sequencing, 
articulating and developing the NLTV, NDPs, MTEFs, annual budgets, sector strategic 
plans, pr ovincial and district plans. Studies focused on making the linkages between 
planning and budgeting processes would enhance the results -based culture in Zambia. To 
avoid rhetorically motivated planning, a transformative culture of streamlined planning and 
budgeting for results should be the driving force behind these studies. The aim should be to 
have a lean planning and budgeting system with properly linked planning and budgeting 
outputs expected at national, line ministry, provincial and district levels. A ll levels will be 
required to work around implementing a unified work plan towards realising a national goal, 
namely NLTV through NDPs.  
 
27. Identify the technical and political aspects of M&E in Zambia : The WoGM&ES will 
need to be strengthened on the supply side and the demand side. However, doing so will 
require in-depth understanding of all critical operational and technical issues surrounding
<<<PAGE=294>>>
275 
 
the system. Although technical issues may seem obvious to identify, political aspects may 
be complex to identify and resolve. As a bearer of good and bad news, M&E may not always 
go well with those tasked to design and implement M&E systems. Thus, more research 
studies will be required to understand currently unclear perspectives of M&E, so that ways 
are found to simplify the articulation and design of M&E arrangements. Issues of weak M&E 
coordination, autonomy and overall poor power relations among institutions, especially the 
M&E role of the OAG, parliament, CSO and civil society, need to be elaborated (Hickey & 
Mohan, 2008; Holvoet & Rombouts, 2008; Kusek & Rist, 2002; Leftwich, 2008; Patton, 
1987).  
 
28. Develop and implement a robust exchange programme with best M&E practising 
countries and organisations: Putting in place a functional WoGM&ES is neither a one-off 
activity nor a short- or medium-term undertaking. It must be seen as a continuous and long-
term endeavour of building, reviewing, strengthening and participatory process. As Zambia 
works to build its nati onal system for M&E, there would be need to learn from other 
countries with success stories in implementing whole -of-government monitoring and 
evaluation systems through structured collaborations. Since such countries as South Africa, 
Uganda, Colombia, Chile, and Australia may have similar experiences to Zambia, learning 
from them would work well for Zambia.  
 
29. Re-establish a financing architecture for the WoGM&ES: One of the outstanding reason 
given for weak M&E implementation across the WoGM&ES for Zambia’ s public sector 
pertains to inadequacies and in many instances lack of finances. The current budget support 
approach seems to fall short of the desired investment in creating a thriving country system 
for M&E. Innovative financing options which will help g overnment and its stakeholders to 
practically deal with the current financial resource challenge are needed. An in-depth study 
may bring out salient alternatives to the M&E financing architecture for Zambia.  Such an 
M&E financial support strategy will for instance ascertain where resources to evaluate the 
NLTV, NDPs and strategic programmes and projects will be sourced  from and give 
predictable estimates of expenditure.  The alternatives will need to be robust enough to tackle 
resource challenges not only a t national level, but institution -specific level as well. This
<<<PAGE=295>>>
276 
 
suggestion comes in the light of research responses that acknowledged of sustained 
institutional failures to adequately plan for M&E activities.  
  
30. Re-engineer the public sector planning archit ecture focused on development results:  
M&E function thrives on good and results -oriented planning. The findings of this research 
have revealed that plans across government structures (that is, at national, line ministry, 
provincial & district) are currently fragmented and in some cases missing. There were many 
line ministries with outdated strategic plans while others either were implementing draft 
plans or had no official plans. The situation was worse at provincial and district level where 
barely a few of them had up-to-date plans. For the few with such plans, there was a notable 
weak linkage with respective NDPs. It was difficult to map out clear linkages between the 
NDP and the other plans at decentralised levels. Even worse were the de-linkages that existed 
between implementation mechanisms as well as monitor ing and evaluation frameworks. 
Thus, these gaps  demand that all planning at all levels of government —national, line 
ministry, provincial, district and sub -district should be responsive to a results -based 
planning. It means that designing a country-level M&E measurement framework for NDPs 
is practically problematic.  For instance, t he lack of specific indicators and targets  at 
provincial, district and among several line ministries exacerbates the challenge for effective 
and efficient M&E in the country. This gap also makes it difficult to place and provide data 
and information needs for regional, continental and global obligations. To fix this challenge, 
the planning architecture must be shifted to meet these basic tenets of results -based 
management through implementation of an effective WoGM&ES. Thus, future studies will 
have to consider appreciating the whole range of public policy and guidelines on planning, 
budgeting, implementation, oversight , legisl ation and geo-political aspects of national 
development.

B  PROPOSAL SUMMARY SHEET 
B1 ABSTRACT OF THE PROPOSA L (Each department should suggest a word count for 
this) 
In pursuit of good governance practices and better management of public resources and affairs, 
many governments if not all around the world have embarked on strengthening their monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) functions. As observed by Segone (2009:169): 
 
“Country-led systems of M&E are a concept whose time has come. A growing number of 
developing and transition countries and most if not all developed countries are devoting 
considerable attention and effort to their national M&E systems. Many do not label it as such – it 
may be called evidence -based policy -making, performance -based budgeting, or results -based 
management, for example – but at the core is an evidentiary system for public sector management 
that relies on the regular collection of monitoring information and the regular conduct of 
evaluations”. 
 
The main objective of this research study is to examine Zambia's Whole -of-Government 
Monitoring and Evaluation System, to identif y gaps and suggest salient improvements in 
building and sustaining stronger monitoring and evaluation arrangements for the Government 
of the Republic of Zambia. The study is premised on the recognition that despite a lot of public 
sector reforms undertaken  by the Government so far to strengthen Zambia's public sector 
management and especially the M&E arrangements, more work remains to be done to make 
Zambia’s country level M&E system functional to meet the desired expectations of various 
stakeholders. 
 
B2 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES (as stated in the full proposal see * on page 1) 
Primary Objective 
 To examine Zambia's public sector M&E arrangements in the context of National 
Development Plans in order to bring about a strengthened Whole-of-Government M&E 
system.
<<<PAGE=386>>>
367 
 
Secondary Objectives  
1. To apply  the Theory of Change to justify the theoretical significance of Zambia's 
Whole-of-Government M&E system for better public-sector management 
2. To present Zambia as a case study in terms of the Whole-of-Government M&E 
system  
3. To find out gaps inhibiting the building of a stronger Whole -of-Government M&E 
system for Zambia’s public sector  
4. To identify salient elements that are necessary for building a stronger and enhanced 
Whole-of-Government  M&E system for the  Zambian public sector   
5. To design a Public Sector-Wide M&E Policy and Practice  Coordination Model that 
shall contribute to an improved Whole-of-Government M&E system for Zambia 
6. To make recommendations for the monitoring and evaluation  practice in Zambia 
and for future research prospects  
 
B3 RESEARCH DESIGN (as stated in the full proposal see * on page 1) 
The chosen research design 
The primary objective of this research study is to examine Zambia’s monitoring and evaluation arrangements in 
the context of National Develo pment Plans in order to ascertain ways of strengthening the Whole -of-Government 
M&E system. To achieve this broader goal, the research design will be broad -based to take on board various 
elements that shall be deemed key to answering the primary as well as  stated secondary objectives. To fulfil that 
aspiration, the research design shall be both investigatory and descriptive in nature. This means the qualitative 
approach shall guide the overall data collection, analysis, interpretation and recommendations.  
  
Specifically, a two -tier research approach to data collection and analysis will be adopted. On one hand, a desk -
based research will be used to consult literature (secondary research) on the topic and subject matter of monitoring 
and evaluation while on t he other hand, the study shall use field -based research (primary research) for hands -on 
information. In terms of design and methodology, the study will fundamentally take the qualitative approach to 
guide the entire work.  However and whenever necessary, q uantitative techniques and tools shall be employed to 
complement the qualitative aspects in order to obtain valuable data for analysis, drawing of conclusions and 
recommendations.   
 
Further, the sources of data for the study are already defined.  Essentia lly, key government policy documents such 
as the National Development Plans (NDPs), NDP Annual Progress Reports (APRs), Sector, Provincial and District 
Strategic Plans, Vision 2030 and various management reports and policies shall be used in the study. In addition, 
the research shall make use of M&E related literature from various international development organisations such 
as the World Bank, OECD/DAC, IMF and other multilateral and bilateral agencies. Equally, some scholarly books, 
journals, articles and research papers will also be consulted to enrich the discussion, analysis and drawing of 
conclusions and recommendations for bettering Zambia's Whole-of-Government M&E system. 
 
With regard to primary data collection, the research will benefit from various interviews and interactions with 
government workers particularly those charged with responsibilities of planning, monitoring and evaluation. These 
public officers shall form an important cadre of key informants and shall be drawn from institutions of influ ence 
with regard to matters of M&E. Such institutions as the Ministry of National Development Planning, Ministry of 
Finance and other line ministries as well as Parliament, among others.   
 
Therefore, accessibility to the research units of analysis will be feasible because the candidate is resident in Zambia 
and working for the Zambian Public Service. In terms of methodology, and as alluded to earlier that the study shall 
use a mixed approach, whereby, both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Notwithstanding, the 
qualitative approach and techniques will be employed more than the quantitative ones. This is because of the nature 
of the study which requires more interaction and engagement with the subjects of research.

Appendix J: Letter of introduction for field research from candidate  
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,  
 
REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO UNDERTAKE INTERVIEWS WITH OFFICIALS IN YOUR 
ORGANISATION AS PART OF MY DOCTORATE (PHD) RESEARCH STUDY  
 
I am currently a doctoral student registered with the University of South Africa (UNISA) and supervised by 
Professor Derica Kotze ( contact details: +27 12 429 6592; kotzeda@unisa.ac.za). My topic is: “Analysis of 
Zambia’s Whole-of-Government Monitoring and Evaluation System in the context of National Development 
Studies”.  
 
The purpose of this doctoral research study is to analyse Zambia's public sector M&E arrangements in the 
context of National Development Plans in order to bring about a strengthened results -based Whole -of-
Government Monitoring and Evaluation system (WoGM&ES). The study seeks to achieve this objective by 
interrogating the holistic functionality of the WoG -M&E system at national, line ministry, provincial and 
district levels. In that regard, the research aims to find out gaps inhibiting the building and sustaining of a 
stronger results-focused WoG- M&E system for Zambia’s public sector. The study findings will be used to 
suggest im provements and indeed recommend the development of a public sector -wide M&E Policy and 
Practice Coordination Framework towards a result-based WoGM&ES for Zambia. 
 
I have selected your institution for my research study because of the following:  
 The role of coordinating the planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation as well 
as reporting for your institution is placed under your mandate  
  Your role stands out in the institution as that of ‘overseer’ and mediatory in terms of activities 
regarding monitoring and evaluation of programmes, projects and policies 
 You are expected to play a liaison role for monitoring and evaluation activities for your institution  
 The leadership, championship and advocacy for monitoring and evaluation practice are  largely 
situated in your jurisdiction 
 You are responsible for reporting and disseminating performance information for your organisation,  
 You are well vested in knowing possible challenges facing your institution regarding the processes of 
planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation and reporting  
 Your organisation plays a fundamental role in providing checks and balances to government’s good 
governance and accountability agenda, and 
 Your organisation provides technical and financial supp ort to good governance programmes for the 
public sector. 
 
For the above reasons, my research seeks to understand in some detail issues surrounding the M&E 
arrangements and indeed how they function. To make this feasible, I would appreciate if you could ava il me a 
number of your officers (Note: the number to be dependent on which institutional level) whom I could conduct 
interviews with or administer a questionnaire to. Depending on the need, focus group discussions (FGDs), 
individual semi-structured interviews, and questionnaire administration will be required. Therefore, depending 
on the type of interaction, minimal time shall be spent, ranging from 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Further, 
I would also like to hear from you as the leader of the institution  your own views about monitoring and 
evaluation arrangements in your organisation. 
 
The final thesis and research results will be available and accessible to all participants as well as the public. 
Should it be required, I will give a presentation on the research project to your institution. It will be interesting 
to particularly appreciate the final results of the research and have a discussion around them to see how your 
institution fit within the specific and general contexts of the WoGM&ES for Zambia’s public sector.  
  
Further, I wish to inform you that my research study has already been approved and given ethical clearance by 
the UNISA Policy on Research Ethics through the Ethics Review Committee. To that extent, high research 
ethical and confidential standards are being adhered to at all cost. Therefore, research respondents will have 
rights to confidentiality and consent to the research questions.

Government of the Republic of Zambia  
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
INTRODUCTION OF MR. VINCENT KANYAMUNA, DOCTORATE (PhD) CANDIDATE AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AFRICA UNDERTAKING HIS FIELD RESEARCH  
 
The subject above refers. Mr. Vincent Kanyamuna is pursuing his doctorate studies with the University of So uth 
Africa (UNISA) under the research titled ‘Analysis of Zambia’s whole -of-government monitoring and 
evaluation system in the context of national development plans’.  The research mainly concerns collecting data 
and information from institutions across go vernment structures – national, sectors, provinces, districts and other 
spending agencies. As a ministry responsible for coordinating national level planning, implementation, monitoring, 
evaluation and reporting of national development plans, Mr. Kanyamuna  has requested for a letter of 
recommendation to gain access to government structures mandated with planning, budgeting, monitoring, 
evaluation and other public accountability responsibilities and functions. In that regard, I write to seek your 
permission in respect of Mr. Kanyamuna’s request that you allow him conduct his research in your institution. As 
you may appreciate his study topic, government will seemingly benefit a great deal from the findings and 
recommendations of the research by Mr. Kanyamuna. 
 
Again, I wish to implore you to fully support Mr. Kanyamuna in any way possible to conduct his research tasks in 
your organisation. Should there be any further need for clarification, please, contact me.
