T
raining is a way for organizations to equip 
their employees with eﬀ  ective skills, knowl-
edge, and abilities in order to meet the global 
challenges that all workplaces face. Organizations 
can enjoy the fruits of their training activities if 
their employees transfer the skills they learned 
to their jobs, but, in fact, many factors work against 
employees’ eﬀ ectively transferring those new skills. 
Researchers are struggling to ﬁ  nd the amount of learn-
ing transfer to the workplace by trainees (Holton, 
1996). Moreover, a variety of learning performance 
situations exist that make learning transfer compli-
cated (Broad & Newstrom, 1992). Wexley and Latham 
(2002) highlighted that employees transfer 40% of their 
training content immediately after training, but this 
amount falls to 25% after six months and to 15% in one 
year (see also Cromwell & Kolb, 2004). Baldwin and 
Ford (1988) and Noe (1986) reported that most train-
ees do not transfer their newly learned skills to their 
job. In addition, London and Flannery (2004) discov-
ered that in spite of heavy investment in training activ-
ities, the fact is that trainees transfer less than 10% to
20% of their new skills and knowledge. In short, orga-
nizations are not getting the desired results from 
their investment in training activities (Mackay, 2007). 
Researchers need to address this problem (London & 
Flannery, 2004). 
The purpose of this study is to 
examine the eff ects of individual, envi-
ronmental, training design, and aff ective 
reaction factors on training transfer and 
transfer motivation. To determine the 
relationship between these factors and 
their infl uence on training transfer and to 
test the model, the researchers collected 
data from employees in the Malaysian 
banking sector. Structural equation 
modeling with Amos 16 was used to test 
the model and determine the relation-
ship. The study suggested that train-
ing stakeholders should manage the 
training program eff ectively. Transfer is 
maximized when trainees have social 
support, high performance self-effi  cacy, 
and transfer motivation. Stakeholders 
(e.g., trainers, trainees, supervisors, and 
peers) are important to the training 
transfer process, as are learner readi-
ness, trainee reaction, instrumental-
ity, and training retention. This study 
revealed that perceived content validity 
and transfer design work together and 
infl uence the trainee’s performance self-
effi  cacy. In other words, if trainers want 
to improve the performance self-effi  cacy 
level of trainees, they need to explain 
how the trainee can transfer the learned 
skills at the workplace and make sure 
the content of the training is similar 
to the actual job. The main objective 
of training programs is to align the 
employee’s expertise with organizational 
goals. Organizations can achieve their 
desired objectives only when employ-
ees transfer the learned skills on the job. 
Unfortunately, employees often transfer 
only a small percentage of skills they have 
learned in training. To eff ectively manage 
their training programs, organizations 
need to identify and focus on the factors 
that resist eff ective training transfer.

Among the reasons that the training transfer issue remains unresolved 
are lack of theoretical support for empirical ﬁ  ndings about training trans-
fer (Balaguer, Cheese, & Marchetti, 2006) and lack of theoretical support 
for training transfer models (May & Kahnweiler, 2000). In addition, May 
and Kahnweiler (2000) suggested that researchers should conceptualize 
training transfer in the form of variables and test the relationship of these
variables to training transfer. Furthermore, researchers should test 
these variables using a model and highlight the factors that aﬀ  ect train-
ing eﬀ ectiveness (Scaduto, Lindsay, & Chiaburu, 2008). Another reason 
behind the low rate of transfer is lack of attention to training trans-
fer in practice and academic research (Kauﬀ  eldd and Lehmann, 2010). 
Th erefore, the purpose of this study is to highlight the factors that play an 
important role in eﬀ  ective training transfer and test the model in order to 
improve training transfer system. 
Factors in Training Transfer and Transfer Motivation
Th e following sections explore the factors in training trans-
fer and transfer motivation separately in order to highlight their roles 
and importance.
Transfer Design
 Transfer design is one of the important factors in training design. 
Nikandrou, Brinia, and Bereri (2009) argued that 
researchers have not examined the inﬂ  uence of 
training design on training transfer. Holton, Bates, 
and Ruona (2000) pointed out that when the train-
ing content is similar to the actual work, the eﬀ ec-
tiveness of training rises. Nikandrou et al. (2009) highlighted that training 
content, the stakeholders, and the instructional design may aﬀ  ect the learn-
ing as well. May and Kahnweiler (2000) suggested that the training content 
should be similar to the actual work and that trainers need to provide train-
ees suﬃ  cient time to practice their new skills. Velada, Caetano, Michel, 
Lyons, and Kavanagh (2007) support May and Kahnweiler’s viewpoint and 
proposed that training transfer may be at a maximum when trainees learn 
the training content, when the content is similar to the work they do, and 
when the trainees have enough time to practice their new skills.
Th e role of transfer design factor in the training transfer process is 
twofold. First, design factors may increase transfer when content is simi-
lar to the actual work and time is spent on helping trainees understand 
how to transfer their new skills (Velada et al., 2007). Second, transfer 
design may increase the eﬃ   cacy level of the trainees (Bhatti & Kaur,  
2010). Bhatti and Kaur also suggested that researchers should empirically 
examine the impact of the transfer design factor on training transfer and 
self-eﬃ  cacy. 
Transfer design is one of the 
important factors in training 
design.

Perceived Content Validity
Th e concept of perceived content validity holds that training con-
tent should be similar to the actual work, and this similarity can moti-
vate trainees to transfer the learned skills to their work. Brown and 
McCracken (2009) noted that after evaluating trainees’ learning transfer, 
the next step is to investigate the link between participation in training 
activities and training transfer. 
Th e concept of content validity is useful in training activities when 
the purpose of the training is to make trainee expert in performing his 
or her actual job tasks. Kauﬀ eldd and Lehmann (2010) argued that stake-
holders can maximize training transfer by developing training content 
that is similar to the actual work done. When organizations are launching 
new technology or a new business plan and trainees have to learn new 
skills, this concept is not applicable. Th is concept is also not applicable in 
situations where trainees use new skills or techniques on the job accord-
ing to the circumstances. 
To maximize training transfer, trainers should design training in such 
a way that it represents the actual job tasks. In addition, the equipment 
used in training should be similar to that used on the job. Also, trainees 
should do the training in an environment that is similar to that of their 
actual work. In other words, the training activities should be similar to 
the actual job. Al-Eisa, Furayyan, and Alhemoud (2009) hold that the 
similarity of training content increases trainees’ conﬁ dence to learn and 
transfer their training. 
Liebermann and Hoﬀ  mann (2008) believe that the similarity of 
training content to the actual job creates a positive attitude toward 
the training activities. Awais and Sharan (2010) proposed that content 
validity inﬂ  uences trainees’ reactions and performance self-eﬃ   cacy. 
Th erefore, this study empirically examines the impact of perceived con-
tent validity on aﬀ ective reaction and performance self-eﬃ  cacy. 
Performance Self-Effi  ca cy
Performance self-eﬃ  cacy represents individual characteristics. Self-
eﬃ  cacy is concerned not so much with the skills of individuals, but with 
whether they believe they can use those skills to reach certain goals, 
such as performing well. Velada et al. (2007) found that performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy positively inﬂ  uences transfer of training, and Kirwan and 
Birchall (2006) proposed that perceived content validity and transfer 
design work together to improve performance self-eﬃ  cacy and inﬂ uence 
transfer motivation. Researchers have also proposed that the concept of 
performance self-eﬃ  cacy should be tested with other variables to analyze 
the combined eﬀ ects.
Researchers have been examining the impact of performance self-
eﬃ  cacy on other training transfer variables like transfer motivation and 
training transfer and found that performance self-eﬃ  cacy helps trainees 
to transfer the learned skills at their workplace up to the maximum level 
(Chiaburu & Marinova, 2005; Kirwan & Birchall, 2006; Velada et al.,
<<<PAGE=4>>>
54 DOI: 10.1002/piq Performance Improvement Quarterly
2007). Awais and Sharan (2010) argued that past researchers have not 
highlighted the factors that increase the level of trainees’ performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy. 
To boost trainee conﬁ  dence and level of understanding concerning 
the transfer of skills, trainers can use diﬀ erent examples related to learners’ 
work. In other words, trainers can use examples to show trainees how they 
can transfer the learned skills on the job. In addition, this practice will assist 
trainees in maximizing the training transfer. Kirwan and Birchall (2006) 
tested the Holton model and found a signiﬁ  cant correlation between trans-
fer design and performance self-eﬃ  cacy. Moreover, Al-Eisa et al. (2009) 
noted that similarity of training content increases trainees’ conﬁ dence in 
learning and transferring the training. Th is shows that transfer design also 
inﬂ uences transfer motivation through performance self-eﬃ  cacy. In other 
words, we can conclude that performance self-eﬃ  cacy mediates the rela-
tionship among transfer design, perceived content validity, and transfer 
motivation. Empirically testing this relationship will lead to new insights 
and highlight the importance of performance self-eﬃ  cacy factors in train-
ing transfer theory. Th  erefore, the study set out in this article empirically 
examined the eﬀ  ects of transfer design and content validity on performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy that inﬂ uenced transfer motivation and training transfer.
Learner Readiness
Learner readiness represents characteristics of individuals. Th e con-
cept of learner readiness relates to integrated control theory. It explains 
that trainees should be prepared to enter into and participate in training 
for learning and skills transfer.
 Bates, Kauﬀ  eld, and Holton (2007) suggested that researchers 
should test the relationship between transfer and the other factors in the 
Learning Transfer System Inventory (LTSI): learner readiness, transfer 
design, and performance coaching. In an earlier study, Facteau, Dobbins, 
Russell, Ladd, and Kudisch (1995) proposed that training reputation 
(when employees perceive that training is eﬀ ective and helpful for career 
development) also inﬂ uences learner readiness. 
Stephen (2008) measured learner readiness in terms of  knowledge 
retention and motivation to learn and apply skills. He found that learning 
transfer is higher when trainees are conﬁ dent that they will retain the new 
skills and motivated to apply this knowledge. In other words, trainees 
who know about the training program and are motivated to apply what 
they learn are more likely to transfer their learning.
Bates et al. (2007) proposed the concept of learner readiness in terms 
of (1) a program that aﬀ ects performance, (2) understanding about job-
related developments, (3) expectations of the training, and (4) outcomes 
expected at the beginning of the training. Kirwan and Birchall (2006) 
argued that transfer motivation and performance self-eﬃ  cacy correlated 
with the same factors, such as learner readiness, transfer design, per-
ceived content validity, and opportunity to use the new skills. Th  ere is
<<<PAGE=5>>>
Volume 27, Number 1 / 2014 DOI: 10.1002/piq  55
also some indication that these factors may work collectively. In the same 
study, Kirwan and Birchall (2006) found that learner readiness exerted 
a signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect and proposed that learner readiness directly aﬀ  ects 
motivation to transfer. 
Peer Support 
In the category of environmental factors, peer support plays an 
important role in the training transfer process and inﬂ  uence on training 
transfer (Burke & Hutchins, 2007), but this factor has not been exam-
ined suﬃ  ciently in training transfer models (Scaduto et al., 2008). Some 
researchers have tried to examined the role of peer support in train-
ing transfer models and proposed that peer support can help trainees 
learn and maintain new skills (Aguinis & Kraiger, 2009). Furthermore 
Chiaburu and Tekleab (2005) suggested that peer support more signiﬁ  -
cantly inﬂ  uences training transfer and transfer motivation compared to 
other environmental factors like supervisor and management support. 
Chen, Kwok, and Goodson (2007) found that top management and peer 
support inﬂ  uence training transfer. 
Although some researchers who examined the role of peer support in 
the training transfer process and found that peer support positively inﬂ u-
ences such transfer (Nijman et al., 2006; Kirwan and Birchall 2006),they 
also found that it was not related to pretraining motivation (Facteau 
et al., 1995). In contrast, some found that peer support positively 
inﬂ uences transfer motivation (Ruona et al., 2002). Furthermore, Holton 
et al. (2000) and van der Klink and Streumer (2002) did not ﬁ  nd any sig-
niﬁ cant relationship between peer support and training transfer. Tracey, 
Tannenbaum, and Kavanagh (1995) argued that peer support is an impor-
tant factor in training transfer models. Th ese conﬂ  icting results of past 
research should encourage researchers to examine the role of peer sup-
port and include peer support in training transfer models more frequently. 
In this study we suggest that researchers should consider the time 
and type factor while examining peer support in training transfer models. 
Researchers might, for example, divide the work into determining what 
type of support is needed at various times in the training process: before, 
during, and after training. For example, Noe (1986) measured peer sup-
port as “peers care about applying new knowledge” (p. 45), and Chiaburu 
and Marinova (2005) used their scale. Th ey found that peer support was 
positively related to pretraining motivation and skills transfer. Facteau 
et al. (1995) measured peer support in terms of “peers’ encouragement of 
incorporating new learning” (p. 21) and found that peer support is related 
to skills transfer but not pretraining motivation. 
Pidd (2 004) measured peers’ support in terms of expectations and 
behavior and proposed a moderating role of peer support of trainees identi-
ﬁ ed with workplace groups and training transfer. In addition, Seyler, Holton, 
Bates, Burnett, and Carvalho (1998, p. 131) measured peer support as 
“peers’ appreciation for using new skills, ” “peers’ encouragement for using
<<<PAGE=6>>>
56 DOI: 10.1002/piq Performance Improvement Quarterly
new skills, ” “peers’ expectations, ” and “peers’ behavior” against training 
transfer and found that peer support inﬂ  uences transfer motivation and 
training transfer. Due to the conﬂ icting results, this study proposes that 
future research should highlight the kind of peer support trainees need 
at each stage of training. Furthermore, at the time of developing the peer 
support scale, researchers should classify the peer support that trainees 
need before, during, and after training. 
Supervisor Support
In the category of environmental factors, supervisor support plays 
an important role in the training transfer process and inﬂ uences training 
transfer (Burke & Hutchins, 2007), a factor that has not been examined 
suﬃ  ciently in training transfer models (Scaduto et al., 2008). Research has 
examined the role of supervisor support in training transfer models and 
found that this support does not inﬂ uence training outcomes (Chiaburu &
Marinova, 2005; Klink, Gielen, & Nautta, 2001). It does, however, inﬂ  u-
ence trainees’ transfer motivation (Nijman et al., 2006). In other words, 
supervisor support has a positive inﬂ  uence on training transfer medi-
ated by its inﬂ  uence on transfer motivation. Some studies (Velada 
et al., 2007; Liebermann & Hoﬀ  mann, 2008) found that supervisor sup-
port does not signiﬁ  cantly inﬂ uence transfer motivation, while others 
found a positive relationship between supervisor support and training 
transfer (Montesino, 2002; Smith-Jentsch, Salas, & Brannick, 2001; Warr, 
Allan, & Birdi, 1999). 
Nijman et al. (2006) measured supervisor support in terms of the 
“supervisor’s opportunity to apply learned skills” and found that this sup-
port has no direct eﬀ  ect on training transfer when taking into account 
the motivation to transfer. In addition, Liebermann and Hoﬀ mann (2008) 
measured supervisor support in terms of supervisor interest in training 
and support for transfer and found little inﬂ  uence on transfer motiva-
tion. Finally, Velada et al. (2007) measured supervisor support in terms 
of “diﬀ  erent methods to apply training on the job, ” “diﬃ  culties in training 
transfer, ” “training interest, ” “performance feedback, ” and “training goals” 
and found eﬀ  ects on transfer motivation.
Due to the conﬂ  icting results, the study we report here suggested that 
researchers should diﬀ erentiate what kind of supervisor support trainees 
need at each stage of training. Furthermore, at the time of developing the 
supervisor support scale, researchers should classify the supervisor sup-
port that trainees need before, during, and after training. 
Instrumentality 
Instrumentality (i.e., intrinsic rewards) is an important factor. Th e con-
cept of instrumentality explains that employees perceive certain rewards 
after training transfer. Researchers divide instrumentality into two cate-
gories: intrinsic rewards, which include interesting work and the content 
of activity assigned, and extrinsic rewards, which include remuneration
<<<PAGE=7>>>
Volume 27, Number 1 / 2014 DOI: 10.1002/piq  57
and career possibilities (Guerrero & Sire, 2001). Furthermore, Th arenour 
(2001) found that both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards have a positive 
inﬂ uence on transfer motivation. Nikandrou et al. (2009) argued that 
trainees think that internal rewards (intrinsic rewards) are important 
because they help trainees develop more self-conﬁ  dence and personal 
improvement. Pilati and Borges-Andrade (2008) considered instrumen-
tality as a belief that trainees carry with them in order to get certain 
rewards (increased pay, promotion, appreciation) after training. In con-
trast, if trainees have few expectations of training outcomes, they will be 
poorly motivated, which results in a lack of training eﬀ ectiveness (Clark, 
Dobbins, & Ladd, 1993; Facteau et al., 1995; Noe, 1986). 
Awais and Sharan (2010) found that trainees motivated through 
extrinsic rewards performed well but made more mistakes while per-
forming their job tasks. In contrast, trainees who were motivated through 
intrinsic rewards performed their job tasks more accurately. Osman-
Gani and Jacobs (2005) highlighted that intrinsic rewards can bring more 
innovation and eﬀ ectiveness to an employee’s performance. Awais and 
Sharan (2010) pointed out that if the trainees are intrinsically motivated, 
they retain and transfer the learned skills at their workplace. Th  erefore, 
the purpose of our study is to empirically test the dual role of intrinsic 
rewards—ﬁ rst to examine the eﬀ  ects of intrinsic rewards on training 
retention and then to examine the eﬀ  ects of intrinsic rewards on transfer 
motivation. 
Training Retention
Training retention is another important factor among individual 
characteristics. After completing training, trainees cannot eﬀ  ectively 
transfer what they have learned unless they retain that training. Ford 
(2009) found that getting learners involved is the key to retention and 
application of learned skills. Velada et al. (2007) suggested that “training 
retention is similar to the cognitive ability and is the degree to which the 
trainee retains the content after training is completed. ” In the training 
transfer process, many factors aﬀ  ect training retention. In this regard, 
many factors inﬂ  uence employees’ learning retention, such as trans-
fer design, trainee characteristics, and environmental factors (May & 
Kahnweiler, 2000). 
Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, and Wright (2006) and Kirkpatrick (1976) 
proposed that in order to perform better, trainees must learn and retain 
the training content and transfer it to their work. In the past, researchers 
have focused on the concept of retention of knowledge in the educational 
sector. To our best understanding, only a few researchers have included 
this concept in training transfer theory. Unfortunately, human resource 
development professionals and researchers have ignored the concept of 
training retention in training transfer theory (Awais & Sharan, 2010). 
Hence, they should try to determine what factors help trainees retain more 
skills. Ultimately, retention of skills leads to increased training transfer.
<<<PAGE=8>>>
58 DOI: 10.1002/piq Performance Improvement Quarterly
Kontoghiorghes (2001) found that extrinsic rewards such as pay and 
promotions, as well as punishment for failing to use the new skills and knowl-
edge, were weakly associated with training retention. Conversely, intrinsic 
rewards such as praise and recognition for using the newly learned skills 
and knowledge acquired in training proved to be a more important vari-
able. In addition, Velada et al. (2007) found that training retention pre-
dicts a signiﬁ cant relationship with transfer of training. Th  erefore, we 
can conclude that training retention mediates the relationship between 
intrinsic rewards and training transfer.
Aff ective Reaction 
Aﬀ ective reaction is the ﬁ  rst stage of Kirkpatrick’s (1976) training 
eﬀ ectiveness model. Past work has given suﬃ   cient attention to train-
ing and development (Chen, Sok, & Sok, 2007), and many researchers 
have highlighted the importance of aﬀ  ective reaction (Arthur, Bennett, 
Edens, & Bell 2003). Nevertheless, there remains a lack of consensus 
among researchers about the role of aﬀ  ective reaction in training eﬀ  ec-
tiveness (Schmidt, 2007; Sitzmann, Brown, Casper, & Ely, 2008). Aﬀ ective 
reactions explain learners’ training experience (Sitzmann et al., 2008) 
and are a source for organizations to evaluate their training programs 
(Sugrue & Rivera, 2005). In addition, Sitzmann et al. (2008) highlighted 
that aﬀ ective reaction is the most commonly used method to assess train-
ees’ response to training activities, yet it is poorly understood (Sitzmann 
et al., 2008). 
 Th e most commonly used method for training evaluation is aﬀ ective 
reactions (Ruona et al., 2002), but researchers lack the empirical evidence 
to support the theoretical grounds, which explain that aﬀ  ective reaction 
inﬂ uences other training outcomes (Alliger & Janak, 1989; Dixon, 1990; 
Noe, 1986; Warr & Bunce, 1995). A possible reason behind the conﬂ  ict-
ing results in past studies might be due to a lack of understanding about 
measuring aﬀ  ective reaction. Some researchers have evaluated aﬀ ective 
reaction to training content (Baldwin, Magjuka, & Loher, 1991; Noe, 
1986; Russell, Terborg, & Powers, 1985), whereas others have focused on 
aﬀ ective reaction to training transfer at the workplace (Latham & Saari, 
1979; Wexley & Baldwin, 1986). Another possible reason, highlighted 
by Pilati and Borges-Andrade (2008), is poor measurement of aﬀ  ective 
reaction. In addition, Dysvik and Kuvaas (2008) argued that the valid-
ity of aﬀ ective reaction is questionable, and researchers should focus 
more on how aﬀ  ective reaction inﬂ  uences the training transfer process 
because some researchers (Liebermann and Hoﬀ  mann 2008) found a 
positive relationship between aﬀ ective reaction and transfer motivation. 
Moreover, Liebermann and Hoﬀ mann (2008) argued that if the perceived 
practical relevance of the training matches or exceeds the trainee’s expec-
tation, he or she will be satisﬁ ed. 
Seyler et al. (1998) found a signiﬁ  cant correlation between content 
validity and aﬀ  ective reaction. Th erefore, we can conclude that aﬀ  ective
<<<PAGE=9>>>
Volume 27, Number 1 / 2014 DOI: 10.1002/piq  59
reaction mediates the relationship between perceived content validity 
and transfer motivation. Further empirical examination of the mediating 
role of aﬀ  ective reaction between perceived content validity and transfer 
motivation will help researchers explain the importance of aﬀ ective reac-
tion in training transfer process. 
Transfer Motivation
One of the important factors among individual characteristics is 
transfer motivation: in order to achieve maximum learning transfer, the 
learner should have high transfer motivation (Nikandrou et al., 2009). 
Holton (1996) suggested that it is important for trainees to have transfer 
motivation in order to transfer the learned skills on the job, yet research-
ers have ignored transfer motivation in training eﬀ  ectiveness studies 
(Colquitt, LePine, & Noe, 2000). 
Many factors aﬀ  ect the level of learner transfer motivation: learner 
readiness, supervisor and peer support, training design and performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy, intrinsic rewards, and aﬀ ective reaction (Kirwan & Birchall, 
2006; Stephen, 2008; Pidd, 2004). Chiaburu and Marinova (2005) found 
that transfer motivation is signiﬁ  cantly related to learning and training 
transfer. Some other researchers have made similar ﬁ  ndings (Kirwan & 
Birchall 2006; Liebermann & Hoﬀ mann, 2008) and explain that transfer 
motivation positively inﬂ  uences training transfer. Th  erefore, we can con-
clude that transfer motivation mediates the relationship between peer 
support, supervisor support, learner readiness, performance self-eﬃ  cacy, 
intrinsic rewards, aﬀ  ective reactions, and training transfer. 
Hypotheses 
As a result of our research, we developed the following hypothesis for 
our study.
H1: Performance self-eﬃ  cacy (an individual factor) mediates the 
relationship between transfer design (a training design factor) and 
transfer motivation.
H2: Performance self-eﬃ   cacy mediates the relationship between per-
ceived content validity (training design) and transfer motivation. 
H3: Transfer motivation mediates the relationship between perfor-
mance self-eﬃ  cacy (an individual factor) and training transfer.
H4: Transfer motivation mediates the relationship between learner 
readiness (an individual factor) and training transfer.
H5: Transfer motivation mediates the relationship between peer 
support (an environmental factor) and training transfer.
<<<PAGE=10>>>
60 DOI: 10.1002/piq Performance Improvement Quarterly
H6: Transfer motivation mediates the relationship between super-
visor support (an environmental factor) and training transfer.
H7: Transfer motivation mediates the relationship between instru-
mentality or intrinsic rewards (a situational factor) and training 
transfer.
H8: Training retention (an individual factor) mediates the relation-
ship between the instrumentality or intrinsic reward (a situational 
factor) and training transfer. 
H9: Aﬀ ective reaction mediates the relationship between perceived 
content validity (training design) and transfer motivation.
H10: Transfer motivation mediates the relationship between aﬀ ec-
tive reaction and training transfer. 
Methodology
Th e purpose of this study was to evaluate the transfer of training in 
the Malaysian banking sector. Th  e study respondents had oﬀ  -the-job 
training, and the instruction methods were selected by the trainers or 
managers. Th e training content was designed to provide eligible partici-
pants with instructions on managing administrative work and perform-
ing diﬀ  erent work activities in the bank. According to the policy of Bank 
Negara Malaysia (BNM), every selected candidate was required to attend 
a two-week training program before beginning work in these areas. Over 
the two weeks, trainees were taught a variety of new skills, including 
supervisory skills, problem solving, team management, conﬂ  ict resolu-
tion, and communication skills. 
Th e data for this study were collected from 503 employees of 11 
Malaysian banks with a majority of female employees (61%); 78% of 
respondents were less than 39 years, 89% had less than an undergraduate 
degree, and 64% were nonmanagerial staﬀ . Forty-six bank branches were 
randomly selected from the Klang valley, Malaysia’s economic hub. We 
selected every third branch out of the 138 branches located within this 
area.  Of the 1,000 questionnaires distributed, 528 completed question-
naires were returned. Twenty-ﬁ ve questionnaires were discarded because 
of problematic responses. Th e remaining 503 questionnaires were used 
for analysis. No statistically signiﬁ  cant diﬀ erences were found between 
the participants of the study and the complete sample of the trainees with 
regard to gender, age, training period, and job position. 
In order to reduce any biased response, the questionnaire was divided 
into two sections based on dependent and independent variables but 
using the same rating source. In section 1, the respondents were asked 
to rate their response and returned the completed questionnaire to their
<<<PAGE=11>>>
Volume 27, Number 1 / 2014 DOI: 10.1002/piq  61
manager or supervisor. In section 2, another questionnaire was distrib-
uted to respondents after a few days and asked for their response based 
on 5-point scale. Although the period of time between sections 1 and 2 
was short, this practice helped to reduce biased response. 
Measurement
To measure the variables, the researcher used scales adopted from 
previous research. Th e respondents were asked to mark a number on a 
5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5 for each statement, where 1 indicates 
Strongly Disagree to 5, which means Strongly Agree:
 ♦ Transfer design was measured with three items (e.g., “It is clear to 
me that people conducting the training understand how I will use 
what I learn”).
 ♦ Perceived content validity was measured with three items (e.g., “I 
like the way training seems so much like my job”).
 ♦ Performance self-eﬃ  cacy was measured with four items (e.g., “I am 
conﬁ dent in my ability to use new skills at work”).
 ♦ Learner readiness was measured with ﬁ  ve items (e.g., “I know what 
to expect from training before it begins”).
 ♦ Peer support was measured with three items (e.g., “ At work, my 
colleagues expect me to use what I learn in training”).
 ♦ Supervisor support was measured with three items (e.g., “My super-
visor meets with me to discuss ways to apply training on the job”).
 ♦ Transfer motivation was measured with three items (e.g., “Training 
will increase my personal productivity”) and assessed as proposed 
by Holton (1996). 
 ♦ Aﬀ ective reaction was measured with three items (e.g., “I am 
pleased I attended this training”) as proposed by Smith-Jentsch, 
Salas, and Brannick (2008).
 ♦ Training transfer was assessed as proposed by Tesluk, Farr, Mathieu, 
and Vance (1995) with three items (e.g., “Th  e training will help me 
to improve my job performance”).
 ♦ Intrinsic rewards were measured with seven items proposed by 
Guerrero and Sire (2001) (e.g., “Training increases my autonomy 
at work”).
 ♦ Training retention was measured with three items developed by 
Velada et al. (2007) (e.g., “I can easily say several things that I have 
learned in the training course”).
Analysis
To analyze the research data, structural equation modeling (SEM) 
with Amos 16 was used. In the ﬁ  rst of two steps, measurement model
<<<PAGE=12>>>
62 DOI: 10.1002/piq Performance Improvement Quarterly
(factor) analyses evaluated the contribution of each item to the construct 
(latent variables) being assessed. In the second step, the structural model 
was tested to determine the strength of the hypothesized relationships 
between the constructs.
Table 1 shows that the internal consistency of all scales is above then 
0.7, except “Learner readiness” as 0.672 (Hair, William, Barry, & Rolph, 
2000), which indicates that all scales have higher internal consistency level.
Fornell and Larcker (1981) argued that the convergent validity of all 
scales should be at least 0.50. As shown in Table 1, all variables have at 
least 0.50 or all values are greater than 0.50, which shows that all scales 
have adequate convergent validity. 
Discriminant Validity
All items in Table 2 are greater than squared covariance or greater 
than 0.60, as proposed by Hair et al. (2007), which demonstrates that all 
variables have discriminate validity and are statistically signiﬁ  cant. Th e 
criterion validity of the studied variables was veriﬁ  ed by Holton (1996) 
and Velada (2007). Diﬀ erent measures were selected for model ﬁ t to test 
the structural model. 
Diﬀ erent measures were selected for model ﬁ  t to test the structural 
model. With reference to chi square goodness-of-ﬁ  t indices, Wynne, 
Johnson, and Schwarz (2008) argued that these indices can be used to 
evaluate model ﬁ t, but psychometricians tend not to consider them a 
reliable guide for model adequacy (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Th is is because 
the actual size of the test statistic depends not only on model adequacy 
(Wynne et al., 2008) but also on which one among several chi square tests 
is used, as well as other conditions (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Th  is statistic 
has no upper limit, and so its value is not interpretable in a standard way 
(Kline, 2005). Th  erefore, we have selected alternative measures of ﬁ t. For

these measures, goodness-of-ﬁ t is based on various cutoﬀ  criteria (Byrne, 
2001). 
Computation of Degree of Freedom (Default Model)
For goodness-of-ﬁ  t indices, it is important to be aware that there is 
no distinction made in terms of degree of ﬁ t for diﬀ erences in ﬁ t indexes 
beyond the cutoﬀ   point (Wynne et al., 2008) as indicated in Tables 3 and 4.
Table 5 shows the measurement model ﬁ  t. Six indicators have been 
selected to explain the ﬁ t. In this model the comparative ﬁ t index (CFI) is 
0.942, higher than the acceptable baseline (CFI ≥ 0.90), which indicates 
adequate ﬁ t (Cleveland, Laroche, & Papadopoulos, 2009). 
With reference to the adjusted goodness-of-ﬁ  t index (AGFI), the 
value is 0.821, which fulﬁ  lls the acceptable baseline (AGFI ≥ 0.80) and 
indicates good ﬁ t (Cheng, 2007). Th e root mean square error of approxi-
mation (RMSEA) is 0.053; the model ﬁ t value should be less than 0.05 to 
indicate a good ﬁ  t (Byrne, 2001); a value up to 0.10 can indicate average 
ﬁ t (Chen et al., 2008), and above a value of 0.10, the ﬁ  t is said to be poor 
(Byrne, 2001). Th e chi square/degree of freedom (CMIN/df) is 2.406, 
also indicating good ﬁ t—CMIN/df < 3 (Cheng, 2007; Byrne, 2001; Chau, 
1997). Th e Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) is 0.934, which indicates adequate 
ﬁ t (Loibl, Cho, Diekmann, & Batte, 2009). Finally, the IFI is 0.942, which is 
also considered an adequate ﬁ t (Lai, 2009). 
Table 5 shows the standardized model ﬁ  t. Six indicators have 
been selected to explain the model ﬁ  t. In this model, the comparative 
ﬁ t index (CFI) is 0.90 for the proposed model and 0.962 for competing 
models A and B, which touches the acceptable baseline (CFI ≥ 0.90) and 
indicates adequate ﬁ  t (Cleveland et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008; Cheng, 
2007; Chau, 1997). 
With reference to the AGFI, the value is 0.852 for proposed 
and competing models A and B, which fulﬁ  lls the acceptable baseline

(AGFI ≥ 0.80) and indicates good ﬁ  t (Cheng, 2007; Chau, 1997). Th  e

less than 0.05; Byrne, 2001). Up to 0.10 can indicate an average ﬁ t (Chen 
et al., 2008), and above a value of 0.10, the ﬁ t is said to be poor (Byrne, 2001). 
Th e CMIN/df is 2.162, also indicating good ﬁ  t with a CMIN/df below 3 
(Cheng, 2007; Byrne, 2001; Chau, 1997). In addition, the TLI is 0.890 
for the proposed model and 0.95 for competing model B, indicating ade-
quate ﬁ t (Loibl et al., 2009). Finally, the IFI is 0.901, also considered an 
adequate ﬁ t (Lai, 2009). 
Th e ﬁ  nal step is to compare the proposed model with two compet-
ing nested models (Hair et al., 2007) to ensure that no other model is 
acceptable. Th  erefore, three models were examined, for which the model 
parsimony, ﬁ t indexes, and theoretical justiﬁ  cation were compared as 
indicated in Tables 6, 7, and 8. Th e ﬁ rst model is proposed with a chi square 
of 1541.39. Th  e second model, competing model A, added the direct 
paths and has the lowest chi square with 1149.36 and degree of freedom 
556; it also has the highest number of parameters. Th  erefore, the alter-
native was parsimonious. Furthermore, the results showed that most of 
the relationships among variables were not statistically signiﬁ  cant. Th e 
third model, competing model B, has a chi square of 1168.91, which is 
lower than the proposed model and good model ﬁ  t as compared to the 
proposed model. However, “good model ﬁ t alone is insuﬃ  cient to support 
to proposed structural theory” (Hair et al., 2007. p. 757). Th  erefore, the 
proposed models have been accepted. 
Findings
All constructs are statistically signiﬁ cant with p-value less than 0.05 
(Hair et al., 2007). In order to see the eﬀ ects of diﬀ erent factors on transfer 
motivation and training transfer, the researcher explained the parameters 
of the signiﬁ cant paths. As indicated in the Figure 1 transfer design and 
perceived content validity explain 62% of the variance of performance self-
eﬃ  cacy. In addition, 27% of the variance of aﬀ ective reaction is explained
<<<PAGE=16>>>
66 DOI: 10.1002/piq Performance Improvement Quarterly
by the validity of the perceived content. Performance self-eﬃ  cacy, aﬀ ec-
tive reaction, learner readiness, peer support, supervisor support, and 
instrumentality (intrinsic rewards) explain 48% of the variance of transfer 
motivation. Furthermore, instrumentality (intrinsic rewards) also explains 
only 2% of the variance of training retention. Finally, training retention 
and transfer motivation explain 23% of the variance of training transfer. 
Transfer Design
Transfer design is an important factors in training transfer. In the past, 
researchers have found many training design factors that inﬂ  uence the
transfer of training at the workplace. Holton et al. (1997) developed 
the LTSI in which they introduced the transfer design factor. Transfer 
design develops an understanding about the training program and 
shows in a practical way how training can be best used back on the job. 
Nikandrou et al. (2009) argued that studies have seldom examined the 
impact of training design and methods on training transfer. Th  erefore, 
the hypothesis developed based on the research framework (H1) explains 
that performance self-eﬃ  cacy as an individual factor mediates the rela-
tionship between transfer design and transfer motivation. 
Th e ﬁ  ndings of this research support H1 and suggest that the rela-
tionship between transfer design and performance self-eﬃ  cacy is much 
stronger (eﬀ ect = 0.484) than transfer motivation (eﬀ ect = 0.141) which 
explains that transfer design inﬂ uences transfer motivation through per-
formance self-eﬃ  cacy. In other words, transfer design has a strong direct 
eﬀ ect on performance self-eﬃ   cacy and inﬂ  uences transfer motivation

indirectly. Th e results of this study explain that performance self-eﬃ  cacy 
mediates the relationship between transfer design and transfer motiva-
tion t-value (t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007; t = 6.688). 
Perceived Content Validity
With reference to perceived content validity, Liebermann and 
Hoﬀ mann (2008) argued that if the perceived practical relevance of the 
training matches or exceeds the trainee’s expectation, he or she will be 
satisﬁ ed (reaction) and therefore will react more positively. If the training 
is less relevant, the trainee will be less satisﬁ  ed or show a negative aﬀ ec-
tive reaction. In the same study, they found that practical relevance is an 
important factor that inﬂ uences aﬀ ective reaction. Th ey also found that 
there is no signiﬁ cant direct correlation between perceived content validity

and transfer motivation. Other researchers have also found that per-
ceived content validity aﬀ ects transfer motivation through performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy. 
Garavaglia (1993) proposed that two factors lead to less training 
transfer: when trainees do not get support from their work environ-
ment and when they perceive that the training activities are irrelevant. 
In our proposed framework, we highlight the multidimensional role of 
perceived content validity factor. Th e ﬁ  rst dimension exposes the role 
of perceived content validity as a factor to increase the learner performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy level, which ultimately aﬀ  ects transfer motivation. When 
learners perceive that the content of the training is similar to what they 
do on the job, they more strongly believe in their capabilities to perform 
given tasks. In addition, the learner’s perception that “training content is 
similar to the actual job tasks” also leads to a positive aﬀ ective reaction.

Th e hypothesis we developed based on the research framework 
explains that performance self-eﬃ   cacy as an individual factor mediates 
the relationship between perceived content validity and transfer motivation 
(H2) as indicated in Table 10. Th e results of this study supported H2 and 
explains that performance self-eﬃ   cacy mediates the relationship between 
perceived content validity and transfer motivation t-value ( t > 1.96; 
Hair et al., 2007; t = 5.467). Th e results of this study’s p-value (p < 0.05; 
Garver & Williams, 2009; p = 0.001) also provide evidence and explain that 
perceived content validity positively inﬂ uences performance self-eﬃ  cacy 
(eﬀ ect = 0.516) as indicated in Table 9.
Performance Self-Effi  ca cy
Performance self-eﬃ  cacy develops trainees’ beliefs in their abilities, 
which leads trainees to realize they can use the skills they learn on the 
job and improve their job performance. In addition, self-eﬃ  cacy increases 
trainees’ conﬁ  dence that they can overcome any obstacles they might face as 
they work to transfer their skills, and it gives them conﬁ dence in the ability. 
Th e hypothesis developed based on the research framework explains 
that transfer motivation mediates the relationship between performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy and training transfer (H3). Th  e results of the study sup-
ported H3 and indicate that transfer motivation mediates the relationship 
between performance self-eﬃ  cacy and training transfer t-value (t = 4.610; 
t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007). Th e results show that performance self-eﬃ  cacy 
directly aﬀ  ects transfer motivation (eﬀ ect = 0.291). Th e results also pro-
vide evidence about p-value ( p = 0.001; p < 0.05: Garver & Williams, 2009) 
indicating that the path (performance self-eﬃ  cacy have positive relation-
ship with transfer motivation) is statistically signiﬁ cant. 
Learner Readiness
With reference to learner readiness, Kirwan and Birchall (2006) 
determined that transfer motivation and performance self-eﬃ   cacy cor-
relate with learner readiness, transfer design, perceived content validity, 
and opportunity to use the learning. Th ere is also some indication that 
these factors may work collectively.  Kirwan and Birchall also found that 
learner readiness exerts a signiﬁ  cant eﬀ ect and proposed that learner 
readiness directly aﬀ  ects motivation to transfer. 
Th e hypothesis we developed based on the research framework 
explains that transfer motivation mediates the relationship between 
learner readiness and training transfer (H4). When trainees have the 
basic knowledge and skills to perform diﬀ  erent tasks during training, 
they will become motivated to transfer the learned skills (beta = 0.155). 
In other words, learner readiness exerts a signiﬁ  cant indirect eﬀ ect on 
training transfer through transfer motivation. Th e results of this study’s 
t-value (t = 2.320; t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007) indicate that transfer moti-
vation mediates the relationship between learner readiness and train-
ing transfer and supports H4. Learner readiness motivates trainees to
<<<PAGE=21>>>
Volume 27, Number 1 / 2014 DOI: 10.1002/piq  71
transfer their new skills and directly inﬂ  u-
ences transfer motivation (eﬀ  ect = 0.155). Th e
p-value ( p = 0.020; p < 0.05; Garver & Williams, 
2009) indicates that the path (learner readiness 
aﬀ ects the transfer motivation) is statistically sig-
niﬁ cant. Learner readiness, however, exerted an 
indirect eﬀ ect on training transfer mediated by 
transfer motivation. 
Peer and Supervisor Support
Environmental support (peer and supervisor support) plays an 
important role in the training transfer process, but due to conﬂ  icting 
results in past studies, there is a lack of consensus among researchers 
about peer and supervisor support. Th  erefore, this study suggests that 
researchers need to classify the kind of support trainees require before, 
during, and after training. Th e classiﬁ cation of peer and supervisor sup-
port at each stage of training will help researchers understand the impor-
tance of each kind of support before, during, and after training and its 
eﬀ  ects on trainees transfer motivation and training transfer. 
Th e hypotheses developed based on the research framework explain 
that transfer motivation mediates the relationship of peer support, super-
visor support and training transfer (H5, H6). Environmental factors 
like supervisor and peer support also motivate trainees to transfer their 
learned skills. In this regard, supervisor support (beta = 0.145) and peer 
support (beta = 0.125) also motivate trainees to transfer their learned 
skills and inﬂ uence the training transfer through transfer motivation. Th e 
results of this study’s t-value (t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007; t = 1.96) indicate 
that transfer motivation mediates the relationship between peer support 
and training transfer (H5). In other words, peer support directly inﬂ  u-
ences transfer motivation (eﬀ ect = 0.125). Th  e p-value (p < 0.05; Garver &
Williams, 2009; p = 0.049) indicates that the path (peer support positively 
related with transfer motivation) is statistically signiﬁ cant. 
Th e results of this study indicate that transfer motivation mediates the
relationship between supervisor support and training transfer with 
the t-value (t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007; t = 2.156) and therefore supports 
H6. In addition, the results explain that supervisor support positively 
inﬂ uences transfer motivation (eﬀ  ect = 0.145) and p-value ( p < 0.05; 
Garver & Williams, 2009; p = 0.031). Th  e path (supervisor support posi-
tively related with transfer motivation) is statistically signiﬁ cant. 
Instrumentality
  Intrinsic and extrinsic rewards (instrumentality) suggest that individ-
uals are poorly motivated when they do not believe that training will lead 
to improvement in their work, career, or compensation (Clark et al., 1993; 
Facteau et al., 1995; Noe, 1986). If trainees perceive training outcomes 
in terms of extrinsic rewards like money, status, and perceived external 
Intrinsic and extrinsic rewards

that individuals are poorly 
motivated when they do not 
believe that training will lead 
to improvement in their work, 
career, or compensation.

pressures, they may work hard but will make more mistakes or errors 
because their goal is to get ﬁ nancial rewards. If instead trainees view training 
outcomes in terms of intrinsic rewards such as greater self-determination, 
task involvement, competence, and interest, they will perform very well. 
Condry (1977) indicated that individuals who prefer material rewards 
such as raises or bonuses may work hard but may make more mistakes 
and their work will be of low quality. One possible reason behind this per-
ception is that when trainees are involved in training activities because of 
personal satisfaction or to improve their performance, their  motivational 
level can be higher. In other words, when forces that drive motivation 
(intention to improve performance, self-satisfaction) become part of the 
individual’s mind-set, that person is more motivated to transfer the skills 
learned to the job. But if the basic intention of trainees is just to get a 
promotion or a raise, their motivation can be low because they are not 
seeking to improve their performance. Furthermore, trainees’ percep-
tions of training output can be diﬀ erent. Researchers need to empirically 
test which kinds of rewards are important for employees. 
Th e hypothesis developed based on the research framework explains 
that transfer motivation mediates the relationship between instrumental-
ity and training transfer (H7). Instrumentality (intrinsic rewards) not only 
motivates trainees to transfer their learned skills (gamma = 0.142) but 
also helps them retain and then transfer their new skills (gamma = 0.152). 
Th erefore, when trainees retain more of the skills they learned, the more 
these skills will transfer to the job (gamma = 0.207). 
Th e results of the study also indicated that instrumentality exerts a 
signiﬁ cant direct eﬀ ect on training transfer mediated by training reten-
tion and transfer motivation, but has a stronger indirect eﬀ  ect through 
training retention as compared to transfer motivation. In addition, the 
more that trainees are satisﬁ  ed with the training activities, the more 
motivated they are to transfer the new skills (beta = 0.105). Subsequently, 
when trainees are motivated to transfer the skills they learned, the trans-
fer level is higher (beta = 0.418).
Th e results of this study’s t-value (t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007; t = 2.794) 
indicate that transfer motivation mediates the relationship between 
instrumentality (intrinsic rewards) and training transfer. Th  e results 
also explain that instrumentality  positively inﬂ  uences transfer motiva-
tion (eﬀ ect = 0.142) and p-value ( p < 0.05; Garver & Williams, 2009; 
p = 0.005). In addition, the study p-value (p < 0.05; Garver & Williams 
2009; p = 0.005) provides evidence and explains that instrumentality is 
positively related to training retention (eﬀ ect = 0.152).
Training Retention
Trainees cannot eﬀ  ectively transfer their training until and unless 
they retain what they have learned. Ford (2009) argued that getting learn-
ers involved is the key to retention and application of learned skills. 
Velada et al. (2007) suggested that “training retention is similar to the
<<<PAGE=23>>>
Volume 27, Number 1 / 2014 DOI: 10.1002/piq  73
cognitive ability and is the degree to which the trainee retains the content 
after training is completed. ” In the training transfer process, many fac-
tors aﬀ ect training retention. In this regard, May and Kahnweiler (2000) 
say that many factors inﬂ uence employees’ learning retention, including 
transfer design, trainee characteristics and environmental factors, and 
instrumentality. 
Th is study suggests that training retention mediates the relation-
ship between instrumentality and training transfer (H8). Similarly, 
instrumentality directly inﬂ  uences training retention (eﬀ  ect = 0.152) 
and transfer motivation (eﬀ ect = 0.142), which leads to transfer moti-
vation. Th ese ﬁ  ndings suggest that training retention plays equal roles 
as transfer motivation to inﬂ  uence the training transfer. Th  e result of 
hypothesis H8 indicates that training retention mediates the relationship 
between instrumentality or intrinsic rewards and training transfer t-value 
(t = 4.086, t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007) and inﬂ uences training transfer (eﬀ ect 
= 0.207). Th e results also indicate the positive relationship between train-
ing retention and instrumentality  p-value (p = 0.001, p < 0.05; Garver & 
Williams, 2009). Th  erefore, training retention works as a mediating factor 
between instrumentalities (Intrinsic rewards) and training transfer.  
Aff ective Reaction and Transfer Motivation
Aﬀ ective reaction, or the subjective evaluations learners make about 
their training experiences (Sitzmann et al., 2008), are the primary means 
by which organizations evaluate training programs (Sugrue & Rivera, 
2005).   Although aﬀ ective reactions are frequently assessed in practice, 
they remain poorly understood (Sitzmann et al., 2008). Ruona et al. (2002) 
believe that aﬀ ective reaction measures or measures of trainee satisfac-
tion remain one of the most overused methods of evaluation in the ﬁ  eld 
of human resource development. In fact, research has shown no correla-
tion between aﬀ ective reaction and other training outcomes (Alliger &
Janak; 1989; Dixon, 1990; Noe, 1986; Warr & Bunce, 1995). Hence, the 
focus on the aﬀ ective reaction measure has not been clear in past studies. 
Th us, it is suggested that aﬀ  ective reaction (utility or aﬀ  ective) may be 
aﬀ ected by other training outcomes through motivation, whereby a per-
son is motivated to show a speciﬁ c behavior when the person expects this 
behavior to help him or her achieve goals, as proposed by Vroom (1964). 
Th is study suggests that aﬀ  ective reaction mediates the relationship 
between perceived content validity and transfer motivation (H9), and 
transfer motivation mediates the relationship between aﬀ ective reaction 
and training transfer (H10). Th  e results indicate that perceived content 
validity inﬂ uences transfer motivation through aﬀ  ective reaction. In 
other words, aﬀ ective reaction plays a mediating role between perceived 
content validity and transfer motivation. Th  erefore, when trainees believe 
that they can improve their performance, they will be more motivated 
to transfer the skills they have acquired (gamma = 0.291). Furthermore, 
training content has a signiﬁ cant direct eﬀ ect on aﬀ  ective reaction (eﬀ ect

= 0.516) and performance self-eﬃ  cacy (eﬀ ect = 0.379) and a strong direct 
eﬀ  ect on aﬀ ective reaction as compared to performance self-eﬃ  cacy.
Th e results of this study support H9 and explain that aﬀ  ective 
reaction mediates the relationship between perceived content validity 
and transfer motivation t-value ( t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007; t = 9.098). 
Th e results of this study’s p-value ( p < 0.05; Garver & Williams, 2009; 
p = 0.036) also provide evidence and indicate that aﬀ  ective reaction 
positively inﬂ  uences transfer motivation (eﬀ ect = 0.105). Th  e results of 
this study’s t-value (t > 1.96; Hair et al., 2007; t = 2.097) supports H10 
and explains that transfer motivation mediates the relationship between 
aﬀ ective reaction and training transfer. Th e p-value results ( p = 0.001; 
p < 0.05; Garver & Williams 2009) also provide evidence and explain that 
transfer motivation positively inﬂ  uences training transfer (eﬀ ect = 0.418).
Discussion and Future Research Directions
Training transfer is an important issue among training and develop-
ment activities. Training professionals have been investigating the factors 
that are associated with trainees’ eﬀ ectively transferring skills they learn. 
Organizations have been investing millions of dollars to upgrade their 
employees’ skills in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In 
contrast, researchers have been trying to build on the literature on train-
ing transfer in order to provide strong theoretical grounding to training 
professionals. Th is study is part of that eﬀ ort. 
Th e concept of training retention is similar to cognitive ability and 
explains the degree to which trainees retain content after they com-
plete training (Velada et al., 2007). Training transfer can be maximized 
if trainees retain the skills they have learned. Th  is study indicates that 
training retention is positively related to training transfer and mediates 
the relationship between instrumentality (intrinsic rewards) and train-
ing transfer. Trainee may transfer the learned skills with the intention of 
improving their performance or getting intrinsic or extrinsic rewards. 
After completing the training, trainees should remember the training 
activities for longer periods and use the new skills whenever it is required 
of them on the job. Training retention should be an ongoing process for 
trainees. 
Th e concept of training retention has been underestimated in past 
research. Th is study has examined the role of training retention in the 
training transfer process and suggests that future research could explore 
the intention of trainees to retain training. It is only assumed in this study 
that retention is meant for transfer but there could be other reasons, such 
as increasing employability, personal satisfaction, self-development, or 
peer pressure.
Th is study empirically tested the role of learner readiness in the train-
ing transfer process and found that learner readiness positively relates to 
transfer motivation, which further inﬂ  uences training transfer. In other
<<<PAGE=25>>>
Volume 27, Number 1 / 2014 DOI: 10.1002/piq  75
words, learner readiness has an indirect eﬀ ect on training transfer medi-
ated by transfer motivation. Trainees should have the basic skills needed 
to perform the training activities and maximize their learning. For exam-
ple, if a trainee is going to learn how to operate accounting software, he or 
she needs to know how to use a computer. When trainees have the basic 
skills to perform training activities and basic knowledge about what kinds 
of activities they will perform during training, they are mentally prepared 
to participate in training activities and their learning level will rise. 
Among the environmental factors, the results of this study indicated 
that peer and supervisor support inﬂ uence training transfer mediated by 
transfer motivation. Th is study suggests that peer and supervisor support 
should be diﬀ erentiated with reference to type of support and its tim-
ing. Th is study investigated peer and supervisor support after the train-
ing and explained that managers should carefully examine what kind of 
support trainees need from their peers and supervisors. Th  is study has 
shed new light and proposes that trainees may need diﬀ  erent types of 
support from peers and supervisors before, during, and after the train-
ing. Future research should highlight the kind of support at each stage 
(before, during, and after the training) that is needed and empirically test 
the relationships with other training transfer factors. An understanding 
of environmental factors may lead to training eﬀ  ectiveness and improve 
employee performance after training. In addition, future research should 
examine the impact of training eﬀ  ectiveness on organizational perfor-
mance. Th is work will strengthen the literature on training transfer. Work 
explaining the importance of environmental factors (peer and supervisor 
support) within the context of training eﬀ  ectiveness will be helpful. 
Th is study explained the dual role of perceived content validity in 
the training transfer process, which to our knowledge has not been 
highlighted in past research. Perceived content validity develops posi-
tive aﬀ ective reaction and increases trainees’ performance self-eﬃ  cacy. 
When trainees see that the content of the training is similar to the work 
they do, they react more positively toward the training activities and 
their performance self-eﬃ  cacy level increases. Th is ﬁ nding suggests that 
knowledge is key in training transfer and that related knowledge that is 
explicit in terms of similarity between training content and the job boosts 
trainees’ conﬁ dence of using what they have learned to increase their 
performance. Future studies should examine the relationship between 
trainees’ perceptions of content validity and job performance to help 
substantiate the role of perceived content validity in the training transfer 
process.
In past work, less attention has been given to highlight factors that 
develop trainee performance self-eﬃ   cacy. Th is study has focused on 
trainee performance self-eﬃ  cacy and aﬀ ective reaction and highlighted 
factors that inﬂ  uence trainees’ eﬃ   cacy level and aﬀ  ective reaction. For 
example, one factor that inﬂ uences performance self-eﬃ  cacy is transfer 
design. Th e results of this study indicate that perceived content validity 
and transfer design work together and inﬂ  uence trainees’ performance
<<<PAGE=26>>>
76 DOI: 10.1002/piq Performance Improvement Quarterly
self-eﬃ  cacy. Th e results also indicate that performance self-eﬃ   cacy is 
positively related to transfer motivation. In other words, performance 
self-eﬃ  cacy has an indirect eﬀ ect on training transfer mediated by trans-
fer motivation. Th is supports the notion that explicit related knowledge 
helps boost trainees’ conﬁ  dence in training transfer and perceive it to 
boost their performance as well. Further exploration of this explicit-
related knowledge in training is a topic for future research in terms of 
identifying its conceptual and operational deﬁ  nitions and establishing an 
instrument to measure it. 
Th e role of aﬀ  ective reaction has not been clear in previous work. Th e
results of this study indicate that aﬀ  ective reaction plays a mediating 
role between perceived content validity and transfer motivation. When 
trainees feel good about or satisﬁ ed with the training program, they likely 
perceive the training content as relevant, and transfer is more likely to 
take place. Hence, satisfaction with training plays a role in training trans-
fer. However, factors that lead to this satisfaction are not addressed in this 
research, so it remains another direction for future research. Th  erefore, 
there is a need to highlight the factors that develop positive aﬀ ective reac-
tion. In the future, researchers should highlight the relationship between 
aﬀ ective reaction and other levels of the Kirkpatrick model like learning 
and transfer. 
Th is study has investigated the relationship between intrinsic rewards 
and training retention and found that when trainees perceive training 
activities as a source of receiving intrinsic rewards, they retain more skills 
and transfer of learning occurs. Th e results of this study also indicate that 
intrinsic rewards inﬂ uence training transfer mediated by training reten-
tion and training transfer. Th  ese intrinsic rewards may develop a positive 
aﬀ ective reaction, another avenue for future research. Th  is ﬁ  nding sug-
gests that intrinsic rewards also reinforce retention and promote transfer. 
Intrinsic rewards tied to training could also act as a form of positive per-
ception toward training. 
Implications
As part of a cross-sectional study, this study helps build on the exist-
ing training literature by explaining the role and purpose of diﬀ erent fac-
tors that aﬀ ect the training transfer process. It thus sheds new light and 
proposed diﬀ erent relationships between the variables and their eﬀ  ects 
on training transfer. A clear understanding about these factors will help 
researchers, human resource development (HRD) practitioners, and 
training professionals to design eﬀ ective training programs. Th e ﬁ ndings 
of this research will be helpful for HRD professionals to develop eﬀ ective 
strategies in order to maximize training transfer and eﬀ  ectively manage 
training programs. Th e ﬁ ndings also explain the roles of each stakeholder 
(trainers, trainees, supervisors, peers, and top management), which will 
lead to maximizing training transfer at work place.

Th e ﬁ ndings of this research suggest that supervisors should support 
trainees before, during, and after training. Th is supervisor support before 
training may encourage trainees to realize how training activities can 
help them to improve their performance. During the training, supervisors 
may support trainees as they work on the training activities and motivate 
them to maximize their learning. After training, supervisors should set 
goals for trainees to transfer the skills they have learned. In addition, they 
should discuss with trainees how to apply the new skills on the job. When 
supervisors play this role properly, training transfer can increase.
Th is study has suggested that peers also can play a role to maximize 
training transfer. Th  ey should encourage trainees to participate in train-
ing activities and help trainees apply the new skills in order to improve 
their performance and achieve organizational tasks.
Supervisor support and peer support increase trainees’ transfer moti-
vation level. Th erefore, trainers should engage trainees’ supervisors and 
peers in the training transfer process and explain their role to increase 
training transfer. Trainers should discuss with supervisors and peers their 
role and guide them to play their role eﬀ  ectively in order to enhance 
training transfer.  
Trainers should give importance to the content of the training. When 
trainees perceive that the content of the training is similar to their actual 
work, their eﬃ  cacy level increases and they react more positively toward 
training activities. Th erefore, the content of the training is an important 
consideration for trainers to maximize training transfer.
Another important consideration for trainers and training profes-
sionals is that learners should be ready to participate in training activities. 
Th e ﬁ  ndings of this study suggest that before starting a training pro-
gram, trainers should make sure that the trainees have the basic skills and 
knowledge required to participate in training activities.
Transfer design and content validity play important roles in the 
training transfer process. Based on the ﬁ  ndings, we suggest that train-
ers should pay attention to transfer design and training content in order 
to improve trainees’ performance self-eﬃ  cacy. Trainers might use some 
other techniques that could improve trainees’ transfer motivation level 
that ultimately leads to increase training transfer. 
Finally, HRD professionals and trainers should explain to trainees 
how to apply their new skills on the job. Th is practical exposure increases 
trainees’ eﬃ  cacy levels and leads to more eﬀ  ective training transfer. In 
addition, top management, trainers, and supervisors should appreciate, 
encourage, and motivate trainees to participate in training activities
