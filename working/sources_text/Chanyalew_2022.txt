Abstract
Background: Weak health information systems (HISs) hobble countries’ abilities to effectively manage and distribute their
resources to match the burden of disease. The Capacity Building and Mentorship Program (CBMP) was implemented in select
districts of the Amhara region of Ethiopia to improve HIS performance; however, evidence about the effectiveness of the
intervention was meager.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of routine health information use for evidence-based decision-making
among health facility and department heads in the Amhara region, Northwest Ethiopia.
Methods: The study was conducted in 10 districts of the Amhara region: five were in the intervention group and five were in
the comparison group. We employed a quasi-experimental study design in the form of a pretest-posttest comparison group. Data
were collected from June to July 2020 from the heads of departments and facilities in 36 intervention and 43 comparison facilities.
The sample size was calculated using the double population formula, and we recruited 172 participants from each group. We
applied a difference-in-differences analysis approach to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Heterogeneity of program
effect among subgroups was assessed using a triple differences method (ie, difference-in-difference-in-differences [DIDID]
method). Thus, the β coefficients, 95% CIs, and P values were calculated for each parameter, and we determined that the program
was effective if the interaction term was significant at P<.05.
Results: Data were collected using the endpoint survey from 155 out of 172 (90.1%) participants in the intervention group and
166 out of 172 (96.5%) participants in the comparison group. The average level of information use for the comparison group was
37.3% (95% CI 31.1%-43.6%) at baseline and 43.7% (95% CI 37.9%-49.5%) at study endpoint. The average level of information
use for the intervention group was 52.2% (95% CI 46.2%-58.3%) at baseline and 75.8% (95% CI 71.6%-80.0%) at study endpoint.
The study indicated that the net program change over time was 17% (95% CI 5%-28%; P=.003). The subgroup analysis also
indicated that location showed significant program effect heterogeneity, with a DIDID estimate equal to 0.16 (95% CI 0.026-0.29;
P=.02). However, sex, age, educational level, salary, and experience did not show significant heterogeneity in program effect,
with DIDID estimates of 0.046 (95% CI –0.089 to 0.182), –0.002 (95% CI –0.015 to 0.009), –0.055 (95% CI –0.190 to 0.079),
–1.63 (95% CI –5.22 to 1.95), and –0.006 (95% CI –0.017 to 0.005), respectively.
Conclusions: The CBMP was effective at enhancing the capacity of study participants in using the routine HIS for
decision-making. We noted that urban facilities had benefited more than their counterparts. The intervention has been shown to

produce positive outcomes and should be scaled up to be used in other districts. Moreover, the mentorship modalities for rural
facilities should be redesigned to maximize the benefits.

Introduction
A health information system (HIS) is an intersection between
health care business processes and information systems to
deliver better health care services [
1]. An effective and
integrated HIS is the foundation of a strong health system and
provides underpinnings for decision-making [
2,3]. It has much
to offer in managing health care costs and improving health
care quality [
4,5]. Effective decision-making to improve public
health care essentially depends on the availability of reliable
data [
6].
Countries have made tremendous efforts to enhance data use
practice for patient care and management. For example, a
granular ontology model for maternal and child HISs and a
national acute care information platform were implemented and
improved data analysis skills and policy making in Pakistan [
6]
and Sri Lanka [ 7], respectively. On the other hand, timely
feedback on health system performance was implemented in
sub-Saharan African countries and resulted in enhanced
decision-making among leaders [
8]. Likewise, a data-driven
quality improvement intervention in Mozambique, Rwanda,
and Zambia [
9], as well as a data use workshop in Zanzibar and
the United Republic of Tanzania [ 10], were implemented and
brought a shift from a lack of awareness to collaborative
ownership and improved local use of target indicators to drive
change, respectively.
In Botswana, a task-shifting initiative (ie, development of a
dedicated monitoring and evaluation cadre) was implemented
to strengthen monitoring and evaluation and build a sustainable
HIS. As a result, the intervention brought increased use of health
data for disease surveillance, operational research, and planning
purposes [
11]. The Feedback and Analytic Comparison Tool
in Egypt [12] and the District Health Profile tool in Kenya [13]
were implemented as change drivers; they helped health workers
to identify gaps and facilitated data-informed decision-making.
Moreover, a partnership-mentoring model implemented in the
public hospitals of Ethiopia resulted in a 60% improvement of
management indicators [
14].
Previous work has indicated that training, supervision, a good
perceived culture of information use, having standard indicators,
competence on routine HIS (RHIS) tasks, technology
enhancement along with capacity building activities, and
feedback systems were positively associated with routine health
information use [
15-18]. Despite this, there has been a concern
when using this information in strategic decision-making among
health workers [
19] as well as a concern that the RHIS was
unfairly used to enhance evidence-based decision-making [15].
According to Mate et al [ 20], incomplete, inaccurate, and
untimely data have been challenges of data use. Hoxha et al
[
16] also documented that the technical, organizational, and
behavioral attributes of RHIS data remain challenges in health
data use.
The investment in health systems infrastructure or training for
clinicians and administrators in low- and middle-income
countries (LMIC) has been low [
21]. Weak HISs hobble the
ability of many LMIC to distribute their resources to match the
burden of disease [
22], and lack of data use is disempowering
staff and those seeking to support them from making progress
in setting-relevant research and quality improvement [
7].
Considering the low level of health data use among health
workers, the Amhara Regional Health Bureau (ARHB), in
collaboration with the University of Gondar (UoG) in Ethiopia,
introduced the Capacity Building and Mentorship Program
(CBMP) in 2019. The initiative has been implemented in five
selected districts of the region since then. However, information
was meager about the effectiveness of the intervention on the
use of information in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed
to determine the level of health information use among health
facilities and department heads in the Amhara region, Northwest
Ethiopia.
Methods
Study Setting and Design
Baseline data were collected from April to May 2019 in 10
selected districts of the Amhara region: five were in the
intervention group and five were in the comparison group. A
year later, endpoint data were collected from June to July 2020
in the same districts. Thus, to estimate the effectiveness of the
intervention, a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent, control group
study design was employed [
23].
The Amhara region is located between 8˚45 ′ N and 13˚45 ′ N
latitude and 35˚46 ′ E and 40˚25 ′ E longitude in Northwest
Ethiopia [24,25]. It is subdivided administratively into 12 zones
and three town administrations ( Figure 1). The zones and the
town administrations are again subdivided into a total of 189
districts, of which 39 are urban towns. As of 2020, the total
population of the region was 22,292,890. The ratio of males to
females was close to 1. The region has been implementing a
three-tier health system comprised of primary, secondary, and
tertiary levels. There are nine referral hospitals, 71 primary
hospitals, 954 health centers, and 3450 health posts that are
providing health services in the region [
26].

Participants
The source population of this study included all health
department and health facility heads. Individuals responsible
for the health departments or health institutions that were
expected to use routine health data and who were at the selected
facilities for at least 6 months were included in the study.
However, health department heads who were on leave, retired,
and not supposed to use routine health information for patient
monitoring and follow-up were excluded from the study. Since
it was an intervention effectiveness study, newly inaugurated
facilities with patient stays of up to 3 months were also excluded
from the study.
Interventions
The CBMP is an innovative approach that has been implemented
since 2019 in selected districts of Ethiopia through the joint
venture between the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and
selected universities; its goal is to strengthen the national HIS
through proper data documentation, information use, and
digitalization. The ARHB along with the UoG were responsible
for implementing the intervention in the Amhara region. The
intervention had two components: tailored training and
mentorship. It targeted service delivery unit heads, case team
leaders, health department heads, health facility heads, program
officers, and district office managers [
27].
The intervention was designed primarily to improve the capacity
of health workers at different levels. Thus, data quality and
information use training manuals were distributed to health
facilities, and participants from intervention districts received
training on DHIS2 (District Health Information Software 2)
data analytics, visualization, presentation, troubleshooting, and
data use for decision-making. Furthermore, HIS resources (ie,
registers, tally sheets, and computers) were provided to health
facilities to enhance the availability and quality of data, and
joint review meetings, which served as a platform for discussion,
were organized every 6 months [
28].
Mentoring is a strategic development activity that supports
health workers to attain the vision and goals of the organization
[
29]. The UoG recruited mentors from departments such as
health informatics, health systems and policy, epidemiology
and biostatistics, and health education. Thus, training was
organized and provided to mentors to introduce them to the HIS
strategies being implemented nationally and to provide them
with mentorship skills. The trained mentors conducted
mentorship programs at each health facility department every
quarter for 1 year using the mentorship checklist. As a result,
four rounds of mentorship programs were conducted. After that,
the mentors with their mentees developed action plans that
indicated activities to be accomplished, responsible persons,
and implementation period. Based on the mentorship findings,
mentees provided detailed written feedback that contained the
strengths, weaknesses, and next steps in the performance of the
RHIS.
Outcomes
The dependent variable of the study was the level of information
use. The concept of information used for action in the health
care systemwas applied. The practice of routine health data use
is a process that encompasses gap identification, prioritization,
root cause analysis, action plan development, and follow-up.
Thus, we used a composite indicator to calculate the average
value of information use. The five components of the outcome
variable were as follows: identifying indicators in the
department, calculating targets versus achievements, providing
feedback to health workers at the lower levels, calculating
program coverage, and evidence showing the use of data to
inform decisions. We calculated the average value of these five
indicators and compared the level of information use among
intervention and comparison groups [
15,30].
Sample Size
The study employed a quasi-experimental design with pre- and
postassessment and intervention and comparison groups.
Considering the difference in the level of information use among
intervention and comparison districts after the intervention, we
employed a double population proportion formula to estimate
the sample size. Mathematically, the sample size was determined
using the following formula [
31]:
N = (K [P1 (1 – P1) + P2 (1 – P 2)]) / ([P1 – P2]2)
where N is the sample size; P1 is the anticipated proportion of
facilities with the attribute of interest (ie, level of information
use after the intervention, assuming a 15% increase in
information use and considered as 84%) [
32]; P 2 is the
proportion of data use with no intervention, taken as 69%; K is
the constant at an α  value of .05 and a β value of .2, taken as

7.9; and power (1 – β) was 80% [ 33,34]. With these
assumptions, the sample size was calculated to be 122 units per
department for each group. Though the source population was
finite (<10,000), the sample size was corrected using the
correction formula. Considering a design effect of 1.5 and a 5%
nonresponse rate, the final sample size was 172 for each group.
Thus, the overall sample size for both groups combined was
344 individuals.
As a quasi-experimental study, five districts were recruited for
each arm (ie, intervention and comparison groups). The
intervention districts were selected by the FMoH from among
the low-performance districts regarding RHIS activities in the
region. However, comparison districts were chosen randomly
among the 146 districts in the region. We applied a multistage
sampling procedure to select the study participants and
developed a sampling frame that contained a list of the heads
of departments and facilities in the selected districts. Thus, study
participants were selected from the study population using a
simple random sampling technique.
Data Collection Tools and Procedures
Data collection tools were developed based on the Performance
of Routine Information System Management tools (version 3)
and adapted to the local context [
35]. In this paper, we applied
the Information Use Assessment Tool and Organizational and
Behavioral Assessment Tool (OBAT). The tools were piloted
in two districts, Injibara and Debre Tabor, for validity and
reliability checks; the districts were out of the study area but
comparable with the study sites. The reliability assessment score
showed a Cronbach α of .92 for the Likert scale, which indicated
that the tool was consistent in measuring the outcome of interest
[
36].
The Information Use Assessment Tool is an
interviewer-administered tool. It was used to examine the health
facilities’ report production, information display, discussions,
and decisions based on the RHIS, planning, supervision, and
mentorship. The OBAT is a self-administered tool that is used
to identify information about the technical, organizational, and
behavioral constraints for routine health data use. Eight data
collectors and two supervisors participated in the data collection.
The principal investigator (PI) delivered training on data
recording, document review, and ethical consideration to data
collectors and supervisors for 2 days. A data quality checklist
was developed and applied during data collection to maintain
the quality of data. Daily feedback was provided to data
collectors by supervisors. The PI led and coordinated the overall
data collection process.
Data collectors requested permission from the facility heads to
access the documents and departments. In addition, they
provided information about the purpose of the study and
obtained written consent from selected participants before
interviewing them. Following that, they prepared participants
for the interview. They reviewed source documents and charts
posted in the department or unit, observed the discussion points
made among members of the management body in the logbook,
and collected data using the study tool. Subsequently,
respondents were provided with a self-administered tool (ie,
the OBAT) and informed to take an ample amount of time to
complete the questionnaire.
Assignment Methods
The FMoH with the ARHB selected five intervention districts
based on predefined criteria. All of these districts were low
performers regarding the RHIS activities. They had a low level
of information use and poor data quality but could potentially
improve their performance if given the intervention. As a result,
random assignments of districts to comparison and intervention
arms were not applicable. However, the research team, in
collaboration with the ARHB, selected five comparison districts
to help in measuring the effectiveness of the intervention.
Therefore, the intervention groups received usual service and
the new CBMP intervention (ie, tailored training and
mentorship), and the comparison groups received usual service
(ie, supervision and review meeting by routine service).
Blinding
The nature of the intervention was designed to be implemented
by mobile mentors. As a result, we were unable to mask health
workers and program implementers. However, all study
participants and data collectors were blinded to the research
question and hypothesis that the team generated during
implementation, baseline, and endpoint data collection.
Statistical Methods
The team scrutinized the data to identify missing values before
entering the data into the software. The data entry template was
developed using EpiData software (version 3.1; EpiData
Association) by applying the commands and skipping patterns
that minimized errors during entry. Thus, cleaned data were
entered into EpiData and exported to R software (version 4.0.4;
The R Foundation) in CSV file format to compute the effect
size of the intervention. R software has different built-in
statistical packages that enable researchers to run statistical
models and test the hypothesis in question. Descriptive statistics,
such as mean and percentage, were calculated. Tables and graphs
were also used for presenting findings.
The data were collected from the intervention and comparison
districts before and after the implementation of the intervention.
Thus, it entailed the difference-in-differences (DID) method to
determine the effectiveness of the CBMP. As alluded to by
different scholars, the DID method is one of the most frequently
used methods in outcome and impact evaluation studies. Based
on a combination of comparisons before and after the
intervention as well as comparisons of the treatment and
comparison groups, the method has an intuitive appeal and has
been widely used in economics, public policy, health research,
management, and other fields [
37,38]. Thus, we employed the
DID estimation technique to measure the effectiveness of the
intervention using data from before and after the intervention
in comparison of intervention and comparison groups. It was
applied predominantly to quantify and test whether the level of
change in the outcome of interest in the intervention group was
significant compared to the comparison group.
The DID approach applied a linear regression model and
calculated the change over time in intervention and comparison
JMIR Med Inform 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 4 | e30518 | p. 4https://medinform.jmir.org/2022/4/e30518

groups. It double-differenced the change over time in the
intervention group compared to the comparison group. The
method also generated a valid estimate of the causal effect if
the implementation of the CBMP was the only factor that might
cause a change in the association between the CBMP and
average information use before and after the intervention, as
shown in the equation below:
Ygt = β0 + β1Tg + β2Pt + β3(Tg × Pt) + β4(Tg × P t ×
covariates) + εt
where Y gt is the average level of information use, β1 is the
average difference in Y between the two groups that is common
in both time periods, β2 is the average change in Y from the
baseline to the endpoint time period that is common to both
groups, β3 is the average change in Y from the baseline to the
endpoint time period of the intervention group compared to the
comparison group, and β4 is the triple difference adjusted for
some covariates.
To estimate the average change in information use over time
using the DID model, we created a dummy variable by assigning
1 to the intervention group and 0 to the comparison group.
Moreover, the preintervention period and postintervention period
were assigned 0 and 1, respectively. Subsequently, we employed
a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DIDID) method to
assess whether the program effects were heterogeneous across
sex (male vs female), age (≤30 years vs >30 years), educational
level (diploma vs above diploma), location (rural vs urban),
salary (≤5000 ETB [Ethiopian birr] vs >5000 ETB; a currency
exchange rate of 44.32 ETB=US $1 is applicable), and
experience (≤5 years vs >5 years) [
15].
The model provided information about the β coefficients, P
values, and 95% CIs. If the coefficient for the interaction term
(ie, the DID estimator) was significant at an α  value of .05, we
determined that the intervention was responsible for causing
the change in the treatment group. In addition, the coefficients
for the triple difference (ie, the DIDID estimator) were examined
using the covariates listed above; one group was judged as
having benefited more than the other if the model provided
significant β coefficients [
37,38].
Ethics Approval
The study protocol was developed considering the ethical
principles from the Declaration of Helsinki. The research
protocol was registered at the Pan African Clinical Trials
Registry (PACTR202001559723931), which is a World Health
Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
primary register [
39]. Moreover, the registry confirmed that the
intervention was implemented with ethical consideration to
human subject involvement. The CBMP offers original insights
and is a new approach; the tailored intervention was
implemented in an adaptive way to address the gaps identified
at a specific intervention site. We also secured an ethical
clearance letter from the UoG Institutional Review Board
(reference No. O/V/P/RCS/05/430/2018). Participants were
informed of the purpose of the study and consented before any
inquiry. Data were collected anonymously with no personal
identifiers; data were used only for this study. We presented
findings with no manipulation or subject involvement.
Results
Participant Flow Through the Study
Baseline data were collected from 344 study participants
(intervention: n=172, 50%; comparison: n=172, 50%) across
83 health facilities. However, a total of 321 study participants
(intervention: n=155, 48.3%; comparison: n=166, 51.7%) across
79 health facilities (intervention: n=36, 46%; comparison: n=43,
54%) were surveyed at the endpoint of the study; the response
rate was 93.3% (321/344). A total of 4 facilities out of 40 (10%)
from the intervention arm were excluded because they became
part of the newly established districts (

Characteristics of Study Participants
Among the 321 total study participants, 155 (48.3%) were from
the intervention districts and 166 (51.7%) were from the
comparison districts. More than half of the study participants
were male in both intervention and comparison districts at
baseline and endpoint periods. Almost two-thirds of the study
participants were below the age of 28 years in both arms.
Similarly, more than half of the study participants were diploma
holders and resided in rural locations. Two-thirds of the
participants earned equal to or below 5000 ETB at baseline,
and nearly half of them earned above 5000 ETB at the study
endpoint in both the intervention and comparison groups. More
than half of the study participants had 5 years or more of
experience (

Component Indicators of Information Use
The study indicated that a mean of 30.2% (95% CI 23.3-37.2)
and 51.7% (95% CI 44.23-59.3) of the department heads in
comparison and intervention districts, respectively, used
available evidence while making decisions at baseline, whereas
a mean of 33.7% (95% CI 26.4-41.0) and 73.5% (95% CI
66.7-80.3) of the department heads in comparison and
intervention districts, respectively, used available evidence
while making decisions at study endpoint. At baseline, a mean
of 41.9% (95% CI 34.5-49.3) and 43.0% (95% CI 35.5-50.5)
of the departments in the comparison group calculated target

mean of 63.9% (95% CI 56.7-71.2) and 50.0% (95% CI
42.5-57.5) of the departments in the intervention group did so.
However, the postperiod data showed that a mean of 56.0%
(95% CI 48.4-63.7) and 45.2% (95% CI 37.6-52.8) of the
comparison groups calculated target achievement and program
coverage, respectively, whereas a mean of 85.5% (95% CI
80.1-90.9) and 76.5% (95% CI 70.0-83.0) of the intervention
groups did so. At baseline, less than half of the study participants
in both groups provided feedback to health workers at the lower
levels; however, at the study endpoint, a mean of 34.9% (95%
CI 27.5-42.3) of comparison group participants and 62.1% (95%
CI 54.6-69.5) of the intervention group participants did so. At
baseline, a mean of 41.9% (95% CI 34.5-49.3) and 58.7% (95%
CI 51.3-66.2) of the departments in the comparison and
intervention groups, respectively, had identified indicators,
whereas at the study endpoint, a mean of 48.8% (95% CI
41.1-56.5) and 81.3% (95% CI 75.3-87.3) of the departments
in the comparison and intervention groups, respectively, had
done so (

Amhara region, Northwest Ethiopia, 2021. The mean values are reported on the bars; the whiskers represent 95% CI values.
Average Level of Information Use in Decision-making
The average level of information use for the comparison group
was 37.3% (95% CI 31.1%-43.6%) at baseline and 43.7% (95%
CI 37.9%-49.5%) at the study endpoint. The average level of
information use for the intervention group was 52.2% (95% CI
46.2%-58.3%) at baseline and 75.8% (95% CI 71.6%-80.0%)
at the study endpoint. The DID analysis indicated that the net
program effect change over time was significant ( P=.003). It
indicated that the intervention resulted in a 17% (95% CI
5%-28%) increment in the level of information use among the
intervention districts compared to the comparison districts (

Discussion
Principal Findings
All five component indicators showed high improvement at the
study endpoint compared to baseline in each group. The
intervention resulted in a 17% change in the average level of
information use among study participants in the intervention
districts compared to the comparison districts. We noted that
the effect of the intervention was heterogeneous in urban and
rural facilities. However, significant differences were not
observed based on the sex, age, educational level, salary, and
experience of the study participants.
This research revealed that the CBMP was effective in
improving the capacity of the department and facility heads in
using routine health information for decision-making and action.
This finding was higher than that found in a cluster randomized
controlled trial conducted in Sierra Leone on a community
health data review meeting, which resulted in a 14% increment
in evidence generation [
40]. However, this finding was by far
below the findings reported in a study conducted in Nigeria; in
that study, data quality and information use training were found
to improve feedback mechanisms by 54% [
32]. This difference
could be due to the large number of facilities covered by the
CBMP and the nature of the study participants. Building health
workers’ capacity in data use for actions at all levels in the
health system would improve and make more efficient the use
of health care resources, which would, in turn, lead to making
quality services available to clients.
As indicated with these findings, the intervention resulted in
the majority of study participants having identified and used
indicators to track performance progress in their catchment area.
It was consistent with a single study done in Zanzibar and
Tanzania where the data use workshop resulted in improvement
in the local use of target indicators [
10]. Identifying and using
indicators in the health system enable health workers to measure
the occurrence of disease or other health conditions and factors
contributing to them [
41]. In addition, indicators link
information to actions and provide signals as to whether a
program is effective and efficient in achieving the intended
results in the target groups [
42].
Though the findings highlighted an improvement in providing
feedback to health workers at lower levels, it was still
unsatisfactory compared to the desired level [
27]; however, it
was better than the findings of the study done in the Southern
Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region [ 43]. It was also
inconsistent with the findings obtained in Egypt that reported
the effectiveness of the Feedback and Analytic Comparison
Tool intervention in improving clinicians’ capacity on providing
feedback [
12]. The difference might be because the latter was
a single intervention primarily targeted at improving feedback
mechanisms. In addition, it could be associated with low
attention given to the importance of feedback among the study
participants in our study. Generating synthesized evidence that
indicates the strengths and weaknesses of health workers in the
health system is one of the solemn expected activities, among
others, in realizing the information revolution agenda [
44]. Thus,
ineffective feedback mechanisms lead to the provision of
poor-quality services to clients and patients.
It was evidenced in a subgroup analysis that urban dwellers
benefited more from the intervention than their counterparts.
This finding is also in line with the baseline study finding, which
indicated that work location was a significant factor associated
with the level of information use [
15]. This may be because
more senior and qualified health workers had transferred from
rural to urban facilities. Staff transfer is a common practice in
the health system to reduce staff attrition rate [
45]. This
imbalance created different achievement levels in reaching the
information revolution targets in all districts, which, in turn,
can affect the quality of care provided to beneficiaries in general.
Limitations
One limitation of this study was that we did not employ
randomization and blinding because of the nature of the study.
This may have introduced some information leakage between
intervention and comparison districts. Some facilities from
which we took baseline data were not included in the endpoint
survey, which may have biased the results. Moreover, social
desirability and recall bias may also have been introduced, since
participants were part of the intervention.
Conclusions
The CBMP was found to be effective in improving department
and facility heads’ capacity in using routine health information
for decision-making. The intervention was more beneficial to
study participants who resided in urban facilities than their
counterparts. A remarkable change was observed in using the
available evidence to inform decisions, identify indicators for
tracking performance progress, compare targets versus
achievements, and calculate program coverage. However, there
is still a gap in providing synthesized feedback to health workers

at lower levels. Therefore, we propose the following
recommendations. The intervention has been proven to produce
positive outcomes and should be scaled up to other districts.
Moreover, attention should be given to enhance the capacity of
health workers employed in rural facilities and to strengthen
feedback mechanisms at all levels, in order to reach the desired
outcomes of the information revolution.
