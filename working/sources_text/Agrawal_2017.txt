S
ince 2015, when the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were 
adopted and the Paris Agreement was concluded, the concept of devel -
opment has transformed in two major directions. First, the old distinction 
between “developing” and “developed” countries has disappeared in the face 
of global threats, particularly of climate change. All countries are now per -
ceived as “developing” toward a sustainable, equitable, and inclusive future. 
Second, the scope and ambition of development in the coming decades has 
grown dramatically, and has now integrated the peace and conflict agenda 
as well as humanitarian efforts in response to natural disasters, including 
a focus on ecosystem services that are essential for humankind to survive. 
To tackle these issues, the traditional social and economic development 
agendas are changing beyond recognition, with innovation, new partnerships, 
and efforts focused on green societies and economies taking shape. Into this 
mix of change and ambitious perspectives, evaluation is challenged to provide 
evidence on what works, where, for whom, and under what circumstances in 
a labyrinth of new policies, program, and interventions. This book provides 
inspiration for an emerging new role for evaluation in the global push toward 
a sustainable, equitable, and inclusive world.
The Independent Evaluation Office of the United Nations Develop-
ment Programme (UNDP) and the International Development Evaluation 
Association (IDEAS) are to be applauded for their initiative to start up the 
discussion on the role of evaluation in the SDGs just a month after these 
goals were approved. They organized two conferences that took place in 
parallel, with joint keynote addresses and special sessions: one from the 
perspective of governments, the other from the perspective of the profes-
sional development evaluator. These conferences took place in Bangkok, 
Thailand, in October 2015. They ended with the Bangkok Declaration on 
National Evaluation Capacity for the Sustainable Development Goals, which 
was subsequently included in the Global Evaluation Agenda 2016–2020. 
While conference proceedings were published in 2016, IDEAS and UNDP’s 
Independent Evaluation Office also approached the most innovative and

forward-thinking contributors to the conference to update their insights for 
this book, which provides a stimulating array of subjects.
This is of the utmost importance. We need to understand the way 
forward on the many challenges in the SDGs. If we truly want to “leave 
no one behind,” we need to learn from our mistakes and from efforts to 
build inclusive and equitable societies that can sustain themselves, not just 
economically, but in an endurable relationship with nature. While achieving 
insight is not just an effort of evaluation, it is one of the few systematic and 
independent assessments of interventions and innovations that we have. In its 
best incarnation, it includes perspectives from civil society, the private sector, 
government at all levels, and academia. In Agenda 2030, evaluation has a rec-
ognized role to play in understanding the progress that is made toward the 
SDGs. It is therefore crucial that the discussion started in Bangkok continues, 
and this book provides fuel to this fire. 
This book provides an overview of some of the crucial transforma-
tions we see in development, and how evaluation plays an important role in 
these changes. First and foremost is the shift from donor-centric evaluation 
to country systems for monitoring and evaluation that can provide evidence 
for decision making in these countries. The chapters in part I make important 
points on how evaluation contributes to some of the most significant issues 
of our time, such as inclusive societies, reducing the carbon footprint of our 
economies, and gender and equity. Capacities and capabilities for evaluation 
of progress toward the SDGs are explored in part II. Part III is devoted to 
regional and national perspectives, underscoring that evaluation is becoming 
increasingly relevant to countries’ development priorities in many regions of 
the world. Part IV deals with safeguards and resettlement, and demonstrates 
the negative impacts of development displacement that governments need 
to be aware of. The book’s last part addresses some of the enduring prob-
lems of evaluation: how to evaluate impact in complex circumstances; how to 
evaluate new partnerships and new forms of private sector involvement, such 
as social and environmental impact investing.
In the meantime, the debate continues, as we see it taken up in new 
conferences and in deliberations of governments and societies on the poten-
tial role evaluation could play in understanding progress toward the SDGs. I 
hope this book contributes to informing that debate.

E
valuation is a dynamic, evolving, global profession. This book reflects and 
illuminates that dynamism, evolution, and global engagement. To place 
this book in context and help you appreciate its significance, let me preface 
the new directions presented in these pages with some historical context.
Evaluation as a profession has been international in orientation and 
membership from its formal association beginnings in the mid-1970s when 
the Australasian Evaluation Society, the Canadian Evaluation Society, and 
American Evaluation Association predecessors (the Evaluation Network and 
the Evaluation Research Society) were all formed. The European Evaluation 
Society was founded in 1992. 
The African Evaluation Association was formed in 1999 in Nairobi. The 
Latin American Evaluation Network was conceived in Lima in 2003, bringing 
together the networks of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Networks and associa-
tions in other regions followed. The International Development Evaluation 
Association (IDEAS) was inaugurated in 2002 in Beijing to help fill a gap in 
the international evaluation architecture. This was followed by international 
conferences, which are now biennial. The conference themes provide an 
overview of issues in development evaluation, issues still being addressed 
in the current volume. Watch for these recurring themes, and how they have 
evolved, as you read this book:

Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
xiv
The 21st century has seen exponential international growth and 
development of evaluation, highlighted in 2015 as the International Year 
of Evaluation, as recognized by the United Nations. By 2017, more than a 
hundred voluntary organizations for professional evaluation had been formed 
representing thousands of evaluators worldwide. 
TEN EVALUATION TRENDS TO LOOK FOR IN THIS VOLUME
The evolution of evaluation reflects the profession’s development and adap-
tation to a rapidly changing world. The practice of evaluation is inextricably 
linked to changes in the world. At any given moment, evaluation practice 
worldwide will include traditional ways of doing evaluation that have become 
established over the last 50 years as well as innovative new directions that are 
on the leading edge of both development and evaluation. This volume reflects 
that mix. With that in mind, I offer my top 10 list of things to look for in this 
book. To the extent that you can identify these developments and challenges, 
and make the distinctions between traditional evaluation approaches and inno-
vative new directions, you understand the history, dynamism, and future of 
our profession. As is the case with top 10 lists, I offer a countdown, concluding 
with the most important challenge—at least as I see it. I would add that my 
list is necessarily subjective and based upon my own observations and biases, 
so by offering this list, I invite readers to think about your own observations of 
evaluation trends and challenges, and look for how the authors in this book 
acknowledge and engage with those trends and challenges. 
10 . New evaluands . “Evaluand” refers to the focus of an evaluation, the thing 
evaluated. Traditional evaluands are projects and programs, which we do an 
excellent job of evaluating.
We know how to specify SMART goals (specific, measurable, achiev -
able, relevant, and time-bound) and develop performance indicators. We have 
become skilled at developing logic models and theories of change. We know 
why and how to distinguish monitoring from evaluation, the different types 
of evaluation (utilization focused, impact, theory driven, cost-benefit, empow-
erment, participatory, social justice, etc.), the diverse uses of evaluation 
(accountability, learning, decision making, enlightenment, etc.), and the impor-
tance of working with diverse stakeholders (program staff, policy makers, 
funders, participants, etc.). We have standards for what constitutes evalua-
tion quality and checklists for what should be included in an evaluation. We 
know the importance of specifying intended use by intended users. We have 
a variety of ways of reporting findings. This is by no means a comprehensive 
or exhaustive list, but, hopefully, it provides a sense that we’ve learned a lot, 
know how to do a lot, and merit the designation of being a knowledge-based 
profession.
But new evaluands beckon. The emergent challenges for evaluation, 
from my perspective, primarily have to do with new units of analysis and 
broader areas of focus for evaluation.
Evaluation, we say, “grew up in the projects.” As evidenced by what 
we do well, the profession’s origins lie in evaluating projects, and, from my
<<<PAGE=15>>>
A Reading Guide  xv
perspective, we remain in the grip of a self-limiting project mentality. Eval -
uating community impacts, regional and sectorwide initiatives, cross-sector 
initiatives, networks and collaborations, global leadership development, 
innovation, and collective impact pose new conceptual and methodological 
challenges. In addition, and along parallel tracks, evaluators are being chal -
lenged to develop new approaches to evaluating the scaling of innovations, 
assessing the effects of social media, and using “big data” to examine large 
and open systems. Ecosystem governance is a leading-edge evaluand and 
cannot be evaluated as if it is a project or program.
Evaluating principles, such as the 2005 Paris Declaration on International 
Development Aid, is also different from evaluating projects. Principles-driven 
programs are different from goals-driven programs. Principles constitute 
a different kind of evaluand. Principles take on added importance among 
the new challenges for evaluation because principles are the primary way 
of navigating complex dynamic systems and engaging in strategic initiatives. 
Principles undergird efforts at community change and collective impact. 
Understanding how to evaluate principles, and adapting evaluation concepts, 
approaches, methods, and processes through principles-focused evaluation 
will, I believe, provide valuable direction for how to evaluate other new evalu-
ands as we grapple with related emergent challenges (Patton 2018). 
So, as you read, watch for new evaluands, innovative units of analysis, 
and the limitations of forcing complex initiatives into project boxes. With this 
10th trend in my countdown list as context, I can be briefer in identifying the 
remaining things to watch for as you read.
9 . Applying complexity understandings . This trend follows from the pre-
ceding item but deserves highlighting because of its importance. Projects 
are closed systems, or at least treated as such in most evaluations, in which 
boundaries can be established and control can presumably be exercised 
within those boundaries by both program staff and evaluators. In contrast, 
complex dynamic interventions, advocacy campaigns, and strategic initiatives 
are open systems characterized by volatility, uncertainty, and unpredictabil -
ity—all of which make control problematic. Treating these complicated and 
complex evaluations like simple projects is inappropriate, ineffective, and 
insufficient. Indeed, it can do harm by misunderstanding, misconceptualizing, 
and misrepresenting the very nature of complex change and thereby gen-
erating results that are inaccurate and irrelevant. Consider these books on 
complexity as context for the contributions in this volume. Watch for how 
complexity is addressed in these pages:

8 . Globalization, global interconnectedness, and global systems 
dynamics . Evaluating global systems dynamics poses a particularly daunting 
challenge as we learn to view the Earth and the Earth’s inhabitants as a holis-
tic, interconnected, and interdependent global system.
Why so much attention to globalization? Consider this recent New 
York Times Business Day report: 
The Fed [the U.S. Federal Reserve] Acts. Workers in Mexico and Mer -
chants in Malaysia Suffer. Rising interest rates in the United States are 
driving money out of many developing countries, straining governments 
and pinching consumers around the globe. (Goodman, Bradsher, and 
Gough 2017)
The agreement on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
169 targets has been heralded as a major step forward in global governance 
toward a sustainable post-2015 development agenda. Certainly, the SDG 
framework has addressed many of the gaps identified with the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) by surfacing barriers to sustainability on a sys-
temic level including inequality, consumption patterns, and weak institutional 
capacity. Nevertheless, the framework remains more sectorally siloed than 
integrated. Implementation is focused at the nation-state level with few 
mechanisms to inspire and mobilize innovation within the private sector and 
civil society to implement alongside national governments. 
Poverty, hunger, well-being, education, and ecosystem health are inter-
related. The relationships are nonlinear, dynamic, and complex. As you read 
this book, watch for discussions about, analyses of, and approaches to eval -
uation of the SDGs that integrate indicators across SDGs and move both 
down and up scale (down to local levels and up to encompass global dynam-
ics), thereby moving beyond nation-states as the only unit of analysis. By 
making sense of the interrelationships and interdependencies among and 
across SDGs, interventions and evaluations will demonstrate sensitivity to 
and understanding of global systems dynamics.
7 . Power, politics, and the realities of evidence  . The book’s subtitle is 
“Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability.” Watch for how the 
contributors to this book acknowledge and deal with the politicization of 
evidence.
On April 22, 2017, millions marched for science in 600 cities worldwide. 
The American Evaluation Association was one of 270 partner organizations 
that supported the March for Science. The New York Times headline on the 
day of the march read: “Scientists, Feeling Under Siege, March against Trump
<<<PAGE=17>>>
A Reading Guide  xvii
Policies” (St. Fleur, 2017). USA Today led with: “Marchers for Science Protest 
‘Alarming’ Anti-Science Trends.” Anti-science is, ultimately, anti-evaluation evi-
dence. Culturally and politically, the anti-science trends include “alternative 
facts,” “fake news,” and a “post-truth” world. In November 2016, the Oxford 
Dictionaries announced “post-truth” as its Word of the Year:
post-truth adjective Relating to or denoting circumstances in which 
objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals 
to emotion and personal belief. (Oxford Dictionaries 2016)
Casper Grathwohl, president of the Oxford Dictionaries, explained: 
“Given that usage of the term hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if post-truth becomes one of the defining words of our 
time” (Oxford Dictionaries 2016). Science? Just another perspective. Evalua-
tion? Paperwork. Administrivia. Opinion. 
The current anti-science political climate calls us to unite with others 
engaged in defending and supporting science, creating a united front to the 
larger world. Science is ultimately about evidence, so how evidence is con-
ceptualized and what constitutes evidence matter a great deal for evaluation. 
Ironically, some evidence skeptics have become sophisticated at undermining 
the credibility and utility of evaluation by demanding levels of “proof” that 
are not possible in complex dynamic systems. Evaluators are having to deal 
with preponderance of evidence, triangulation, use of mixed methods, and 
rapid feedback as ways of facing the challenges of producing meaningful and 
useful results in a timely fashion.
The politics of evidence include speaking truth to power, speaking 
truth to each other, and empowering those at risk of being left behind to 
speak their truth. A “post-truth” political world undermines the value of sys-
tematic evaluation. In short, evidence is not just about data. It’s about how 
people understand what constitutes meaningful and credible evidence. So, 
watch how the contributors to this volume take on these issues. The future 
viability of evaluation as a valued evidence-based profession is at stake.
6 . Evaluative thinking embedded in evaluation processes . Methods 
alone do not ensure rigor. A research design by itself does not ensure rigor. 
High-quality analytical techniques and procedures do not ensure rigor. Rigor 
resides in, depends on, and is manifest in rigorous thinking—about every -
thing, including methods and analysis. This means valuing intellectual rigor. 
There are no simple formulas or clear -cut rules about how to do a credible, 
high-quality analysis. The task is to do one’s best to make sense of things. An 
evaluator returns to the data over and over again to see if the constructs, 
categories, interpretations, and explanations make sense—if they sufficiently 
reflect the nature of the phenomena studied. Creativity, intellectual rigor, 
perseverance, insight—these are the intangibles that go beyond the routine 
application of scientific and research procedures. These are bedrock elements 
of rigorous evaluative thinking. Rigorous evaluative thinking combines critical 
thinking, creative thinking, inferential thinking, and practical thinking. Watch 
for how evaluative thinking is manifest in the contributions of this book.

5 . Evaluation as intervention (process use) . The mantra of performance 
management is that what gets measured gets done. Process use concerns 
how the conduct of an evaluation affects what is done quite apart from the 
findings of the evaluation. Evaluation is no longer simply about producing an 
end-of-project report. How evaluation is framed, the questions asked, the data 
collection priorities established, and the processes for engaging major stake-
holders constitute interventions in the development process. As you read, 
watch for how the presence of evaluation affects development interventions.
4 . Evaluation understandings shaping intervention designs . One way 
evaluation becomes an intervention is by helping conceptualize an interven-
tion’s theory of change or strategic approach. Evaluation is no longer simply 
a back-end activity assessing whether goals are attained. Evaluators are now 
involved in determining how an intervention is conceptualized—for example, 
how much attention is given to interactions across and among different SDGs. 
That’s an intervention design issue as much as it is an evaluation issue. Watch 
for how the examples in this book include evaluators playing a significant role 
in framing development interventions. A good example is chapter 11 on good 
governance.
3 . Failure as learning . A major source of resistance to evaluation is fear of 
failure. The preceding items in this list all point toward the increased impor -
tance of learning from evaluation findings, and a particularly potent form 
of learning follows from acknowledging and understanding failures. Engi-
neers without Borders has established a stellar approach to learning from 
failure by issuing an annual failure report. The politics of development make 
acknowledging failure, and learning from it, particularly challenging, but also 
essential. Watch for how the authors in this book identify and address failure, 
and support learning and adaptation.
2 . Transformation . Evaluation has traditionally focused on outcomes and 
impacts. That is no longer sufficient. Climate change changes everything. The 
urgency of dealing with the implications of climate change has led to a new 
focus on transformation. Transformation involves multiple and intersecting 
interventions that lead to major, deep, systemic, and resilient changes at a 
large scale, across SDGs, and with urgent timelines. Transformation means 
big changes happening quickly. Time is of the essence. Scenarios supporting 
the need for transformation include forecasts that by 2050, under current 
trends, 20 countries will be gone, 60 cities swamped and unviable, and 
1.5 billion people displaced.
Evaluating transformation is new territory for evaluators, a new and 
challenging evaluand. It cannot be reduced to targeted indicators. I would 
argue that transformation is a sensitizing concept that’s only meaningful 
when applied to a given context. Transformation has to be interpreted con-
textually and dynamically. Thus, transformation should not be subject to 
narrow measurement or narrow operationalization because it occurs in non-
linear and often unpredictable ways. The problem is not the measurement of
<<<PAGE=19>>>
A Reading Guide  xix
transformation; the problem is actually engaging with multiple perspectives, 
multiple kinds of data—qualitative and quantitative, case studies, indica-
tors—and global to local scales in an integrated, systemic way to understand 
what the global patterns of transformation are. Watch for how the emergent 
agenda of transformation is addressed in this book. More generally, watch 
for a sense of urgency and scale that goes well beyond project thinking to 
global transformation.
1 . Focus on intended beneficiaries, especially children . I recently reviewed 
the five-year strategic plan for evaluation of a major international agency. The 
plan went into great detail about how evaluations would be conducted, crite-
ria of quality, the nature of reports, the timing of findings, and a commitment 
to meaningful accountability. Intended beneficiaries of development efforts 
were essentially invisible. The evaluation appeared people-less and heart-less.
A 2015 UNICEF report entitled Unless We Act Now makes the case 
that children will bear the brunt of climate change. The report documents 
that over half a billion children live in extremely high flood-occurrence zones; 
nearly 160 million live in high or extremely high drought-severity zones 
(UNICEF 2015). Since there is a clear scientific consensus that climate change 
will increase the frequency of droughts, floods, and severe weather events, 
children are especially in jeopardy globally. Climate change will not affect all 
equally. Because of the potentially devastating risks in flood and drought 
zones, and high poverty and low access to essential services such as water 
and sanitation in those zones, children and families who are already disad -
vantaged by poverty are likely to experience the greatest effects of climate 
change.
Part of the responsibility of evaluation should be to highlight and 
deepen global understanding of effects on real people. If no one is to be left 
behind, how evaluations are conducted affects that vision. Watch for how this 
book illuminates the effects of development efforts on intended beneficiaries 
in ways that make those people and their lives real to readers.
LOOKING FORWARD
I approached reading this book through the lens of how it manifests major 
changes in the world and corresponding changes in evaluation practice and 
theory. I’ve shared the 10 major developments in the evaluation profession 
that I think will determine the future relevance and utility of our profession. 
As I noted earlier, your list of what to watch for will not be the same as mine. 
So, what will you look for? The diverse authors of this volume offer their own 
priorities and perspectives. In so doing, they challenge all of us to think about 
how we understand and will engage with Evaluation for Agenda 2030.

ustainable development is back center stage on the international agenda. 
After the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, sustainable 
development seemed in vogue for a while but lost ground to a more 
pragmatic perspective in the Millennium Development Goals in 2000, which 
embodied practical goals and targets that could be met in 15 years’ time 
by the international community and by countries. However, the increasing 
urgency of climate change and related environmental crises such as biodi-
versity loss and the growth of chemical and other waste throughout the 
world caused a recalibration of development processes. This led to the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), incorporated into Agenda 2030, 
which were accepted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 
2015. In October 2015, two evaluation conferences took place in parallel in 
Bangkok, Thailand: one organized by the Independent Evaluation Office of 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the other by the 
International Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS). These two confer-
ences focused on sustainable development: the UNDP conference on what 
the newly adopted SDGs meant in terms of development of national capaci-
ties, mainly for governments, whether they had the capacity to contribute to 
understanding progress toward the SDGs, and whether the policies were in 
place to enable evaluation to play its proper role. The IDEAS conference, on 
the other hand, focused on the concept of sustainable development and how 
it could be evaluated, and aimed at bringing best practices and innovation 
from all over the world to be discussed in Bangkok.
The UNDP conference—the Fourth International Conference on 
National Evaluation Capacities (NEC)—led to the publication of its proceed -
ings in June 2016. IDEAS does not publish proceedings, but has, since its 
Global Assembly in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2009, presented the most 
challenging and promising perspectives emerging from its conferences in a 
book. The three books that followed were edited by Ray C. Rist, Marie-Helene 
Boily, and Frederic Martin. After Ray Rist retired as president of IDEAS, he 
presented the continuation of the series as a challenge for the new president:

Rob D. van den Berg. A new editorial committee was established by Rob, with 
Indran Naidoo, former board member of IDEAS and currently director of the 
Independent Evaluation Office of the UNDP, and Susan D. Tamondong, vice 
president of IDEAS. The aim was to publish a follow-up book of the Bangkok 
conference, focusing on some of the themes and on new and promising 
developments in the field of evaluation of sustainable development.
The present volume thus should be placed in the tradition of the three 
IDEAS’s books on the Global Assemblies in Johannesburg (2009), Amman 
(2011), and Barbados (2013). It diverges from that tradition, as the book 
includes many perspectives that were explored with the NEC conference in 
joint sessions, including perspectives of governments, nongovernmental orga-
nizations, the private sector, and academia. Issues discussed included policies 
and capacities, as well as evaluation methodology and the difficulties for the 
evaluation profession to find its place between academia and (international) 
bureaucracies.
Part I of the book comprises further developments of the keynote 
addresses at the two Bangkok conferences. Vinod Thomas (chapter 1) 
provides an overview of the main challenges with which evaluators are con-
fronted when evaluating sustainable development. His chapter discusses the 
various evaluation methods for assessing sustainability: cost-benefit analysis, 
impact evaluation, green accounting methods, social impact analysis, and safe-
guard compliance mechanisms. The chapter argues for rigorous frameworks 
for evaluation, but at the same time underscores the need for innovation 
and further development of methods. Vinod urges capacity development 
in countries that need to apply these methods in their evaluations of coun-
try-led initiatives.
In chapter 2, Marco Segone and Florencia Tateossian have developed 
Marco’s keynote address from a United Nations’ perspective, advocating 
for equity-focused and gender-responsive evaluations at the national level, 
enabled by sufficient national evaluation capacity and a monitoring and eval-
uation (M&E) system that includes all national and international partners. 
Mallika Samaranayake and Asela Kalugampitiya further develop the former’s 
Bangkok keynote address on the importance of participatory evaluation in 
chapter 3. In a world where equity concerns are widespread and increasingly 
seen as behind the rise of populist movements, participatory evaluation can 
provide evidence to policy makers on what could be done to ensure that “no 
one (is) left behind,” to quote one of the overarching themes of the SDGs. 
Part II focuses on capacities and capabilities. Indran Naidoo and Ana 
Rosa Soares discuss UNDP efforts to support countries in their development 
of evaluation capacity and national systems for evaluation (chapter 4). They 
also incorporate lessons from implementation of the Millennium Develop-
ment Goals to inform how the SDGs should be evaluated, as well as the 
capacity that countries need to develop and enable their M&E systems. In 
chapter 5, Linda Morra Imas focuses on the professionalization efforts that 
were discussed at the Bangkok conference and what has happened since. 
While much has been accomplished, Linda calls for new efforts to ensure 
core competencies reflect the SDGs and inform the development of national 
capacities.

Introduction  3
The paradigm shift from capacity building to capacity development 
is discussed by Michele Tarsilla in chapter 6. After a discussion of contex -
tual and process-related factors that need to inform capacity development, 
Michele highlights the contribution of IDEAS to the ongoing discourse on 
evaluation capacity. Lastly, in chapter 7, a group of authors around Awuor 
Ponge discuss their experiences as “young and emerging evaluators” and the 
specific barriers and obstacles they face to find their place in the global and 
national evaluation communities. To tackle these barriers, Ponge, Adesobo 
Taiwo Peter, Ahmed Tamman, and Tara Devi Gurung advocate for mentoring 
programs that support young and emerging evaluators.
Regional perspectives are brought to the reader in Part III. Juha I. Uitto, 
Jeremy Kohlitz, and David Todd highlight the challenges that the small island 
developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean and Pacific face to develop national 
capacities for evaluation of sustainable development (chapter 8). These range 
from limited human and institutional capacities to low priorities for evaluation 
in government policies. They argue that these challenges are best addressed 
by crafting M&E systems that are appropriate for a variety of SIDS contexts, 
that are country led, and that are supported by external agencies in a coher-
ent manner. In chapter 9, Ana Luisa Guzmán and Warren Crowther tackle the 
recent development of evaluation standards in Latin America, as proposed by 
the regional network Latin American and Caribbean Network of Monitoring, 
Evaluation and Systematization (ReLAC) on the basis of a series of innova-
tive evaluations undertaken in Costa Rica. Their focus is on applying ethics in 
evaluation and on basic principles such as relevance, viability and trade-offs 
between evaluation and decision making. 
Sonia Ben Jafaar and Awny Amer in chapter 10 discuss regional devel-
opments in the Middle East from the perspective of the call for greater 
accountability of governments to their peoples. The Arab Uprising, also known 
as the Arab Spring, has initiated a new paradigm on the role of evaluation that 
promotes national capacities and national M&E systems in which local profes-
sionals are valued and supported and contribute through evaluations to the 
development of their countries and the region. Chapter 11 provides a similar 
perspective on three South Asian countries: the call for evaluation to contrib-
ute to good governance. Rashmi Agrawal, Asela Kalugampitiya, Jigmi Rinzin, 
and Kabir Hashim reflect on recent initiatives and efforts in Bhutan, India, and 
Sri Lanka. In India and Sri Lanka, these efforts focus on tackling corruption in 
public service delivery; in Bhutan, the role of evaluation in promoting good 
governance and increasing Gross National Happiness is discussed. 
Chapter 12 is devoted to feminist approaches and evaluation in India, 
written by Rituu B. Nanda and Rajib Nandi. Based on a program implemented 
by the Institute of Social Studies Trust in India, the chapter aims to contrib-
ute to a better understanding of how evaluations can support changes in 
gender-based inequalities and power dynamics. The last chapter of this part, 
chapter 13, deals with evaluation cooperation in West Africa. Abdoulaye 
Gounou discusses the capacity and impact evaluation program in West Africa 
as supported by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), focus-
ing on the countries of the West African Economic Monetary Union. Of great 
interest is Abdoulaye’s discussion of the new program Twende Mbele, which

partners Benin, South Africa, and Uganda in developing appropriate M&E and 
exchange of experiences. 
Part IV aims to discuss the role of evaluation in preventing negative 
impacts. It starts with a historical overview of environmental and social 
safeguards in India by Shekhar Singh and highlights that recent political 
developments have led to reduced priority for these safeguards (chapter 14). 
Evaluations were essential to bring attention to the detrimental effects of 
ignoring these safeguards, and Shekhar’s chapter develops proposals on how 
evaluation can continue to play this role in the future. For the next chapters 
in this part, we turn to resettlement issues—often accompanied by negative 
impacts of development displacement, which have led to the adoption of 
social safeguards on resettlement. In chapter 15, Inga-Lill Aronsson provides 
an anthropological and historical perspective on resettlement, and indicates 
that heritage and memories tend to be neglected in projects, to the detriment 
of outcomes. Given this lack of a historical perspective, current resettlement 
models are insufficient to grasp the longitudinal consequences of resettle-
ment. A consideration of heritage and memory could lead to improvements. 
Marife Ballesteros, in chapter 16, focuses on the assessment of ben-
efits and costs of resettlement projects implemented by the Philippine 
government using a quantitative methodology. The study compares reset -
tlement modes, in-city and off-city, and determines which mode provides 
greater efficiency and best socioeconomic outcomes. The author discusses 
areas for improvement that the government can undertake, bearing in mind 
trade-offs and recommendations for a more efficient resettlement resulting 
in improved welfare. The last chapter in this part, chapter 17 by Susanna 
Price, compares international policy perspectives and evaluation outcomes 
in Asian countries to see how livelihoods are affected, addressed, and eval -
uated. She argues that livelihood issues are often neglected in laws and 
regulations concerning resettlement. Furthermore, livelihood risks, livelihood 
support, and livelihood outcomes in evaluations are rarely seen. The author 
presents some approaches that may provide a way forward in building the 
knowledge base on livelihood success and sustainability through evaluation 
at the country level.
Part V concerns evaluation of impact in its broadest sense and focuses 
on sustainable development issues. In chapter 18, Chris Barnett and Rachel 
Eager further develop a contribution of Chris’s to the Bangkok conferences 
in a special session on the new frontiers for evaluation. While new initia-
tives take shape to achieve sustainable development—and especially new 
partners from the private sector engage in forms of “impact investing” and 
social corporate responsibility—the challenge is how evaluation can provide 
evaluative evidence within these often complex, interconnected, and rapidly 
changing contexts. They argue for a bolder evaluation agenda, in which eval-
uators recognize their potential role in contributing to change: to act not just 
as providers of evidence for others to use, but to proactively engage in an 
ethical obligation to society, and to stimulate deliberation and re-examination 
of evidence by a broader range of citizens—citizens who can be emboldened 
to use such evidence to improve their situations, as well as to call others to 
account.

Introduction  5
In chapter 19, Adinda van Hemelrijck reflects on the Participatory 
Impact Assessment and Learning Approach (PIALA), a systemic theory-based 
and participatory mixed method for addressing the challenges of impact 
evaluation in complex development contexts. On the basis of fieldwork 
in Vietnam and Ghana, Adinda concludes that inclusiveness and rigor can 
reinforce each other, even more so at scale, with sufficient capacity. Method-
ological complementarity and consistency, extensive and robust triangulation, 
and cross-validation are important attributes. Investing in research capacity 
may help reduce costs over time, while enhancing the value of impact evalu-
ation and the uptake of its findings.
Takaaki Miyaguchi in chapter 20 synthesizes findings from eight dif -
ferent climate change mitigation projects in five different Southeast Asian 
countries, using the Theory of No Change approach developed by Christine 
Wörlen. Almost all the projects studied addressed barriers of ignorance and 
lack of expertise for all agent groups (consumers, supply chain, policy makers, 
and financiers); none of the projects has specifically addressed the barrier of 
cost effectiveness, and only a few projects specifically focus on harnessing 
the interest and/or motivation of relevant agent groups. Emmanuel Jimenez 
and Jo Puri also synthesize findings from various sources to identify gaps 
in evidence on education and climate change/environment interventions 
(chapter 21). They discuss the “wicked problems” that evaluators encounter 
when aiming to bridge the gaps; their analysis points out why the gaps persist 
and how future evaluations might address them. 
Lastly, Gwendolyn Wellman’s chapter reports on impact evaluations 
of the development efforts of a mining company in Ghana (chapter 22). 
While the company was not primarily interested in measuring the impact 
of its community/societal development program, the government of Ghana 
required it to evaluate what it had done. Gwendolyn reports on the process 
that evolved, and discusses to what extent the evaluation commissioned was 
able to come up with findings. The chapter concludes with an exploration of 
“the way forward” for impact evaluations of the development activities of big 
corporations.

Given the variety and depth of topics in this book, we hope that it provides an 
overview of some of the important issues in the global evaluation community: 
 n how to take sustainability into account; 
 n how to leave “no one behind” when evaluating sustainability; 
 n what capacities and capabilities are needed to undertake these 
evaluations; 
 n how this is taking shape in regions and countries and incorporated 
into country-led evaluation systems; 
 n whether the negative consequences and impacts of interventions 
are sufficiently taken into account and what the role of evaluation 
can be in highlighting these issues; and

 n whether evaluation of impact is sufficiently developed to tackle 
the growing demand for evidence, including new initiatives and the 
increasing involvement of the private sector and civil society as part-
ners in development. 
Increasingly, evaluation is becoming a truly global issue and concern. 
While in the past most of the chapters in a book like this would have been 
written by gray-haired old men from the developed world, this book contains 
the work of 38 authors, 26 of whom are from the Global South! 
Reading this book will certainly lead us to acknowledge that much 
still needs to be done. But it is better to stand at the beginning of a new 
road, knowing that this is where we—as an evaluation community—need 
to go, than to sit down in recognition of where we have failed so far. If one 
thing may be concluded from this book, it is that the evaluation community 
is intellectually alive and kicking and aiming to improve further in the coming 
decades.

Evaluating Sustainable 
Development
Vinod Thomas
Abstract . The United Nations’ new Sustainable Development Goals provide the inter -
national mandate and opportunity for countries to focus on socially equitable and 
environmentally sustainable growth. There is a growing recognition in countries that 
the quality of growth signified by inclusion and sustainability is vital for how it affects 
the well-being of people and the planet, and for continuing economic growth itself. 
But this broader recognition also raises several tough challenges. An important one 
is managing actual or perceived trade-offs that occur as countries pursue sustainable 
and inclusive development. One example is food security, for which there is the need 
to increase areas under cultivation while at the same time to ensure sustainable forest 
use and conservation. The pressure to develop fossil fuel energy to power growth is 
another case in point which conflicts with controlling pollution and minimizing damages 
to human health and climate change. The pursuit of sustainable and inclusive growth 
also presents challenges to evaluation. It would be fair to say that evaluative priorities 
and methods have not kept pace with the needs of assessing outcomes in sustainabil -
ity. Stepped-up evaluative efforts are necessary at several levels, ranging from sound 
frameworks and methods of analysis to relevant and practical applications, conclusions, 
and recommendations.

FRAMEWORK OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Three dimensions of sustainable development are economic growth, social 
inclusion, and environmental sustainability, 1 which align with an ecosystems 
services approach ensuring that environmental services such as clean air and 
water and nutritious food remain available for future generations. Past initia-
tives were largely skewed toward attaining high economic growth. Focusing 
solely on the pace of growth has contributed to increasing inequality, envi-
ronmental destruction, and climate change—repercussions that threaten 
economic growth itself. The challenge for evaluation is integrating the social 
and environmental dimensions while assessing growth.
The basic framework is one that recognizes that for economic growth 
to be sustainable, we need to value all three forms of capital—physical, 
human, and natural (Basu et al. 2017; Thomas et al. 2000). Government 
spending and private investment have long favored the first two forms of 
capital, with natural resource management getting short shrift. Yet, a coun-
try’s natural capital—its stock of natural assets—is essential for the pace and 
quality of growth. Sustainable land use and agricultural practices, and forest 
and coastal management, need far greater emphasis.
The fact is that raising economic growth remains the principal driver of 
policy. Earlier thinking was that social inclusion and environmental sustainabil-
ity are good to have, but that their pursuit presents unacceptable trade-offs 
to economic growth. Evaluation results, however, have shown that projects 
with objectives incorporating inclusive growth and the environment have per-
formed well compared to those that have stand-alone objectives (IED 2014, 
2015). These results provide support for building inclusion into the design 
and implementation of projects intended to help raise economic growth. In 
this and other instances, evaluators need to put more of such contextual 
evidence into their evaluations. 
The argument in fact goes further. In many settings, growth itself 
seems to depend on inclusion. The intuition is that when all the people are 
included in the growth process, the possibilities for growth are that much 
greater. If so, going forward, not just any growth will do; it needs to be 
growth that is more inclusive. In this case, there would be a premium on 
generating growth that disproportionately includes the lower income strata 
in the growth process. 
This line of thinking is just as powerful in the case of environmen-
tal sustainability. There is growing evidence that sustained growth will not 
be possible in the future without tackling environmental degradation and 
climate change. For example, the costs of climate-related disasters in many 
disaster-prone countries such as Bangladesh, Cuba, Haiti, the Philippines, and 
Thailand are staggering, and they weigh on economic growth. 
In principle, making growth more inclusive and sustainable is assuring 
development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their needs. Providing more and better

Chapter 1. Evaluating Sustainable Development  11
quality of growth for sustainability requires that high growth be accompanied 
by quality standards that ensure broad-based benefits through gainful and 
productive employment and access to opportunities in health, education, and 
social protection while at the same time ensuring environmental quality that 
supports future growth. 
Nevertheless, sustainable development remains a contentious, complex, 
and dynamic paradigm. There are many considerations to take into account 
among which are the many trade-offs and policy issues at stake. 
METHODS FOR ANALYSIS
On methods for assessing sustainability, there are five strands to stress. First, 
cost-benefit analysis, a long-standing economic tool of analysis, can be put 
to better and wider use to assess sustainability. In particular, the frameworks 
allow the qualification in the use of market prices to account for externalities 
such as pollution and congestion. The effect of doing so can be enormous, 
as in the carbon emissions that aggravate global warming. If, based on such 
analysis, carbon emissions were to be taxed adequately—in contrast to the 
absence of such taxes, let alone subsidies that encourage the use of polluting 
fuels such as coal—the result would change the game. 
Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis has not been used often for such 
purposes. Where it has been used, the results were compelling. For example, 
environmental impact assessment is mostly based on cost-benefit analysis. It 
has focused mostly on “do no harm” principles and has been instrumental in 
preventing investments and projects that would have led to environmental 
damage.
The use of cost-benefit analysis in some of the multilateral develop-
ment banks (MDBs) has been on the decline (IEG 2010a). Part of the reason is 
the greater difficulty in applying the technique in social sectors where lending 
has been on the rise. But that is not a good enough reason to de-emphasize 
cost-benefit analysis. The tool is potentially a highly effective means to assess 
the net gains and losses from interventions.
Second, impact evaluation can help to assess the effects of programs 
that seek to ensure greater social inclusion and environmental sustainability. 
The much-cited example is the case of social protection programs, in partic -
ular measuring the impacts of conditional cash transfer programs. There are 
also good examples of the effects of forest protection and natural resource 
management more generally. While there are many counterfactual evalua-
tions that have contributed such insights, many of the useful efforts have not 
been experimental.
We also see a strong emergence of new forms of evaluation of impact, 
such as process tracing, systems mapping, and qualitative comparative 
analysis. They use methods and tools that are rigorous, but not necessar -
ily experimental. Randomized control trials cannot tackle issues like climate 
change and sustainability over generations. 
Third, green accounting methods in principle are available for better 
valuation of natural capital (Hamilton 2014). Data are usually a constraint in 
effectively applying such valuation, but it is clear that when the destruction of
<<<PAGE=34>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
12
natural capital is not accounted for, it results in inflating long-term growth pros-
pects (Dasgupta 2009). Not accounting for the destruction of natural capital 
sends the wrong signals for pursuing gross domestic product growth at the 
expense of de-investing in natural capital, which eventually hurts the growth 
process itself. 
Fourth, social impact analysis brings in especially the harnessing power 
of participatory process in development planning and implementation and is 
especially relevant where environmental impact is also taken into account. 
Even if qualitative in many instances, this work shows a direction that should 
be encouraged, given its relevance for sustainable development. Social and 
environmental impact assessment includes the processes of analyzing, moni-
toring, and managing the intended and unintended social and environmental 
consequences, both positive and negative, of planned interventions (policies, 
programs, plans, and projects) and any social and environmental change pro-
cesses invoked by those interventions. Its primary purpose is to bring about a 
more sustainable and equitable biophysical and human environment. 
Fifth, safeguard compliance mechanisms are essential to ensure that 
development projects do not cause social and environmental harm. Especially 
where negative externalities are present, desirable regulations designed to 
avoid harm would not be followed by private or even public agents without 
environmental and social safeguards. But safeguards have not historically 
been considered as part of sustainability criteria of projects, and this must 
change. A subsequent section discusses safeguards in greater detail. 
Rather than thinking of these tools as alternatives, one can have a rig-
orous framework that mixes methods depending on the issues at hand. It is 
crucial to list the things that are really important. Incorporation of analysis of 
counterfactuals can be applied more widely than at present, not only in social 
areas but also in the agriculture, urban, and infrastructure sectors. These are 
not necessarily experimental, but can integrate with others’ regression analy-
sis, counterfactual systems analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. 
We must take cost-benefit analysis more seriously and not hide under 
the premise of unquantifiable aspects or questions about the reliability of 
economic, social, and environmental modeling, and a suspicion that some-
times there were biases in the assumptions that were incorporated in these 
models. It is important to always evaluate both benefits and costs so that the 
evaluation can objectively guide sustainable development.
Underlying evaluation of impact and cost-benefit analysis is green 
accounting, which can help enormously in the right valuation, especially of 
natural capital. Data availability and estimation methods remain a barrier, but 
they must be overcome with continued efforts and financing for such work, 
which has high payoffs. 
Some applications of these techniques have yielded good results 
(Thomas and Luo 2011). For example, there have been some striking results 
in assessing the impact of conditional cash transfer programs in the Philip-
pines. There has been a breakthrough in evaluating sustainable use of natural 
resources, as for example in Brazil’s deforestation and biodiversity loss. 
Remote sensing in monitoring and evaluation in the management of peat -
lands in Mongolia has been an interesting experience.

Chapter 1. Evaluating Sustainable Development  13
In the urban space, there have been evaluations of the value added 
when bus rapid transit incorporates a clean development mechanism such as 
clean energy, as has been done in China. Encouraging commuters to use bus 
transport in Brazil and Korea is another case in point. The full cost of subsidies 
for fossil fuels and the value of slashing them have also been assessed quite 
carefully (IMF 2015; Morgan 2007). More work needs to be done in assessing 
the full benefits of switching to renewable energy. These issues can be best 
illustrated with specific areas in mind, a few of which are taken up below.
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Environmental sustainability is heavily dependent on how natural resources 
are harnessed and utilized. There are a number of perceived and actual 
trade-offs when it comes to natural resource management, especially as they 
involve externalities and the public goods nature of some of these resources. 
In some cases there are win-win opportunities, where growth and envi-
ronmental objectives complement each other. Improving energy efficiency 
and reducing energy losses are a case in point (Petrie and Thomas 2013). 
There are other areas where costs are clearly involved, and yet there may be 
net-win opportunities as these costs are more than offset by societal and/or 
environmental gains. Switching out of subsidies for fossil fuels (where neg-
ative externalities are present) and even providing subsidies for renewables 
(where positive externalities are present) would be a case in point. 
One central issue is the question of the carbon content of economic 
growth. A byproduct of economic growth is the production of greenhouse 
gases and the resulting climate change. A general observation is that a 
1 percent increase in per capita income induces—on average and with excep-
tions—a 1 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions. But some exceptions 
offer opportunities to promote strategies that both promote growth and 
limit emissions. 
Ending encouragement to use fossil fuels is one avenue. Removing 
fossil fuel subsidies would increase economic efficiency and reduce green-
house gas emissions (van den Berg and Cando-Noordhuizen 2017). The 
largest subsidizers in absolute terms were Egypt, India, Indonesia, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and Ukraine—all with 
more than $10 billion a year in subsidies. Subsidies are 2–7.5 times larger 
than public spending on health in Bangladesh, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Morocco, 
Pakistan, the Republic of Yemen, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.
Using energy-efficient instruments can also help (IED 2014; UNDP 
2008). Compact fluorescent lamps draw only 20–30 percent as much power 
and last much longer. Substituting them for all the incandescent lamps in 
Sub-Saharan Africa would reduce peak power consumption by 15 gigawatts, 
roughly 23 percent of the installed capacity.
Together, these findings suggest that a win-win strategy could be built 
around introducing efficiencies while reducing subsidies and better targeting 
subsidies to the poor. This would simultaneously reduce the strain on gov -
ernment budgets, free resources to allow extension of energy sources to the 
poor, and promote more efficient energy use.

Another area of concern is the use of water resources (IEG 2010a; 
Thomas and Luo 2011). For almost a century, water use has been growing 
almost twice as fast as population. To meet the demand for water, numer -
ous parts of the world have exceeded sustainable limits of water withdrawal 
from rivers and groundwater aquifer. The level of water in underground aqui-
fers below Beijing, New Delhi, and many other booming cities is falling rapidly. 
Major rivers such as the Ganges, the Yangtze, the Nile, and the Jordan are 
overtaxed and regularly shrink for long periods during the year. 
Water shortages already loom in many parts of the world. One-third 
of the world population, concentrated in developing countries, lives in basins 
where the water deficit is larger than 50 percent. About 700 million people 
in 43 countries face water stress, unable to obtain the minimum need of 
1,700 cubic meters of water per person per year. And climate change aggra-
vates erratic rainfall patterns, compounding the challenges.
The global water footprint reached 9,000 billion cubic meters a year 
in 1996–2005. Irrigated agriculture accounts for more than 80 percent of 
water use in developing countries. Yet, feeding more people and coping with 
the changing dietary demands from a richer population will require more 
efficient water use. Without sufficient water, future economic progress could 
be severely constrained.
But water stress is about more than availability. Rapid economic growth 
increases not only water use but also pollution. It has changed natural water 
reservoirs—directly, by draining aquifers, and indirectly, by melting glaciers 
and the polar ice caps. And overexploitation of groundwater results in salini-
zation, while industrial and agricultural waste pollutes water sources.
The economic benefits of better managing water resources are big, as 
are the economic costs of inaction. Country examples indicate that proper 
water management could increase gross domestic product by 5–14 percent. 
In the Middle East and North Africa, where water shortages are most acute, 
the cost of environmental degradation from water pollution and excessive 
withdrawals is estimated at between 2.0 and 7.4 percent of gross domestic 
product. 
It may not be just an issue of better managing scarce resources, but one 
of changing sources to more sustainable ones. Water scarcity should lead to 
higher prices for water, which will at a certain point make whole-scale desali-
nization of seawater economical, but with a transportation problem—how 
to get this water to remote regions and landlocked countries. Innovations in 
filters and other desalinization techniques could drive the price of desaliniza-
tion down, which could bring the tipping point for the market in desalinized 
water closer.
Yet another aspect is the protection of forests (IEG 2009). An evalu-
ation using forest fires as a proxy found that, on average, protected areas 
significantly reduce tropical deforestation and associated carbon release, 
thus reducing carbon emissions while preserving biodiversity. The study 
examined whether areas subject to strict protection—with essentially no use 
allowed—fared better than those in which some activity was permitted.
The expectation was that, all things equal, strict protection would have 
the bigger impact on reducing the incidence of fires, considering differences
<<<PAGE=37>>>
Chapter 1. Evaluating Sustainable Development  15
in deforestation pressures. But the evaluation found instead that the impact 
was actually greater when the protected areas allowed sustainable use by 
local populations than when they did not. This finding is true for Africa, Asia, 
and Latin America and the Caribbean, when comparing the mean reduction in 
fire incidence from strict protected areas with that from multiuse protected 
areas. In Latin America, where indigenous areas can be identified, the impact 
on fire incidence is extremely large.
Closely related is the protection of the world’s precious biodiversity 
(GEF 2016a). Placing a value on biodiversity loss is not easy, but the high cost 
of irreversible losses cannot be underestimated. Protecting biodiversity is a 
critical element for the protection of our planet, and it has been shown to 
carry with it valuable resources and sources of livelihood, especially for the 
poor. 
NATURAL DISASTERS
Great floods in China and India, superstorms in the Philippines and in the 
United States, and summer heat waves in Australia and Japan in recent years 
are manifestations of an alarming trend in the rise of climate-related disasters. 
The 2010s may well go down as the decade when the trend line of these 
events headed aggressively upward after a noticeable rise in their intensity 
and frequency since the 1970s. 
Global warming has contributed to warming oceans, more moisture in 
the air, and higher sea levels, but scientists have been cautious about attribut-
ing a flood or storm to climate change. Even so, papers have argued that the 
intensity of the 2011 Great Flood in Thailand and of Super Typhoon Haiyan 
in the Philippines are owed in part to changing climate. More recent work 
has been even more pointed: global warming is shown to have made Japan’s 
unusually hot summer this year 1.5 to 1.7 times more likely. 
A consensus, too, is building that climate change has roots in human 
actions (IPCC 2015). We have known for a long time that weather events turn 
into disasters for human-made reasons. More people are hurt when they are 
exposed in harm’s way, and when they are vulnerable and unable to cope. 
But now we also know that the intensity and frequency of the hazards them-
selves are greater because of human-made global warming. 
This understanding profoundly affects how countries engage in disas-
ter risk reduction. Economic growth projections are contingent on addressing 
climate change. Yet few of the forecasts for global and country growth take 
into account the impacts of climate change that are already evident, or the 
massive investment and resources that will need to be mobilized for climate 
action. Such forecasting is missing from the current estimates for growth, for 
example, of around 3.0–3.5 percent in 2017 and 5.5–6.0 percent for Asia and 
the Pacific.
Countries and regions need to build contingency plans into their eco-
nomic programs. Floods and storms in recent years inflicted sizable economic 
losses in Australia, China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
After the financial crisis, governments and multilateral institutions intensi-
fied their efforts to anticipate future crises, carrying out stress tests of the

16
vulnerability and resilience of their banking systems. In the same way, we now 
need stress tests that can reveal how well countries can withstand the impact 
of rising natural disasters.
In many respects, such country actions bring both global and local ben-
efits (GEF 2016b). Reducing black carbon emissions that blight so many cities 
(like Beijing and New Delhi) is a case in point. Phasing out the use of fossil 
fuels that present the greatest danger to our environment is another. India 
and Indonesia recently slashed fossil fuel subsidies. Investments in solar pho-
tovoltaics in China and Japan and in onshore wind across Europe are pointing 
the way for increased use of renewable energy. 
The five cities most vulnerable to natural hazards are all in Asia: 
Bangkok, Dhaka, Jakarta, Manila, and Yangon. All of them are overcrowded 
and in geographically fragile settings. Asia’s growth has been characterized 
by increasing urbanization, making it imperative that climate-friendly urban 
management become a strategic thrust. And because the poor are hit harder 
by the effects of climate change than the rest of the population, building resil-
ient communities will be an essential element of poverty reduction strategies. 
Climate-related natural disasters are no longer one-off occurrences; 
rather, they are systemic events that need preventive action. Disaster risk 
reduction needs to be seen as an investment, going beyond relief and recon-
struction to a dual approach of prevention and recovery. Japan invests some 
5 percent of its national budget in disaster risk reduction, and this has been 
shown to reduce human and economic losses when disasters strike. 
The main message is that to deliver sustained growth and well-being, 
we need to value natural capital, recognize the human hand in climate change, 
and take preventive action against climate-related calamities.
THE DANGER OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change is the greatest known threat to economic growth and well-be-
ing and its impacts go far beyond natural disasters (Stern 2006; Uitto, Puri, 
and van den Berg 2017). To confront this peril, world leaders, especially of 
the large economies, must commit to much stronger cuts in carbon emis-
sions than currently envisaged at the United Nations conference in Paris. But 
the challenge is bigger. To bring about lasting change, countries will need to 
reform the way their economies generate growth.
What makes this difficult is political leaders’ differing beliefs about 
what generates growth. After all, carbon-intensive production created wealth 
in the past, so many still see a change in this recipe as inimical to expansion. 
Yet the reality is just the opposite. In the face of mounting disasters linked to 
human-made global warming, a low-carbon path is the only way to progress.
To appreciate why, note that the current growth path within a quarter 
century will push carbon concentrations in the atmosphere to the critical 
450 parts per million. Beyond this threshold, temperatures will rise above 
2 degrees from pre-industrial levels, with catastrophic impact. Just-released 
data warn that we are already halfway to that dreaded mark. 2016 has 
surpassed 2015 as the hottest on record. Asia is on the front line of cli-
mate-related disasters.
<<<PAGE=39>>>
Chapter 1. Evaluating Sustainable Development  17
To dodge this dangerous scenario, energy-related emissions alone need 
to fall by 40–70 percent below 2010 levels by 2050. With energy accounting 
for two-thirds of emissions today, the required shift from reliance on fossil 
fuels is huge. Currently, two-thirds to four-fifths of electricity relies on fossil 
fuels in China, Japan, Russia, and the United States. China and India continue 
to ramp up coal-fired power stations.
Industrial countries were far and away the main cause of past carbon 
build-up. But developing countries in Asia is now the origin of some 37 
percent of global emissions. Some countries, like Canada, generate relatively 
low total but high per capita emissions, while others, like India, generate a 
relatively high total but are low in per capita terms. Among those at the high 
end in total, Japan is moderate in per capita terms.
Regardless of the historical and current sources, what is clear is that 
business as usual will sink everyone. We need an economic transformation 
that is not only in the global interest but also in a country’s own interest. 
Evaluation must take on board this reality, and be especially cognizant of five 
trends (Office of Evaluation and Oversight 2015; Thomas 2017).
First, renewable energy sources—solar, wind, wave, tidal, geothermal, 
and biomass—need to expand vastly, supported by research and develop-
ment and exchange of knowledge. Battery storage, smart grids, and demand 
measures have to improve. Demand for renewable energy can be augmented 
by a carbon tax that reduces demand for dirty fossil fuels. Cap and trade 
schemes can also help, as China plans for 2017. There is a heightened policy 
debate in Japan about raising the ratio of electricity from renewable and 
other nonpolluting energy, including the role of nuclear plants. 
Second, countries need to move much more quickly out of using pollut-
ing fossil fuels. Fossil fuel subsidies in financial terms might amount to some 
$550 billion globally. But when their negative effects are incorporated, the 
effective subsidies are much higher (IMF 2015). These subsidies have to be 
slashed, as India and Indonesia have started to do. The Obama administration’s 
decision to reduce carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 
2005 levels by 2030 is positive, but it now needs to be maintained under the 
Trump administration. Japan is trying to encourage cleaner energy, including 
via hybrid and electric engines, and is promoting export of cleaner technology.
Third, dealing with local pollution also helps climate mitigation. Abate-
ment of air pollution is urgent in Delhi and Beijing. Some 3 million people 
die each year from outdoor air pollution. Urban congestion can be lessened 
with intelligent transport systems, as in Seoul. Corruption and greed damage 
developed countries too: Volkswagen’s cheating on automobile emissions, for 
example, is a colossal scandal. 
Fourth, to withstand destruction from global warming, we need to 
strengthen roads and embankments, build in safer areas, and invest in rain 
harvesting, drainage, and early warning, as Japan has been doing. Countries 
can tap new financing such as the Green Climate Fund, as Fiji just did. It 
received a $31 million Green Climate Fund grant for a project supported by 
the Asian Development Bank.
Fifth, we need to protect coastal zones, agricultural land, and forests. 
In Indonesia, haze from slash-and-burn agriculture to clear areas for palm oil

every year spreads through Southeast Asia, ruining people’s health, biodiver-
sity, and economic activities. These fires, on the worst days, emit more carbon 
than the U.S. economy.
Evaluators have been slow to send this message, but it is now urgent 
that the discipline come to grips with it. It is only with a swift response to 
climate change that countries can sustain economic growth and well-being. 
As a major contributor to the discussions of development effectiveness, eval-
uation should account for climate effects and provide evidence on social, 
economic, and environmental costs of delayed action. 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS
The value of having environmental and social safeguards is a major area of 
inquiry. Some studies have pinned the cost of having these safeguards as 
less than 3 percent of the administrative budgets of projects (IED 2016; IEG 
2010b), while their benefits in terms of avoided losses have been far higher. 
The demand for safeguards (to manage environmental and social 
trade-offs) emerged in the 1980s in response to a number of controversial 
projects funded by the World Bank. Two examples of these projects are the 
Polonoroeste’s BR-364 Amazon highway program in Brazil, which affected 
indigenous communities, and the Narmada Dam in India, which displaced 
90,000 people. These resulted in the crafting of environmental and social 
policies at the World Bank to ensure a “do no harm” approach in its projects. 
The regional MDBs followed with similar policies. 
MDBs’ safeguard policies aim to promote the sustainability of projects 
by protecting people and the environment from the potential adverse effects 
of development. For example, the Asian Development Bank’s safeguard policy 
lays down key requirements, including: (1) Identify and assess environmental 
or social impacts early in the project cycle; (2) develop and implement plans to 
avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for the potential adverse impacts; and 
(3) inform and consult affected people during project preparation and imple-
mentation. The crucial question for evaluation is how effective the practices are. 
The independent evaluation units of the Asian Development Bank 
and the World Bank (IED 2016; IEG 2010b) document some successes and 
important gaps. Both discuss strengths in the design of safeguards that must 
not be diluted and point out weaknesses in implementation and supervision 
of safeguards, especially for moderately risky projects. They support the 
eventual use of country systems when they are more equivalent and compa-
rable to MDB systems, signal the need for great caution in switching to them, 
and recommend continued efforts to strengthen local capacities. 
Evaluation must take on board four principles to govern the use of 
safeguards.
 n Safeguards must be legally binding, and compliance should be 
enforceable. Standards that are to be met flexibly during a project’s 
life will not suffice in ensuring protection against spillover damages. 
Sure, flexibility can speed up project approval, but for risky projects, 
the resulting damages could just delay project completions.
<<<PAGE=41>>>
Chapter 1. Evaluating Sustainable Development  19
 n International policy should govern safeguards, rather than national 
systems that by law or in practice are not yet equivalent. Recent 
years have seen several disasters under national systems; for 
example, the collapse of a garment factory near Dhaka, Bangladesh; 
a mining disaster involving a dam burst in Minas Gerais, Brazil; and 
explosions at a container storage station in Tianjin, China.
 n It is not enough to have systems in place; implementation and over-
sight need strengthening. In particular, downstream supervision 
of how safeguards are being followed on the ground needs to be 
bolstered, but without weakening upstream regulation. Monitoring 
of impacts is essential, not by the investor alone but also by an 
independent party.
 n The efficiency with which processes and procedures are followed 
can usually be improved a great deal. Greater differentiation in the 
treatment of high- and low-risk projects can help. Project process-
ing can be speeded through such efficiency improvements, and not 
through a weakening of the regulation.
Effective safeguards are needed more than ever both for the estab-
lished lenders and the newcomers. How the international banks apply these 
defenses will be an indication of their true commitment to the Sustainable 
Development Goals and the Paris climate accord.
Going forward, MDBs will have to focus more and more on the positive 
potential of their safeguard policies, i.e., move away from a “do no harm” phi-
losophy to a more proactive stance of harnessing safeguards to “do good” on 
social and environmental issues. MDBs will also have to support strengthen-
ing member countries’ capacity in implementing safeguard provisions.
The tensions raised in considering safeguards also provide one of the 
most powerful illustrations of trade-offs that evaluators must lay out—but 
which they often sidestep, at least explicitly. Those who have worked on safe-
guards over the years naturally recognize the uphill battle involved in taking 
on special interests who would rather not be burdened with adherence to 
any safeguards. The Trump administration’s public statements are a case in 
point. Proponents of safeguards also have anecdotes and stories, if not quan-
titative evidence, of how much gain to society sound safeguards bring.
But on the other side, some operational staff in organizations, and cer-
tainly special interests, use anecdotes, if not quantitative evidence, of how 
much safeguards weigh down investment operations. They often minimize 
the gains that safeguards bring as well.
Clearly there are inherent trade-offs and also different sets of interests 
driving people’s perceptions and even evidence. The role of sound evaluation 
under these circumstances cannot be overstressed. One way forward is the 
application of cost-benefit analysis that takes into account both private and 
social benefits and costs (IED 2016). Data are a constraint in applying such 
analysis, but where it has been done reasonably well, social benefits of most 
safeguards (i.e., avoided damages) far outweigh the social costs of having 
such safeguards (IEG 2010a). That does not mean costs can be reduced 
further with greater efficiency in executing safeguards. The policy implications
<<<PAGE=42>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
20
would be to adopt safeguards where net benefits are positive but to continue 
improving efficiency such that the net benefits are increased further. 
CONCLUSION
An overarching implication of all this is the need for an introspective look at 
evaluation in the context of sustainable development. To remain relevant and 
effective, evaluation must not favor a risk-averse standpoint of doing what 
is easy and conventional. Evaluation should encourage innovative thinking 
and methods that shepherd the dynamics of sustainable development. In 
addition, systematic identification, analysis, and scaling-up of successful inter-
ventions are necessary actions to move forward sustainable development 
and growth. 
Related to this, an equally important activity is developing further eval-
uation capacity at the country level, as promoted by an increasing number of 
countries. Implementation is expected to be the key test for the Sustainable 
Development Goals, and monitoring and evaluation will be an important part 
given that the development initiatives and related evaluations will be country 
led.

No One Left Behind - 
 A Focus on Gender and Social Equity 
Marco Segone and Florencia Tateossian
Abstract . This chapter presents the importance of evaluating the Sustainable Devel -
opment Goals (SDGs) with a focus on gender and social equity. It analyzes the 
transformative nature of the new 2030 Agenda, due to its focus on making sure that 
“no one is left behind.” It explains how the SDGs expand and build on the Millennium 
Development Goals, as well as how heads of states from all over the world have 
made a commitment to ensure a systematic follow-up and review of the SDGs that is 
“robust, voluntary, effective, participatory, transparent and integrated” in order to track 
progress, and argues that to ensure that no one is left behind, the follow-up and review 
should be informed by country-led evaluations that are equity focused and gender 
responsive. This should be accompanied by strengthening national evaluation capacities 
through a systemic approach that looks at the enabling environment and at both insti-
tutional and individual capacities, from the supply as well as the demand side. Finally, 
it argues that strengthening national evaluation capacities to evaluate SDGs in such a 
way as to ensure that no one is left behind is a common endeavor that requires strong 
partnerships among various actors, such as national evaluation systems, parliamentari-
ans, voluntary organizations for professional evaluation, and civil society.

A TRANSFORMATIVE AGENDA FOR “THE WORLD WE WANT”
We live in a world where a massive concentration of wealth and privilege exists 
in the hands of a few: the richest 1 percent of the population owns 40 percent 
of the world’s wealth, while the poorest 50 percent of the population owns 
only 1 percent of the world’s wealth. The three richest people in the world 
own wealth equivalent to the combined gross domestic product (GDP) of the 
world’s 49 poorest countries. It may seem that this is only related to income, 
but a similar situation exists in the statistics concerning human development 
as well. Human development indicators from 2015 show that 793 million 
people are still malnourished (FAO 2015), and that one in three women will 
be beaten, raped, abused, or mutilated in their lifetimes.
1 These are just a few 
examples of the many that illustrate the current inequity in the world.
The question is: is this the world we want? Or would we like to live in 
a world in which inequities have been banished for all humans—everywhere, 
anytime? Most would agree this is a common goal: so how do we get there?
The good news is that the countries that endorsed the 2030 Sustainable 
Development Agenda recognize the importance of long-term equitable and 
sustainable development: more and more countries are implementing social 
and public policies to try to decrease the gap between those with the most (the 
best-off) and those with the least (the worst-off) (UN 2015b). In September 
2015, leaders from around the world adopted the ambitious 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development at a historic United Nations (UN) Summit.
2 Agenda 
2030 calls for global transformation that focuses on ending poverty, protecting 
the planet, and ensuring prosperity for all. In January 2016, the 17 Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs) intended to implement this agenda came into 
force. These new goals—built on the success and the unfinished agenda of 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—call on all countries to mobilize 
efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities, and tackle climate change, 
while ensuring that “no one is left behind.”
How do the SDGs expand upon and continue the work of the MDGs? 
There are a number of key differences, both in the process through which the 
SDGs were identified, as well as the content.
First, the SDGs were identified in a broad and inclusive process . For more 
than two years, governments, civil society, the private sector, and thought 
leaders from around the world negotiated and discussed the development 
of the SDGs. For the first time, 8 million people voted on which of the SDGs 
were most important to them. This inclusive and participatory process has 
also encouraged each country to adapt the SDGs to their own national con-
texts. This will make the level of ownership of the SDGs much stronger.

agenda was held in New York, September 25–27, 2015, and convened as a high-level 
plenary meeting of the General Assembly.

Second, the SDGs are universal . Unlike the MDGs, which had a strong focus 
on the developing countries (with seven of the eight goals devoted to them), 
the SDGs are relevant to any country of the world. Rob D. van den Berg, 
president of IDEAS, has reminded us that “from the perspective of the SDGs, 
all countries are developing countries.”
3
Third, the SDGs are comprehensive and integrated . While some have 
noted concern over the large number of goals (17), this also encourages 
sweeping transformation across a broad number of areas, and encourages 
the use of partnerships to accomplish these goals. To improve communica-
tion and ensure that people understand the ultimate intent of the SDGs and 
Agenda 2030, the UN has clustered them into “five Ps”: people (human devel-
opment); prosperity (inclusive economic development); planet (environment 
and climate change); peace (a key component of all development); and part -
nership (one of the few ways to achieve such sweeping transformation). 
As shown in figure 2.1, the SDGs are interrelated and interlinked, which 
adds to their complexity, but also to their dynamic interaction.
Fourth, gender equality and reduced inequalities among and within 
countries are both stand-alone goals, and they are both mainstreamed 
to all SDGs . The principle of “no one left behind” is the key principle inform-
ing every SDG, and is mainstreamed throughout the entire structure of 
Agenda 2030.

Fifth—and very important to those in the evaluation community—
Agenda 2030 and the SDGs include a follow-up and review mechanism, 
operating at the national, regional, and global levels . The principles for 
this mechanism are voluntary and country-owned; open, inclusive, and trans-
parent; support the participation of all people and all stakeholders; are built 
on existing platforms and processes; avoid duplication; respond to national 
circumstances; and are rigorous and evidence-based, informed by data that is 
timely, reliable, and disaggregated. Most important for those in the evaluation 
community, the follow-up and review mechanism will be informed by coun-
try-led evaluations, and calls for strengthening national evaluation capacities. 
THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY AND THE GREATEST 
CHALLENGE FOR THE GLOBAL EVALUATION COMMUNITY
This is the first time in the history of international development that a 
follow-up and review mechanism to assess the implementation of a devel -
opment agenda was adopted unanimously.. This high-level and far-reaching 
commitment will enable a surge in the demand for country-led evaluation. 
Key policy makers will request their own national evaluation systems so that 
they can produce high-quality evaluations to inform the national SDG reviews 
that countries will be presenting at the UN High Level Political Forum. This is 
therefore an unprecedented opportunity for the evaluation community. 
On the other hand, evaluation of these broad-reaching goals with a 
central focus on “no one left behind” presents a number of unique challenges:
 n How do we evaluate equitable development interventions?
 n What are the best questions to use in order to assess whether 
interventions are relevant, and are having an impact in decreasing 
inequity, and in achieving results for the worst-off groups? 
 n What are the methodological, political, social, and financial impli-
cations of designing, conducting, managing, and using evaluations 
that are responsive to issues of social equity and gender equality? 
 n How can we strengthen the capacities of governments, civil society 
organizations (CSOs), and parliamentarians to evaluate the effect of 
interventions on equitable outcomes for marginalized populations? 
EVALUATING THE SDGS WITH A “NO ONE LEFT BEHIND” LENS 
THROUGH EQUITY-FOCUSED AND GENDER-RESPONSIVE 
EVALUATIONS4
The 2030 Agenda made a commitment to ensure a systematic follow-up and 
review of the SDGs that would be “robust, voluntary, effective, participatory, 
transparent and integrated,” and that would “make a vital contribution to 
implementation and will help countries to maximize and track progress in

implementing the 2030 Agenda in order to ensure that no one is left behind” 
(UN 2015b). Country-led evaluations will be a central element used to inform 
SDG reviews and, together with strong monitoring data, will help support 
national policy decision making.
Gender equality and reducing inequalities between and among coun-
tries are central to the SDG principle of leaving no one behind. This recognizes 
the need to go beyond aggregate indicators, which only estimate the propor-
tion of the population who have benefited from a particular intervention. 
There is evidence that aggregate indicators of progress can conceal the fact 
that some marginal or vulnerable groups are being left behind. In this context, 
the goal of the SDGs in reducing inequalities is to
 n Identify groups that have been left behind;
 n Understand why this has happened; and 
 n Identify strategies to promote more inclusive approaches that will 
include these groups.
While strengthening the national statistical system is of paramount 
importance in order to be able to produce disaggregated data that go beyond 
national averages, the evaluators will have to explain why certain groups have 
been left behind, and how this can be corrected. This is why equity-focused 
and gender-responsive evaluation (EFGRE) is vital. 
UN Women, the UN entity for advocating for gender equality and 
women’s empowerment, defines gender-responsive evaluation as having two 
essential elements: what the evaluation examines, and how it is undertaken. 
Gender-responsive evaluation assesses the degree to which gender and 
power relationships—including structural and other causes that give rise to 
inequalities, discrimination, and unfair power relations—change as a result 
of an intervention. This process is inclusive, participatory, and respectful of 
all stakeholders (rights holders and duty bearers). Gender-responsive evalu-
ation promotes accountability regarding the level of commitment to gender 
equality, human rights, and women’s empowerment by providing information 
on the way in which development programs are affecting women and men 
differently, and contributing to the achievement of these commitments. It is 
applicable to all types of development programming, not just gender-spe-
cific work (UN Women Independent Evaluation Office 2015). UNICEF, the 
UN agency for children, defines equity-focused evaluation as a judgment of 
the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability of policies, 
programs, and projects that are concerned with achieving equitable devel -
opment results (Bamberger and Segone 2011). This approach involves using 
rigorous, systematic, and objective processes in the design, analysis, and inter-
pretation of information in order to answer specific questions, including those 
of concern to the worst-off groups. It assesses what does work to reduce 
inequities, and what does not, and it highlights the intended and unintended 
results for the worst-off groups, as well as the gaps between the best-off, 
average, and worst-off groups. It provides strategic lessons to guide decision 
makers and to inform stakeholders (Bamberger and Segone 2011). The UN

Evaluation Group, the professional network of evaluation offices of UN agen-
cies, says in its guidance document that integrating human rights and gender 
equality in evaluations provides a valuable resource for all stages of the for -
mulation, design, implementation, dissemination, and use of the human rights 
and gender-responsive-focused evaluations (UNEG 2014). 
ROLES OF THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SDG 
FOLLOW-UP AND REVIEW MECHANISM
The key agencies responsible for the implementation of country-led evalua-
tions within each country are the national governments. Since national SDG 
reviews (see box 2.1) are voluntary, the commitment of governments is crit -
ical, particularly as they are the ones who have to decide how to prioritize 
their limited financial and technical resources among many different devel -
opment priorities—which are supported by different groups of international 
and national stakeholders. Given the broad scope of the SDGs, almost all 
government agencies will potentially be involved, and the national govern-
ment will play an important coordinating role. One of the challenges is to 
avoid the “silo mentality” that has been seen in many of the MDG monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) activities, where each sector agency works on its own 
sector-specific studies, with very little coordination between sectors.
At the national level, donor agencies, UN agencies, CSOs, advocacy 
groups, and foundations can all play important roles in determining the 
evaluation agenda. But there is always the danger that each donor agency, 
CSO, and UN agency will conduct their own studies, often with only limited 
coordination and comparability of data between entities, and with significant 
duplication. The Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs is seeking to avoid these 
issues by advocating for a global indicator framework for SDGs that would 
be agreed upon by all member states, with national and subnational indica-
tors used for more localized policy interventions at the country level.
CSOs, including voluntary organizations for professional evaluation 
(VOPEs), will play an important role in the country-led evaluations at both 
the national and local levels, and their contribution will be critical in ensuring 
a truly inclusive consultation and participatory approach. While many gov -
ernments collect data on local communities and are willing to involve these 
communities in the data collection process, government agencies are often 
less willing to involve them in the interpretation of the findings and in the dis-
cussion of the policy implications. Civil society, and particularly human rights 
and feminist groups will have an important role to play in ensuring that the 
voices of local communities and marginalized groups are heard.
STRENGTHENING NATIONAL EVALUATION CAPACITY FOR SDGS5
Using country-led evaluations to inform the SDG follow-up and review mech-
anisms goes hand in hand with strengthening national evaluation capacities.

BOX 2.1 Principles of SDG follow-up and review mechanisms
The SDG follow-up and review mechanism will:
a . Be voluntary and country led ; will take into account different national 
realities, capacities, and levels of development; and will respect policy 
space and priorities. Since national ownership is key to achieving sustain -
able development, the outcome from national-level processes will be the 
foundation for reviews at the regional and global levels, given that the 
global review will be primarily based on official national data sources. 
b . Track progress in implementing the universal goals and targets , 
including the means of implementation in all countries in a manner that 
respects their universal, integrated, and interrelated nature as well as 
the three dimensions of sustainable development. 
c . Maintain a longer-term orientation; identify achievements, chal -
lenges, gaps, and critical success factors; and support countries in 
making informed policy choices  . This will help mobilize the necessary 
means of implementation and partnerships; support the identification of 
solutions and best practices; and promote the coordination and effec -
tiveness of the international development system. 
d . Be open, inclusive, participatory, and transparent for all people ; and 
will support reporting by all relevant stakeholders. 
e . Be people centered and gender sensitive; will respect human rights; 
and will have a particular focus on the poorest, most vulnerable, and 
those furthest behind  . 
f . Will build on existing platforms and processes where these exist; 
will avoid duplication; and will respond to national circumstances, 
capacities, needs, and priorities  . These will evolve over time, taking 
into account emerging issues and the development of new methodolo -
gies, and will minimize the reporting burden on national administrations. 
g . Will be rigorous and evidence-based, and will be informed by coun -
try-led evaluations and data that are high-quality, accessible, timely, 
reliable, and disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, 
migration status, disability, and geographic location and other char -
acteristics that are relevant in national contexts  . 
h . Will require enhanced capacity-building support for developing 
countries, including the strengthening of national data systems and 
evaluation programs , particularly in African countries, least developed 
countries, small island developing states, landlocked developing coun -
tries, and middle-income countries. 
i . Will benefit from the active support of the UN system and other 
multilateral institutions  .

Country-led evaluations are essential in order to bring evidence together with 
monitoring data to inform the review of the SDGs.
The United Nations General Assembly resolution on national evalua-
tion capacity building (UN 2015a) has set the stage for an understanding of 
the importance of evaluation capacity development.
This resolution emphasizes the importance of building capacities for 
the evaluation of development activities at the country level. It calls for inter-
action and cooperation among all relevant partners, including those of the 
UN system, and both national and international stakeholders, to coordinate 
efforts to further strengthen member state capacities for evaluation. Most 
importantly, the resolution emphasizes that national ownership and national 
priorities form a strong base for building national capacities to manage and 
oversee evaluations. Through this resolution, the member states agree that 
evaluation is an important component of development processes, and recog-
nize evaluation as a country-level tool that can help strengthen and support 
development results toward the achievement of the SDGs.
National evaluation capacity development is a complex field in which 
different stakeholders have different roles to play, based on their respective 
value added. This complexity encourages the use of a systemic approach to 
national evaluation capacity development, while fully recognizing that each 
country has its own unique context and realities. This makes it necessary to 
not only look at actors at different levels and across sectors, but also, cru-
cially, at the network of relationships or connections between them in each 
country. Such a viewpoint illustrates the fact that weaknesses in capacity at 
any level, or with any key actor, will affect the capacity of the whole system 
to deal with a problem in order to achieve a goal. Therefore, a country-specific 
systemic approach to national evaluation capacity development is needed, 
particularly when addressing evaluation capacities for country-led evaluations 
of the SDGs that are equity focused and gender responsive. 
Individual and Institutional Evaluation Capacities Enabled by a 
Supportive Environment
In the past, evaluation capacity development focused on strengthening the 
capacities of the knowledge and skills of individuals. However, it is by now 
clear that capacity development should be based on a systemic approach that 
takes into account three major levels (individual, institutional, and external 
enabling environment); and two components (demand and supply
6), and that 
both should be tailored to the specific context of each country (figure 2.2).
The enabling environment for evaluation is determined by a culture of 
learning and accountability, by which we mean the degree to which information 
is sought about past performance; and the extent to which there is a drive to 
6 “Supply” refers to the capability of professional evaluators to provide sound 
and trustworthy evaluative evidence. “Demand” refers to the capability by policy 
makers and senior managers to request sound and trustworthy evaluative evidence, 
with the aim of using it in strategic decision-making processes.
<<<PAGE=53>>>
Chapter 2. No One Left Behind - A Focus on Gender and Social Equity   31
continuously improve, and to be responsible or accountable for actions taken, 
resources spent, and results achieved. Such a culture is embedded in tacit 
norms of behavior, and an understanding of what can and should—or should 
not—be done; and in many cases, by behaviors being role-modeled by leaders. 
An enabling environment is also supported or created through gov -
ernance structures that demand independent evaluation, be it through 
parliaments or governing bodies, and that is further enhanced through VOPEs 
that set standards and strive toward greater professionalism in evaluation. 
Therefore, VOPEs should be supported, so that they can foster indigenous 
demand for and supply of evaluation, including by the setting of national 
evaluation standards and norms. There are also examples of governments 
soliciting the advice and involvement of VOPEs, not only in formulating evalu-
ation policies and systems, but also in the implementation of evaluations that 
are consistent with those policies. 
The institutional framework for evaluation ensures that a system that 
can implement and safeguard the independence, credibility, and utility of 
evaluation within an organization exists. Such an institutional framework has 
the following characteristics: 
 n Includes a system of peer review, or assurance that the evaluation 
function is set up to safeguard and implement the principles of 
independence, credibility, and utility
 n Establishes safeguards to protect individual evaluators, evaluation 
managers, and the heads of evaluation functions

 n Puts in place a multidisciplinary evaluation team that can ensure 
the credibility of evaluation by understanding multiple dimen-
sions of evaluation subjects and combining the necessary technical 
competence
 n Secures the independent funding of evaluations at an adequate 
level, to ensure that the necessary evaluations are carried out, and 
that budget holders do not exercise inappropriate influence or 
control over what is evaluated and how
 n Combines measures for impartial or purposeful selection of evalua-
tion subjects to ensure impartiality on the one hand, and increased 
utility on the other, by making deliberate choices linked to deci-
sion-making processes
 n Sets out a system to plan, undertake, and report evaluation findings 
in an independent, credible, and useful way (to increase objectivity 
in the planning and conduct of evaluations, systems that increase 
the rigor, transparency, and predictability of evaluation processes 
and products are needed)
 n Institutes measures that increase the usefulness of evaluations, 
including the sharing of findings and lessons learned that can be 
applied to other subjects 
An evaluation environment is essential to support country-led evalua-
tions of the SDGs. The UN resolution on capacity building for evaluation at 
the country level, and the strong commitment of evaluation to support the 
follow-up and review of the SDGs, are key drivers to enhance evidence-based 
policy making to achieve the SDGs.
At the individual level, a capacity development strategy should 
strengthen the ability of senior management to strategically plan evalua-
tions and to identify the key evaluation questions, to manage evaluations 
for their independence and credibility, and to effectively make use of evalua-
tion results. Mackay underlines the importance of identifying and supporting 
leaders or natural champions who have the ability to influence, inspire, and 
motivate others to design and implement effective evaluation systems 
(Mackay 2007). Leadership is not necessarily synonymous with a position of 
authority; it can also be informal, and can be exercised at many levels. There-
fore, the evaluation capacity development strategy should, especially in the 
initial stages, identify and support as appropriate, national and local leaders 
in public administration and intergovernmental monitoring, as well as in eval-
uation groups and national VOPEs. It should also be linked to the national 
processes that focus on the country-level review of the SDGs. By giving 
national M&E departments or agencies responsibility for SDG follow-up and 
review, evaluation can become a key source of support for these national 
reviews. On the supply side, a capacity development strategy should enhance 
behavioral independence—independence of mind and integrity; knowledge 
of and respect for evaluation standards; and agreed-upon evaluation pro-
cesses and products—as well as professional competencies through formal 
education, specialized training, professional conferences and meetings,

on-the-job training such as joint country-led evaluations, and communities of 
practice and networking, for example VOPEs.
Fostering Demand for and Supply of Evaluation
A distinction should be made between the capacity of policy makers and advi-
sors to use evidence, and the capacity of evaluation professionals to provide 
sound evidence. While it may be unrealistic for policy makers and advisors 
to become competent experts in evaluation, it is both reasonable and neces-
sary for such professionals to be able to understand and use the evidence 
produced by evaluation systems in their policies and practices. Integrating 
evidence into practice is a central feature of policy-making processes, and in 
this case, for integrating it into the follow-up and review mechanisms of the 
SDGs. An increasingly necessary skill for professional policy makers and advi-
sors is to know about the different kinds of evidence that are available; how 
to gain access to them; and how to critically appraise evidence. Without such 
knowledge and understanding it is difficult to see how a strong demand for 
evidence can be established and, hence, how to enhance its practical applica-
tion. However, it is also important to take into consideration that the national 
SDG review process is a political process, informed by evidence. The use of 
evidence in national SDG reviews depends on the combination of the capac -
ity to provide quality and trustworthy evidence on the one hand, and the 
willingness and capacity of policy makers to use that evidence on the other. 
The extent to which evidence is used by policy makers depends, in turn, on 
the policy environment. To strengthen an enabling policy environment, policy 
makers may need to provide incentives to encourage policy makers and advi-
sors to use the available evidence. These can include mechanisms to increase 
the “pull” for evidence, for example, requiring spending bids to be supported 
by an analysis of the existing evidence base, as well as to facilitate the use of 
evidence, such as integrating analytical staff at all stages of the policy imple-
mentation. CSOs, including VOPEs, should play a major role in advocating 
for the use of evidence in policy implementation. Think tanks, with the help 
of mass media, can also make evidence available to citizens, and citizens can 
demand that policy makers make more use of it. 
CONCLUSION
The way forward is complex, but one thing is clear: there is no single ministry 
or organization that can do it alone. Evaluating the SDGs to ensure that no 
one is left behind is a common endeavor that requires strong partnerships 
among a variety of actors.
EvalPartners—a global partnership for evaluation capacity develop-
ment that brings together approximately 60 organizations, including regional 
VOPEs, UN agencies, multilateral banks, academies, CSOs, and governments 
from around the world—was launched in March 2012, with the purpose of 
strengthening evaluation capacity. In 2013, at the Third International Con-
ference on National Evaluation Capacities in Brazil, EvalPartners declared 
2015 the International Year of Evaluation (EvalYear). EvalYear was a global,

bottom-up movement acknowledged by the UN General Assembly. It advo-
cated for and promoted demand and use of evaluation in evidence-based 
policy making and positioned evaluation in the policy arena. It also kicked 
off the launch of several more initiatives, including The Global Parliamen-
tarian Forum for Evaluation, three new networks (EvalGender+, EvalYouth, 
and EvalSDGs), and the Global Evaluation Agenda 2016–2020. EvalPartners, 
together with EvalYear and the new networks, are part of an enabling envi-
ronment to enhance the use of evaluation to inform SDGs follow-up and 
review mechanisms. 
Because evaluation can be a powerful agent of change, it will be up 
to evaluators, policy makers, and leaders around the world to make Agenda 
2030 a reality. Therefore, we encourage everyone—evaluators, commission-
ers of evaluation, policy makers, and parliamentarians, among others—to 
be ambassadors of evaluation within their departments, organizations, and 
countries. This is essential in order to make the ultimate goal of evaluation a 
reality, and to help enact the change from the world we have to the world 
we want.

Evaluation for Improving

Mallika R. Samaranayake and Asela Kalugampitiya 
Abstract . This chapter focuses on the evolutionary process of the acceptance of the use 
of evidence for policy formulation and decision making. An effective evaluation system 
and enabling environment are required for achieving such objectives. The complementar-
ity between the demand for evaluation findings and the capacity to meet that demand 
is of paramount significance. A strong enabling environment for evaluation encourages 
the generation of impartial, technical, strategic, and citizen-based information to ensure 
that national planning and budgeting reflect the needs of the people. Evaluation pro-
vides a means to enhance participation of civil society groups, as well as an opportunity 
for stakeholders to interact with members of parliament and improve consultation and 
representation. The engagement of parliamentarians with evaluation is becoming increas-
ingly important in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. Parliamentarians 
are responsible for passing policies and laws, and for prioritizing and endorsing budget 
allocations, all of which requires evidence as a basis for national decision making. Parlia-
mentarians are also well positioned to question disparities in society and approve the 
resources needed to overcome them, again requiring access to sound and comprehensive 
evidence to aid decision making and better serve those who are left behind. A growing 
movement of parliamentarians involved in this process can help lead the way.

O
ver the years, development cooperation has operated on the principle of 
promoting social justice through the transfer of resources to the poor. The 
global system of social justice provides long-term consideration of how 
to do this while a country is going through a process of development, even 
if there are no expectations that this will accelerate economic development. 
National governments and donor agencies have a long way to go in develop-
ing the ability to make transparent and evidence-based policies and decisions 
so that investments become more effective. This requires greater recognition 
of the various dimensions of poverty reduction, based on evaluation findings. 
Poverty is related to other problems of underdevelopment. It has 
become a major global issue that affects more than half the world’s popula-
tion. In 2015, the World Bank revised the international poverty line: the new 
threshold is $1.90 per day. This is a very low margin: the people who live 
under this threshold are considered to live in extreme poverty. The World 
Bank’s mission is a “world free of poverty.” As such, the role of evaluation 
cannot be underestimated in understanding the causal factors of poverty and 
identifying appropriate interventions in addressing such issues. 
EvalPartners, in collaboration with other stakeholders, developed and 
launched the Global Evaluation Agenda 2016–2020, according to which 
national evaluation policies and systems play an important role at the country 
level. This agenda builds on support from the United Nations (UN) General 
Assembly Resolution GA/RES/69/237 (UN 2015a) and the more than 90 
events that were organized around the globe in celebration of EvalYear 2015.
EvalAgenda 2020 (EvalPartners 2016) highlights the importance of 
strengthening an enabling environment for evaluation by developing institu-
tional capacities, including voluntary organizations for professional evaluation 
(VOPEs); individual capacities for evaluation, focusing on evaluators, commis-
sioners, and users of evaluation; and the need for developing links among 
stakeholders. Such an approach ensures that “no one is left behind” in the 
evaluation process, and that interventions are designed for sustainable 
development.
In the above context, evaluation is not a “stand-alone.” The comple-
mentarity between the demand for evaluation findings and their use, and 
the capacity and ability to supply the respective services, is of paramount 
importance.
This chapter focuses on the historical factors and evolutionary process 
of acceptance of evaluation as a means of providing much-needed evidence 
for policy formulation and decision making. As such, utilization-focused eval -
uation, as well as equity and gender-focused evaluation, have come to be 
accepted progressively. Achievement of such objectives is envisaged through 
an effective evaluation system supported by an enabling environment, and 
institutional and individual capacity development so that in time “improving 
people’s lives” with “no one left behind” will become a reality.

dimensions—poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter, and exclu-
sion—while promoting gender equality, education, and environmental 
sustainability. They are also basic human rights—the rights of each person 
on the planet to health, education, shelter, and security.
1 In September 2000, 
the leaders of 189 countries gathered at UN headquarters and signed the 
historic Millennium Declaration, committing to achieve a set of eight measur-
able goals that ranged from the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger by 
half, to promoting gender equality and reducing child mortality by the target 
year of 2015. Despite the progress made in reducing poverty, the number 
of people living in extreme poverty globally remains unacceptably high, and 
given global growth forecasts, poverty reduction may not be fast enough to 
reach the target of ending extreme poverty by 2030. According to the World 
Bank, in 2013 10.7 percent of the world’s population lived on less than $1.90 
a day, compared to 12.4 percent in 2012, and 35 percent in 1990. This means 
that in 2013, 767 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day, compared 
to 881 million in 2012, and 1.85 billion in 1990.
2 While the trend is certainly 
positive, as the Bank notes, “The effort to end extreme poverty is far from 
over, and there are many challenges remaining.”
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
The UN Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 
June 2012 (Rio+20) stimulated a process for developing a new set of Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals were formulated in a highly 
participatory process; and they were subsequently approved by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015. This is the new global 
plan for improving people’s lives: it is comprised of 17 goals and 169 targets 
aimed at resolving major socioeconomic issues. It will cover the next 15 years. 
The SDGs have replaced the MDGs, which expired in 2015. While the MDGs 
focused primarily on poverty and health, the SDGs also cover the environ-
ment, human rights, and gender equality, among other new goals.
In this context, many organizations will integrate the SDGs into the 
development programs that will be carried out with the goal of improving 
peoples’ lives around the globe from 2016 onward. Measuring and evaluat -
ing these programs will help donors, implementing agencies, beneficiaries, 
and other stakeholders to identify trends, measure changes, and capture 
knowledge in order to improve the performance of programs and increase 
transparency. A fundamental principle underpinning this process is giving a 
voice to the people themselves. This highlights the need for participatory 
evaluation processes, methods, and tools as part of the capacity building of 
evaluators, institutions, and other stakeholders.

THE NEED FOR PARTNERSHIPS IN PROMOTING EVALUATION
The emergence of global partnerships, reflected by the Fourth International 
Conference on National Evaluation Capacities (NEC) and the International 
Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS) Global Assembly in 2015, which 
were conducted in parallel, can be considered a great achievement and a 
contributory factor in achieving the Global Evaluation Agenda. The NEC Con-
ference addressed the issue of integrating evaluation principles with human 
development practices. The IDEAS conference focused on evaluating sustain-
able development by enhancing evaluation capacities, both institutional and 
individual. These two initiatives complemented each other in reaching toward 
the final goal of improving people’s lives. 
In the context of the SDGs, it is necessary to assess how such goals 
are being realized in the developed world as well, since the SDGs are being 
adopted by all countries, both developed and developing. With this paradigm 
shift toward supporting the SDGs, it is prudent to examine how evaluation 
will be able to provide evidence of such support in achieving the SDGs.
As emphasized by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the 
follow-up declarations of Accra, Busan, and—more recently—Nairobi (in the 
Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation),
3 the need for 
international cooperation to support development in partner countries in line 
with priorities that reflect those of the people is now well established: this 
includes the role of evaluation, and is a major breakthrough. It represents 
a paradigm shift from donor-driven evaluations to country-owned joint 
evaluations.
Conceptual Framework
The current situation can be reflected upon in the context of two fundamen-
tal questions for better understanding: 
 n How can the SDGs empower evaluators to provide evidence that 
the lives of people are being improved in a more sustainable way?
 n How can the paradigm shift toward sustainability ensure that 
people can achieve a balance between their economic, social, and 
environmental needs, both for the present and for the future? 
A conceptual outlook on these two questions can be shown in 
diagrammatic form, depicting the demand and supply aspects within a utiliza-
tion-focused evaluation framework, as captured in figure 3.1.

Demand for Evidence-Based Evaluation
The demand for evaluation and the use of its findings are very much 
dependent on the perceptions and understanding of various stakeholders 
regarding the added value evaluation can bring to the policy formulation and 
decision-making processes. The commitment of policy makers to transpar -
ency and the use of evaluation findings in policy formulation is considered a 
significant factor underlying the development agenda. In this context, there is 
an increasing focus on the role of parliamentarians in these processes.
Demand for evaluation is created through an enabling environment 
comprised of policy frameworks at the national, international, global, and 
donor levels. In this context, cooperation and partnership for promoting eval-
uation of both public and private sector programs, including the commitment 
of policy makers to promote and use evaluation findings in policy formulation, 
become critical factors. Thus: 
 n Regulatory mechanisms such as results-based monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) systems need to be in place, to ensure that the 
milestones are being achieved as planned, with evidence being used 
for decision making.
 n Stakeholders’ commitment to using evaluation findings is another 
crucial factor in making evaluations matter. This involves policy 
makers, decision makers, implementers, and the overall community. 
There is an emerging trend of civil society organizations moving

from service delivery to advocacy, in order to secure more sus-
tainable, widespread change. More important in the context of the 
SDGs is the involvement of the people themselves, since the final 
goal is improvement of their lives. A crucial element to be consid -
ered is the willingness and commitment of the commissioners of 
evaluations (i.e., government and donor agencies) for independent 
evaluation findings, both positive and negative. 
 n Community participation in the evaluation process becomes an 
important underpinning factor, allowing the voices of the people 
to be heard.
 n Political will for the use of evaluation findings and for providing 
space for the involvement of the people should prevail. The involve-
ment of parliamentarians as policy makers is crucially significant in 
order for political will to use evaluation findings and influence policy. 
A PARLIAMENTARIAN MOVEMENT FOR EVALUATION
Developing and strengthening evaluation policies in countries is important 
for good governance and effective development. Moreover, it is implicit in UN 
General Assembly Resolution GA/RES/69/237 (UN 2015a) and the SDGs 
and their guiding framework, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
(UN 2015b). The SDGs focus on country-led evaluation in line with identified 
priorities for the SDG targets that are most relevant to national and local 
contexts. This has emphasized the need for countries to strengthen their data 
collection, analysis, and review processes. The importance of evaluation is 
highlighted in the 2030 Agenda, which states that review of the SDGs will 
be “rigorous and based on evidence, informed by country-led evaluations,” 
and calls for “strengthening of national data systems and evaluation pro-
grams.” One of the key principles of the SDGs, “no one left behind,” points 
to the importance of achieving equity-focused sustainable development. In 
many countries, one of the challenges is that disadvantaged communities 
sometimes do not receive the benefits of development. This is why equitable 
development needs to be emphasized through equity-focused and gender-re-
sponsive evaluation. 
According to the Parliamentarians’ Forum for Development Evaluation 
mapping study, as of 2015, only 20 countries had established national eval -
uation policies (PFDE 2015). This shows how far there is to go. The Global 
Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation (GPFE) plans to advance this import -
ant work on national evaluation policies and systems (box 3.1). 
Among Asian countries, only two, the Philippines and Malaysia, have 
endorsed national evaluation policies. In addition, Malaysia has a strong inte-
grated results-based management system that is used in all governmental 
ministries. Although the Philippines has endorsed a national evaluation policy 
(NEDA and DBM 2015), it is yet to be operationalized. Afghanistan, Bhutan, 
Nepal, and Sri Lanka have draft policies that were developed through stake-
holder consultations and have been submitted to their governments for 
endorsement. Out of these four draft policies, the Afghanistan policy includes 
a section on equity and gender (section 3.3). In Nepal and Sri Lanka, the draft

BOX 3.1 Key facts on the Global Parliamentarian Forum for 
Evaluation
A movement by parliamentarians toward the use of evaluation has grown 
rapidly in the past few years. Particularly during 2014–15, regional parlia -
mentarian forums were created in the Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and 
Middle East and North Africa regions. The first-ever parliamentarians’ panel 
on evaluation was held at the Community of Evaluators of South Asia’s 
Evaluation Conclave 2013 in Nepal. This was a historic milestone, as it was 
the first time parliamentarians raised their voices to advocate for national 
evaluation policies and to commit to put evaluation at the core of the coun -
try-level agenda. The Parliamentarians Forum for Development Evaluation 
(PFDE) was established in South Asia in early 2013. Thereafter, parliamen -
tarians were featured in many international evaluation events promoting 
national evaluation capacities. One of the key milestones in this regard is 
a study mapping the status of national evaluation policies, which was con -
ducted by PFDE with support from EvalPartners, the global movement to 
strengthen national evaluation capacities (PFDE 2015). This helped promote 
national evaluation policies, including through regional consultations.
The African Parliamentarians Network on Development Evaluation 
(APNODE) was initiated at the African Evaluation Association conference 
held in Yaoundé, Cameroon, in March 2014, a year after the initiation of 
PFDE. APNODE is hosted and supported by the African Development Bank, 
and is the most formal group among all the parliamentarian forums cur -
rently active. In 2015, regional parliamentarians’ forums were initiated in 
other regions.
More importantly, the first-ever national parliamentarians’ forum for evalu -
ation was initiated in Nepal by a group of parliamentarians representing all 
political parties. In Kenya, a caucus for evaluation was initiated to advocate 
for evaluation in the Kenyan Parliament. In this context, the Global Parlia -
mentarians Forum for Evaluation (GPFE) was launched on November 25, 
2015, at the Parliament of Nepal, on the occasion of celebrating the Interna -
tional Year of Evaluation (EvalYear).

policies are being reviewed by stakeholders for inclusion of equity-focused 
and gender-responsive evaluation. Nepal is the only country in the region that 
has evaluation included in its Constitution, and in which the national evalu-
ation policy will be formalized through an act of Parliament. The Evaluation 
Community of India has formed a task force to work on its national evaluation 
policy. Bangladesh and Pakistan are planning to work on their national evalu-
ation policies as well.
<<<PAGE=64>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
42
In Nepal, all stakeholders, including parliamentarians, the government 
(through the National Planning Commission), VOPEs, development partners, 
academia, and the media are supporting the national evaluation policy and 
its formulation process. Nepal was the first country to initiate a National 
Parliamentarians Forum for Development Evaluation. In this forum, most 
Nepalese political parties are represented, and it actively supports the case 
for evaluation in the country. Another example of working with stakeholders 
is in Sri Lanka, where the National Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation, 
the government, VOPE, and development partners all work together in 
stakeholder consultation meetings. Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, 
Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam have established in-country VOPEs. In Cam-
bodia, the VOPE, the government (through the Ministry of Planning), and 
parliamentarians are working together. Pol Ham, who is a member of the 
National Assembly and of the Steering Committee of the GPFE, is also the 
chair of the Parliament’s standing committee on planning. He therefore will 
be able to officially support evaluation activities through the parliamentary 
system.
The VOPE in Mongolia is very new, and VOPEs in Laos, Myanmar, 
and Vietnam are also in their emerging stages. None of these countries 
have national evaluation policies and systems in place, nor have they even 
begun the process. Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam have 
been part of EvalPartners’ Peer-to-Peer projects; and Laos, Mongolia, 
Myanmar, and Vietnam are part of one project in the fourth round of 
the Peer-to-Peer program. This participation will give these countries a 
chance to further advance evaluation culture within their countries and to 
strengthen VOPEs. 
Cambodia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are the three countries in the region 
that are involved in the EvalGender+ network-supported projects on eval -
uating SDGs through an equity and gender lens. Cambodia has developed 
guidelines on equity-focused and gender-responsive evaluation, and the final 
draft of these is available. In Nepal, under this project, a workshop was con-
ducted on “Evaluating SDGs in Equity and Gender Lens” for all stakeholders; 
the country has also developed a national evaluation agenda and conducted 
various other activities, including development of an online repository that 
documents tools and methods, national networking meetings, etc. The Sri 
Lankan project has conducted a national stakeholder consultation to develop 
a national evaluation plan, held two meetings for parliamentarians, initiated 
the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum, and conducted a training of trainers 
program for potential evaluators from the public sector. Interestingly, a young 
parliamentarian from Sri Lanka has submitted two motions, one on national 
evaluation policy, and one on the allocation of resources for evaluation from 
the national budget, to the Parliament.
SUPPLY FOR EVIDENCE-BASED EVALUATION
In order to meet the demand for evidence-based evaluation, there is a dire 
need for evaluation capacities to be developed and made available. Method-
ologies that ensure the active involvement of the people require an approach
<<<PAGE=65>>>
Chapter 3. Evaluation for Improving People's Lives  43
that allows space for them to voice their views. Evaluators need to integrate 
participatory evaluation methods with systems analysis. Economic, social, and 
environmental sustainability requires that these systems interact with each 
other. To manage such integration, evaluators need to provide evidence of 
what people need, together with evidence of how far a particular solution 
would work both for the present and the future. The methodology should be 
comprehensive enough to allow for free expression of views by all stakehold-
ers concerned: this is the challenge for evaluators. 
Evaluation field building refers to the process of improving an orga-
nization’s ability to use evaluation to learn from its work and improve results. 
Organizational evaluation approaches and practices need to be strengthened 
and the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of individual evaluators improved. The 
competencies of evaluators include coaching and training on the principles 
and techniques of evaluation, experience in conducting evaluations, on-the-
job training, the appropriate use of tools and techniques, and the exchange 
of experiences among peers in different projects and different countries for 
the purpose of learning from each other. In this context, Fred Carden, Evalu-
ation Director of the International Development Research Centre in Canada, 
emphasizes building evaluation capacity, as well as the need for improving the 
evaluation quality (Carden 2010). Concerns about evaluation capacity in inter-
national development are raised at many different levels: the small number 
of trained evaluators in many developing countries; the nature and location 
of training; the cultural, linguistic, and political differences that have to be 
considered in the evaluation process; and the capacity of evaluators to meet 
the needs of both donors and the specific countries. 
Institutional capacity building to accept change also requires atten-
tion. Change that strengthens the organization’s standing, influence, formal 
presence, or ability to achieve its goals, and the ability to address the 
demands from the state, civil society, the private sector, and the community 
when necessary are essential capacities to be developed in order to meet the 
demand for evidence-based evaluations. There is a demand for more training: 
funds are being established by some donors to support evaluation capacity 
building, and more organizations are trying to understand how they can play 
a useful role in addressing these gaps.
Evaluators can reflect on the principles, and suggest strategies to 
ensure integration with the human development practices that are included 
in the Global Evaluation Agenda 2016–2020, and that contribute to devel -
oping national capacities to evaluate sustainable development. It is pertinent 
to consider how inclusion of the excluded, gender equity, and human rights 
could be included in the evaluation process. Evaluator integrity and ethics 
are important aspects of moral character and involve a commitment to intel-
lectual honesty and personal responsibility. Evaluation for accountability and 
governance are significant aspects on which the capacity building of evalua-
tors needs to be focused. 
These are some of the key challenges that evaluators will face:
 n How policy change can be addressed to prevail positively for evi-
dence-based decision making
<<<PAGE=66>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
44
 n Bridging the gaps between the commissioners, practitioners, and 
users of evaluation 
 n How evaluators can provide evidence that improves the lives of 
people in a more sustainable way
 n How the shift toward sustainability can ensure that civil society and 
people can achieve a balance between their economic, social, and 
environmental needs for both the present and the future, and can 
use data to hold the state accountable
 n How to engage with people concerning their future needs, and how 
they see a sustainable balance emerging from their economic, social, 
and environmental needs
 n How to bring the time dimension into their evaluations in blending 
evaluation principles and practices to support the SDGs 
 n How to provide evidence for the continuity of changes that need 
to be taken into account in improving people’s lives, as required by 
the SDGs. 
THE GLOBAL EVALUATION AGENDA 2016–2020
The Global Evaluation Agenda 2016–2020, also called EvalAgenda 2020, 
was formally launched at the Parliament of Nepal on November 25, 2015 
(EvalPartners 2016). This agenda explains the demand as well as the supply 
implications for evidence-based evaluation. It is clear that evaluation as a tool 
for effective governance is becoming increasingly respected and implemented: 
evaluation has become so embedded in the vision of good governance that 
no policy maker or manager will imagine excluding it from the decision-making 
toolbox, dare to hold an important meeting, or reach an important decision 
without having first reviewed relevant evaluation information. It is also increas-
ingly true that evaluators, whether internal or external, will use whatever 
methods and approaches are most appropriate to the situation to generate 
high-quality, ethical information that is pertinent to the issues at hand. 
At the same time, it is envisaged that evaluation will help to amplify 
the voice of all stakeholders, particularly the marginalized and disadvan-
taged. Experience shows the difference evaluation can make in illuminating 
the realities of specific contexts by unpacking the complexity that people, 
organizations, and communities face as they struggle to address a variety of 
economic, social, and environmental issues. Experience shows the beneficial 
impact that principled evaluation can have in democratic settings when eval -
uators work in a neutral way, with all stakeholders contributing data, analysis, 
and insights in order to assess results, identify innovations, and synthesize 
learning toward improved outcomes. 
Four essential dimensions of the evaluation system make up the core 
of EvalAgenda 2020: the enabling environment for evaluation; institutional 
capacities; individual capacities for evaluation; and links among these first 
three dimensions. 
A strong enabling environment reflects the demand for evi-
dence-based evaluations:
<<<PAGE=67>>>
Chapter 3. Evaluation for Improving People's Lives  45
 n All sectors of society understand and appreciate the value of 
evaluation
 n Evaluation is explicitly required or encouraged in national evalua-
tion policies and other governance and regulatory instruments
 n Sufficient resources are allocated for evaluation, at all levels
 n Credible, accessible data systems and repositories for evaluation 
findings are readily available
 n Stakeholders are eager to receive and use evaluation information
 n Evaluation receives due recognition as a profession and 
 n The ownership of public sector evaluations rests with national gov-
ernments based on their distinctive needs and priorities, and with 
full participation of civil society and the private sector
Strong institutional capacities include the following:
 n A sufficient number of relevant institutions, including but not 
limited to VOPEs, government agencies, civil society organizations 
(CSOs), academia, and institutions generate and share relevant data 
to develop and support evaluators and evaluation
 n These institutions are capable of appreciating and facilitating quality 
evaluations
 n They are skilled at collaborating with other relevant and involved 
institutions
 n They are able to resource quality data generation and evaluations 
as required, make information readily accessible, and are ready to 
follow up on evaluation findings and recommendations
 n They are able to continually evolve and develop as the evaluation 
field advances and
 n Academic institutions have the capacity to carry out evaluation 
research and run professional courses in evaluation
Strong individual capacities for evaluation include the following:
 n Developing individual capacities for evaluation will be relevant not 
only to evaluators, but also to the commissioners and users of 
evaluation
 n Commissioners and users of evaluation have a sound understanding 
of the value of evaluation the processes for conducting high-qual -
ity, impartial evaluations and more commitment to using evaluation 
findings and recommendations
 n Sufficient numbers of qualified evaluators, drawn from a diversity 
of relevant disciplines, are available to conduct high-quality evalua-
tions in all countries and all subject areas
 n These evaluators have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to 
make appropriate use of generally accepted evaluation principles, 
theories, methods, and approaches
<<<PAGE=68>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
46
 n Evaluators have integrated the values discussed above, and are cul-
turally sensitive and
 n Evaluators continually learn, and improve their capabilities
Strong links among these first three dimensions include the following:
 n Governments, parliamentarians, VOPEs, the United Nations, founda-
tions, civil society, the private sector, and other interested groups 
dedicate resources to joint ventures for the conducting of evalua-
tions, innovation in the field of evaluation, and evaluation capacity 
building
 n A common set of terms exists in all languages to disseminate and 
share evaluation knowledge 
 n Multiple partners in evaluation regularly attend national and inter -
national learning opportunities
 n The “no one left behind” principle stated in the SDGs is embed -
ded as a key value that goes across the three fundamental building 
blocks of an evaluation system: an enabling environment institu-
tional capacities and individual capacities for evaluation
These four dimensions do not operate in isolation, but are connected in 
diverse ways in different countries, sectors, and situations. The relationships 
are dynamic, with overlapping influences, partners, and drivers; yet at the same 
time, all dimensions are working like a vortex, pulling the various dimensions 
ever closer to better outcomes. Each of the partners (institutions, individuals, 
and evaluation users) contribute a distinct part to the whole through the 
mutually supportive and interconnected dimensions of the agenda.
It is a collective hope and intention that by advocating for the many 
initiatives and activities outlined in the Global Evaluation Agenda, the global 
evaluation community will be able to make significant contributions to attain-
ing EvalAgenda 2020, and all the SDGs, for the benefit of humankind. Each 
partner in the global community, including but not limited to parliamentari-
ans, donors, governments, VOPEs, CSOs, the media, and the private sector, 
will have their role to play, and all of the stakeholders will be willing to work 
with parliamentarians to promote evaluation. 
Parliamentarians can play a significant role in this process by demand -
ing high-quality evaluations to ensure accountability. Parliamentarians can 
take the lead in promoting national evaluation policies and systems, and all 
parliamentarians and parliaments are expected to join hands with the evalu-
ation community in this effort. Together, parliamentarians and evaluators can 
proceed toward achieving EvalAgenda 2020.

Incorporating the Sustainable 
Development Goals in National 
Evaluation Capacity Development
Indran Naidoo and Ana Rosa Soares
Abstract . This chapter discusses the efforts of the United Nations Development Pro-
gramme to develop national evaluation capacities through the biannual conferences 
and actions promoted by its Independent Evaluation Office. The paper also looks into 
lessons learned from implementing the Millennium Development Goals that could be 
useful in evaluating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It further outlines 
directions and priorities for incorporating the SDGs in national evaluation capacity 
development efforts, building on what emerged from the consultations that took 
place during the Fourth International Conference on National Evaluation Capacities in 
Bangkok, which was jointly organized with the 2015 Global Assembly of the Interna-
tional Development Evaluation Association.
A
t a United Nations (UN) summit in September 2015, member states 
adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, “a plan of action

peace in larger freedom” (UN 2015c). The 2030 Agenda commits all coun-
tries and various stakeholders to work together to “free the human race 
from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet,” 
to address inequality and injustice, and to ensure “that no one will be left 
behind.” The 2030 Agenda presents an integrated plan of action with a 
vision and principles for transforming our world as set out in the results 
framework of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets, 
with quantitative and qualitative objectives for the next 15 years; a means of 
implementation and global partnership; and a follow-up and review process. 
The follow-up and review framework calls for accountability to the people, 
national ownership, and country-led evaluative processes. Evaluation prac -
tice will provide an important means for raising the voice of stakeholders in 
this process to inform, support, measure, and assess whether development 
progress around the SDGs is relevant, sustainable, and equitable. Developing 
national evaluation capacities will be necessary in order to ensure that the 
follow-up and review process adds value to the implementation of the SDGs.
UNDP DEVELOPING NATIONAL EVALUATION CAPACITIES TO 
EVALUATE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
In 2015, the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the Royal Thai Government cohosted 
the Fourth International Conference on National Evaluation Capacities (NEC) 
in Bangkok, in collaboration with the UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the 
Pacific. The conference was organized jointly with the 2015 Global Assembly 
of the International Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS). 
This conference was the fourth in a series of NEC conferences that have 
recognized UNDP for its distinct focus on supporting the governments with 
which UNDP works across the globe, as part of an IEO strategy to support 
the development of national evaluation capacities. The NEC conferences are 
held by UNDP every two years, each time in a different region, in partnership 
with a host government.
The model of the NEC conference has evolved over the years, drawing 
on lessons learned and emerging demands: but of essence is the focus on 
supporting governments to build their accountability capacities, of which eval-
uation is a key part. Over the last 10 years, the event has involved different 
partners, each of which has provided a particular emphasis and served to 
enrich the discussions, making it a key global evaluation event. 
Each time around, support is focused on a specific region and uses 
different formats of exchange to promote commitment, cooperation, and 
action between and beyond senior government officials and to encourage the 
sharing of responsibility with other key players in the evaluation community. 
Much effort has also been invested in promoting continued engagement with 
past participants and institutions to deepen dialogues and foster continuity, 
partnership, and learning.
The NEC conferences are part of a broader architecture, in which the 
United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) plays a role by bringing together 
UN agencies and development partners to collaborate with each other. These
<<<PAGE=75>>>

occasions serve to enhance the understanding and appreciation of evalua-
tion as a powerful tool of public accountability and learning. They also help 
to advance the evaluation discourse globally and to align it with a strong 
call for cooperation in “building capacity for the evaluation of development 
activities at the country level” highlighted in the UN General Assembly Res-
olution 69/237 (UN 2015a). This resolution invites the entities of the UN 
development system, with the collaboration of national and international 
stakeholders, to support, upon request, efforts to further strengthen the 
capacity of member states for evaluation, in accordance with their national 
policies and priorities. Through UNEG, the UN promotes professional norms 
and standards for evaluation. In addition, UN entities and partners use evalua-
tion to support accountability and program learning; to inform UN systemwide 
initiatives and emerging demands; and to benefit from and contribute to an 
enhanced global evaluation profession. The UN plays a particularly import -
ant role in enhancing national capacities to monitor and evaluate progress 
in poverty eradication and other internationally agreed-upon development 
goals, and therefore its key responsibility in supporting the SDGs.
UNDP’s value added in evaluation has been its contribution as the sec-
retariat and cochair of UNEG, but above all the strong independent mandate 
of its IEO to evaluate its contributions to development. IEO works with UNDP 
country offices and bureaus for national evaluation capacity development 
with a clear division of roles and responsibilities. IEO is responsible for devel-
oping guides and standards, and for promoting national evaluation capacity 
development through discussion forums such as the NEC conferences and 
associate initiatives of knowledge exchange. UNDP program units are further 
responsible for following up on the outcomes and partnerships of the con-
ferences, and for supporting more specific programs and partnerships to 
develop national evaluation capacities in the medium to long term. This divi-
sion of roles and responsibilities ensures IEO’s independence and ability to 
credibly evaluate the results of UNDP’s contributions. 
UNDP believes that when appropriately tailored to national circum-
stances and priorities, the evaluation function can be an effective country-led 
vehicle for greater citizen accountability that can accelerate progress toward 
national SDG priorities, drawing on contributions from indigenous peoples, 
civil society, the private sector, and other stakeholders, including national 
parliamentarians (UNDP 2016a). Governments are engaged by UNDP to iden-
tify national evaluation partners, especially during the NEC conferences, but 
also as partners in certain evaluations. In these processes they develop their 
national evaluation capacities to promote greater accountability, learning, and 
development effectiveness in their countries. 
UNDP has been supporting a range of activities to promote national 
evaluation capacity development, based on the UNDP definition of capacity 
development as an endogenous process through which individuals, organi-
zations, and societies obtain, strengthen, and maintain the capabilities to set 
and achieve their own development objectives over time. Such a process can 
be described as country-owned if it is operated in a dynamic change process 
with reflection and learning, and if it is gradual, opportunistic, and adaptive 
to varying circumstances.
<<<PAGE=76>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
54
Using this frame of reference, the IEO NEC strategy approaches evalu-
ation capacity development and the purpose and meaning of evaluation from 
a country, as opposed to a donor, perspective. In this regard, the purpose of 
evaluation goes beyond accountability to donors, to encompass public sector 
efficiency and accountability to the citizens of the country. The purpose of 
evaluation embraces other significant institutional and national goals for 
learning, and the development of innovation and social capital, knowledge 
assets, and the intellectual capital needed for growth, development, and con-
tribution to global advancement.
UNDP has been successful in linking theory with practice, vision and 
ideals with realities, and in the methods we have sought to do the bridging. 
The Fourth NEC Conference provides a clear example of this approach with 
the theme “Blending Evaluation Principles with Development Practices to 
Change People’s Lives.” Together with IDEAS, this conference was an import-
ant opportunity to engage decision makers, academics, practitioners, and 
the UN community in global dialogue and advocacy around evaluation and 
the SDGs. More than 450 participants from 100 countries and from three 
key evaluation networks—UNEG, the Evaluation Cooperation Group of the 
Multilateral Development Banks, and the Evaluation Network of the Develop-
ment Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD DAC)—participated in the conference, indicating 
the important role evaluation should play in shaping and contributing to the 
SDGs during the upcoming 15 years. The conferences are also an important 
opportunity for countries interested in South-South and South-North coop-
eration to find solutions together for challenges that have no ready-made 
answers. All can learn from previous experiences, such as what was advanced 
during the decade of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), that can 
be useful for the SDGs. 
In Brazil in 2013, in a previous iteration of the conference, participants 
discussed solutions to challenges related to the independence, credibility, 
and use of evaluations. The conference produced 18 NEC commitments 
to further enhance national evaluation capacities, and encouraged creating 
greater accountability by setting goals for each country’s NEC journey.
1 The 
18 NEC commitments centered around four main strategies to build national 
evaluation capacities: 
 n Promote evaluation use through in-country and global advocacy
 n Define and strengthen evaluation processes and methods 
 n Engage existing and new stakeholders in exchange and collaboration
 n Explore options for different institutional structures for managing 
evaluations
In 2015, IEO published a baseline assessment of the countries that have 
participated in the NEC conferences series in order to document where each

country stood, and in what direction they were moving regarding national 
evaluation capacities (IEO UNDP 2015c). This assessment found a variety of 
institutional settings and legal frameworks among the countries, reflecting 
a variety of government interests, political contexts, and national develop-
mental stages. These granular aspects of national evaluation capacities are 
complex, and intrinsically linked to each country’s development agenda: 
therefore they need to be taken into consideration and incorporated into the 
development of future evaluation agendas. 
Over the years, one key lesson was learned through the NEC confer -
ences and the process of promoting and implementing NEC commitments: 
without clear goals and the appropriate follow-up, governments and part -
ners have a hard time focusing their attention on, and committing to the 
changes and long-term investments needed in order to build national evalu-
ation capacities. The 18 NEC commitments served as a conversation starter 
for NEC participants to go back to their countries and reconsider their key 
national evaluation capacities and needs. These commitments were not nec -
essarily the 18 initial commitments of the 2013 NEC conference, but included 
specific commitments that the countries agreed made more sense for their 
unique national contexts, and were therefore equally important.
Expanding on the 18 NEC commitments, in a global partnership effort 
for 2015, the International Year of Evaluation (EvalYear), the NEC 2015 con-
ference focused on gathering information and commitments from participants 
to develop a new set of NEC commitments. The outcome was the Bangkok 
Declaration, a much expanded format that went beyond NEC and incorporated 
elements that also focused on the evaluation profession and global issues.
2 The 
declaration later contributed to another relevant document, the Global Evalu-
ation Agenda, which was the first ever long-term global vision for evaluation.
3
The Bangkok Declaration was a collective statement of all participants 
of the joint 2015 NEC conference and IDEAS Global Assembly: it is an expres-
sion of aspirations grounded in the community of practice of professional 
development evaluation. It is not legally binding on individuals or govern-
ments, but it seeks to capture key principles, give a sense of common purpose 
and understanding, and frame a vision of joint action in future support of 
individual, professional, and national evaluation capacity as countries shape 
their responses to the 2030 Agenda.
CONVERGENCE OF THE MDGS AND THE SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT TRACKS FOR THE SDGS

able development, during the General Assembly Special Event in September 
2013, UN member states requested that the Open Working Group and the

Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing produce inputs 
for the post-2015 negotiations of the SDGs.
In August 2014, the Open Working Group submitted its proposal for 
a set of 17 SDGs, along with 169 associated targets. At the same time, the 
Committee of Financing Experts produced a set of recommendations on sus-
tainable development financing. In December 2014, the Secretary-General 
submitted to UN member states his synthesis report, combining the intergov-
ernmental proposals and the full range of inputs from both tracks. 
UN member states agreed that the proposed SDGs would form the 
basis for intergovernmental negotiations of the post-2015 agenda with a text 
of the new agenda entitled “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development,” for adoption by the Post-2015 Summit held in 
New York September 25–27, 2015. The text included a declaration, 17 SDGs 
and 169 targets, and components on the means of implementation, the 
global partnership, and a follow-up and review process. The 2030 Agenda 
was structured around five “Ps”—people, planet, prosperity, peace, and 
partnership—and its set of 17 SDGs were officially adopted by the summit 
on September 25. The comprehensive nature of this new agenda has effec -
tively reaffirmed this convergence, aligning the processes and the scope, and 
leading to a holistic approach to development.
Three other complementary processes ran alongside the Post-2015 
process: one with a focus on disaster risk reduction, another on financing 
for development, and a third focused on climate change. The 2030 Agenda 
became an umbrella agreement for these other three agreements as well. 
In March 2015, UN member states adopted the Sendai Framework for 
Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030) during the Third World Conference 
on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Japan. This framework, which is the result 
of several years of consultations and several months of intergovernmental 
negotiations, contains seven targets and four priorities for action to reduce 
negative impact, build resilience, and strengthen related international cooper-
ation. The 2030 Agenda explicitly recognizes the importance of disaster risk 
reduction, and makes reference to the Sendai Framework and the need for 
development of holistic disaster risk management at all levels in its Goal 11. 
In July 2015 in Addis Ababa, UN member states held the Third Inter -
national Conference on Financing for Development, organized as a follow-up 
to the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration. This conference led to 
an agreement entitled “Addis Ababa Action Agenda,” which identifies the key 
action areas needed in order to provide the means and create an enabling envi-
ronment for implementing the SDGs. The text of the adopted 2030 Agenda 
recognizes the concrete policies and actions agreed to in Addis Ababa as sup-
porting, complementing, and contextualizing the means of implementation 
targets of the SDGs, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda itself as an integral 
part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
The third complementary process is the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC). The 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) that 
was held in Paris in late 2015 featured negotiations toward the first universal, 
legally binding global agreement on climate change, now known as the Paris 
Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which is due to enter into force in 2020,
<<<PAGE=79>>>
Chapter 4. Incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals in National Evaluation Capacity Development  57
contains an action plan that could allow UN member states to limit global 
warming to well below 2°C, and aims to limit it to 1.5°C. In addition to actions 
aimed at the reduction of emissions, it also covers issues related to adapta-
tion, support, loss and damage, and transparency and stocktaking. Such an 
agreement is explicitly mentioned in the proposed SDGs, and the UNFCCC is 
acknowledged as the primary forum for these negotiations.
APPLYING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE MDGS TO THE SDGS
The post-2015 negotiations, and the work to design the SDGs, were led by 
member states from the outset. The outcome is the result of a consistent 
global participatory process in which representatives from countries, aca-
demia, civil society, and the private sector together formulated the SDGs. The 
SDGs contain much that critics said was missing in the MDGs.
One thing that was learned from the experience of the MDGs was the 
importance of reporting and monitoring. However, the 2030 SDG Agenda 
has a much wider scope than the largely social goals of the MDGs, and takes 
into greater consideration the need for economic, social, and environmental 
sustainability. It also recognizes the importance of peaceful societies. With 
the MDGs, the question was: What are the goals that are lagging the most, 
where are the gaps, and how can we fill them? With the SDGs, given the fact 
that the breadth of the 2030 Agenda implies a need to break down silos and 
adopt an integrated approach to development interventions, the question 
has become more evaluative. Reporting and monitoring are insufficient; coun-
tries need evaluations in order to answer this question: What are the actions 
required to accelerate progress across a broader range of interlinked goals? 
Addressing this question requires thinking through the connections and syn-
ergies across the goals, and pointing out how actions in one area affect other 
areas. Evaluative tools are also required to assess and manage trade-offs, and 
in this context “evaluation methods will need to determine whether the right 
choices were made to achieve possibly conflicting desirable outcomes, and 
how the different outcomes should be valued” (Heider 2015).
While much has been achieved during the MDG implementation period, 
a key criticism of the MDGs was that there was insufficient attention paid to 
generating evidence on achievements and particularly learning from challeng-
es.
4 Much greater focus has been on monitoring and reporting, with many 
countries publishing national and also subnational MDG progress reports, while 
evaluation of which policies and interventions have worked and which have 
not were often only conducted at a later stage, and as part of designing MDG 
acceleration frameworks. MDG progress was largely tracked at the aggregate 
level, masking disparities in performance and disguising rising inequalities. In 
order to move forward in such a way as to ensure that no one is left behind, a 
better understanding of why and how certain policy choices and interventions 
affect different segments of society will be imperative. Recognizing that “only

by counting the uncounted can we reach the unreached” (UN 2015b), SDG 
targets should be met for all nations, peoples, and segments of society, and 
should “reach the furthest behind first,” but only by evaluating trends, and 
contributing and hindering factors, can we assess whether progress has been 
or can be made relevant, sustainable, and equitable. 
The 2030 Agenda is also a much more ambitious agenda than the 
MDGs, aspiring toward the goals of the elimination of poverty and univer -
sal access to benefits: this requires addressing the root causes of exclusion 
and deprivation, which are often deeply embedded in economic, social, and 
political marginalization. Another key lesson of the MDG implementation was 
that early strategic planning is important in laying the groundwork for long-
term progress, because putting into place priority actions at an early stage 
can have multiplier effects on development outcomes (IEO UNDP 2015b). 
Targets associated with the MDGs were only shaped over time, while financ-
ing the MDGs was discussed in Monterrey two years after the Millennium 
Declaration. In contrast, the inclusion from the outset of a detailed results 
framework in the 2030 Agenda presents an opportunity for early action to 
link results and resources for results-based management.
From the beginning, the follow-up and review mechanism of the SDGs 
will also allow for early adjustments, course corrections, and enhanced results. 
In addition, the “MDG monitoring experience has clearly demonstrated that 
effective use of data can help galvanize development efforts, implement suc-
cessful targeted interventions, track performance and improve accountability” 
(UN 2015b, 10). The MDG framework also strengthened the use of robust 
and reliable data for evidence-based decision making, with many countries 
integrating the MDGs into their national priorities and development strategies. 
Country ownership, leadership, and the participation of a wide range of stake-
holders have been vital to ensure MDG progress and accountability.
PRIORITIES FOR NATIONAL EVALUATION CAPACITY 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE POST-2015 SDG DEVELOPMENT 
AGENDA
The 2030 Agenda states that “Governments have the primary responsibility 
for review, at the national, regional and global levels, in relation to prog-
ress made in meeting the goals and targets over the next fifteen years” (UN 
2015c). With the explicit follow-up and review mechanism of the SDGs, coun-
tries will need to go beyond the usual monitoring and tracking of the MDGs, 
and tackle evaluations.
5 
Given the complexity of the SDGs—17 goals, 169 targets, and 230 
indicators—the evaluation community has to be prepared to support an SDG 
platform for measurement, and for improving national evaluation capacities to 
contribute to accountability and learning. In addition, investment in qualitative 
5 The universal nature of the 2030 Agenda and the changing dynamics of devel-
opment finance and development cooperation also present an opportunity to move 
from donor-driven to country-led evaluation.
<<<PAGE=81>>>
Chapter 4. Incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals in National Evaluation Capacity Development  59
assessment and careful design of national and international platforms and 
networks for dialogue, information sharing, and debate, with particular atten-
tion given to evidence provided by diverse domestic actors, may become 
central to achieving the SDGs.
The challenge of implementation points to the need for learning what 
works and what does not; which factors influence and hamper success; which 
aspects can risk sustainability, under which contexts; and how to break down 
silos and promote an integrated approach in order to achieve the most 
effective and efficient results. With that in mind, four overarching priorities 
emerged from the consultations that took place during the last NEC confer-
ence in Bangkok, building on the discussions from previous NEC conferences 
about independence, credibility, and the use of evaluations.
Promoting country-owned, country-led evaluations, with an emphasis 
on their use in influencing policies . One important priority is to respond 
to national circumstances, to support existing national systems and to avoid 
duplication of efforts and the famous “reinventing the wheel.” Doing this 
entails a shift from donor-driven evaluations to country-owned evaluations 
and developing national evaluation capacities. This process should not be 
donor-driven but rather localized, contextualized, and culturally sensitized.
Critical for national ownership of evaluations is the need to raise the 
demand for evaluations, and not just focus on supply. A successful use of 
evaluations to inform policy, and to promote a change in mindsets within 
organizations and governments, can be used to advocate for a prominent role 
for evaluation in the implementation of the SDGs, for learning, and ultimately, 
to bring about improvement in people’s lives.
Developing and strengthening evaluation process and methods . A 
second priority identified at the conference is developing new methods for 
evaluating progress toward, and the impact of, the SDGs. The 2030 Agenda 
is committed to developing broader measures of progress to complement 
gross domestic product. But how do we measure sustainability with the 
SDGs in mind? Environmental protection is only one of the means to achieve 
continued ecosystem services to mankind of clean air, water, healthy food, 
and freedom from disease. Sustainability requires an adaptive dynamic 
balance between the social, economic, and environmental domains. The 
SDGs require seeing economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental 
protection as mutually reinforcing. Whether our measurement and evaluation 
tools are sufficiently sophisticated to provide evidence on whether such a 
dynamic balance has been reached, or is within reach, and whether it is adap-
tive enough to change when necessary are great challenges. Methods that 
capture social inclusion and environmental protection need to be found in 
order to assess and evaluate sustainability.
6
6 There has been increasing interest from governments around the world in 
using innovative techniques to get better feedback from citizens on the effectiveness 
of their policies and programs, and to improve equity, sustainability, and accountability.
<<<PAGE=82>>>

60
Engaging existing and new stakeholders in exchange and collaboration . 
A third priority identified was the importance of promoting more diverse 
partnerships and greater cooperation between governments, civil society, par-
liaments, and the private sector, in order to increase the awareness and use 
of evaluations. Traditional North-South aid models are playing a increasingly 
small role as private sector and national government resource flows increase, 
and the evaluation community advocates for more country-driven evaluations. 
There is a need for more dialogue in order to improve cooperation between 
the public and private sectors, to create networks and platforms for infor -
mation and knowledge sharing, and to involve representatives of the private 
sector, parliamentarians, policymakers, legislators, and individual citizens.
The conference also stressed the importance of citizens as stakehold -
ers, and the importance of raising awareness among citizens of the SDGs 
and the role of evaluation. There is growing awareness of the importance 
of people’s engagement in monitoring and evaluation, and in accountability 
mechanisms.
Institutional structures for the evaluation of the SDGs . The NEC Confer -
ence revealed that we still have a long way to go in understanding how 
we integrate the evaluation of the SDGs into institutional structures. Almost 
every SDG is covered by national policy, so the question governments now 
face is how to monitor and evaluate all these policies and SDGs without 
duplicating and wasting resources. The holistic and integrative nature of the 
SDGs is not reflected in its structure and division into 17 goals. Governments 
may be tempted to divide out responsibility for the SDGs to respective line 
ministries, and the integrative perspective may be lost as a result. We need 
to sustain the discourse on the need to work on all SDGs also in evaluation. 
In an environment where the resources needed to deliver on the SDGs are 
scarce, evaluation will continue to gain prominence as a means of ensuring 
accountability for the use of those resources, and can help nations learn what 
works best under which contexts, in order to ensure effectiveness. The right 
institutional structures and national evaluation capacities will be key to the 
success of these processes. 
CONCLUSION
The 2030 Agenda spells out the ideals and goals that will require evaluators 
and the development community to engage with in addressing a variety of 
interrelated, complex, and challenging issues, and to be competent at mul -
tiple levels in order to make significant contributions. If evaluators are to 
help give voice to people and countries in a global context where inequality 
persists at multiple levels, there is a need to start thinking about evaluation 
of the SDGs now, rather than as an afterthought. The SDGs contain a vision 
that combines a human capability approach to development with modern 
UNDP, through its Innovation Fund, has implemented a number of prototypes with 
partners that harness technology to improve sustainability and accountability.

reconstructions of traditional economic models of growth. In responding to 
the SDGs focus on inequity, and in service to the principle of “no one left 
behind,” the evaluation function can bring methodological validity as well 
as the legitimacy to empower people as effective evaluation processes help 
promote social action for development. 
Achieving the SDGs depends on country-led evaluations that will 
produce evidence of whether the outcomes and impacts of policies, pro-
grams, and projects are equitable, relevant, and sustainable. Such evidence 
is useful not only in demonstrating public sector accountability, but also in 
focusing the attention of civil society and governments on enhancing learn-
ing, adaptive management, and innovation. Evaluation does not only identify 
“what works and what doesn’t,” or simply answer the question of whether 
we did or did we not achieve our objectives. Its real value is that it can be 
coupled to learning. For that, the learning and knowledge highlighted in eval-
uations needs to be used beyond simple accountability for strategic planning 
and adaptive management. Evaluation is a dynamic and ongoing process that 
continues to evolve, and is vital to support improving efforts, results, and 
development.
Therefore, supporting national evaluation capacity development is key 
to enabling mutual accountability among countries, and promoting learning 
to further the effective achievement of the SDGs, while ensuring that no one 
is left behind. 
IEO is proud of the role UNDP has played in supporting development, 
and stands ready to work with partners to advance in supporting the devel -
opment of national capacities for evaluating progress toward the SDGs. 
In 2017, the Fifth International Conference on National Evaluation 
Capacities will take place. The evaluation community should be intensely 
engaged in discussing how to assess the equitability of SDG outcomes for 
marginalized populations; how to measure and evaluate new themes that 
are integral to the SDGs; and how to assess the effectiveness of integrated 
approaches, in order to understand what works best and under which con-
texts, to expedite progress toward and the achievement of the SDGs.

Chapter 5
Professionalizing Evaluation - 
A Golden Opportunity
Linda Morra Imas
Abstract . This chapter considers the strong mandate for evaluation provided by 
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; and there are laudable efforts to 
strengthen national evaluation capacities in line with the mandate. However, there is 
still a lack of clarity on what such capacities look like in the context of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), and what this means for evaluator competencies. Evalu-
ators can view this situation as an opportunity to move forward on establishing core 
competencies for evaluators that reflect the SDGs, as well as to develop a clearer 
vision of national capacities to evaluate them.
T
he good news is that the field of evaluation has a strong mandate, and 
is responding to it: on January 1, 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—which 
were adopted by world leaders in September 2015 at a historic UN Summit—
officially came into force (UN 2015). Over the next 15 years, these new goals, 
which universally apply to all countries, will mobilize efforts to end all forms

of poverty, fight inequalities, and tackle climate change, while ensuring that 
“no one is left behind.”
Ensuring that no one is left behind means strengthening the voices 
and power of the most marginalized members of society—the disabled, the 
young, women, the poor—and challenging some of the most vested interests, 
such as those of energy producers. These are no small tasks, and there are 
some who believe the goals will not be realized by 2030.
1 But even to know 
how we are progressing toward these goals, evaluation of poverty and ineq-
uity, both within and across countries, is clearly needed.
The SDGs also provide an international mandate for evaluation, and 
continue to propel an evaluation capacity-strengthening movement that began 
with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). From these and from other 
ongoing influences, evaluation societies, known as voluntary organizations for 
professional evaluation (VOPEs) have sprung up at all levels—national, sub-
national, regional, and international—from just 15 in 1999 to 151 verified 
VOPEs by 2016.
2 Some have developed, or are in the process of developing, 
competency systems for their memberships, and a few have moved to cre-
dentialing or qualification systems. Both are ways of attempting to increase 
the professional status of evaluation, among other things. 
But is this too little, and is it moving too slowly? The SDGs are multi-
dimensional and tend to require mixed methods and complex, system-level 
insights. Without agreement on basic core competencies for the profession, 
and by letting “a thousand flowers bloom,” are we missing a golden opportu-
nity to advance the professionalization of evaluation? This chapter explores 
these issues.
A STRONG INTERNATIONAL MANDATE FOR EVALUATION
It cannot be overemphasized that the 17 SDGs, with their 169 targets, each 
with multiple indicators, are a first step in requiring all countries—not just 
the so-called developing countries—to set their own national agendas 
and strategies in collaboration with stakeholders. In this context, all coun-
tries are “developing” countries, facing common issues. The 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development calls for follow-up and review processes that 
examine progress toward achieving the SDGs at the country, regional, and 
international levels. Follow-up and review processes are to be “rigorous and 
based on evidence, informed by country-led evaluations and data which is 
high-quality, accessible, timely, reliable and disaggregated by income, sex, 
1 See, e.g., Berliner (2015). Berliner and his team selected one key target for 
each of the 17 goals. Using projections from leading organizations, they predicted that 
not a single goal will be reached by 2030 if current trends continue.
2 The International Organization for Cooperation in Evaluation (IOCE), the 
umbrella organization for evaluation organizations, lists the number of VOPEs as 188 
in 2013 on its home page (ioce.net). Creating VOPEs may be easier than sustaining 
them. IOCE maintains an Excel database on VOPEs and, as of May 7, 2016, reports 151 
verified VOPEs. This still represents huge growth from 1999.

age, race, ethnicity, migration status, disability and geographic location and 
other characteristics relevant in national contexts” (UN 2015). As indicated 
by EvalSDGs, a network of policy makers, institutions, and practitioners who 
advocate for evaluation of the SDGs, the initial focus has been necessarily on 
how to define and measure progress using indicators. However, it is acknowl-
edged that measurement is not enough: “monitoring must be accompanied 
by evaluation that addresses the complexity of the SDGs and how they are 
achieved” (Schwandt et al. 2016). 
WHAT DOES EVALUATION OF THE SDGS ENTAIL?
How to evaluate the SDGs is not so clear when it comes to the specifics, 
and relatively few have tried to articulate a clearer vision. Taking the lead, 
the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), in part -
nership with the network EvalSDGs, has been producing a series of briefs 
on this topic. At a basic level, the April 2016 brief indicates that evaluation 
uses monitoring data, but adds that it is “primarily concerned with how well 
implementation, outputs, and development outcomes were achieved, as well 
as with determining long-term development impact.” It also says that “Evalu-
ation asks why targets were achieved or not achieved and what can be done 
to improve the likely success of future initiatives” (Schwandt et al. 2016a, 2). 
But these generic statements about evaluation are followed with an emphasis 
on the interconnectivity of the SDGs that leads to the need to think about the 
evaluation of complex systems, rather than the evaluation of a single policy, 
program, or project. 
More specifically, in terms of the SDGs, the brief notes that because 
the SDGs are interrelated in such complex ways, they present “wicked” 
problems for evaluation. For example, the aim of reducing income inequality 
(SDG 10) cannot be neatly separated from the aim of ensuring healthy lives 
and well-being (SDG 3). Initiatives to address such problems are themselves 
complex. They may involve “long causal chains with many intermediate out -
comes, or outcomes that can only be understood using a ‘causal package’ 
approach that examines contributions from multiple interventions, contexts, 
or agencies…” (Schwandt et al. 2016a, 3).
. The implication for evaluation is 
that skills in new evaluation methodologies that draw on systems thinking 
may be needed. Another brief focuses on critical thinking skills as essential 
for conducting evaluations that analyze arguments, weigh evidence, and 
assess claims (Schwandt et al. 2016b). Being able to conduct country-led 
evaluations that assess sectoral, thematic, and holistic national policies, and 
that reflect whether a problem was correctly identified, the intended effects 
achieved, and whether unintended effects—either positive or negative—
occurred is another part of the skills picture. Also, one must determine that 
outcomes and impacts are equitable, relevant, and sustainable. Because evalu-
ations are not only at the national level but country led, stress is additionally 
placed on partnerships and evaluation capacity building.
Others—for example, Patton’s “blue marble evaluation”—have put an 
emphasis on the need for evaluation from a global perspective, and the ability 
to evaluate adherence to principals such as human rights, gender equity,

68
inclusiveness, and sustainability, as well as the importance of maintaining the 
independence of evaluations (UNEG 2016c).3 Yet others focus on the evalu-
ation process itself, stressing the involvement of stakeholders, and qualities 
such as mindfulness, inclusiveness, and facilitation skills (Catsambas 2016).
Those who favor experimental and quasi-experimental approaches to 
evaluation have raised their voices to stress that information must be “evi-
dence-based” and “rigorous.” Some, such as the organization 3ie (International 
Initiative for Impact Evaluation), are promoting the use of findings from sys-
tematic reviews as a sounder base than individual studies for policies and 
programming (White 2015). This is because many lessons come from eval -
uation anecdotes, correlational data, and strong counterfactual data. These 
lessons need to be sorted out in order to use the most rigorous findings, and 
to see how the effects in one setting hold in other settings and over time.
From these writings, we could draw up an impressive and long list of 
skills that might be needed by those seeking to evaluate SDGs. But we also 
know that countries currently have not only widely different levels of evalua-
tion capacity, but also wide variability in the availability of evaluation training. 
Variability in evaluation and in the quality of evaluation likely will be the main 
stories in efforts to evaluate the SDGs today, such that it might be difficult 
to have a coherent picture beyond indicator data. The ability to look at and 
address SDG issues from a global, regional, or even subnational perspective 
is limited. Professionalization of evaluation could provide an opportunity for a 
more level playing field by identifying global core competencies, and focusing 
training on building those competencies.
THE NEED FOR NATIONAL EVALUATION CAPACITY 
STRENGTHENING 
Even at a basic level, it has been apparent for many years that many countries 
need assistance in developing their national evaluation capacities. The MDGs 
had building national evaluation capacity as an emphasis, and that emphasis 
is continued with the SDGs. For example, the World Bank, through its Inde-
pendent Evaluation Group, fostered the development and implementation of 
the long-running International Program for Development Evaluation Training 
(IPDET), and it also partners in the Regional Centers for Learning on Eval -
uation and Results (CLEAR). With the SDGs, UN organizations are making 
increased efforts to support VOPEs. To illustrate, the International Orga-
nization for Cooperation in Evaluation (IOCE) has as its mission to support 
VOPEs in contributing to good governance, effective decision making, and 
strengthening the role of civil society. Under an agreement with UNICEF, IOCE 
3 At a lunch presentation at IPDET in June 2015, Patton floated the idea of 
“blue marble evaluators.” He was received enthusiastically and based on the reaction 
developed a proposal to move forward the perspective of a complex, dynamic, and 
interconnected world system. The “blue marble” perspective means thinking globally, 
holistically, and systematically. Evaluators need special perspectives and competencies 
to engage and evaluate these global change efforts.

launched the EvalPartners Peer-to-Peer Program, which encouraged two or 
more VOPEs to form partnerships to strengthen their capacities. Thirty-two 
national and six regional VOPEs have formed 25 partnerships to design and 
implement Peer-to-Peer projects.

The largest evaluation association today is the American Evaluation 
Association (AEA), with a membership of 7,100, followed by the Canadian 
Evaluation Society (CES), with about 1,800 members; the Latin American and 
Caribbean Network of Monitoring, Evaluation and Systematization (ReLAC)
has about 1,600 members; the International Association for Development 
Evaluation (IDEAS) about 900 members; Australasia
 860 members; and 
the European Evaluation Society (EES) about 550 members. 5 But then the 
numbers drop substantially. Other national and regional associations gener -
ally struggle, with from about 150 members to just a handful (UNDP 2015). 
Thus, efforts to support VOPEs, which are often easier to create than to 
sustain, continue to be needed. 
The Global Evaluation Agenda, EvalAgenda 2020 (EvalPartners 2016), 
sets out four key areas where evaluation capacity needs to be strengthened 
if it is to fully realize its potential in supporting the new development agenda 
and beyond: an enabling environment for evaluation, institutional capacities 
for evaluation, the capabilities of individual evaluators, and the links between 
these three elements. And while all of them are important, it is the third area, 
concerning the capabilities of individual evaluators, that relates most directly 
to professionalism.
A strong enabling environment is described as one where all sectors 
of society understand and appreciate the value of evaluation; where evalua-
tion is explicitly recognized or encouraged in national evaluation policies and 
other governance and regulatory instruments; where sufficient resources are 
allocated for evaluation at all levels; where evaluation findings are used; and 
where evaluation receives due recognition as a profession.
Strong institutional capacities involve strong VOPEs, as well as gov -
ernment agencies, civil society organizations, academia, and other institutions 
that generate and share relevant data to support evaluation.
Developing individual capacities for evaluation is relevant not only to 
evaluators but to commissioners and users of evaluation as well. The latter 
need sound understanding of the value of evaluation, and commitment to 
using evaluation findings and recommendations. In terms of individual capac-
ities, the goals are to have:

 n Sufficient numbers of qualified evaluators, drawn from a diversity 
of relevant disciplines, who are available to conduct high-quality 
evaluations in all countries and all subject areas; 
 n Evaluators who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to 
make appropriate use of generally accepted evaluation principles, 
theories, methods, and approaches;
 n Evaluators who have integrated the values discussed above, and are 
culturally sensitive. 
But despite the vision presented in this agenda, a lack of clarity and 
agreement exists today on what it would look like to have national evaluation 
capacity in the context of the SDGs. UNDP, for example, has contracted for a 
study to try to further understand what this would entail, and what it would 
look like if a country had it.
6 The issues are many. For example, does national 
evaluation capacity mean having a sufficient number of qualified evaluators 
who are able to conduct high-quality evaluations in all relevant subject areas? 
Does it mean having the governmental capacity to do cross-cutting evalua-
tions (i.e., evaluations that cross different ministries, so that interrelatedness 
can be addressed)? Does it mean having government policy makers and par-
liamentarians who are not only able to use evaluative information, but also 
consistently do so? Is it about having the capacity to conduct independent 
evaluations? Inclusive evaluations? Self-evaluations? Rigorous counterfac -
tual evaluations? Complex systems evaluations? Systematic reviews? All the 
above and more?
THE CHALLENGES OF PROFESSIONALIZATION 
It is difficult to build evaluation capacity in a profession that remains fractured, 
and lacking in agreement on how to define competencies for evaluators. 
Much has been written about evaluators and development evaluators still 
lacking professional status and visibility; evaluators not feeling recognized 
as professionals; and the belief that the lack of control over access to the 
ranks of evaluators resulting from lack of professional standards (and lack 
of enforcement of those standards) too often yields poor quality evaluation 
work.

Is the Problem That Evaluation Is a Young Profession?
Evaluation is often referred to a young discipline. For example, Robert Pic -
ciotto, one of the gurus of development evaluation, calls it a “fledgling 
profession” (Picciotto 2015). Others have called it the “new kid on the block” 
among the social sciences. Its “youth” is often given as the reason for its strug-
gles with professionalizing, and its general lack of agreement on evaluator

competencies. But it is interesting to compare two young professions in the 
United States—school psychologists and evaluators—both of which have 
developed over similar time frames.
Rossi, Freeman, and Lipsey have credited the boom in evaluation to 
the demand for knowledge of results that accompanied large public expen-
ditures for major programs in urban development and housing, education, 
occupational training, and preventive health services following World War II 
(Rossi, Freeman, and Lipsey 1999). They indicate that major commitments 
were also made during this time to international programs for family plan-
ning, health, and nutrition, and rural development. They conclude that by the 
end of the 1950s, evaluation research was commonplace. 
According to Hogan, we can thank Russia’s launch of Sputnik in 1957 
and the ensuing space race for the discipline of evaluation (Hogan 2007). The 
National Defense Education Act poured money into new education projects 
and programs in math and science, and evaluations were funded to measure 
the success of the new curricula. The passage of the Elementary and Sec -
ondary Education Act of 1965 is commonly considered the birth of modern 
program evaluation in the United States, because it required evaluation, and 
thus helped evaluation to emerge as a profession. Once federal monies began 
to flow, universities began to offer courses in evaluation methods.
8 The Evalu-
ation Research Society emerged in 1976, and so did evaluation journals such 
as Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, New Directions for Program 
Evaluation, and Evaluation News. By this time, evaluation clearly had emerged 
as a distinct specialty field within social science. In 1986, the Evaluation 
Research Society and the Evaluation Network merged to become the AEA. 
Evaluation has been largely practice-based, with the people who do 
program evaluation coming from many different backgrounds, such as edu-
cation, sociology, psychology, economics, social work, and public policy. Most 
evaluation degrees are still awarded out of departments such as education 
or psychology. 
But as described by Stevahn et al. (2005), in the development of com-
petencies for evaluators, the field of program evaluation has been decidedly 
less than can-do. They indicate that most fields recognized as professions, 
such as health care, teaching, counseling, and so on, have typically developed 
competencies for their practices by asking a group of distinguished practi-
tioners—often on behalf of a professional organization—to first generate a 
category scheme and initial list of competencies, then to institute an expert 
review process to edit and refine them (Stevahn et al. 2005). The compe-
tencies are then made available to professionals in the field so that they 
can structure training programs for novice practitioners; continuing education 
programs for experienced professionals; and periodic reviews to update the 
competencies as theory, research, and practices evolve over time. But this has 
not happened in the field of program evaluation. Because there has been no

standardization, anyone can claim to be an evaluator, and can still do so to 
this day. 
By contrast, the field of school psychologists was recognized as a 
division of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1945. 9 But it 
was a nine-day conference in 1954 with 48 APA participants representing 
practitioners and trainers of school psychologists that began to advance 
the profession. Their task was to develop an official position on the roles, 
functions, and necessary training and credentialing of school psychologists. 
One of the goals of the conference was to define school psychologists, and 
the agreed definition was that school psychologists were psychologists who 
specialize in education, and have specific knowledge of the assessment and 
learning of all children. Participants at the conference felt that since school 
psychology is a specialty, individuals in the field should have a completed 
either a two-year graduate training program or a four-year doctoral program. 
They also felt that states should be encouraged to establish certification 
standards to ensure proper training. It was also decided that a practicum 
experience should be required, to help facilitate experiential knowledge 
within the field.
The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) was formed 
in 1969, and in 1988-89 they moved to a national credentialing system. NASP 
is linked to state education agencies and to their credentialing boards. The 
NASP Standards for Training and Field Placement Programs in School Psy -
chology identify the critical training experiences and competencies needed 
by candidates preparing for careers in school psychology. Ten domains are 
laid out, with standards in each domain. These standards serve to guide the 
design of school psychology graduate education. They provide a foundation 
for the recognition of programs that meet national quality standards through 
the NASP program approval process. The Standards for the Credentialing of 
School Psychologists are intended as a model for state education agencies 
or other state or local entities that employ school psychologists, and have 
the statutory authority to establish and regulate credentialing for school psy-
chologists’ titles and practices. Included are recommended criteria for initial 
credentialing, consisting of graduate coursework, practicums, and internship 
requirements, as well as recommendations for credential renewal.
While the world of school psychologists has its own debates, such as 
whether a doctorate should be required for entry into the profession, there 
is no debate about professionalism. Access to the profession is clearly highly 
controlled. 
This is not to suggest that the credentialing of school psychologists 
should serve as a model for global evaluation, where access to training is not 
equal, and equity is a major concern. Additionally, evaluation is trans-sector: 
it does not have a history of state licensure, nor is accreditation a goal. But 
what we can conclude from looking at the development of school psychol -
ogy as a profession is that the youth of a profession does not necessarily

ogists (NASP) website and from Wikipedia.

correlate with professionalism, or hinder the degree of control over access to 
the profession through the setting of standards.
Letting a Thousand Flowers Bloom 
Today any person or group can create their own set of evaluation compe-
tencies. And indeed, that is not only what is happening, but also what is 
being encouraged. The Global Evaluation Agenda summarizes the general 
view that “Given widely different cultural contexts and operating require-
ments, no standard blueprint approach would be appropriate for all VOPEs 
in all countries” (EvalPartners 2016, 24). Given the widespread contexts and 
sectors that evaluators cover, it is believed that each VOPE should design 
its own qualification system within a set of general, internationally accepted, 
guiding principles. Such principles are currently part of evaluator capabilities 
framework pilots being implemented by the EES and the United Kingdom 
Evaluation Society (UKES). These principles address voluntariness, autonomy, 
legitimacy, pluralism, transparency, equity, and quality assurance.
10
As recognized by King and Stevahn, there are advantages to letting 
a thousand evaluation-competency framework “flowers” bloom (King and 
Stevahn 2015). This provides room for adaptation to unique contexts and 
content, and it may generate creativity and innovative ideas. The good prin-
ciples referred to above would not restrict the bloom, and they can help 
guard against the possibility of elitism and continuing exclusion that is feared, 
especially in the context of developing countries, if formal qualifications are 
overemphasized over other indicators of competence, such as on-the-job 
training or relevant experience (Levin 2015). 
But unless there is an agreed-on core of competencies that have some 
part in competency frameworks, it is hard to see how practitioners will be 
able to advance the argument that evaluation is indeed a discipline. Without 
an agreed-on core set of competencies that can be augmented by specialist 
and context-laden additions, it is difficult to see how the field of evaluation 
will be able to move toward increased professionalism. While there is value in 
diversity, more coherence is needed in order to advance the professionalism 
of evaluation. And without a core set of competencies, there is no sound 
basis for the exclusion of unqualified practitioners—a basic qualification for 
any profession.
11
COMPARING SYSTEMS OF COMPETENCY
Today evaluator competency systems are rapidly being developed and 
adopted around the world not only in VOPEs, but also in organizations such 
as the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG 2016a, 2016b) and graduate 
10 These principles are more fully described in EvalAgenda2020 (EvalPartners 
2016), 84–86.

ments of evaluation’s professional status.

school programs in universities, for example, Western Michigan University’s 
doctoral program in evaluation. While only two credentialing systems exist—
those of the CES (which is peer review–based) and the Japanese Evaluation 
Society (which is training course and exam–based)—the EES and the UKES 
are conducting pilots of peer review–based systems. IDEAS, the international 
VOPE, has been considering whether to also pilot a peer review–based system 
and/or to investigate other options. Given the more rapid growth of compe-
tency programs over credentialing programs, the next questions to consider 
are how fundamentally different these competency systems really are, and 
whether any of them have been developed in the context of the SDGs.
Table 5.1 compares the competency domains of five different inter -
national, regional, and national associations. The associations have separate 
ethical standards for their memberships, and some have separate standards 
for the commissioners of evaluations.
The CES has the only approved and operating peer review–based, cre-
dentialed evaluator system.
12 Launched in 2010, it is a voluntary designation, 
which means that the holder has provided evidence of the education and 
experience required by CES to be a competent evaluator. Competencies for 
Canadian evaluation practice (along with ethical standards) are the founda-
tion for the credentialed evaluator program. Their 49 key competencies were 
placed into five competency domains: reflective practice, which focuses on 
fundamental norms and values, and awareness of one’s evaluation expertise 
and need for growth; technical practice competencies, which focus on special-
ized aspects of evaluation; situational practice, which covers the application 
of evaluative thinking and the contextual circumstances in which evaluation 
skills are being applied; management practice competencies, which focus on 
the process of managing evaluations; and interpersonal practice competen-
cies, which focus on “people skills.” 
To qualify for the designation, applicants must provide evidence of a 
graduate-level degree or certificate related to evaluation; evidence of two 
years (full-time equivalent) of evaluation-related work experience within 
the last 10 years; and indicators of education and/or experience related 
to 70 percent of the competencies in each of the five domains. As a peer 
review–based system, applications are reviewed by the CES credentialing 
board. There are special provisions for those who do not have a graduate 
degree or certificate, but they do carry additional out-of-pocket costs.
The Aotearoa New Zealand Evaluation Association (ANZEA) estab-
lished its evaluator competencies in 2011, adding them to a system that 
included ethical guidelines and evaluation standards for undertaking and 
12 See Kuji-Shikatani (2015). Also, the Japan Evaluation Society has not only 
developed a competency framework, but has also implemented a certification program 
that is based on completion of a training program and a passing score on the related 
exam. As of early 2017, the Eurasian Alliance of National Associations, which includes 
evaluation associations from the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, and Armenia, was seeking to partner with academic institutions to further 
professionalization.

commissioning evaluations (ANZEA 2011). Cutting across four competency 
domains and approximately 100 competencies are values and cultural compe-
tency. These are meant to ensure the inclusion and participation of indigenous 
groups and all marginalized subgroups. The first domain, contextual analysis 
and engagement, describes the abilities critical to undertaking analysis of 
the context; engaging with people as part of developing this understand -
ing; and identifying the people, skills, knowledge, and experience needed to 
carry out the evaluation. The second domain, systematic evaluative inquiry, 
describes the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to undertake a system-
atic evaluative inquiry. The third domain, evaluative project management and 
professional evaluation practice covers the competencies needed to manage 
an evaluation in a professional manner. The fourth, reflective practice and pro-
fessional development, includes competencies that support the development 
of the evaluation practitioner and the profession.
In 2012, IDEAS also approved a set of professional competencies. 
IDEAS is the only association for individual development evaluators, and it 
can proudly state that its competencies were developed by an international 
volunteer group from 40 countries, and ratified by the IDEAS membership, 
which spans at least 105 countries (Morra Imas 2010). Competencies were 
developed for those who conduct evaluations as well as for those who 
manage evaluations but do not conduct them directly. For those evaluators 
conducting evaluations, 25 competencies across six domains were identified. 
Additional supporting documentation breaks the competencies down even 
further. This is the only one of the five competency frameworks reviewed that 
identifies monitoring skills and capabilities as a domain. Additionally, unlike 
with the other competency systems, technical skills are broken into stages. 
Adapting to and knowing the context and the culture—what other systems 
refer to as situational practice or context—is incorporated by IDEAS into pro-
fessional foundations; planning and design; and conducting the evaluation. 
Interpersonal practice also overlaps several domains. IDEAS treats all the 
competencies as core competencies.
The EES has attempted to make a distinction between a capabilities, 
or input-based, system such as their own, and ANZEA’s and other out -
come-based competency systems, such as the CES system. Outcome-based 
systems require evaluators to demonstrate their competencies: they are in 
effect testable, or results-based. Input-based systems are viewed as having a 
more deliberate learning orientation that focuses more on capabilities than 
on the demonstration of skills. While this distinction may not be quite clear at 
this point, and while the framework is being used to implement the Voluntary 
Evaluator Peer Review Pilot, it is certain that this is the only framework that 
stresses evaluator dispositions and attitudes, rather than reflective practice 
or professional development. Other models tend to make evaluator disposi-
tions and attitudes a focus of separate ethical standards, or they include a 
competency on compliance with ethical standards. 
After years of discussing competencies (Stevahn et al. 2005), in 2015, 
the AEA began to formally develop a set of competencies for its member -
ship (Altschuld and Engle 2015). Several drafts have been produced and 
reviewed by the membership since that time, with review continuing into
<<<PAGE=99>>>
Chapter 5.  Professionalizing Evaluation -A Golden Opportunity  77
September 2017. The specific goal of the AEA is to develop the general com-
petencies that every evaluator or team of evaluators should have, regardless 
of context. As of September 2017, the competencies remained in draft form, 
with 44 competencies comprising the five domains. AEA continues to debate 
certification and credentialing.
SURPRISING COMMONALITIES
Looking across the five frameworks, at least in terms of the domains, there 
is more consistency than might be expected. While the specific words used 
may differ, five domains seem to be central to all of these systems: reflec -
tive practice; professional or methodological skills; contextual understanding; 
evaluation management; and interpersonal communication. A few domains 
are unique, such as the IDEAS identification of monitoring practice, or EES’s 
dispositions and attitudes.
More variation seems to exist in the specification of competencies, 
and in their placement in domains. Some associations specify more meth-
odological evaluator competencies, while others focus on competencies in 
the interpersonal domain. Still, this comparison suggests that identifying 
and agreeing on five or six core domains, and core competencies within each 
domain that skilled evaluators in various contexts should have, is a realizable 
goal. The core piece could then be added to and adapted for evaluators 
working in different specific contexts, but the core would remain the same. 
None of these five systems have been developed with the SDGs or 
MDGs as a driving force. Most acknowledge that they will require review 
and revision from time to time in order to remain current. If the SDGs, and 
the commitment to them, are to be taken seriously, then they should provide 
the imperative for a review against the core competencies required by those 
who seek to evaluate the SDGs. It may be only a dream now, but the SDGs 
could provide the impetus to move forward toward the professionalization of 
evaluation in a more directed way.
CONSIDERING CORE COMPETENCIES IN THE  
CONTEXT OF THE SDGS
Thinking through core competencies in the context of the SDGs will likely 
be a three-step process. What is needed first is a review and agreement 
on the handful of core domains and concomitant competencies that are 
most important for skilled evaluators to have, whether they are specialists 
in empowerment evaluation or randomized designs, HIV/AIDS evaluation 
experts, or country evaluation specialists. These are the base competencies 
that those who call themselves evaluators should have, even though they 
may also specialize in particular evaluation methods, sectors, or countries. 
Like any set of competencies, these would not be set in stone, but would 
have provisions for periodic review and renewal as the field evolves. This step 
in itself would advance the professionalism of the field. 
Second, as discussed earlier, is the envisioning of what it would look

SDGs. The third would be to add to the core competencies and extend them 
to the SDG context as needed. 
This will not be relevant for all evaluators. Not all evaluators work 
on an everyday basis in the direct context of the SDGs. But it would be 
a critically important paradigm for the many evaluators who are struggling 
with the SDGs. For example, working across sector boundaries might become 
a core SDG competency under the interpersonal domain. Mastery of com-
plexity theory and systems approaches might be deemed important SDG 
competencies under professional or methodological practice; or new uses of 
technology for better data capture; or the use of big data. Some key questions 
will always need to be asked—for example, is this a necessary competency? 
or is it teachable?, as suggested by King and Stevahn (2015).
What are some of the advantages of professionalizing evaluation in the 
context of the SDGs? By creating agreement on what the evaluation of the 
SDGs entails, and delineating the core competencies necessary to undertake 
it, clear core standards would enable evaluators to work across geographical 
boundaries. This could level the playing field in the sense of knowing what 
the expectations are, and enabling the targeting of evaluation training pro-
grams where they are lacking, and where they are most urgently needed. 
Flexibility could be retained for noncore competencies, so that customization 
is still possible. Two of the largest benefits might be increased compara-
bility of evaluation findings from shared methods and approaches, and an 
increased quality of evaluations. 
How to start? That the convening power exists today to accomplish this 
goal is clear. EvalPartners, in partnership with IOCE, IDEAS, UNEG, and others, 
could continue a series of global multistakeholder consultations, whether 
face-to-face, virtual, or some combination of the two. This has already started 
to some extent, with the Third Global Evaluation Forum, held in April 2017 
in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, and organized by IOCE, EvalPartners, UNEG, the 
Global Parliamentarian Forum for Evaluation, the Kyrgyz Monitoring and Eval-
uation Network, and the Eurasian Evaluation Network, with the support of 
the Kyrgyz government. This forum brought together some 150 delegates, 
representing governments, parliaments, development partners, foundations, 
the private sector, universities, civil society, and the evaluation community, to 
advance implementation of the SDGs through review and implementation 
of Eval2020. Much could be gained by involving larger groups of evaluators, 
taking advantage of everyone’s need to understand and advance evaluation 
of the SDGs; and with it, the opportunity for professionalization of the field. 
As SDG competencies are developed and agreed upon, ready access to 
high-quality professional training opportunities on SDG evaluation can follow.

From Evaluation Capacity Building to 
Evaluation Capacity Development - 
A Paradigm Shift
Michele Tarsilla
Abstract . In acknowledging the current limitations of contemporary evaluation capac -
ity-building practice, and in an effort to promote an innovative and equity-focused 
contribution to the current discourse on evaluation capacity, this chapter suggests a 
new framework for conceptualizing, planning, implementing, and assessing the results 
of capacity development (as opposed to capacity building) in evaluation more effec -
tively in the future. The first part of the chapter proposes a new definition of capacity 
in evaluation, and encourages readers to embrace and adopt the more encompassing 
term of “evaluation capacity development” as opposed to that “evaluation capacity 
building.” The second part offers funders and planners an overview of those contextual 
and process-related factors that need to be taken into account in order to enhance 
the effectiveness of capacity development activities and programs. The third part 
highlights the specific and innovative contribution of the International Development 
Evaluation Association (IDEAS) to the ongoing discourse on evaluation capacity.

O
ften associated with the delivery of short-term training and technical 
assistance funded by international agencies, evaluation capacity build -
ing (ECB) has fallen short of its intended objectives in many different 
development and humanitarian contexts (Tarsilla 2014a). Despite the copious 
resources allocated by international development organizations to enhance 
the capacity of low- and middle-income countries to evaluate the perfor -
mance and impact of their development programs and policies, most ECB 
activities on the ground have failed on multiple fronts. They have not been 
able to target a sufficiently large critical mass of individuals and organizations 
that could truly foster systemic change in the uptake and use of evaluation. 
The agencies that fund evaluation capacity-building programs in the Global 
South have not coordinated with each other as closely and systematically as 
they should have and, in so doing, have undermined their own ability to foster 
a more efficient and strategic use of resources. Finally, time and energy have 
been focused on the measurement of short-term effects, while the quest for 
long-term results has largely remained elusive. 
Well aware of such weaknesses, and in response to the need expressed 
by many actors for the roll-out of more innovative ECB strategies, the Interna-
tional Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS) is promoting a paradigm 
shift in contemporary thinking and practice in the area of evaluation capacity 
development (ECD) (Tarsilla 2012). In particular, it is calling for a shift from 
the current focus on short-term training activities to the adoption of ECD 
strategies that are more contextually relevant and are better geared toward 
equitable, systemic and sustainable learning in evaluation. 
EVALUATION CAPACITY BUILDING:  
KEY ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS
It is well understood that having individual practitioners and organizations’ 
staff participate in two- or three-day workshops on evaluation theories and 
methods cannot foster dramatic change either in the quality of evaluation 
practice or the use of evaluation products. However, despite this, most ECB 
interventions, supported by both national and international funders in many 
different countries over the last two decades, have consisted mainly in the 
implementation of a finite number of activities. Such reification of capac -
ity building, illustrated by the tendency to equate capacity building with 
training, as well as the tendency to implement evaluation workshops in a 
vacuum—that is, without accurate knowledge of how power and resources 
are distributed and contested at the local level—is indeed one of ECB’s main 
weaknesses. This phenomenon, which has had egregious effects on the way 
international and national funders have planned and budgeted for in this area 
of development in the past, has been so prevalent that the meaning of ECB 
has been watered down, and its potential significantly compromised. 
A second limitation in the way ECB has been conducted in the past 
is the dismissal of organizational processes in the planning, implementation, 
and evaluation of capacity-building efforts. While too much focus has been 
given to advancing the technical skills of individuals and organization staff, 
ECB planners and workshop facilitators have often failed to assess and act
<<<PAGE=105>>>

upon the environment in which their target groups are operating. In particular, 
ECB planners and implementers have not systematically addressed the fol -
lowing as part of their capacity needs assessment: 
 n Environmental factors that influence the use of evaluation (e.g., the 
type of political system in place at the national and subnational 
levels; existing governance and accountability norms; and the 
degree of openness to accept failure/s and learn from them)
 n Institutional or organizational processes that either benefit or hinder 
the evaluation function (e.g., lines of reporting and communication 
across different levels of a governmental agency, or data quality 
assurance regulations within the national statistics office) 
 n The quantity and quality of incentives available to conduct and use 
evaluation (e.g., the systematic publication of evaluation reports on 
a public portal, and/or the practice of organizations’ executives to 
develop a management response in reaction to the recommenda-
tions included in an evaluation report)
Given inadequate understanding of ECD ecology, most funders and 
planners have failed to get many of the relevant actors from either the public 
or private sectors involved, either as partners or beneficiaries, in their past 
ECD efforts.
1 Evaluation training programs, for instance, are generally aimed 
at a limited number of evaluation technical officers from one or more organi-
zations without the strategic involvement of their supervisors and directors. 
Furthermore, numerous ECB interventions provide participants with evalua-
tion toolkits and checklists but they often dismiss the environmental factors 
that influence the adoption and use of such knowledge product—what I have 
defined as the “political economy” of ECD.
A third limitation has been the more or less inadvertent perpetuation 
of the old development paradigm, according to which donors’ needs and 
interests prevail over anybody else’s. For more than a decade, ECB activi-
ties have been geared toward increasing the level of knowledge, skills, and 
attitudes of project staff in the field with the primary de facto objective to 
enhance regular results reporting to funders (e.g., on a quarterly basis). What 
has been particularly fallacious is the assumption that retrofitting existing 
practices within established boundaries identified by donors would enable 
empowerment and social change. Unfortunately, this donor-centric strategy, 
which I tend to classify as “functional evaluation capacity building,” or F-ECB, 
not ECD, has gradually become the norm (Tarsilla 2014a). In one case, four 
small cultural organizations that I worked with in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo had strategic objectives that, as spelled out in the plans and logical 
frameworks formulated for them by an international funder, were out of sync 
not only with their organizations’ own vision, but also with their country’s 
1 Public sector actors would include, among others, staff in ministries and 
members of parliaments. Private sector actors would include, among others, training 
institutes and consulting firms.

national cultural policies. It was very disheartening to discover that—accord-
ing to the contract signed with the funder—I needed to enhance the capacity 
of these four organizations to measure the attainment of their objectives, 
which had been imposed from the outside, by using a number of indicators 
that the organizations in question did not really understand, or assign any 
credit to. In particular, it was very difficult to talk to them about logic models, 
theory of change, and rigorous evaluation designs, especially given the fact 
that the impact indicators showing at the top of the logical framework tem-
plate—which had been distributed by the funder—rested on the assumption 
that grantees would be in a position to effectively measure the extent to 
which some of their activities, which were targeting less than 20 participants 
per year, had contributed to improved attainment of two of the Millennium 
Development Goals in the whole country. Unfortunately, this example shows 
once again that ECB programs often provide participants with the knowledge 
and tools that facilitate timely reporting to funding agencies, but rarely foster 
true organizational learning and increased results-oriented agency.
HOW TO OVERCOME EXISTING LIMITATIONS WITH THE 
NEW DEFINITION OF CAPACITY IN EVALUATION: FROM 
EVALUATION CAPACITY BUILDING (ECB) TO EVALUATION 
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT(ECD)
ECB in International Development: Key Assumptions and Real-
World Considerations
The evaluation policies and strategic evaluation plans currently in use among 
several development agencies around the world are predicated on the assump-
tion that international development evaluation serves two primary functions 
(GIZ 2013; Norad 2006; Sida 2007; UNESCO 2015; USAID 2011). The first is 
to enhance the accountability of those who manage and implement interna-
tional development projects, especially vis-à-vis their respective funders and 
expected beneficiaries (Wiesner 1997). The second is to foster learning among 
those who commission, manage, conduct, and use evaluation, on what works 
well and what needs to be improved in international development projects and 
programs (Argyris and Schön 1996; Bamberger 2009; Pasteur 2006; Rist, Boily, 
and Martin 2011; Solomon and Chowdhury 2002). Based on such assumptions, 
any activity aimed at strengthening the evaluation function—locally, nationally, 
or globally—should, therefore, be able to contribute to strengthening both the 
performance and the effectiveness of international development projects in a 
variety of countries. However, this is easier said than done. 
Typically, funders and international development agencies attempt to 
strengthen the evaluation function by developing the technical skills of local 
development practitioners. However, such strategies do not always translate 
into stronger development effectiveness. One reason for this is the lack of a 
genuine evaluative culture—that is, the systematic conduct of evaluation, and 
the use of findings for decision making—which often results from the limited 
ability of ECB to foster ownership and inclusiveness of evaluation processes.

Chapter 6. From Evaluation Capacity Building to Evaluation Capacity Development -A Paradigm Shift  85
The scenario, however, is not as bleak as it would first appear. There 
are several examples of countries that have put monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) systems into place that are both prospering and serving accountabil -
ity and learning purposes. Chile, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, 
and Sri Lanka provide good illustrations of how the creation of a supportive 
environment to enhance the evaluation functions at both the organizational 
level (Stevenson et al. 2002; Wijayatilake 2011) and the institutional level 
can foster the development of a strong national evaluative culture (Boyle, 
Lemaire, and Rist 1999; Mayne 2008; Trochim 2006). One feature that all 
of these countries have in common is the buy-in of different stakeholder 
groups both within and outside the national government into the discourse 
on evaluation, and their subsequent involvement in all of the related pro-
cesses. Such success stories, though, have not been capitalized on in the 
international development arena as frequently as they should, or could, have 
been. The result is that the pursuit of non-inclusive targeting strategies has 
hindered the success of ECD interventions in many countries around the 
world. The simultaneous involvement of actors operating both within and 
outside of national governments as part of an ECB intervention has been very 
rare: this is also a result of the rigidity featured by the mission and the scope 
of work among the majority of funding agencies. On the one hand, for over 
a decade bilateral donors and philanthropic foundations have been able to 
fund a plethora of initiatives and programs specifically aimed at strengthen-
ing the knowledge and skills of stakeholders supplying evaluation services 
(e.g., representatives from academia, the private sector, and nongovernmental 
organizations) (OECD 2006). On the other hand, multilateral agencies, such 
as the United Nations and the World Bank, have allocated the largest share 
of ECB resources to national governments; that is, the agents that for the 
most part demand evaluation services. 
ECB or ECD: Does the Terminology Really Matter?
Far from becoming rhetoric in a purely academic exercise, an exploration of 
the language used to describe ECB would be particularly useful to enhance 
future programming in this area. In particular, reviewing the central attributes, 
modalities of implementation, and evaluative variables of ECB would be ben-
eficial. The same is true for another popular term used in the international 
development arena: evaluation capacity development. An in-depth review of 
ECD appears even more relevant than that of ECB, given that capacity devel-
opment—in evaluation as well as in a variety of other fields—is not the only 
“missing link in development” (World Bank 2005, 24). Even more importantly, 
it is part of the overall goal of development cooperation (Fukuyama 2004).
A certain confusion or lack of consensus exists over the meaning of 
both terms, and has been attested to by a stream of peer-reviewed literature 
produced by evaluation scholars. Among the most recent contributions on 
this topic, Bohni and Attström’s (2011) appears particularly relevant. Accord-
ing to these Danish authors, more serious reflection and debate on the 
distinction between ECD and ECB is needed, as it would allow the address-
ing of four main issues affecting the practice of evaluation in a number of

countries: the widespread conceptual pluralism in the area of ECB and ECD; 
the increased number of discordant opinions regarding the purposes of ECB; 
the lack of a comprehensive empirical base for most ECB and ECD models; 
and the relatively greater focus on the approaches implemented in tackling 
ECB rather than ECD. 
When referring to capacity building, Morgan, one of the most prolific 
authors on capacity, has defined it as:
…a risky, murky, messy business, with unpredictable and unquantifiable 
outcomes, uncertain methodologies, contested objectives, many unin-
tended consequences, little credit to its champions and long time lags. 
(Morgan 1998, 6). 
Likewise, in defining capacity development, Lusthaus, one of the most 
well-respected Canadian experts in institutional evaluation and change, has 
described it as follows:
…a concept still in its infancy. Its definition is still forming. Research 
describing how people use the concept is sparse. So is research, which 
tests its assumptions and predicts its consequences. There are few 
evaluations of projects that are claiming to use approaches to capacity 
development. (Lusthaus et al. 2002, 34)
The discourse on capacity development (including over its definitions) 
has continued over the years. However, it has traditionally been dominated 
by the voices of northern scholars. Only recently have researchers and aca-
demic institutions in the Global South become engaged in this area of work. 
Among some of the most recognized actors who have contributed to advanc-
ing capacity development-related definitions are the following:
 n The African Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s Develop-
ment, which in 2010 introduced an African Capacity Development 
Strategic Framework (AU and NEPAD 2012)
 n The African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF 2016)

forum in Asia

The Main Attributes of ECD
Rather than being a purely semantic issue, the distinction between ECB and 
ECD appears all the more relevant due to the unique political and ideolog-
ical connotations ascribed to each of the two terms. As confirmed by the

Chapter 6. From Evaluation Capacity Building to Evaluation Capacity Development -A Paradigm Shift  87
increasing use of the term “evaluation capacity development” in some of the 
evaluation offices of international organizations, such as the World Bank and 
GIZ, ECD is characterized more consistently and intentionally by a stronger 
emphasis on inclusiveness, flexibility, development result focus, and context 
responsiveness to an already existing evaluation capacity. An Institute of Inter-
national Development Studies report commissioned by UNESCO draws an 
important distinction between capacity building and capacity development 
that appears particularly useful for the discussion in this chapter (Ortiz and 
Taylor 2009). When applied to the evaluation context, the report seems to 
corroborate and amplify the differences between ECB and ECD. As discussed 
in one of the report’s most salient passages, capacity building and capacity 
development are not described as simply different terms, but rather as two 
opposite development paradigms:
Much of the capacity development literature stresses the fact that 
development is already happening before the arrival of any project, 
donor, program or initiative, and not to recognize this as an irresponsible 
error and ultimately a precursor to an ineffective use of resources. Too 
many donors and executing agencies are determined that their projects 
be executed in any event, yet when those projects are severely out of 
tune with the development processes already in motion, they are likely 
to fail. They fail because:
a) Capacity development programming that does not recognize develop-
ment in motion is quite literally a foreign object; that is, it pushes ideas that 
aren’t likely to take hold because they are out of step with local realities;
b) They do not build on momentum; that is, positive development initia-
tives and processes already in motion;
c) The motivation needed to take forward a strategy that does not fit 
will in turn require a push strategy to convince people to carry it out. 
Even when the appropriate incentives are in place, true motivation will be 
dubious because participation will likely be led by the possibility of short-
term gain. The fundamentals required for sustainability will be lacking 
and therefore the project activities and desired behavior changes are 
unlikely to develop deep roots” (Ortiz and Taylor 2009, 26)
Based on such foundational work, and following global research on 
the understanding of ECB and ECD among evaluation planners, managers, 
and practitioners in many different countries, the need for a new definition of 
ECB and ECD becomes apparent (Tarsilla 2012). However, rather than seeing 
the two terms as opposite, the two definitions that I came to develop after 
my exchanges with more than 150 practitioners in over 40 countries situate 
themselves along an ECB-ECD continuum, where ECB generally accounts for 
one of the preliminary phases of a broader and long-term ECD strategy.
Evaluation Capacity Building: A New Definition
The new definition of ECB, which was developed toward the end of a long 
series of consultations with practitioners around the world, reads as follows:
<<<PAGE=110>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
88
A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for ECD to take place. ECB 
mainly consists of a vast array of trainings and coaching activities (some 
of which are short-term in nature) aimed at building capacity, especially 
where capacity is either very low or thought not be in place yet, among a 
discrete number of individuals working either for or within organizations 
and/or institutions that develop, commission, manage, conduct and/or 
use evaluation. Although it is an integral component of most national 
and international development projects today, ECB has often been 
viewed (especially outside of the United States) as a relatively limited 
accountability-driven tactic rather than a full-fledged strategy aimed at 
attaining organizational learning as well as other developmental objec -
tives. As a result, ECB scope and modalities of delivery have often been 
considered too narrow. (Tarsilla 2012)
Evaluation Capacity Development: A New Definition
ECD, on the other hand, is defined as:
A process consisting in both the integrated enhancement and main-
tenance over time of: (a) Individuals’ knowledge, skills and attitudes; 
(b) Organizations’ capabilities; and (c) Institutions’ readiness; toward con-
textually relevant planning, management, implementation, and use of 
evaluation at any level-global, regional, national or sub-national. More 
specifically, ECD is aimed at both individual and collective transfor -
mational learning in the pursuit of three primary goals: strengthening 
the technical quality and ownership of national evaluation processes; 
enhancing the local authenticity and cultural appropriateness of evalua-
tion approaches, methods and tools used in-country; and increasing the 
use of evaluation findings as a way to improve development interven-
tions in a variety of sectors. (Tarsilla 2012)
In order for ECD to be successful, it is critical that ECD strategies be 
implemented either in a simultaneous, or an intentionally sequenced fashion. 
ECD-savvy strategies (such as the ones adopted by IDEAS) are specifically 
aimed at promoting the conditions that support ECD among a variety 
of actors operating in two different spheres (both within and outside of 
national government), and characterized by different functions (operational, 
and policy or decision making) and roles (both consumers and providers of 
evaluation). ECD strategies consist of a combination of short, medium, and 
long-term activities (including training, mentoring, coaching, peer exchange, 
and the creation of evaluation units). Otherwise, ECD appears to be a systemic 
and adaptive process rather than the combination of stand-alone activities 
aimed at enhancing capacity at the individual, organizational, or institutional 
levels. As stressed by the new definition provided above, ECD emerges as 
an endogenous process that builds upon existing levels of knowledge, skills, 
and attitudes (individual), capabilities (organizational), and readiness (insti-
tutional) either simultaneously or sequentially, and in a variety of contexts 
(global, regional, national, and subnational), as opposed to building from 
scratch.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND PROCESS-RELATED FACTORS 
INFLUENCING THE OUTCOMES OF CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT 
(ECD) ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS
ECD: Gaps in Targeting and Possible Solutions
Activities aimed at strengthening technical capacity within national ministries 
and central planning agencies (Compton, Baizerman, and Stockdill 2002) 
have enhanced the knowledge of evaluation within the governmental sphere, 
but have not necessarily contributed to the development of skills needed 
to either formulate key evaluation questions or use evaluation findings 
(Bamberger 2009; OECD 2006). Furthermore, activities aimed at enhanc -
ing national evaluation capacity have rarely been customized to the specific 
functions (operational or strategic) and roles (commissioners, implementers, 
policy makers) of individual officers operating within the government, and 
have instead favored the implementation of the same standardized approach 
at several levels within the government, as if it were a monolithic block. 
Addressing the limitations of current ECB targeting is all the more relevant, 
as the currently biased allocation of funding between governmental and non-
governmental actors has three primary consequences. 
First, it has hindered the mainstreaming of evaluation at a more sys-
temic level, as predicated by a number of studies, including a recent work 
funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (Gaventa and 
Barrett 2010). Change happens through multiple types of citizen engage-
ment: not only through formal governance processes, even participatory ones, 
but also through associations and social movements that are not created by 
the state. Strengthening these broader processes of social change and their 
interactions can, in turn, create opportunities for state reformers to respond 
to demands, build external alliances, and contribute to state responsiveness 
(Gaventa and Barrett 2010). 
Second, the identification of individual evaluation champions within 
host governments that are characterized by high employee turnover has 
not always contributed to either the uptake of an evaluation culture or the 
sustainable promotion of the use of evaluation findings in other sectors 
(Lennie 2005). There are certainly some good examples of the contributions 
of national evaluation champions. However, the tendency among politicians 
to cater to their constituencies’ needs and interests regardless of what the 
available evidence suggests confronts ECD planners and implementers with 
a real hurdle to overcome. 
Third, the greater focus on the demand for evaluation, which some 
authors critically refer to as “elite domination” (Fung 2003, 340), has ignored 
the potential contribution of evaluation “suppliers” (e.g., national evaluators), 
and has not sufficiently leveraged their wealth of knowledge and practical 
experience during the undertaking of evaluations. That notwithstanding, ECD 
targeting is already gradually evolving, as attested to by the support pro-
vided by such initiatives as EvalPartners and the strengthening of voluntary 
organizations of professionals in evaluation (VOPEs) over the last five years.

ECD Processes: What’s New Compared to Past ECB Practices?
As per the new definition of ECD, the focus of ECD is not on either activities 
or products (e.g., a training on mixed methods, or the timely submission of a 
midterm review to the project funder), but rather on processes, interactions, 
incentives, leadership, organizational learning, and organizational develop-
ment. Furthermore, ECD is characterized as a particularly inclusive process 
that is able to respond to the continually emerging needs and interests not 
simply of individuals, organizations, or institutions; but rather of individuals 
situated within organizations, and institutions interacting with each other, 
both in the governmental and nongovernmental spheres. Likewise, rather 
than resting upon linear and mechanistic planning, ECD is understood and 
defined as a process grounded in both a realistic understanding of the 
world’s complexity, and the need to adopt more flexible and iterative plan-
ning processes. However, my analysis of contemporary ECB practice shows 
that the latter has focused on developing individual technical skills—how to 
write evaluation terms of reference, or how to develop sampling strategies—
rather than on developing organization-level capabilities and institutional 
readiness, based on relatively linear and results-based planning processes 
(Tarsilla 2012). Moreover, in contrast to the descriptions of capacity develop-
ment as an incessant endogenous process in the peer-reviewed literature, the 
way the term ECB has been understood suggests that it rests on the main 
assumption that in-country capacity is static (you either have it or you don’t), 
and that targeted interventions, often funded from external development 
partners, are the most effective. As a result, ECB does seem to fail to recog-
nize the inherent institutional processes and social dynamics of the settings 
where its activities are being implemented.
Other Contextual Factors Influencing the Outcomes of ECD 
Activities and Programs
If one takes the organization as the main unit of analysis of any reflection 
on ECD,4 then it is relevant to consider those unique distinct organizational 
features (its structures and processes) that are likely to affect the outcomes 
of an ECD program. The adequate consideration of organizational infrastruc-
tures and underlying dynamics is, therefore, critical to the success of any 
ECD strategy. For each of the relevant factors identified in the left column of 
table 6.1, a series of ECD strategies are recommended in the right column. 
Based on a review of the organizational factors listed in the table, a 
key conclusion is that, despite the size of one’s own organization, the planning 
of any ECD program cannot overlook the context in which that organization 
operates. As harmonization, relevance, and ownership are some of the prin-
ciples that any sound ECD program should feature, it could be useful to 
link organizations targeted by ECB efforts with each other as if they were

organizations.

partners and not simply grantees sharing the same donor, so as to allow an 
alignment of their internal M&E systems. 
It is important to note that what is being advocated here is not the 
development of a cookie-cutter approach, whereby individual organizations 
share exactly the same set of indicators or evaluation strategies: after all, cre-
ativity and flexibility to adjust to emerging changes are two typical features 
of successful ECD programs. By promoting ECD alignment, what is being 
suggested instead is to encourage organizations to find common and cost-ef-
fective solutions to their information needs and operational questions. During 
the planning of an ECD program, for instance, each organization with a vested 
interest in ECD could look at what tools similar organizations have used to 
measure a certain construct that they are interested in measuring and—for 
the sake of avoiding replication and the wasting of resources—might adopt 
those very same existing tools. Besides freeing up resources for the devel -
opment of other tools, or the set-up of an information management system 
within one’s own organization, for example, ECD alignment would foster the 
use of identical indicators and, as a result of increased data aggregation, the 
availability of data that could then inform ECD-related decision and policy 
making. This is even more relevant if such alignment not only takes place 
locally, but also at the provincial, district, regional, and national levels. 
Likewise, it is important that ECD strategies acknowledge more effec -
tively what the real interests and needs of any organization are, independently 
of the donors’ interests and needs. With that in mind, the following key rec -
ommendations should be taken into account during the development of a 
new ECD strategy:
 n Although it is tempting to introduce radical changes within the 
realm of organizational practices when ECD programs are being 
implemented, it is critical that donors and contractors implement -
ing ECD strategies on the ground recognize the speed of local 
organizations to “digest” new evaluation methods and tools. 
 n Development organizations should understand that assigning a 
prominent role to funders’ evaluation requirements and needs, and 
building upon them to design an ECD program, is a conventional 
form of evaluation capacity building. For evaluation capacity devel-
opment to occur, the centrality of the organizations (each with their 
own interests and needs) within the system where they are operat-
ing needs to be recognized.
 n A broader and more systemic targeting of ECD is needed. Two new 
possible scenarios could be envisaged. On the one hand, funders 
and implementing organizations should promote the conduct of 
evaluation awareness-raising among actors who, despite not being 
directly targeted by the ECD intervention, still gravitate within the 
system where the latter is being implemented. On the other hand, 
funders and implementing partners should ensure more active 
involvement of the entities working in both the private and public 
sector anytime a large-scale ECD program sponsored by a national

government or a consortium of large funders is being planned. Too 
often ECD funding has concentrated on either the supply side (the 
individuals providing evaluation services) or the demand side (the 
commissioners of evaluations) of the equation. However, at a time 
when roles often overlap such a distinction no longer appears to 
be reasonable. 
 n For organizations that are implementing ECD strategies, as well as 
local organizations being targeted by ECD programs, ECD program 
objectives or organizational visions for evaluation should fit well 
with their respective institutional or organizational vision.
Enhancing Evaluation Capacity: The Equity Paradox
Considering the observed gaps in the targeting of ECD programs across 
funding agencies in the past, and based on the results of key ECB and ECD 
theoretical frameworks in use, this section provides a list of suggestions 
on how to make ECD targeting more inclusive and effective in the future 
(box 6.1).
IDEAS’S CONTRIBUTION TO A PARADIGM SHIFT IN 
CONTEMPORARY CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT THINKING AND 
PRACTICE
A Radically New Perspective on Evaluation Capacity 
Development
The role that IDEAS has played so far, and intends to play, in the area of 
ECD in the future is important and timely for three main reasons. First, it 
allows revitalization of the discourse on ECD among IDEAS members eight 
years after the IDEAS Global Assembly that was organized around this theme 
in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2009.
5 Second, it is likely to provide guid -
ance in the production of some concrete tools and checklists that IDEAS 
members could use to enhance the effectiveness of the ECD work in their 
respective fields in the future. Third, it would build and expand upon the 
work that IDEAS has already done on evaluation competencies. Overall, the 
work of IDEAS in this area, as envisioned in the mission of the newly created 
Evaluation Capacity Development International Topical Interest Group (ECD 
ITIG), aims to build more consensus among members of IDEAS from different 
regions on what it means to work with organizations and governments on 
evaluation capacity in a more contextualized and sustainable manner.

Chapter 6. From Evaluation Capacity Building to Evaluation Capacity Development -A Paradigm Shift  95
BOX 6.1 Key suggestions to make ECD strategy more inclusive and 
effective 
1 . Understand the specific ECD ecology where you are working  . In con -
ducting a mapping of the major institutions—both within and outside 
of the government sphere, including VOPEs, academia, and the private 
sector that have demonstrated interest in ECD in the past—the identifi -
cation of individuals as well as specific units with a more vested interest 
in evaluation is strongly recommended, so as to avoid the personaliza -
tion of the evaluation function, which would then be exposed to the risk 
of collapse in case of staff turnover.
2 . Identify some common nationwide goals and objectives that all ECD 
stakeholders could be encouraged to contribute to  . Such goals, ideally 
aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, do not need to be per -
ceived as imposed from the outside, and should be consistent to the largest 
extent possible with the each targeted actor’s mission and objectives.
3 . Build institutional incentives from within  . The incentives that are 
made available, including the identification and rewarding of champi -
ons, should not focus on meeting preset performance agreements, and 
should promote instead the ECD actor’s ability to wonder and ask ques -
tions about how to turn short-term and isolated tactics into long-term 
and sustainable strategies.
4 . Conduct a participatory ECD diagnostic assessment  . Through such 
assessment, it will be important to foster opportunities for self-reflec -
tion and mutual learning. In this vein, it would be important that such 
assessment focus on a selected number of the organizational and envi -
ronmental factors and processes discussed in this chapter.
5 . Develop a national ECD strategy and, depending on the scope of your 
intervention, put into place a national ECD task force  . Far from being 
a logical framework or road map, a national evaluation strategy is to be 
regarded as a work in progress and a living document, setting general 
objectives and leaving ECD stakeholders space to come up with creative 
and innovative ways to achieve the agreed-upon objectives. This phase 
might require addressing some key issues, such as the creation of ded -
icated evaluation units with three specific responsibilities—compiling 
a database of evaluation data; conducting data analysis; and, fostering 
dissemination of evaluation findings—as well as the establishment of 
partnerships between different departments within the same organiza -
tion. With respect to an ECD task force, it is advisable that a variety 
of actors with different functions and roles (from both the public and 
private spheres), as well as entities whose membership cuts across dif -
ferent spheres, be involved.

The Organizational Principles Driving IDEAS’s ECD Efforts
Cognizant of the peer-reviewed literature produced to date, and building 
upon the understanding of contemporary evaluation practices, IDEAS is striv-
ing to create an enabling environment in which an authentic evaluation culture 
can flourish among its members in the future. The IDEAS ECD strategy rests 
on six key organizational principles that have been identified as among the 
most influential in the development of an evaluative culture, especially at the 
global level:
Membership diversity . The more diverse the membership of IDEAS in terms 
of roles and functions, the more likely it is that IDEAS will be able to affect 
the national evaluation discourse within both the public and private spheres.
Decentralized leadership. The more that IDEAS leadership is shared, and 
the larger the availability of channels through which members can contribute 
to IDEAS decision-making processes, the better the compliance with internal 
governance rules will be.
6
6 According to IDEAS current organizational set-up, all of the world’s regions are 
equally represented in the Board. Individual board members coordinate, too, with the 
national and regional evaluation associations falling within their respective geographi-
cal spheres of competence.
BOX 6.1 (continued)
6 . Focus on strengthening the capacity of local actors (both users and 
providers of evaluation services), and develop an opportunistic joint 
exit strategy , in close collaboration with the individuals, organizations, 
and institutions involved in an ECD program. Although not operational -
ized from the outset, an exit strategy needs to be conceptualized from 
the very beginning of an ECD intervention. In order to advance sustain -
ability, it is of utmost importance to have a very strong leader in place, 
who is capable of innovation and available to promote internal structural 
changes and the reallocation of budget resources based on the organi -
zation’s needs and the changing contextual opportunities (what I have 
called “responsible systemic-ness”).
7 . Evaluate the progress of your ECD over time  . In order to measure the 
effectiveness of your ECD support program, you need to make sure that 
your target audience as well as the type of capacity development you 
are trying to support (according to the interests and needs expressed 
by in-country ECD stakeholders) have been clearly defined at the time of 
ECD strategy development.
<<<PAGE=119>>>
Chapter 6. From Evaluation Capacity Building to Evaluation Capacity Development -A Paradigm Shift  97
Frequent diagnostics of both IDEAS capabilities and organizational 
processes . The more frequently capability assessments are conducted—
for example, annually—and the more promptly identified weaknesses are 
addressed, the more successfully IDEAS will be able to fulfill its mission.
Availability and continued monitoring of the IDEAS theory of change  . 
The more often the IDEAS theory of change is available and is revised, based 
on its program development and the findings of capability assessments 
carried out among its members, the more often the assumptions underlying 
it will be monitored, and programmatic improvements will be made.
Promotion of effective international and external communication . The 
more well-articulated a communication strategy is, the more social and polit-
ical legitimacy IDEAS ECD work could benefit from it.
Availability of opportunities to members for disseminating, exchang-
ing, and developing ideas, theories, and concepts about evaluation . The 
approval of a new publication and dissemination policy by the IDEAS Board in 
May 2017 is an important milestone in the association’s history. The process 
of publishing high-quality, peer-reviewed papers is an integral part of the 
IDEAS ECD ITIG work plan, and of that of all other actors within the associ-
ation who have an interest in capacity development and professionalization. 
By enabling its members to publish original work on topics related to 
international development evaluation, IDEAS will be able to attain the follow-
ing objectives in the short term:
 n Give visibility to practitioners and decision makers with no prior 
track record of publications
 n Disseminate evaluation-related ideas on topics and/or countries 
rarely discussed in the mainstream peer-reviewed evaluation 
literature
 n Encourage its members to collaborate in documenting and writing 
about their own evaluation practices on a more regular basis—
that is, not only in response to the call for conference proposals 
launched every two years before the IDEAS General Assembly
 n Use the publication of articles and other items posted on the IDEAS 
website as an entry point for further dialogue, and for mutual intel-
lectual and professional enrichment among its members
In the medium and long term, the new policy is expected to elicit a 
stronger sense of personal belonging to IDEAS, and that, as a result, will 
assist in advancing and furthering IDEAS members’ practice of development 
evaluation, through strengthening their capacities, and their uptake of innova-
tive evaluation methodologies.

The Vision and Values Driving IDEAS’s ECD Efforts
IDEAS makes a constant effort to promote a more just, equitable, and dem-
ocratic design for the management, funding and evaluation of ECD work. By 
questioning paradigms that have dominated the international development 
discourse over the last 10 years, IDEAS has called upon evaluation practi-
tioners and international partners to engage in evaluation and in capacity 
development with justice, sustainability, and transformative change in mind. 
In so doing, IDEAS is encouraging more reflection among members on what 
kinds of postures evaluation practitioners could and should have toward 
issues of equity, cultural competence, type and quality of evidence, sustain-
ability, and the use of evaluation. Furthermore, this work promotes a more 
systematic appreciation of the cultural and linguistic diversity (what I call 
the “equality” of differences) within the IDEAS as well as the rest of the 
evaluation community. The ECD ITIG, for instance, complements the other 
IDEAS ITIGs, and helps to strengthen the cultural and linguistic diversity of 
the association’s membership, as a strategy for enhancing the sustainability 
of future evaluation endeavors. As part of such a strategy, some of the key 
IDEAS resources will be translated into languages other than English (French 
and Spanish, among others), and stronger links with other regional evaluation 
conferences through the establishment of joint projects will be strengthened.
Technical Considerations Driving IDEAS’s ECD Efforts
Besides the foundational and more vision-related principles inspiring its 
future ECD strategy, a number of technical considerations are driving IDEAS’s 
ECD work, as follows:
 n Given the lack of an effective decentralization of the M&E func -
tion in many countries, it has proven extremely difficult to promote 
a defused culture of evaluation through a top-down approach. 
Therefore, through the involvement of members at the country and 
subnational levels, IDEAS is attempting to extend the in-country 
boundaries of the evaluation culture.
 n Due to the relatively weak data analysis skills among national evalu-
ators, IDEAS aims to enhance the statistical as well as the qualitative 
analysis of their members through the use of webinars and other 
publications.
 n In response to misconceptions about evaluation, or “reduc -
tive” understanding of the purposes of evaluation,
7 IDEAS will 
7 Many evaluation commissioners and planners believe that evaluation consists 
in verifying the compliance between what happens on the ground and the original 
objectives spelled out in the project logframe, with almost no reference to unexpected 
impact. This is what I refer to as the “RBM-ization of the evaluation function” (Tarsilla 
2014b). As a result of such limited interpretation of evaluation objectives, the risk is 
that evaluation could become highly centralized, with little room left for conducting 
independent and equity-based evaluations of programs and policies.
<<<PAGE=121>>>
Chapter 6. From Evaluation Capacity Building to Evaluation Capacity Development -A Paradigm Shift  99
increasingly promote critical publications, blogs, and online discus-
sions on the IDEAS website or on LinkedIn, as a way to promote a 
more exhaustive definition of the evaluation function. 
CONCLUSION
This chapter encourages funders as well as practitioners to rethink the way 
they plan, implement, and evaluate capacity development efforts. Based on 
a review of existing gaps in contemporary capacity-building practices in the 
evaluation arena, this chapter calls on all international development actors 
globally: to adopt a more contextually relevant, adaptive, equitable, inclusive, 
and democratic definition of ECD; to conduct more exhaustive diagnostics of 
both capacity and processes among the organizations and entities targeted 
by their ECD strategies; and to assess the distribution of power and resources 
within the systems where ECD strategies are expected to be implemented. 
Lastly, by documenting the current IDEAS initiatives that are aimed at main-
taining and promoting evaluation capacity at several levels (national, regional, 
and global), this chapter attests to the association’s leadership in the ECD 
arena.

and Tara Devi Gurung
Abstract . This chapter describes a mentoring program the International Development 
Evaluation Association (IDEAS) is implementing to support emerging evaluators. Build-

Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
104
chapter offers conclusions drawn from discussions about the pilot mentoring program, 
and what it portends for young and emerging evaluators, especially in the Global 
South, as they position themselves in readiness for the evaluation of the Sustainable 
Development Goals.
E
merging evaluators often lack the portfolio of experience required of 
professionals. One solution to this challenge lies in strengthening the 
professional capacity and credibility of less experienced evaluators. The 
International Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS) is piloting a men-
toring program for young and emerging evaluators to create opportunities to 
help them build specific professional skills.
Many young evaluators, as well as those entering the field in a career 
shift, are disadvantaged in terms of consultancy and job placement because 
of a lack of experience. Over the past decade, mentoring has proliferated as 
an intervention strategy for addressing the needs of young people for adult 
support and guidance throughout their career development. This chapter 
draws on experiences shared at a panel discussion at the Global Assembly of 
IDEAS in Bangkok in October 2015. The specific aims of this discussion were 
to allow young and emerging evaluators to share some of the challenges 
they are experiencing as they enter the evaluation profession; to brainstorm 
on how context-specific challenges can be addressed in such a way as to set 
emerging evaluators on a stable footing in the profession; and to share best 
practices from across the continents so that emerging evaluators can learn 
from the challenges of others, and how they have been addressed.
There is ample evidence of the positive contribution of mentoring to 
improvement in skills development, social and professional competence, and 
intellectual development, as well as the development of the vocational skills 
needed for professionalization of the evaluation discipline, while positioning 
mentees for professional satisfaction in their practices.
IDEAS REACHING OUT TO YOUTH 
IDEAS is a global membership organization focused on the evaluation of 
development that brings together evaluation practitioners from all the 
corners of the world to help develop their professional skills while enhanc -
ing networking among members and recruiting others into the evaluation 
profession. In order to promote the inclusion of youth, IDEAS has initiated 
a youth membership category for evaluators up to age 30, with a reduced 
annual fee. The mentoring program is to be spearheaded by young evaluators 
themselves, under the guidance of senior evaluators as mentors.
ABOUT EMERGING EVALUATORS
Emerging evaluators often lack the portfolio of experience that is required 
by potential employers and the commissioners of consultancy assignments 
during the hiring process. One possible solution for enhancing the skills set 
and credibility of less experienced evaluators involves the establishment of
<<<PAGE=127>>>
Chapter 7. Mentoring Emerging Evaluators - Sharing Experiences from the Global South   105
a mentoring scheme that pairs emerging evaluators with more experienced 
counterparts. Established evaluators are able to mentor upcoming evaluators 
in various ways, including working with them on assignments. Through involv-
ing youth in evaluation, we are also enhancing their individual development 
and encouraging their active involvement in decisions that will affect their 
lives. The strategy involves setting up partnerships with development orga-
nizations globally in order to create opportunities for students and youth 
evaluators to benefit from the advice of senior evaluators, and give them the 
hands-on experience they need to build specific professional skills. A strategy 
known as reverse mentorship will also be employed, in which youth evalua-
tors will mentor older members in new and emerging trends in development 
evaluation, including but not limited to the use of digital technology and 
social media.
THE CONCEPT OF MENTORING
Mentoring programs for youth are commonplace in today’s society: more 
than 5,000 such programs in the United States serve an estimated 3 million 
young people (MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership 2006, as quoted in 
DuBois et al. 2011). In a typical program, each youth is paired with a volunteer 
from the community, with the aim of cultivating a relationship that will foster 
the young person’s positive development and wellbeing (DuBois et al. 2011).
A mentoring relationship is most often defined as a professional 
relationship in which an experienced person (the mentor) assists a less-ex -
perienced person (the mentee) in developing specific skills and knowledge 
that will enhance the mentee’s professional and personal growth. Evaluators 
are educators: their success is judged by what others can learn from their 
work. Mentoring is generally viewed as one component of a more compre-
hensive youth development strategy: these strategies can help youth gain the 
competencies they need to meet the challenges of adolescence and become 
successful adults (Foster 2001).
Over the past decade, mentoring has proliferated as an intervention 
strategy for addressing the needs of young people for adult support and 
guidance in the development of their careers. Widespread expansion of 
youth mentoring programs in the United States was inspired by the release 
of a report on an evaluation of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a 
community-based mentoring program. Findings from this research provided 
evidence of associations between mentoring and a range of positive youth 
outcomes, and were widely embraced by policy makers and practitioners 
(Tierney, Grossman, and Resch 1995). Sharing experiences is a way of build -
ing community, highlighting commonalities, engaging in practices of cathartic 
release, and often shining light on other matters that might otherwise remain 
hidden. To share experiences is to articulate them, and to articulate them is to 
gain power over them, rather than to feel “stuck” (Vallabha 2015).
As human beings, we live in social groups where we learn our norms, 
values, and behaviors by the example and coaching of others. Mentoring 
happens in all organizations, whether it is fostered as a development strat -
egy or encouraged as an informal process. People are constantly learning

106
from others, adopting modeled behaviors and attitudes, and absorbing the 
culture and perceived values of the organization or professional environment 
through their personal interactions with other members of the organization.
In the context of the IDEAS mentoring program, it is not age alone that 
affects the relationship between a mentor and a mentee. A mentee may be 
older, but changing careers. Or he or she might be an experienced evaluator 
who needs help learning how to use qualitative analysis software from a 
colleague who has experience with this skill.
DEVELOPING THE CASE FOR MENTORING:  
ESTABLISHING THE EVIDENCE
Because individuals may experience mentoring at various life stages, it is not 
surprising that there are three distinct streams of mentoring: youth mentor -
ing; academic mentoring; and workplace mentoring. Youth mentoring involves 
a relationship between a caring, supportive adult and a child or adolescent 
(Rhodes 2002).
Mentee motivation and involvement in the evaluation profession may 
be greatly influenced by mentoring. Role modeling can expose mentees to 
the field of evaluation and to social opportunities that can open their eyes to 
different possibilities and motivate them to seek out new experiences. Those 
who have been mentored are more likely to see the need to go the extra mile 
in order to be fully engrossed in the profession: this can involve many differ-
ent matters currently under debate regarding professionalization, including 
certification and accreditation, as well as other forms of recognition.
A mentoring relationship can promote career success. Mentors can 
impart specific knowledge and expertise that contributes to mentee learning 
and skill development (Eby et al. 2008; Kram 1985). Mentors can also facili-
tate professional networking by introducing mentees to influential individuals 
within academic and organizational contexts: these important career contacts 
can in turn lead to career success in terms of salary, promotions, and job 
offers (Kram 1985). Anecdotal evidence abounds of those who have been 
successful in evaluation practice as a result of the networking and informal 
mentoring they have received through working with more advanced or senior 
evaluators. This certainly is a positive step toward professionalizing not only 
the individual, but the discipline as well.
A study of youth development interventions concluded that a wide 
range of youth development approaches, including mentoring, result in 
positive behavioral changes, such as improved interpersonal skills and rela-
tionships, and increased self-control and academic achievement (Foster 
2001). For example, the mentored professional will most certainly see the 
need to pursue academic or professional courses that are geared toward 
building their capacity in evaluation.
At IDEAS, the emphasis is on workplace mentoring, which occurs 
in an organizational setting, and the purpose of which is the personal and 
professional growth of the mentee (Kram 1985). The mentor may be a super-
visor; someone within the organization who is outside the mentee’s chain of 
command; or an individual in another organization (Eby 1997). Mentoring at
<<<PAGE=129>>>
Chapter 7. Mentoring Emerging Evaluators - Sharing Experiences from the Global South   107
different developmental stages tends to serve different functions or pur -
poses. Youth mentoring is often aimed at reducing risky behavior, or improving 
social and academic functioning; academic mentoring tends to target student 
retention, academic performance, and adjustment to college life; while work-
place mentoring aims to enhance the personal and career development of 
employees (Eby et al. 2008).
A study of the top 200 executives in 50 large U.S. companies revealed 
that mentoring is one of the most effective tools in personnel development 
(Chambers et al. 1998). Another study, by the Institute of Management, involv-
ing 1,500 U.K. managers revealed that mentoring is one of the two most 
powerful leadership development tools used in organizations. It has also been 
reported that 71 percent of Fortune 500 and private companies use mentoring 
in their organizations, and that 77 percent of U.S. companies surveyed said that 
mentoring had improved both the retention and performance of employees.
1
In addition to correlations with higher educational aspirations, the 
research shows that mentoring is correlated with other positive develop-
mental outcomes, including changing attitudes (higher self-esteem, and 
stronger relationships with adults, including with teachers and peers) and 
better behavior (Bruce and Bridgeland 2014). In 2002, DuBois and colleagues 
published a meta-analytic synthesis of findings from 55 evaluations of youth 
mentoring programs that had been published through 1998 (DuBois et al. 
2002). These findings indicated that, on average, youth participating in men-
toring programs had benefited significantly in each of five outcome domains: 
emotional/psychological, problem/high-risk behavior, social competence, aca-
demic/educational, and career/employment (DuBois et al. 2002, 2011).
Studies have shown that many young adults are entering the labor 
force without even the limited skills that are necessary to attain a job in 
the first place, such as interviewing skills, conflict resolution, and effective 
communication (Eccles and Gootman 2002). Mentoring has been linked 
with a myriad of intellectual skills and development, including good deci-
sion-making skills, in-depth knowledge of more than one culture, knowledge 
of both essential life skills and vocational skills, and rational habits of mind, 
such as critical thinking and reasoning skills. One study found that nearly all 
young adults who had formal mentoring relationships (95 percent) found 
these experiences to be “helpful,” half of which (51 percent) found the rela-
tionship to be “very helpful.” Similarly, nearly all youth in informal mentoring 
relationships (99 percent) said their experience was “helpful,” seven in 10 
(69 percent) reporting it as “very helpful” (Bruce and Bridgeland 2014).
All of these studies can be summed up in one statement: there is 
ample evidence of the positive contribution of mentoring to improvement 
in skills development, social and professional competence, and intellectual 
development, as well as the development of the vocational skills that are 
needed for professionalization of the discipline: it also positions mentees for 
professional satisfaction in the practice.

WHAT IS THE ADDED VALUE OF A  
MENTORING PROGRAM FOR IDEAS?
Organizations recognize that workforce demographics have changed dramat-
ically in recent years. Youth are becoming employed in large numbers, thanks 
to the global youth bulge. More and more graduates are joining the work -
force as junior professionals in evaluation practice, while some are developing 
interest in the profession while they are still in university. There is a need to 
provide sufficient growth opportunities for potential future professionals in 
the practice. Senior evaluators also need to be mentored in new and emerging 
evaluation methodologies, including the use of digital technology and social 
media: they could benefit from the proposed reverse-mentoring program.
These are the potential benefits of the IDEAS mentoring program for 
the organization:
 n Recruitment of new members to the organization and discovery of 
talent
 n Development of leadership for the future survival and prosperity 
of IDEAS
 n Communication of values, goals, and plans of the organization 
globally
 n Demonstration of personal and professional standards among 
members
 n Implementation of equity initiatives 
 n Fostering of shared values and teamwork 
 n Building a strong global learning organization in evaluation practice
 n Development of cross-organizational networks
 n Increase in morale and motivation among both junior and senior 
professionals
DEVELOPMENT OF A MENTORING PROGRAM
The IDEAS Board has appointed a mentoring program coordinator, who pro-
posed the program. The program coordinator then formed a task force of 
five people, which has been approved by the Board to develop the mentoring 
program policy, as well as to oversee its implementation. Members of the 
task force represent a cross-section of the organization, including potential 
mentors and mentees, as well as stakeholders who bring value to the process. 
The duties of the task force include the following:
 n Determining the goals of the program
 n Choosing the proper mentoring model
 n Developing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) template for 
the mentoring partnership
 n Negotiating the MOU with major institutions commissioning devel -
opment evaluations
 n Selecting eligible evaluation training programs/institutions
 n Defining criteria for mentors and mentees
<<<PAGE=131>>>
Chapter 7. Mentoring Emerging Evaluators - Sharing Experiences from the Global South   109
 n Defining other critical components of the program
 n Matching the participants
 n Monitoring the pilot
 n Evaluating the results at the end of the pilot program
The mentoring panel at the Global Assembly was sponsored by the 
U.K. Department of International Development (DFID), among others, but no 
other funds could be raised. Thus, many of the more ambitious plans turned 
out to be unrealistic. Similar initiatives in the European Evaluation Society and 
the American Evaluation Association were largely voluntary in nature; this 
seems to be a more realistic way forward for IDEAS as well. 
PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF  
THE IDEAS MENTORING PROGRAM
The mentoring program at IDEAS aims to achieve the following: 
 n Induction and skills enhancement . Helps new members settle 
into the organization; facilitates potential and skill development 
for new members, both young evaluators and those just entering 
a career in evaluation; seeks to enable skills to be passed on by 
experienced, highly competent professionals to others who need to 
develop specific skills.
 n Networking and career development . Helps both mentors and 
mentees in the planning, development, and management of their 
careers; helps them become more resilient in times of change; 
and more self-reliant in their careers. Offers young professionals 
visibility and the opportunity for networking, which helps them to 
explore and plan their career pathways. Also helps both mentors 
and mentees gain a greater awareness of opportunities and activi-
ties that can broaden their professional experience.
 n Education support and practical orientation . Helps bridge the 
gap between theory and practice; complements formal education 
and training through sharing the knowledge and hands-on experi-
ence of competent practitioners. Offers mentees the opportunity to 
acquire new knowledge and skills by observing and understanding 
the mentor’s practical experience. 
 n Leadership and development of competencies . Encourages the 
development of leadership and professional competencies that are 
more easily gained through example, guided practice, or experience 
than through theoretical education and training.
 n Global visibility and organizational development . Will expand 
IDEA’s culture of cooperation and commitment through sharing the 
values, vision, and mission of the organization, and will give IDEAS 
an enhanced visibility globally.
The program proposes the following models of mentoring:
<<<PAGE=132>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
110
 n One-to-one mentoring—matches one mentor with one mentee
 n Group mentoring—assigns one mentor to work with several 
mentees
 n Team mentoring—involves more than one person working with 
the same mentee
 n Computer online mentoring—uses computer-based opportunities 
to develop relationships through online communication
 n Peer mentoring—young people experienced in evaluation mentor 
other young people who are just entering the evaluation profession
In order to realize and sustain the program, IDEAS needs to find mech-
anisms for arranging mentoring on a voluntary basis, without giving up on the 
effort to mobilize resources for the program that are needed for purchasing 
mentoring software; covering the administrative costs for staff managing the 
program; and the costs of training for mentors and mentees, among other 
things. There will also be a need to provide mentors with formal recogni-
tion for all they do for young and emerging evaluators. This recognition can 
take many forms, such as awards—for example designating a mentor/mentee 
match of the year—as well as gifts and/or letters of appreciation. 
Three of the case studies presented at the Global Assembly in Bangkok 
in October 2015 are summarized below.
NIGERIA CASE STUDY
In a presentation titled “Evaluation Capacity Development for Emerging Eval-
uators: A Nigerian Experience,” Taiwo Peter Adesoba observed that describing 
an emerging evaluator is sometimes a tricky task, because there seems to 
be no globally agreed-upon definition in terms of age, educational require-
ments, job experience, and so on. Just as a plant has hurdles to overcome 
when emerging from the soil, so emerging evaluators have particular needs 
while they are trying to establish themselves in the evaluation profession. A 
major challenge for young evaluators, especially in low- and middle-income 
countries, is weak evaluation capacity, which leads to their exclusion from 
evaluation activities. With the growing number of youth-led organizations, 
especially in Africa and Asia, more attention is being given to the monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) components of their projects. Young development pro-
fessionals are keenly interested in evaluating the impact of their own work: 
the demand for accountability from policy makers and other project imple-
menters in their communities is also a factor. Although young evaluators are 
passionate about implementing evaluation assignments, the technical skills 
required to properly fulfill this passion is poor. This makes evaluation capacity 
development (ECD) a necessity for young and emerging evaluators.
The ECD Project in Nigeria is targeted at young evaluators aged 18-30 
with less than two years’ experience in M&E. The project was conceptualized 
following a survey among young evaluators in which about 81 percent of 
respondents said they had never had formal training in M&E: 92 percent of 
them did not belong to any voluntary organizations for professional evalu-
ation (VOPEs), and 100 percent of them said they needed mentoring. The
<<<PAGE=133>>>
Chapter 7. Mentoring Emerging Evaluators - Sharing Experiences from the Global South   111
objectives of ECD programs are to improve youth inclusion not only in project 
implementation, but in its evaluation; to promote and advance the practice 
of the evaluation profession; and to increase youth participation in decision 
making for sustainable development. The participants in the first phase of 
the ECD were 24 (7 males; 17 females) emerging evaluators ranging from 
21 to 33 years who work for local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in 
the Ondo and Ekiti states. They take on M&E roles in their organizations, but 
have only limited experience. About 20 percent of the trainees had attended 
M&E training previously. None of them belonged to any VOPEs in Nigeria, and 
many had never attended an evaluation conference. The ECD covered the 
basics of M&E, and its application to their organizations’ projects.
Some of the lessons learned during the two-day training were tailored 
toward the project areas of the trainees. Assignments and group work were 
aimed at the areas of HIV prevention, economic empowerment, and gender 
programs. After two days of intensive training, group work, and discussions, 
the participants showed a good understanding of the basics of M&E. Some 
have gone on to find online evaluation webinars, and two of the trainees 
have gotten internship opportunities with NGOs in other parts of the country. 
However, better results could be achieved if the trained young evaluators had 
access to mentors who could provide them with additional guidance.
Adesoba concluded that capacity development of emerging evaluators 
for sustainable development will bring about better results if well-quali-
fied evaluation professionals are available to provide on-the-job mentoring, 
through either short-term internships or evaluation job placements.
THE MIDDLE EAST AND EURASIA:  
SAVE THE CHILDREN CASE STUDY
In his presentation “The Future of Evaluation,” Ahmed Tammam discussed 
the challenges faced by emerging evaluators in the Middle East and Eurasia 
(MEE) region. He observed that M&E is a critical component in the advance-
ment of evidence-based interventions, and that it consequently enhances 
efficiency, transparency, and accountability. Evaluation is a profession, and 
grooming new leadership for the future of this profession is needed: thus, 
investment in developing the capacities of young evaluators is an emerging 
priority.
Tammam noted that the evaluation profession is far ranging. Therefore, 
support from experienced evaluators is key in order for young evaluators to 
advance in such a robust profession, which has so many specific and different 
areas of work. Evaluation is a growing career path, but visibility, employment, 
and networking opportunities can be very limited for young evaluators.
He further noted that talented young evaluators in the MEE region 
are increasingly lobbying donors to fund only successes, and described a 
case study of Save the Children in the MEE region as an example. Save the 
Children is a child rights–based organization, working in 12 countries in the 
Middle East and Eurasia, with operations that support children in devel -
opmental contexts (as in Egypt and Georgia), as well as in an emergency 
contexts (as in Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen). With the expansion of needs in the
<<<PAGE=134>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
112
region and the limitation of resources, there is a push to focus only on what 
works best for children. Consequently, there is a need for effective evaluation, 
and thus for evaluators.
In 2014, the program quality department of Save the Children at the 
MEE regional office began a process of investing in the talents of local emerg-
ing evaluators by recruiting an evaluator from a country office to manage 
the M&E tasks on the regional level. One of the mandates of the recruited 
evaluator was to begin to establish a cadre of talented young evaluators. A 
capacity-building process for emerging young evaluators was undertaken, pro-
moting intra-learning and providing opportunities for these individuals to gain 
more knowledge and enhance their experience as emerging evaluators. This 
interactive learning program was mentored by senior program-quality staff 
who helped the emerging evaluators map the real needs in their countries.
As a result, an interactive mapping exercise of local M&E needs and 
capacities was conducted by the emerging evaluators, and a regional think 
tank was created. Through this process all of the young evaluators gained 
on-the-job experience. Two of them offered to support other country offices; 
another five were given the authority to be part of the operationalization 
process of the Vision and Position Paper of the Eurasia region (Albania, 
Armenia, Georgia, Kosovo, and the Northwest Balkans), which aims to align 
the efforts of five countries to work together on subregional programs in 
order to maximize benefits for children and to efficiently utilize the limited 
funding opportunities, by pushing donors to fund success.
In conclusion, Tammam noted that strengthening young and emerging 
evaluators through enhancing the learning environment and providing oppor-
tunities for mentorship are key not only to developing the young evaluators’ 
future, but the future of the evaluation profession as well.
NEPAL CASE STUDY
Tara Devi Gurung presented a case based on her anecdotal experience as 
an emerging evaluator in Nepal, and also from a desk review of the avail -
able literature about development evaluation, and the role of the young and 
emerging evaluators in Nepal.
In her presentation, “Evaluation Challenges and Opportunity for Emerg-
ing Evaluators: A Nepalese Experience/Case,” Gurung noted that evaluation, 
which assesses the results of policies, programs, and projects, is an integral 
part of the development process. Evaluation is particularly critical in the 
context of Nepal, which has a complex social structure, a high poverty rate, 
gender discrimination, dynamic forces of globalization sweeping traditional 
societies, and numerous development projects aimed at the population. 
These factors, in addition to greater competition for limited resources avail -
able for international development are pushing donors, program participants, 
and evaluators to seek more rigorous, but still flexible, systems for monitor -
ing and evaluating development and humanitarian interventions. 
Many of the current approaches to evaluation are unable to address 
the changing structure of development assistance, and the increasingly 
complex environment in which it operates. Innovative evaluation approaches
<<<PAGE=135>>>
Chapter 7. Mentoring Emerging Evaluators - Sharing Experiences from the Global South   113
and practices are particularly important in such situations. However, it is chal-
lenging for emerging evaluators to carry out innovative evaluation, since this 
calls for a high level of expertise. 
Emerging evaluators are those who have recently joined the profession 
and have limited experience. They are not necessarily young, although most of 
them are relatively young. Many of them are disadvantaged in terms of con-
sultancy and job placement because they lack sufficient experience. There are 
only limited forums for sharing and disseminating best practices; developing 
quality and ethical protocols; enhancing the capacity of new evaluators; and 
researching evaluations. There are limited resources for evaluation that col -
lects lessons drawn from evaluations around the world; produces knowledge 
through research undertakings; and supports the development of curricula 
for and carries out basic and advanced training in evaluation. Moreover, there 
is no academic institution in Nepal that offers a university degree in evalua-
tion. Lack of specific acts, rules, and regulations for evaluation has posed even 
more challenges for evaluators in Nepal. Available guidelines focus only on 
governmental M&E, and do not cover other sectors. 
In this context, it is difficult to raise funds for evaluation research, 
capacity building, and activities related to the promotion of evaluation in 
Nepal. The funding agencies have a tendency to support already established 
organizations and firms rather than new evaluators. Often the potential for 
innovation, and the expertise of emerging evaluators, are overlooked by the 
commissioners of evaluations. Better representation, and the active engage-
ment of young and new evaluators in the decision-making process are needed 
in order to bring their ideas and perspectives into evaluation. 
Gurung concluded that effective evaluation is crucial in order to assess 
the progress and impact of the efforts of the government policy to “Build a 
New Nepal” through accelerated development inclusive of all castes, ethnic 
groups, and genders. Evaluation is gradually becoming an integral part of 
development plans, projects, and emergency operations in Nepal. Gurung 
predicts that this will lead to a rise in skilled evaluators, including emerging 
evaluators in the near future.
CONCLUSION
The IDEAS mentoring program aims to enhance induction and skills develop-
ment, networking and career development, education support and practical 
orientation, leadership and competencies development, global visibility, and 
organizational development for young and emerging evaluators.
Mentoring at a variety of developmental stages tends to serve dif -
ferent functions or purposes. Workplace mentoring is aimed at enhancing 
employees’ personal and career development: this is the kind of mentoring 
that IDEAS is piloting. In general, mentoring has been linked with a myriad 
of intellectual skills and development, including good decision-making skills, 
in-depth knowledge of more than one culture, knowledge of both essential 
life skills and vocational skills, and rational habits of mind such as critical think-
ing and reasoning skills. There is ample evidence of the positive contribution 
of mentoring to improvement in skills development, social and professional

competence, and intellectual development, as well as the development of 
the vocational skills that are needed for professionalization of the evaluation 
discipline, while also positioning mentees for professional satisfaction in their 
practices.
Studies have shown that, among other benefits, youth participating 
in mentoring programs have benefited significantly in social competence, 
academic and educational progression, as well as career or employment 
advancement. The three cases discussed in this chapter demonstrate that 
there is a country-level need for supporting young and emerging evaluators 
through mentoring in order to advance their professional competence and 
career prospects. These cases demonstrate further that capacity develop-
ment of emerging evaluators will ensure that more well-qualified evaluation 
professionals are available to provide on-the-job mentoring through short-
term internships or evaluation job placements. They also demonstrate that 
strengthening young and emerging evaluators through enhancing the learn-
ing environment, and providing opportunities for mentorship are key, not only 
to developing the future of young evaluators, but for the future of evaluation 
as a profession in general. Overall therefore, these studies build a strong 
business case for the mentoring of young and emerging evaluators.

Evaluating Sustainable 
Development in SIDS -  
Lessons from the Pacific  
and the Caribbean
Juha I. Uitto, Jeremy Kohlitz, and David Todd
Abstract . Small island developing states (SIDS) are particularly vulnerable to envi-
ronmental stresses, and especially to the impacts of climate change. This is due to 
numerous factors, including limited geographic size and extensive coastal areas; remote 
locations; fragile economies that are often dependent on narrow sectors; limited 
natural resources and access to fresh water and energy; small populations; and weak 
institutional capacity. Managing sustainable development requires coherent and effec -
tive policies and strategies. An essential part of the formulation and implementation 
of such policies and strategies is effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Evaluation 
is also needed to ensure that interventions, policies, and strategies are achieving their 
goals and contributing to sustainable development. This chapter reviews experiences 
with M&E in the Pacific and Caribbean SIDS. It identifies a number of challenges that

need to be overcome, including limited human and institutional capacities, and the per-
ception that evaluation is only important for donor-funded programs, which results in 
low priority being given to M&E. These challenges are best addressed by crafting M&E 
systems that are appropriate for a variety of SIDS contexts, that are country led, and 
that are supported by external agencies in a coherent manner.
S
mall island developing states (SIDS) are facing unique and often severe 
challenges to sustainable development. Their small size in terms of geog-
raphy, economy, and population, and their limited capacities render them 
vulnerable to external shocks. The age-old limitations pertaining to natural 
resources, water, energy, and waste management have been exacerbated by 
global environmental change. Although their role in causing climate change 
has been minimal, they are at the frontlines of facing its impacts. Conse-
quences ranging from increased weather variability and intensified storms 
to sea-level rise and salinization of groundwater pose serious threats to the 
sustainability of SIDS.
There are 57 countries classified by the United Nations (UN) as SIDS.
1 
Most of them are located in the Caribbean and Pacific regions, but a number 
of them can also be found elsewhere—in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, in 
the Mediterranean, and in the South China Sea. The UN has long recognized 
the special development situation of SIDS. The Barbados Programme of 
Action (BPOA), adopted in 1994 at the Global Conference on the Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States, identified the unique nature 
of the vulnerabilities and characteristics of SIDS, including their small size, 
remoteness, and narrow resource and export base, as well as their exposure 
to global environmental challenges and to external economic shocks (UN 
1994). Since then, a series of conferences under UN auspices has focused 
on devising concrete ways to further sustainable development in SIDS. For 
example, the 2005 Mauritius Strategy of Implementation (MSI) built upon the 
BPOA.
2 In 2014, the Third International Conference on SIDS was held in Apia, 
Samoa, and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathways 
was adopted.
3 Similarly, global processes have taken special note of the sit -
uation of SIDS. The 2012 UN report on “The Future We Want” dedicated a 
section to SIDS, noting that “small island developing States have made less 
progress than most other groupings, or even regressed, in economic terms 
especially in terms of poverty reduction and debt sustainability,” with member 
states reaffirming their commitment to providing assistance to implementing 
BPOA and MSI (UN 2012).
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the UN 
member states in 2015, also focused on the specific plight of SIDS, especially 
in terms of climate change and associated issues related to sea-level rise,

ocean acidification, and other impacts that are particularly affecting low-lying 
countries and coastal areas (UN 2015b). The attendant Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals (SDGs), in particular Goal 13 (Climate Action) and Goal 14 (Life 
Below Water), are specifically relevant to SIDS. One of the challenges facing 
SIDS pertains to their generally limited capacities in terms of human and insti-
tutional resources. Consequently, the SDGs also call for “raising capacity for 
effective climate change-related planning and management.”

Effective implementation of sustainable development strategies calls 
for effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in order to determine that 
processes are on track and that interventions, policies, and strategies are 
leading to desired change. Evaluating sustainable development in SIDS must 
take into account the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, while 
dealing with the considerable risk and uncertainties caused by global climate 
change, as well as possible discontinuities and tipping points in environmental 
trends. 
Establishing effective M&E systems requires systematic effort and 
overcoming capacity constraints. An evaluation conducted by the Global Envi-
ronment Facility Independent Evaluation Office (GEF IEO) in the Pacific found 
that all GEF projects have M&E protocols, and that the systems have been 
used effectively for adaptive management in the context of the projects. Yet 
institutionalizing M&E within the regular operations of the involved ministries 
and departments has proven challenging, primarily due to limited capacity 
(GEF IEO 2015). An evaluation in the Caribbean had similar conclusions: while 
project-level M&E has improved over time and has clearly contributed to 
adaptive management, environmental monitoring and the assessment of 
impact-level results have been extraordinarily challenging (GEF IEO 2012a). 
The reasons for this include a lack of baseline data as well as systematic 
monitoring data for assessing environmental trends over time. Other evalu-
ations confirm these findings. For instance, in Timor-Leste and Jamaica, M&E 
has played a very limited role in managing the GEF portfolio and in providing 
environmental data to aid decision making (GEF IEO 2012b, 2012c).
As is evident from the analysis that follows, a number of factors 
hamper institutionalizing M&E in SIDS. One is simply the small size of govern-
ments and their capacities, combined with the fact that M&E is often seen as 
an external requirement related to donor-funded projects, thus rendering it 
low on the list of priorities. There are also significant challenges pertaining to 
data availability and the capacity to collect relevant data.
This chapter draws upon experiences in monitoring and evaluating 
sustainable development in the Pacific and Caribbean SIDS. It focuses on sys-
temic and capacity constraints that need to be addressed in order to make 
M&E a useful tool for governments. In particular, evaluation is often seen 
mostly as being imposed by donor-funded projects or by regional organi-
zations. It is important to overcome this perception in order to increase the 
utility of evaluation in these regions.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN SIDS IN THE ERA OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE
Recognition of the specific vulnerabilities of SIDS is not particularly new. In 
1994, UNESCO’s Island Agenda asked rhetorically, “Is Paradise an island?” 
(UNESCO 1994, 8), and outlined the various challenges facing small islands, 
ranging from small and subsistence economies to cultural issues and the 
mixed blessings of tourism. The report also identified limited natural 
resources, such as fresh water and energy, and the need for conservation of 
coastal and marine systems and unique island biodiversity as significant con-
straints to development. Vulnerability to natural disasters, such as cyclones, 
earthquakes, and tsunamis, and sea-level rise were identified as significant 
risks to small islands. Global warming, ocean circulation patterns, and climate 
variability were also mentioned, although at that time they did not yet receive 
major attention (UNESCO 1994). Similarly, the United Nations University 
World Institute for Development Economics Research presented a report 
to the Barbados Global Conference (UNU/WIDER 1995) that focused on 
overlapping issues. A chapter on natural disasters detailed the impacts on 
economic and social infrastructure in SIDS (Obasi 1995). Based on contempo-
rary knowledge, the chapter was careful to note that there was no evidence 
that there had been an increase in tropical cyclones or their intensity due to 
climate change, but it also noted the increased risks associated with sea-level 
rise and its potential impacts on freshwater resources and coral reefs (Obasi 
1995).
As the body of evidence grew, the international scientific community 
became more confident in stating that global climate change posed a major 
threat to low-lying coastal countries everywhere, and SIDS in particular. It 
was noted that SIDS were the first to pay the price for a problem that they 
had hardly contributed to (Pelling and Uitto 2001). Today we read reports of 
the dramatic effects of rising sea levels in island nations. An analysis of aerial 
and satellite images between 1947 and 2014 shows that in the archipelago 
of the Solomon Islands, five islands ranging in size from 1 to 5 hectares have 
already disappeared under rising seas, and another six islands have shrunk by 
20–62 percent (Albert et al. 2016). Research appears to indicate that tropical 
cyclone frequency is decreasing, while the intensity of the storms appears to 
be increasing in ways that may create geomorphological change in the islands 
(Kelman 2016). 
The 2015 United Nations report on SIDS focused exclusively on climate 
change, pulling together data from publicly available sources concerning the 
impacts on island nations (UN 2015a). The report identified serious threats 
to economic sectors that are essential for many islands, notably fisheries 
and marine resources, and tourism. It also highlighted how climate change 
impacts affect the social sector, including public health, food security, migra-
tion and displacement, and natural and cultural heritage. The report noted 
that the average annual losses from climate change are proportionally 
highest in SIDS: it is estimated that annual climate-related losses in Vanuatu 
are about 6.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The cost of inaction 
is also high. If governments decide against any action toward climate change
<<<PAGE=145>>>
Chapter 8. Evaluating Sustainable Development in SIDS - Lessons from the Pacific and the Caribbean   123
adaptation, it is projected that the annual losses in the Caribbean will rise to 
$22 billion—10 percent of the current size of the Caribbean economy—by 
2050. In the Pacific, the total value of infrastructure, buildings, and cash crops 
at risk from climate change is estimated at $111 billion (UN 2015a).
To address the above challenges, reliable data, systematic monitoring, 
and credible evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of policies, as well 
as their impacts, will be crucial. The following sections discuss issues pertain-
ing to evaluation capacities in the Pacific and Caribbean island nations.
PACIFIC SIDS: DEVELOPING NATIONAL EVALUATION 
CAPACITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DIVERSITY
The nature of Pacific SIDS presents a special case for achieving and evaluating 
sustainable development.5 SIDS in the Pacific collectively comprise several 
hundred islands with remarkable geographic, socioeconomic, environmen-
tal, and cultural diversity, spread out over millions of square kilometers of 
the Pacific Ocean. Numerous threats throughout the region that have the 
potential to affect sustainable development include climate change; rapid 
urbanization that is spurring social inequality, deterioration of fragile biodiver-
sity and ecosystem services, fresh water degradation, and resource depletion 
from growing populations (Duncan 2011; UNEP 2014). Furthermore, Pacific 
SIDS are often categorically described as being ill-equipped to face these chal-
lenges due to their remoteness, small size, and limited access to resources. 
However, the degree to which these and other factors affect sustainable 
development and the ability to react to change varies widely from island to 
island. When speaking of sustainable development in SIDS, it is important to 
be mindful that different SIDS face different challenges and opportunities. In 
the first of the following sections, the diversity of Pacific SIDS is emphasized, 
and the implications for evaluation policy are discussed.
Sustainable development requires sustainable evaluation: this is best 
achieved when countries have ownership and control of their own evaluation 
processes, as required by the SDG framework. The governments of Pacific 
SIDS face difficult challenges in owning evaluation: understanding their gov -
ernance structures and processes is an important early step in planning how 
to fit an evaluation system into their specific contexts. The second of the 
following sections outlines the case for local evaluation of sustainable devel-
opment, and provides a brief look at governance structures in Pacific SIDS.
Diversity of Pacific SIDS
A quick glance at geographic and demographic statistics of Pacific SIDS 
reveals stark differences between countries and territories. For example, 
the “small” in “small island developing states” has an indefinite meaning: 
5 The Pacific SIDS are American Samoa, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, 
Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, 
Niue, Northern Marianas, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-
Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
<<<PAGE=146>>>

124
land areas range from more than 450,000 square kilometers in Papua New 
Guinea to just 21 square kilometers in Nauru. The distribution of human set -
tlements also varies widely, with the majority of Palauans and Marshallese 
living in central urban areas, whereas more than 70 percent of Ni-Vanuatu 
and Solomon Islanders live in rural areas spread across dozens of islands. 
People living on large volcanic islands often depend heavily on surface 
water sources and their associated ecosystems, while these do not exist on 
small atolls, where people depend instead on coastal and lagoon ecosys-
tem services.
Levels of social and economic development also differ substantially. 
Five Pacific SIDS are classified by the UN as least developed countries—that 
is, countries that exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development. 
Meanwhile, some territories, such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia, are 
relatively developed, with a per capita GDP close to that of New Zealand.
Evaluation policy toward sustainable development in Pacific SIDS 
must be flexible enough to respond effectively to the variety of settings in 
which they exist. This requires representation from each of the Pacific SIDS 
so that they can explain their sustainable development objectives, and learn 
how evaluation resources can be made available to them, and used coher -
ently. Fortunately, multiple sustainable development agendas for SIDS have 
already been put forward (e.g., BPOA, MSI, and the SAMOA Pathway), and 
attempts are being made to improve the platforms for regional cooperation 
in the Pacific, for example with the Pacific Plan and the Melanesian Spearhead 
Group (Pacific Plan Review 2013). These are useful entry points for the inter-
national evaluation community to promote and support the implementation 
of evaluation systems. These sustainable development agendas and regional 
platforms currently highlight the importance of evaluation, but there is room 
for more operationalization in the context of individual SIDS. 
One evaluation challenge unique to some SIDS is the small size of 
governments. Pacific SIDS with very small population numbers often struggle 
to assess and report on all of the indicators set by external agencies. Human 
resources may be limited by the small number of government staff, or by a 
“brain drain” problem, as in the Cook Islands and Niue, whose inhabitants are 
automatically granted citizenship in developed countries that offer better 
economic opportunities. Careful thought must be given to prioritizing those 
SDG targets and indicators that can realistically be monitored.
Despite great diversity across Pacific SIDS, they do share important 
cultural characteristics that must be respected by external agencies that are 
looking to build their capacity for evaluation. Pacific SIDS have some of the 
highest levels of indigenous populations in the world, and among these pop-
ulations, collectivist values are strongly maintained (Koshy, Mataki, and Lal 
2011). As a result, many Pacific islanders strive toward achieving harmony, 
respect, risk avoidance, and loyalty within institutions even at the expense 
of efficiency and assertiveness as valued by Western institutions. There is a 
need to build capacity for evaluation in Pacific SIDS, but external facilitators 
must be sensitive to the way indigenous values affect the willingness and 
preferences of the islanders to develop this capacity. (For in-depth discussion 
of this topic, see Rhodes 2014).

Chapter 8. Evaluating Sustainable Development in SIDS - Lessons from the Pacific and the Caribbean   125
Strengthening Government Capacity for Evaluation
Evaluation is more likely to be sustainable if the governments of SIDS are 
put in control of the evaluation processes and systems. Country- or govern-
ment-led, as opposed to donor-led, evaluation is believed to help create a 
culture of evidence-based decision making, and to better reflect the infor -
mation needs and values of the country stakeholders (Segone 2009). 
Establishing a sense of ownership over the systems can also help motivate 
government authorities to maintain evaluation processes, and to apply the 
results.
With respect to sustainable development, there are additional reasons 
to encourage government-led evaluation. First, not all sustainable develop-
ment efforts are driven and funded by donors. For example, Pacific SIDS 
generally take the threat of climate change very seriously, and have their 
own sustainable adaptation initiatives and the associated information needs. 
Governments of Pacific SIDS should be supported in developing evaluation 
systems that they can use for their own endogenous purposes. Next, the 
social, economic, and environmental dimensions that make up sustainable 
development are adaptive and constantly changing. Unlike time-bound bilat -
eral and multilateral programs, government is a permanent fixture, and it is in 
a better position to assess levels of sustainability over long periods of time if 
monitoring mechanisms are institutionalized.
Most sustainable development agendas influencing Pacific SIDS are 
conceptualized at the national or international levels, but governments will 
also need to think locally. Understanding interactions between human and 
environmental systems is key to assessing and evaluating sustainability (Rowe 
2012), but these interactions are often highly context-specific. Therefore, in 
addition to top-down evaluation strategies, bottom-up strategies that can 
capture local nuances of sustainability are also needed. It will be beneficial to 
consider how local government in Pacific SIDS can be included and strength-
ened to fill this need.
Many Pacific SIDS governments have adopted decentralization policies, 
and several have constitutional provisions for local government. The scale 
of local government that exists varies widely (Hassall and Tipu 2008). In the 
Solomon Islands the local government is only decentralized to the level of 
provincial and municipal councils each of which currently oversee only tens 
of thousands of people. Meanwhile, individual islands and island groups in 
Kiribati have their own councils, some of which may oversee as little as a few 
hundred people. Some of the larger Melanesian SIDS have tiered national/
regional/local government structures, while all government is maintained 
centrally in microstates like Niue and Nauru. Consideration of potential M&E 
responsibilities, and the mapping of the potential flow of information through 
disparate government structures is an important early step in assessing the 
potential for a comprehensive evaluation system.
Another interesting aspect of Pacific SIDS is that traditional or cus-
tomary governance systems that date back to precolonial times are often 
blended with democratic governance systems and empowered through 
legislation (Hassall and Tipu 2008; Hassall et al. 2011). For example,
<<<PAGE=148>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
126
village councils composed of the heads of extended families are granted 
administrative power by the state in Samoa. In Tuvalu, elected local offi-
cials are accountable to a traditional assembly of elders who are given 
power by the state to oversee local affairs. These cases offer interesting 
opportunities for evaluation at the local level because the methods of 
inquiry could coalesce with traditional forms of engagement to produce 
rich, useful data that otherwise might be missed by top-down national 
approaches.
In order for evaluation systems to be effective within Pacific SIDS 
governments, they will need to be crafted appropriately to fit a variety 
of contexts, while working within on-the-ground realities. Sustainable 
development is a complex issue that plays out at not just at the global 
and national levels, but also at local levels, where traditional forms of 
governance are still common. Evaluation approaches need to be adaptive 
enough to handle both the complexity and variety found in Pacific SIDS, 
and should respect cultural heritage (Hoey 2015). Furthermore, local 
governments in Pacific SIDS generally are underresourced financially, 
and for the smallest islands this will likely continue for the foreseeable 
future (Hassall and Tipu 2008). The challenge going forward is not just 
to demand more evaluation and to offer training, but to work with Pacific 
SIDS stakeholders to identify which forms of evaluation make sense in 
each of their given contexts.
EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN CARIBBEAN SIDS
The SIDS of the Caribbean are among the world’s most vulnerable countries 
when it comes to the effects of climate change (Todd 2011, 2013; UNFCCC 
2005). This could become critical to their social and economic development, 
as well as to their terrestrial, coastal, and marine environments if no appro-
priate action is taken. Many islands are threatened by increases in the number 
and severity of extreme weather events, rising sea levels and coastal erosion, 
coral bleaching, and damage to biodiversity. At its worst, climate change could 
result in substantial loss of life and the damage to property and infrastruc -
ture that can easily cripple small and fragile economies. The Caribbean SIDS 
comprise a substantial part of the membership of the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM), a regional political and economic grouping of some 20 member 
and associate member states. The World Bank has estimated that about 11 
percent of the total GDP of all 20 CARICOM countries could be adversely 
impacted annually by climate change (Toba 2009; see also IDB 2014; World 
Bank 1997). 
Although the Caribbean SIDS are not high greenhouse gas emitters on 
the world stage, they do have opportunities for climate change mitigation, 
and many countries are pursuing them through such activities as improved 
energy efficiency of buildings; increased production of solar power; the use 
of household equipment such as solar water heaters; and the scaled-up adop-
tion of electric vehicles.

Chapter 8. Evaluating Sustainable Development in SIDS - Lessons from the Pacific and the Caribbean   127
A Common Approach for Increasing Climate Change Resilience, 
Adaptation, and Mitigation among Caribbean SIDS 
In 2009, through the Liliendaal Declaration, 6 CARICOM leaders presented 
their vision of a common regional approach that would enhance resilience 
and adaptation by addressing the threats and challenges of climate change 
on Caribbean society and economy, as well as by providing support for 
mitigation-related policies and measures. This approach will be delivered 
through an overarching regional framework that comprises a set of strategic 
elements, each with defined goals and indicators, which should contribute 
to the achievement of the framework’s overall objectives. Responsibility for 
designing and managing a common M&E system for the regional framework 
and its elements is vested in the Caribbean Community Centre for Climate 
Change (CCCCC), based in Belize. 
The common approach is made up of five strategic elements that 
embody the key objectives contributing to the longer-term goal of building 
regional resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change:
 n Strategic Element 1 . Mainstream climate change adaptation strat-
egies into the sustainable development agendas of the CARICOM 
member states
 n Strategic Element 2 . Promote the implementation of specific 
adaptation measures to address key vulnerabilities in the region
 n Strategic Element 3 . Promote actions to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions through fossil fuel reduction and conservation, and 
switching to renewable and cleaner energy sources
 n Strategic Element 4 . Promote actions to reduce the vulnerability 
of natural and human systems in CARICOM countries to the impacts 
of a changing climate
 n Strategic Element 5 . Promote actions to derive social, economic, 
and environmental benefits from the prudent management of 
standing forests in CARICOM countries
This complex array of strategic elements has generated an associated 
set of 21 goals. It is intended that these should be monitored and evaluated 
in one M&E framework applied across the 20 member and associated states 
(Groupe-Conseil Baastel ltée 2013). 
Challenges for Evaluation of the Regional Framework
Establishing, populating, and analyzing such an M&E framework would be a 
major undertaking for any region, and will pose particularly substantial chal -
lenges for many Caribbean SIDS, as outlined below.

<<<PAGE=150>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
128
Challenge 1: Targets, indicators, and data . Progress toward each of 
the 21 goals should be measured through sets of baselines, targets, and 
indicators. The prevailing situation with respect to climate change targets 
is consistent across the CARICOM countries: that is, targets are generally 
only established for donor-funded projects. In many other cases, particularly 
for government-sponsored policies and activities, progress indicators have 
been defined, but are not associated with specific targets. Baseline data are 
generally available for national and sectoral-level frameworks, as well as for 
donor-funded projects, and are therefore relatively strong compared with 
targets and indicators.
Challenge 2: Variable resources for monitoring and evaluation . The data 
landscape is highly uneven across CARICOM member states. Countries with 
relatively major economies, notably Jamaica, have more resources to invest 
in national-level data collection and management than much smaller econo-
mies, where public administration has limited human and financial resources. 
Similarly, countries with many externally supported projects, such as St. Lucia, 
have greater access to external M&E advice, and the funds to support this 
function, than countries with fewer projects. 
In recognition of this variation, it is important to note that M&E models 
that have been found effective in relatively well-resourced CARICOM coun-
tries cannot simply be transferred to other countries in the region, which have 
fewer resources. It is therefore important to ensure that evaluation activities 
and systems assess whether specific countries have made acceptable prog-
ress toward climate change targets according to their own unique situations, 
priorities, and resources, rather than against region-wide standards derived 
from countries with greater human and financial resources. 
Challenge 3: Ability to respond to challenges of the regional frame-
work . Underlying the concept of a unified CARICOM-wide M&E framework 
is the expectation that each country will have some indicators and targets 
that reflect the goals of its national priorities and policies. However, a pre-
paratory study for the M&E framework found that many key stakeholders 
in government ministries dealing with climate change, or in other national 
bodies with a climate-related mandate, were not strongly aware of the 
specificities of the regional framework, and still less aware of how it might 
be evaluated. Furthermore, there is often no clear separation between mon-
itoring activities and evaluation activities, which would only be feasible in 
much more developed and well-resourced systems. This means that even 
the limited data collected by monitoring systems are often not suitable for 
evaluation purposes.
Challenge 4: Low status of monitoring and evaluation . An additional 
important challenge to overcome is the low status and limited capacity of 
M&E activities in most of the countries in the region. Monitoring and evalu-
ation are largely conducted in internationally funded interventions, and are 
often of a regional or subregional nature. Associated with such interventions,
<<<PAGE=151>>>
Chapter 8. Evaluating Sustainable Development in SIDS - Lessons from the Pacific and the Caribbean   129
several regional or subregional M&E frameworks have been proposed or 
established in various sectors (notably disaster management), usually with 
limited take up at the country level. 
Underlying weak national implementation is the substantial inequal -
ity and perceived disconnect between the regional bodies proposing M&E 
frameworks and the national government departments or units that must 
conduct the detailed work of designing and implementing data collection 
and analysis at the country level. Characteristically, the regional bodies have 
sufficient technical capacity, human resources, and funding to participate in 
complex M&E exercises. Government departments, on the other hand, are 
often understaffed and poorly resourced, but have substantial implemen-
tation and reporting obligations, including some that are mandatory under 
the requirements of internationally funded activities or conventions. At the 
country level, therefore, evaluation is currently rarely recognized as useful, 
and has a correspondingly low functional status.
In the context of the constraints outlined above, the all-embracing 
M&E framework for climate change is often viewed as a largely unwelcome 
addition to existing tasks for the relevant government offices at the country 
level and may, in view of insufficient human and financial resources, be unde-
liverable. The requirements for national-level capacity building need to be 
carefully incorporated into the development of the overall regional M&E 
framework: this would include providing substantial financial resources over 
a period of time, given the low starting point in many countries. 
Advancing Evaluation Capacity
The Caribbean SIDS have limited numbers of experienced evaluators, includ -
ing those with climate change expertise. The demand for evaluators comes 
mainly from international bodies, including the countries and institutions that 
provide funding support to governments and regional institutions. To convert 
the desire for comprehensive evaluation of the effects of CARICOM policies 
and strategies to reality will therefore require substantial evaluation capacity 
development. 
However, this capacity development needs to be placed within a funda-
mental upgrading of the role and implementation of evaluation. Underlying 
the possibility of such change are the following fundamental questions: 
 n How can the value and status of evaluation be raised, so that rather 
than being seen as a function that is of interest only to donors, it is 
seen as a useful resource for governments? 
 n How can evaluation support from various external funders be 
brought together into a coherent package, from its current state of 
fragmented bits and pieces?
 n How can a more equitable and effective balance between the eval-
uation capacity of well-resourced regional institutions, and those 
of “shoestring” national government departments and offices be 
created?

If evaluation is to have any chance of becoming a viable component of 
the CARICOM regional approach to climate change adaptation, resilience, and 
mitigation, it needs to be very carefully focused on a few critical issues, and 
realistically scaled, so that it both appears to be, and is, implementable at the 
country level. 
Evaluation capacity development needs to be part of a comprehen-
sive package that will include in-person engagement of national stakeholders 
in its development through regional planning meetings of operational staff, 
and capacity building and financial support for national M&E functions. This 
process should place increased emphasis on evaluation, rather than focusing 
exclusively on indicators for results-based management. 
FUTURE MONITORING AND EVALUATION IN THE SIDS
Experience in both the Pacific and Caribbean SIDS suggests that monitoring 
and evaluation as analytical tools are currently underutilized. However, we 
propose that M&E can be very powerful in promoting sustainable develop-
ment in the island states, if it is institutionalized at the governmental level 
and integrated into government policies, strategies, and programs. Monitor -
ing is needed to ensure that the various interventions are on track, and are 
completing their stated activities on time and in a cost-effective manner. Eval-
uation is needed in order to ascertain that the policies, strategies, and other 
interventions are reaching their goals and contributing to sustainable devel -
opment without causing unanticipated negative consequences.
There are a number of prerequisites in order for this to happen. The first 
pertains to the fact that currently M&E is seen mostly as a requirement from 
donors and/or regional organizations. It consequently receives low priority at 
the level of national government ministries and departments. It is important 
to change this perception: this will require M&E functions and activities to 
demonstrate their added value. Building the capacity of national stakehold -
ers to appraise and use evidence will contribute to creating demand for M&E. 
National stakeholders must be engaged in the development of these capaci-
ty-building efforts in order to promote country ownership, and a special focus 
on the utility of evaluation beyond monitoring indicators is needed.
There is also significant scope for cross-learning between SIDS in other 
regions: that is, not only in the Pacific and the Caribbean, but also in the Atlantic 
and Indian oceans, the Mediterranean, and the South China Sea. Existing mech-
anisms could be used for this purpose, including the Alliance of Small Island 
States (AOSIS), which has a membership of 44 states and observers covering 
all oceans and regions. Similarly, the UN manages the Inter-Agency Consulta-
tive Group (IACG) on SIDS, which brings together regional SIDS organizations

as well as international, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental partners, 
and could ensure that all M&E activities pertaining to the agency work are 
coordinated. Another existing platform that could be used more effectively to 
share M&E experiences and lessons learned between the regions is the GEF 
International Waters Learning Exchange and Resource Network (IW:LEARN),
8 
which already provides an established forum for learning shared among a large 
number of environmental programs and projects across regions.
It is important to tailor M&E systems to the specific situations at hand. 
One size does not fit all, and top-down approaches that impose uniform 
frameworks on countries and departments regardless of their needs and 
capacities are counterproductive. It will be essential to choose the targets 
of monitoring and the subjects of evaluation carefully, based on the utility of 
these actions in helping to meet national priorities. It will also be important 
to adjust and design M&E systems to the particular institutional and cultural 
systems that are prevalent in each country.
Promoting country-led monitoring and evaluation will best serve the 
need for countries to manage sustainable development. Sustainable devel -
opment issues involve balancing social, environmental, and economic costs 
and benefits: this means making value judgments about what exactly is most 
important to sustain in each country. Ultimately, it is the countries involved 
that should be making these judgments, informed by robust evidence and 
in recognition of the fact that sustainable development looks different at 
different scales and means different things to different people. Furthermore, 
climate change, which is one of the biggest threats to sustainable develop-
ment in SIDS, is insidious because of the uncertainty about how society and 
nature will react to it in the coming decades. This makes consistent implemen-
tation and use of M&E all the more important: SIDS will need to be active 
learners as they adapt to constantly changing environments.

Evaluation Standards for Latin 
America and the Caribbean - 
Experimentation and Evolution
Ana Luisa Guzmán and Warren Crowther
Abstract . This chapter reviews an excellent contribution to the development of evalu-
ation standards for Latin America and the Caribbean developed by the Latin American 
and Caribbean Network of Monitoring, Evaluation and Systematization (ReLAC). Lessons 
learned from experimentation in applying a code of ethics in the development of seven 
diverse and ambitious projects over a 10-year period in Costa Rica are discussed. The 
basic principles covered by the standards are posited, and the practical relevance, via-
bility, and trade-offs, or relative emphasis in the evaluation and decision-making aspects 
of the projects, are analyzed. The proposed standards for Latin America and the Carib-
bean constitute an excellent guideline for applying and implementing the improvement 
of evaluation processes. This observation and analysis suggests an agenda for further 
debate, including the inclusion of additional evaluation standards.

Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability

T
he Latin American and Caribbean Network of Monitoring, Evaluation 
and Systematization (ReLAC) has made an important contribution to the 
experimentation and evolution of standards for program evaluation in the 
region. In the first stage, many evaluators were consulted and a literature 
review was carried out regarding competencies and standards, including the 
evaluation standards used in United Nations (UN) agencies, internationally 
recognized partnerships, and other such initiatives In 2015, a draft proposal 
of standards was circulated among and commented upon by interested 
members of the network, and in 2016 a published edition of the Evalua-
tion Standards for Latin America and the Caribbean (EEALC; Rodríguez et 
al. 2016) was circulated and commented on by interested organizations and 
professionals.
During this period of elaborating and sharing criteria for the stan-
dards, a review of elements of ethical guidance—based on the code of ethics 
published by UNICEF (2002) for research, monitoring, and evaluation of pro-
grams and projects taking into account the rights and interests of children 
and adolescents—took place in Costa Rica.
1 Its basic principles can be applied 
to the target populations in the design and evaluation of the programs and 
projects catering to their rights and interests, and the use of action research 
methodologies. These same principles were adapted for other target pop-
ulations, including low-income families needing assistance with initiatives in 
entrepreneurship, exceptional patients with serious illnesses, older adults, 
and communities and users affected by transportation and communications 
investments. 
The experience with these projects is instructive regarding the need 
and conditions for an adequate set of standards, adapted to Latin Ameri-
can and Caribbean realities, while recognizing that although Costa Rica has 
a mixed population when it comes to ethnicity, urban and rural culture, eco-
nomic conditions, and environment, it still represents only a fraction of the 
diversity that needs to be considered in the entire region. 
The lessons learned from the demonstration projects are summarized 
in table 9.1. They highlight implications for the evolution of program evalua-
tion standards for the region.
The most interesting of these experiences illustrate the ample options 
and major obstacles to some of the critical factors of quality monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) of policies, programs, and projects (PPP), which not circum-
stantially have received the most intensive attention and development in the 
discussions regarding the EEALC.
Between the initial proposal and the latest version of the EEALC, there 
has been an impressive and promising advancement in the definition of these 
standards, particularly related to four major themes: relevance to decision 
making; influence on decision making; validity of the evidence; and the fulfill-
ment of preconditions. Table 9.1 illustrates the importance and value of these 
themes, as well as some nuances or complications that have not yet been 
1 In addition to UNICEF (2002), attention was also given to two other norms: 
UNICEF Costa Rica (2000) and ICAP and UNDP (2003).

broached in the standards, and are in constant evolution as their application 
is being monitored.
Some of the projects are reviewed in table 9.1, regarding what was 
intended, what resulted, and what was learned. These are all demonstration 
projects, initiated by the ProHumana21 Foundation between 2004 and 2014. 
They were undertaken with intensive grassroots participation and attempts 
to create prototypes or models of better practices, including more adequate 
impact assessment. 
USING EVALUATION FOR DECISION MAKING
This is mentioned in the EEALC: it is an important starting point, but it needs 
to be reviewed in order to consider programs and projects as subject to 
constant experimentation, and not just implementation and resolution of pre-
determined terms of reference and premises. There are always both positive 
and negative surprises that affect the engagement, dimensions, and parame-
ters of the M&E and decision-making processes of projects and their impacts. 
The projects reviewed in table 9.1 emphasize this.
It became apparent that in the implementation of these projects, there 
was no relationship between the relative gravity or threat of the situation dis-
covered with innovative evaluation methods, and the amount of local and/or 
national interest that existed to deal with those facets of that situation, and 
in defining the projects´ terms of reference. Thus a focus on the unexpected 
turned out to be more revealing—in either an instructive or a disturbing 
way—than a focus on the achievement of pre-established goals.
For example, it was observed that the resolution of many socio-envi-
ronmental conflicts and medical pathologies led to unanticipated delayed 
effects in the form of new conflicts or pathologies. The apparent resolution 
of one socio-environmental conflict often leads to the unraveling of other 
conflicts, and the remission of one illness is often the preface to a later down-
turn in health. Thus, the adoption of a solution for one challenge can often 
create another challenge.
Another insight from analyzing these projects resulted in fostering 
comparative research and evaluation, which involved ambiguity in choosing 
the models and indicators that were sensitive to particular cultural and local 
realities, and those that were emphasized when comparisons were made. Yet, 
ironically, comparisons can help rather than hurt in this situation. The greatest 
“relevance” of an evaluation is not only in appraising how well preconceived 
challenges and the consequent predefined goals are being met, but also 
in identifying or uncovering the locally or presently unseen or unexpected 
factors: in this regard, comparative evaluation can actually be very helpful in 
making those factors more visible or well anticipated. 
The periodic Latin American Development Administration Congresses 
(CLAD) are very instructive in comparing experiences: however, in the most 
recent congress, held in Chile in 2016, there was a lack of communication 
between two main streams of work. There were several sessions dedi-
cated to reviewing advances in PPP evaluation, including discussion of the 
EEALC. Other sessions were focused on program and project “innovation and

138
government laboratory” advancements: yet it was noticeable that very few 
people who attended the evaluation sessions also attended the innovation 
sessions. Unfortunately, there was no discussion about the importance of 
assimilating the benefits of these approaches. We will readdress this per -
spective when we consider the importance of evaluating impact and not just 
results.
HOW EVALUATION AFFECTS DECISION MAKING
The projects in Costa Rica have used action research methodologies to inte-
grate, at the local level, the evaluation and decision-making processes. These 
projects have also invited—or pressured and educated—the target popula-
tions and other present stakeholders who sometimes met with resistance, to 
broaden their perspective on the relationship between evaluation and deci-
sion making, and how to most positively engage in them. Attention was given 
to questions of confidentiality and sensitivity of the evidence, and judgments 
in the evaluation, which prior to the evaluation should be agreed upon by key 
stakeholders. 
In the projects reviewed in table 9.1, a general benefit was enhance-
ment of the knowledge management capacities of the most active among 
the target populations, and at times of other stakeholders as well. However, 
this meant focusing more attention on the sensitivities—and sometimes 
uncomfortable ethical implications—of this knowledge management 
sharing and decision-making responsibility and privilege, and of the evidence 
itself. A major difficulty arises where a “culture of shame” prevails, meaning 
a general avoidance of sharing what could be sensitive or embarrassing 
information.
The common withholding or suppression of evaluation results was 
even more tense and awkward: this included evidence considered by one 
or more parties to be offensive to their agenda or interests, or potentially 
damaging to other parties.
LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE VALIDITY
In the projects reviewed in table 9.1, it became evident that the more inti-
mate and closely connected the evaluators were to the local details and 
consequences of PPP implementation, the greater the difficulties they faced 
in identifying evaluation indicators that were both suggestive of validity and 
of applicable practicality in the evaluation. This was also illustrated by empir-
ical results highlighted throughout the analyzed literature review. That is, 
the indicators were more geared to their relatively easier application and to 
acceptability by data sources than to the pertinence of the evidence for the 
variables that were posited in each case. This review depicted inconsistencies 
between the connotations of the variables outlined in the conceptual or mod-
eling configuration of what was being studied or evaluated, and what was 
evidenced through the practical indicators. 
Pertinent to this are proposals regarding quality criteria for the selec -
tion of indicators. Somewhat different examples of such proposals have been
<<<PAGE=161>>>
Chapter 9. Evaluation Standards for Latin America and the Caribbean - Experimentation and Evolution  139
offered by Stockmann and Crowther, both of whom have shown that “ample 
criteria” included some that in practice are not compatible with each other 
(Crowther 1999; Stockmann 2011). 
This means that inevitably, in all evaluations, the predispositions of the 
evaluator (or decision makers) play a role regarding the overall criteria used 
for selecting indicators. 
THE REQUIRED PRECONDITIONS FOR A  
PARTICIPATORY EVALUATION 
For almost any reputable and useful evaluation, considerable work has to 
be done just to create the preconditions. This has been the case for decades 
in Latin America, where the insistence on a precipitated or institutionalized 
evaluation procedure without these preconditions has come to denigrate the 
credibility of evaluation. Often those most affected—that is, either those 
being most closely evaluated or the major sources of evidence—might see 
program evaluation as, for example, lying, “tattling,” an intrusion. Or they 
might simply resist it altogether.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND ISSUES
Different initiatives for developing evaluation standards have taken various 
positions regarding the four major themes, and constructive attention has 
been given to them in EEALC. 
It is notable that with the exception of the requisite conditions for the 
evaluation, the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), in its 13 norms, 
tends to assign less attention to these four standards, and instead highlights 
the ones that EEALC has identified as the most difficult ones to resolve. For 
example, UNEG stresses impartiality, and many in UNEG would see impartial-
ity as supporting and strengthening validity. However, UNEG is not explicit 
about the inherent limitations of evidence and judgment validity for example, 
regarding issues of sensitivity and confidentiality. On this last point, the Amer-
ican Evaluation Association’s Program Evaluation Standards more realistically 
assigns importance to “technically adequate” information.
In applying these standards, a general lesson from the projects shown 
in table 9.1 is that their compliance is fostered with the application of action 
research principles and methodology. In addition to complex planning and 
implementation of the evaluation process, more than the usual amount of 
human and economic resource dedication is also required. The target popu-
lations and other stakeholders are not readily prepared for the protagonist 
role they are invited to, or that they need to, assume: much preparation for 
this role is needed.
On the other hand, there are five more themes with which the projects 
faced more troublesome practical challenges, and for which, optimistically, 
the evolution of EEALC may provide solutions. These themes are: involvement 
of the principal stakeholders in decisions about the evaluations; examination 
of the underlying values influencing the evaluations; impact; evaluator com-
petencies; and the role of context.
<<<PAGE=162>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
140
DECISION MAKING: WHO DECIDES WHAT?
The EEALC indicates that the main target population of the PPP are “groups 
affected by” the evaluation. Regarding the very diverse sets of responsibili-
ties and/or privileges they should have in the evaluation and decision-making 
process, 16 different categories or segments of actors or stakeholders are 
designated, with some overlapping regarding both groupings and functions. 
For the projects shown in table 9.1, the most interested segments 
of the population could be readily identified. However, some of the inter -
ested stakeholders demonstrated some degree of resistance to sharing or 
conceding their personal incidence in the decision making or real, informed 
participation in the design and evaluation of PPP, to those most affected 
by them. This resistance was less than expected, although it varied among 
localities and subcultures. With PPPs directed at the rights and interests of 
adolescents and youth, there was less adult centralism than anticipated, but 
there was much more than expected regarding PPPs directed at older adults, 
including among the professionals attending this generation. 
UNDERLYING VALUES, OR CRITERIA, INFLUENCE WHAT IS 
BEING EVALUATED
In the projects reviewed in table 9.1, the agendas of key stakeholders often 
did not coincide with the ethical standards the projects were trying to adopt: 
or they were not compatible with each other regarding the underlying values 
or criteria to be applied.
In these projects, there were numerous cases of unpreparedness for 
new challenges, and others of institutional units adhering to their agendas 
and general priorities, and seeking support for more coverage and technolog-
ical upgrading rather than pertinence and realism in what they were offering. 
In such cases, substantive evaluation could seem very threatening.
The inherent or inevitable incidence of the evaluator’s (or decision 
maker’s) predisposition regarding the selection of indicators is presented 
in all areas of evaluations, since an external referent to the situation being 
evaluated is always being introduced either implicitly or explicitly -reporting 
that things go well or badly, better or worse, optimistically or fearfully, and 
so on. (Perhaps the exception to this is the response “accepted or tolerated” 
or “not accepted or tolerated.”) One can adopt a baseline or benchmark to 
show apparent progress or regression, but there is always that important 
question, which is usually unanswered—“In comparison to what?”—which 
is needed in order to conclude whether a “reasonable expectation” is being 
met. Where does this “reasonable expectation” come from? Not only is the 
lack of reference to a defined reasonable expectation a common deficit in 
evaluation: it is also lacking in almost all social, educational, and administra-
tive research.
TOWARD EVALUATING IMPACT
When comparing proposed evaluation standards, it is important to consider 
the connotations and meanings in different languages of the terminology
<<<PAGE=163>>>
Chapter 9. Evaluation Standards for Latin America and the Caribbean - Experimentation and Evolution  141
being adopted. In fact, the same term can have different connotations even in 
different countries that speak the same language. That said, in the evolution 
of regional standards in Latin America and the Caribbean, the most consis-
tently affirmed values, or criteria, have been utility, precision, pertinence, and 
timeliness. 
A most concerning tendency in the region is placing much more 
emphasis on evaluating results than on evaluating impact, although increas-
ing attention is being given to the latter. The positive side of the emphasis 
on results is that it gives more attention to the democratically elected 
government’s compliance to the promises they have posited, or the expec -
tations they have raised. But a downside is that it can lead to efforts to 
improve a PPP, or do a better job of managing it, when a real impact eval -
uation may indicate that it shouldn’t be taking place at all, or that it needs 
major reform.
Impact as such is not mentioned in the EEALC, but there are interesting 
hints of it in the insistence that there should be a positive contribution to 
decision making, and the “quality of life” of the “beneficial public” and “other 
interested parties.” 
The UNEG norms make seven references to the evaluation of impact as 
an alternative to evaluating outcomes: output, relevance, efficiency, effective-
ness, sustainability, value-for-money, and client satisfaction. But those norms 
don’t really consider what impact as such entails. 
For the projects summarized in table 9.1, a strong definition of impact 
has been adopted, which includes the added value of the target population 
regarding the most fundamental transformations of its quality of life; the 
target population having good knowledge of and insight into what con-
stitutes and influences the quality of their lives; and consideration of the 
opportunity costs of all interested or affected stakeholders. This definition 
is not very operative, except as a point of reference to discuss with the key 
stakeholders, including the target populations. It means not just comparing 
yesterday or today with tomorrow, which is the usual manifestation adopted 
for a baseline: this kind of benchmarking needs to project what was, or is, 
likely to occur in a given period of time without the intervention that is being 
evaluated. 
WHAT COMPETENCIES SHOULD THE EVALUATOR HAVE?
This is a delicate topic: many people who have engaged in evaluation dili-
gently and continuously do not begin to have the qualifications elaborated 
on in texts such as that of Rodriguez et al. (2016). Furthermore, some of the 
standard qualifications are extremely difficult to evaluate, such as whether 
an evaluator is being “objective” and “impartial.” The emphasis on credibility 
puts this up for grabs: who will be most convincing to those who will be 
hiring the services of an evaluator? Comparing the terms of reference of such 
qualifications—including for other projects with the same target populations 
as those in table 9.1—the differences as to expectations of competencies are 
monumental.
<<<PAGE=164>>>

142
TAKING CONTEXT INTO ACCOUNT
The importance assigned to “context” is often associated with recognition 
and respect for local and cultural differences. What is seldom discussed is 
how much subjectivity is inevitable in determining what “context” to consider, 
as almost all of the phenomena being evaluated are interrelated with infinite 
conditions or variables, and there is always a presumption as to where and 
how to draw the lines.
For Costa Rica and the other 40 countries categorized as high middle 
income, there is an additional limitation: not counting on think tanks dedi-
cated to analyzing and comparing their commonalities, such as those that 
exist for the more developed and the less developed countries. There is 
little systematization of the common problems at this stage of development, 
which could help contextualize studies in the individual countries.
CONCLUSIONS
It is extremely challenging to create a consensus about more precise stan-
dards especially regarding the last five mentioned above—decision making, 
the influence of underlying values or criteria, evaluating impact, evaluator 
competencies, and context—including an operative definition of impact.
Nonetheless, UNEG’s 13 norms and the 30 standards of the American 
Evaluation Association’s Program Evaluation Standards focus on these very 
expectations, in some cases mentioning them without really defining them. 
These international norms and standards also give major attention to 
two issues that can be closely interrelated, and which the Latin American 
and Caribbean standards do not deal with directly: that is, human rights in 
general, and the well-being of those participating in the evaluation, not just 
those affected by its results. Human rights, and especially its byproducts of 
equity or equality, involve constant and inherent trade-offs. Fourteen oper -
ative definitions of “equity” that are commonly adopted in practice can be 
identified; all have substantial legitimacy, but they can also be quite contra-
dictory with each other. 
It is necessary to recognize the importance of the learning experiences 
presented in this work, both in terms of the results and the impacts obtained 
in the projects developed, and the constant search for high quality in their 
evaluation. This is especially true in the case of Latin America, where it will 
help to refine the evaluation standards with greater precision regarding the 
contexts and characteristics of the programs and projects of the region.
The standards for Latin America are also a guide, a way forward in 
the design and execution of evaluations that will provide greater knowledge, 
clarity, and understanding of the contexts in which policies, programs, and 
projects are being developed, and will thus improve evaluation processes.

TABLE 9.1 Demonstration projects using research action and 
participatory evaluation: relevant contributions to evaluation 
standards
1. Education and guidance counseling that intends to be more ample, realis -
tic, and personalized, with the development and validation of a website, and 
didactic modules
Back-
ground
The deficiency in guidance counseling appears to be the biggest 
generalized abuse of adolescents in the country, leading to much 
frustration and unfortunate decisions by youth, and contributing to 
the greatly increasing nonworking youth population and violence. 
Making it worse has been civic education that has encouraged stu -
dents to cheat on their civics graduation exams to misconstrue the 
need for improvements and thus for their positive contributions. 
It has been especially hard for today’s young adults (aged 20–35) 
who are of a baby boom generation for which the country did not 
prepare. They are undereducated (only 40% have a high school 
diploma) and have collided with a depressed employment market
Intent for 
target 
popula -
tion
 § Emphasis was on the student being able to intelligently evaluate 
and choose his or her best prospects.
 § Development of a website on how to choose which university or 
technical educational majors/specialties are most needed in the 
labor market and which are accessible given admissions quotas.
 § Experimentation with guidance discourses and didactic modules 
to help in choosing high school and university majors and spe -
cialties, and to understand the complementary value of virtual 
education.
 § Focus was on those entering their last year of high school before 
choosing university majors when registering for the admissions 
exam, those in 9th grade who often can change their category of 
high school, and those who must choose a category on entering 
7th grade.
 § Before giving group and individual feedback to the high school 
students, survey results were shared with the educators.
 § Promotion of more forthright civic education that is honest 
about where youth is needed.
 § Experimentation was undertaken largely by university graduates 
and professors of guidance counseling
Results
 § The survey was undertaken in 38 of Costa Rica’s 81 local gov -
ernments (municipalities), with 19,000 current or potential 
university and high school students, and the general response 
of the great majority was gratitude; it was undertaken in 100 
mostly high schools, plus a few graduating 6th grade classes of 
elementary schools in low-income neighborhoods.
 § In numerous cases, the presentation of student survey results 
surprised the high school educators.
 § Some high school directors were resentful, because with this 
information, many of their students changed their schools to a 
different category; the project did, however, succeed in greatly 
increasing the enrollment of elementary school graduates as a 
result of the counseling

Results
 § In a follow-up study of youth who had received this guidance five 
years earlier, most had continued with their university studies 
and judged the guidance as having been helpful; surprisingly, 
they had been very accurate in anticipating the practical prob -
lems they would encounter, such as socioeconomic background 
and family dynamics in pursuing their preferred prospects.
 § The elementary school graduates of very low-income neigh -
borhoods were registered in high schools generally not of the 
student´s preference, but rather responding to the parent´s 
dominant criteria of security and transportation; therefore, the 
discourse was altered on this, telling students they could choose 
a different category when finishing the 9th grade.
 § Initiation of a comparative study between countries regarding 
civics education pinpointed the influence of the legitimization or 
not of militarization (given that Costa Rica has no military)
Lessons 
learned
 § The target population was mostly helpful in monitoring the 
effects and impacts of attempts at better counseling practices.
 § This has not led to a generalized application of the better 
practices; attempts were made to identify the major sources of 
resistance to generalizing their adoption, or even to evaluation of 
standing procedures, particularly as this resistance was justified 
by referral to intellectual and organizational autonomy and/
or authority that educational institutions or units insist on for 
themselves.
 § This resistance was very strong by universities, which are influ -
enced by professional associations and are very slow to create 
new majors, specialties, and courses, and to resist the notion 
that guidance counseling should be more realistic—which is 
needed to break the tendency that the most-solicited majors are 
the ones leading to severe underemployment, and those majors 
highlighted for meeting international accreditation standards 
rather than for their national relevance, while there are great 
needs of determined specialists often in the same professions.
 § The surge of new categories of high schools caught the existing 
elementary and high schools unprepared, and the latter often 
put up obstacles against more free choice for the students.
 § The Public Education Ministry was adamant in not addressing 
or even wanting to hear about conflicts within its own units 
that are affecting student decision making, such as the conflict 
between civics education, apparent entrepreneurship programs, 
and realistic counseling; however, with a change of government, 
the ministry has indicated interest in taking lessons from this 
experience.
 § The project allowed the students a role of censorship: it was 
important to recognize that many students—more of mid -
dle-class than low-income neighborhoods—were emphatic 
about not wanting their parents involved in the evaluation and 
selection of a category of high school or of a university major; 
where possible, counseling was offered to parents, but insisting 
that the students could choose whether to extend the invitation 
to their parents

2. Identification and creation of windows of opportunity and necessity 
for professional and technical human resources in the zone of residence, 
especially of youth, to reverse their tendency to identify their best future 
prospects as being distant from that zone of their country, and the adap -
tation of formal and parallel education to prepare them for what is most 
relevant to where they live
Back-
ground
Local opportunities and the needs for such competencies, more 
as entrepreneurship than as employment, are generally ignored 
in community development and education plans. Most rural and 
many suburban communities export the resources they most need 
for their development, i.e., their more educated youth, even though 
their vocational interests may coincide with needs or potential 
opportunities in the local zone. Meanwhile, university and high 
school students undertake their required field projects, including 
those of community service, with very little (and at times negative) 
consequences for the community or target population; the disci -
pline; or their own professional portfolios.
Intent for 
target 
popula -
tion
 § The identification of the opportunities and need for professional 
and technical human resources in each zone, using field research 
and community service projects of university and high school 
students and community participation workshops to do this.
 § Incidence in the curriculum to respond to those spaces and 
prospects of the students to respond to or develop them, and 
promotion of the use of virtual education.
 § Field practice for students, e.g., regarding program evaluation, 
local social environmental conflicts, ecotourism opportunities, 
and architecture for schools or community services, all promot -
ing the idea of conforming to a niche.
 § Workshops and follow-up in entrepreneurship, with help in 
getting the required financial, technical, and institutional 
support.
 § Attempts to influence governmental agencies, NGOs, community 
inter-institutional coordination commissions, and international 
cooperation to recognize the need for this, and to take lessons 
learned from the project.
 § Seek ways to enable the community to have what it lacks now, 
which is intelligent planning, design, and evaluation of its under -
lying and most fundamental transformations.
Results
 § 2,000 students (fewer than expected) receiving guidance 
counseling in many local governments also participated in field 
practices related to their vocational interests; many were made 
more conscious of zonal needs and opportunities for their 
intended professional or vocational prospects, or those they are 
interested in. In some cases there has been immediate interest by 
prospective employers, such as in updated accounting and infor -
matics for commerce of artisanal products.
 § A few technical high schools experimented with some curricular 
additions, like educational ecotourism. In one local government, 
the lowest rated in the UN Life Quality Index, the project helped 
bring a new technical high school with recently created (and long 
needed) specialties for such schools.
<<<PAGE=168>>>

Results
 § University students of 18 majors in 6 universities participated, 
annexing and adapting their field projects to support the 
investigation and development of development needs and 
opportunities in the participating communities. Also, many high 
school students contributed to this with their community service 
projects.
 § In the review of Project 3 below, the subject of entrepreneurship 
is elaborated upon somewhat.
 § Extensive bibliographies, citing as many as 400 research reports, 
have been prepared in each of 4 local governments, with copies 
including many of the cited documents, to local authorities, and 
to public and school libraries.
Lessons 
learned
 § The potential for much more relevant student field practice 
seemed quite evident, except that it is so very difficult to get 
the established governmental and NGO institutions to readdress 
their agendas and methodologies: some are set in their ways, 
and some are influenced by the agendas of international coop -
eration. Even some that highlighted youth participation in their 
discourse were not receptive to receiving and using the interest 
profiles of local youth that were offered to them.
 § There were numerous university students interested in under -
taking their obligatory field activities (thesis or other graduation 
projects, internships, or community service) in these subjects, 
and the project urged them to do this in their family’s residential 
zone. However, the universities in general are very poorly orga -
nized for such projects to be relevant in the terms the project 
has promoted (for the student´s professional portfolio, for the 
community, and for the discipline). Therefore a number of initia -
tives were curtailed.
 § Some organizations have been influenced to take lessons from 
this experience, and to adapt their agendas and methodologies, 
but the evident need for this is being met only fragmentally.
 § The use of our bibliographies of research on local realities (a 
large proportion being university theses and field reports), high -
lighting substantial documented local empirical intelligence, has 
been very sporadic. Both external and local organizations prefer 
to embark with their preconceptions, immediate experiences, 
and agendas, and not be distracted by substantiated evidence of 
local realities.
3. Social and business entrepreneurship, especially of community and 
agro-ecotourism projects, small businesses for low-income families, and 
youth initiatives
Back-
ground
Numerous studies of social entrepreneurship show that most proj -
ects have less impact than expected, such as in rural community 
tourism, and family business projects, including those that had 
received training in entrepreneurship and project development. 
Most are very deficient in key ways, and are not adequately pre -
pared to deal with critical factors: most family businesses do not 
survive more than a few years.

Intent for

popula -
tion
 § Workshops and monitoring or follow-up (including incubation), 
with a focus on an operative plan resolving the critical factors 
of the efficacy of such entrepreneurship, including segmenta -
tion of the market or beneficiaries; adjustment of the products’ 
characteristics; realistic financial analysis; the use of informa -
tion technology in marketing and transaction with the users, 
complementation among projects instead of overly zealous com -
petitiveness, and in many cases, the advantages of emphasizing 
the social and ecological benefits of the initiative.
 § Visiting the location of each project before the workshop, in 
order to assure better advice from the instructors and better 
understanding and preparation of the entrepreneurs for what a 
focus on efficacy entails.
 § Periodic updating of a database with numerous (more than 60) 
sources for financing of these projects, with emphasis on dona -
tions. What are updated with regard to the financial sources are 
the themes of interest, conditions for soliciting the funds, and 
their approximate availability.
 § Forming of facilitators of entrepreneurship.
Results
 § Some community entrepreneurship has been undertaken with 
our help, especially in cultural activity, and much family entre -
preneurship as well, especially in tourism, clothing, culinary, 
beautician, informatics, the value-added chain of agro-products, 
and health service endeavors.
 § Numerous workshops have been undertaken, with a huge drop-
off of those indicating interest to those with regular assistance. 
A big factor in the drop-off was our warning that the curriculum 
was demanding, requiring perseverance and patience (especially 
with the bureaucracy), and particularly with regard to financial 
analysis (although many with little formal education were able to 
process it with our help).
 § It appears that by far most that have regular assistance in the 
workshop do continue with their projects, and obtain the needed 
support (over 90% of the low-income women who solicited 
funds from a special government fund with our help, compared 
to less than 20% of requesters in general).
 § Very few have taken up the offer to form and give diplomas to facil-
itators of entrepreneurship, although demand for this is very high.
Lessons 
learned
 § The project’s curriculum has been criticized for being very 
demanding by various institutions and instructors who offer work -
shops and incubation in entrepreneurship. However, this exacting 
curriculum responds to studies indicating how few entrepreneurial 
projects succeed even somewhat near expectations, and the need 
to focus on critical factors of efficacy. Thus, an attempt has been 
made to emphasize more practical help than academic assistance.
 § There have been very variable differences of grades of commit -
ment and follow-through among the communities and the families 
that have participated with entrepreneurial projects. The reasons 
for this are being analyzed by monitoring the perspectives and 
decisions of the entrepreneurs. There seems to be a complex set 
of personal, social, economic, and political factors involved.
<<<PAGE=170>>>

Lessons 
learned
 § A greatly increasing number of families who have serious health 
problems have participated. They are desperately seeking income 
to pay for private care, given the huge waiting lists in public 
health care services. This of course requires great attention to 
how to address this combination of health and financial crises.
 § Much depends on the local counterpart organizations that 
solicited this project, and those that either enjoin or distance 
themselves from entrepreneurial initiatives.
4. Attention to the increased violence in communities and schools, along 
with its effects; and of intrafamily violence on the psychosocial, vocational, 
and civic prospects for youth; and to the need to conciliate the emphasis 
on containing human violence with adequate preparation for disasters and 
emergencies
Back-
ground
The major burden of responsibility in the Law of Protection of Chil -
dren and Adolescents goes to educators in schools, who receive 
very little help with carrying it out. The programs of prevention of 
suicide, femicide, and abuse in general do not respond to under -
lying factors or statistical tendencies. The Manual of the National 
Emergency Commission with the Ministry of Education on how 
to prepare for disasters and emergencies, including brigades and 
simulation, is horribly unrealistic if one takes into consideration 
lessons learned from the earthquakes in Haiti and Mexico, as well 
as incidents in Costa Rica.
Intent for 
target 
popula -
tion
 § Workshops for youth facilitators of peace and security in their 
schools and communities, in combination with the Ministry of 
Justice and Peace, Municipalities, and other agencies dedicated 
to the subject.
 § Advice to school student commissions dedicated to the theme.
 § Workshops for educators on how to assist adolescents trauma -
tized by violence, indicating that there is a government agency to 
help them in case of reprisals.
 § To create a commission on how to mitigate the huge arrival of 
so many arms, drugs, fugitives (including pedophiles) into the 
country, and the impact of the romanticizing of violence, most of 
this from the United States.
 § On-site evaluation of how to conciliate the great attention to 
containing human violence, by enclosing the students and educa -
tors in barbwire fencing, small gates, and guards (who are often 
off on errands), and lack of the open spaces not under roofs 
and ceilings, with realistic preparation for the mass movement 
of students, educators, rescuers, hysterical parents, and water, 
sediments, and lack of electricity in case of a disaster such as an 
earthquake, fire or huge storm.
Results
 § Only two local governments responded to the concern about 
the contradiction between measures of containing human vio -
lence and preparation for disasters and emergencies, facilitating 
an investigation, which made recommendations to 17 schools. 
However, technical solutions for key problems, such as economical 
remote locks that the guards can handle at a distance and that 
are not dependent on the electrical system have not been found.
<<<PAGE=171>>>
Chapter 9. Evaluation Standards for Latin America and the Caribbean - Experimentation and Evolution  149
Results
 § In two other local governments, there was a surprising regularity 
of attendance at our workshops for 125 youth facilitators of 
peace and security in their schools and communities (including 
students from 25 high schools), given the schedule of 6 all-day 
Saturday sessions, and the distances to travel that were required. 
Through gaining confidence with the students, and interviewing 
them, it was understood that the great majority were at least 
partially motivated because they have violent internal family situa -
tions, and most had not shared that information with anyone.
 § Naturally, they contributed considerably to penetrating the 
world of violence in which they are living, and are observing.
 § The students gained confidence by their preparing 25 videos 
of their own artistic creations, including themes not presented 
in the conferences of experts and authorities. Their artistic 
renditions have been circulated to many schools and local child 
protection committees.
 § Advice was given to municipal commissions, educators, and 
student commissions on their respective work plans regarding 
violence, and help in articulating with local agencies.
 § Several high schools enabled the training of educators on how 
to attend to adolescents traumatized by violence.
 § The government agency in charge of helping endangered victims 
and witnesses did not show an interest in an offer to create a 
video about their services to circulate among educators.
 § This project was curtailed abruptly, as the Ministry of Education 
created new protocols, insisting that they were to be “supreme 
and exclusive,” although they were not adapted to the realities 
discovered in the demonstration projects.
Lessons 
learned
 § Organized commissions in two municipalities facilitated the 
project´s activity of the youth in favor of more peace and secu -
rity in the community, and officials in two other municipalities 
facilitated inspections on how to prepare schools better, with 
periodic evaluation of what was undertaken, until the project 
was curtailed abruptly. The Public Education Ministry is now, 
several years later, reviewing what happened in this regard.
 § The last few years we have attended 11 forums on dealing with 
violence in communities and schools in Costa Rica, with more 
than 65 conferences by international experts and national coun -
terparts of executing agencies, of which very few shared lessons 
of the realities of their field experiences. By far most made pro -
paganda for what was and will be intended. Several key themes 
or factors in the game were never mentioned in the conferences, 
and only in a few cases was there opportunity for discussion.
 § The governmental and university organizations dedicated to 
preparation for disasters showed no interest in the problem of 
conflict of measures regarding violence that have put so many 
students and educators in jeopardy. This is now being under -
taken, but the criteria for selecting model schools are very 
deficient and impractical; and the models have serious defects. 
Hopefully, this new program will take lessons from what was 
undertaken by the project.

5. Taking lessons from exceptional patients, with due attention to critical 
factors that are receiving inadequate attention
Back-
ground
Many recent panel studies of clinical trials of oncological patients 
in different countries show that 5–10% of patients survive more 
than three times the average life span of all patients receiving 
treatment. There is a great need to draw lessons from the experi -
ence of these and other exceptional patients.
Intent for 
target 
popula -
tion
 § Anthologies of biographies of exceptional patients to see what 
antecedents, conditions, coping, and complementary treatments 
they have or have adopted.
 § Special attention to the huge challenges for the family care -
giver, internal familial tensions, impact on family children and 
adolescents, medical and neuropsychological services, support 
groups, and implicit suicide chosen by so many ill people who are 
suffering more financially, or for other reasons, than physically or 
emotionally.
 § Wide circulation of these lessons, to enhance medical and neu -
ropsychological attention beyond just following epidemiological 
tendencies, to help transcend those tendencies; this can take the 
form of textbooks, manuals for patients and family caregivers, 
protocols for medical personnel and neuropsychologists, indica -
tors for researchers, and brochures for children and adolescents.
 § Helping with comparative (and hopefully also international) 
studies of R&D on these patients, with an emphasis on M&E 
of the impact of agency programs for patients and family 
caregivers.
Results
 § Intensive research is in process in very extraordinary cases to 
serve as prototypes for more extensive studies.
 § Preliminary findings have been shared with medical personnel 
and neuropsychologists, family caregivers of dementia and pal -
liative care patients, and with support groups—e.g., for the 115 
Costa Rican cancer patients who suffered overradiation in their 
cobalt treatments.
 § Some exceptional university programs and NGOs in public health 
do show interest in what is being discovered, and in seeing how 
to adjust their agendas and procedures accordingly, especially 
with family caregivers.
 § Key challenges continue to be treated very marginally or excep -
tionally for the seriously ill, including exceptional patients 
who are also being evaluated: e.g., children in families with a 
medical crisis or premature death of a very ill sibling or parent; in 
general, intrafamily relationships that are so often tense and con -
flictive, affecting both the patient and the key family caregiver.
 § Social health agencies and programs interested in impact M&E of 
their programs are being helped to engage university students 
undertaking their fieldwork or internships, with the intention 
that when feasible they can elaborate on and test badly needed 
protocols.
<<<PAGE=173>>>
Chapter 9. Evaluation Standards for Latin America and the Caribbean - Experimentation and Evolution  151
Lessons 
learned
 § The experience of 115 cancer patients who in 1996 suffered 
overradiation is a prelude to what is evident in Costa Rica and 
even more elsewhere, such as the United States: that legal, 
paradigmatic, and ideological currents can greatly impede due 
attention to factors that can explain the prolonging and quality 
of life for exceptional patients.
 § The emphasis has been on indemnification for malpractice pallia -
tive care, ideological debates regarding euthanasia, and the usual 
benchmarks in clinical trials, at the expense of due attention to 
the possibility of prolonging the length and quality of patients’ 
lives.
 § A key problem for evaluation can be the chaos or “snarl” in han -
dling patient medical records, including legal handling.
 § Family caregivers are more receptive to taking lessons from excep-
tional patients, but they are imbued with very haphazard support 
for what they have to resolve, and ironically the meager attention 
they do receive focuses almost exclusively on some of the onerous 
tasks before them, and not on the personal benefits they often 
derive from caregiving; this is evident in the most frequently used 
questionnaires and protocols for caregivers.
 § The most positive impact has been with patients, but the impact 
is limited by the enclosed perspectives of the general discourse 
on this subject, and that of professional and informal caregivers.
 § There is attention to an incipient movement, especially in Europe, 
to alter the perspective of medical personnel and neuropsychol -
ogists on this matter, e.g., that palliative care can be given early 
on, and may assure more prolongation as well as quality of life, 
not just preparation for a more serene death.
6. Knowledge management for older adults
Back-
ground
Costa Rica´s legislation is rather unique in recognizing the impor -
tance of two particular interests with regard to older adults: to 
enhance, adapt, and take advantage of their accumulated empirical 
intelligence; and to have a direct role in the design and evaluation 
of programs and projects for their generation. However, we see 
very little application of these principles.
Intent for 
target 
popula -
tion
 § Guidance on recapitulation of his or her accumulated intelli -
gence, and how to transmit the lessons and benefits of that 
knowledge to succeeding generations.
 § Voice and vote in the design and evaluation of the programs and 
projects intended to enhance the older adult´s quality of life.
Results
 § There has been spotty acceptance among some public and 
private agencies in helping foster and organize this initiative, but 
overall there have been many obstacles.
 § There has been much less progress than hoped for with these 
intentions, and thus with the evaluation of the experience.
 § In one suburban zone, an older adult association is strongly com -
mitted to pursuing these intentions; which offers some hope.
<<<PAGE=174>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
152
Lessons 
learned
 § Older adults, including the more educated, believe that they are 
to be retired, respected, entertained, and perhaps educated in 
some subjects, but not with the type of activity intended in this 
project.
 § To our surprise, much more than with professionals attending to 
adolescents and youth, where adult-centrism was expected (in 
projects 1–4 above), those attending to older adults generally 
were adamantly against these objectives, possibly fearing a con -
flict between the need for caregiving and program management.
 § The older adult is beset with stigmas held by others, and even 
with self-adoption of such stigma.
7. Effects on communities and users of transportation and communications 
public service investments in buffer, forest, plantation, and mining zones
Back-
ground
There is a strong sense that these investments enhance transitory 
exploitation and not sustainable development of these zones, con -
tributing linking to socio-environmental conflicts; great distortions 
in the added value chain of local products; and higher user costs 
affecting all sectors. This is an example of a problem or conflict 
resolution apparently being a predictable precedent of others.
Intent for 
target 
popula -
tion
 § To know the role of transportation and communications in the 
evolution of community and family economic sustenance and 
survival strategies.
 § To study the options and the predominant criteria of investments 
in these sectors.
 § To know the role of the predominant models for these invest -
ments and protocols by academics and international cooperation.
Results
 § Initial studies of Central Appalachia in the United States, and 
central and southern Costa Rica.
 § Probing of other case studies and a historical overview of the 
application of international cooperation models in Latin America.
 § Preliminary results indicate historical adoption of similar 
investment models of earlier private investors and later public 
agencies.
 § The highly influential evolution (really, several huge evolutions) 
of the globalization strategy of transnational corporations has 
not been well addressed in economic development studies of 
Latin America.
Lessons 
learned
 § The significance of this for the community and families who live 
in it has been largely overlooked by economic historians and 
anthropologists.
 § Interviews with older residents of these zones give inconsistent 
versions of community and family history; there is a need for 
more creative methods, such as theatrical representations, of 
that reality.
 § This appears to vouch for the great need in Central America of 
R&D-focused university majors in transportation economics.

The Role of Monitoring and 
Evaluation in the MENA Region, 
with a Focus on the Arab Uprising 
Countries
Sonia Ben Jaafar and Awny Amer
Abstract . The demands of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for the Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals in the Middle East and North Africa region are particularly challenging. 
The diversity of the 22 countries; a large and youthful population; unprecedented 
political transitions; and a variety of conflicts and humanitarian crises have created a 
cluster of complex development needs. Development aid activity in the region is now 
operating in a landscape of high accountability demands and traditionally poor gover -
nance practices. This chapter explores the way these regional transitions are cultivating 
a new paradigm that promotes national capacities and country M&E systems in which 
local M&E professionals are valued and supported in the development of their own 
countries and region.

T
he Arab region is comprised of 22 countries in Northern Africa, the Levant, 
and the Arabian Peninsula. This region, which is known as the Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) region, has a population of approximately 
350 million, the majority of which is under the age of 25.
1 The current chal-
lenges affecting this region are partially tied to an unprecedented wave of 
political transition that has swept the region since 2010, coupled with an 
increasing number of conflicts. According to the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP):
2
Weak social, political and administrative accountability mechanisms and 
politically oriented socioeconomic planning models have resulted in the 
neglect of large parts of the population. These nations face the chal -
lenge of forming new, accountable governments that reflect popular 
aspirations.
THE ARAB UPRISING
The Arab Uprising refers to a series of antigovernment protests, uprisings, 
and armed rebellions across the Middle East that surfaced in 2010. By 2012, 
the rulers in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen had been pushed out of power; 
civil uprisings had erupted in Bahrain and Syria; there were major protests 
in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, and Sudan; and minor protests had 
occurred in Djibouti, Mauritania, Oman, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and Western 
Sahara (Smith 2016). This revolutionary atmosphere in the Arab region was 
tempered in the Gulf states, where a more reformist approach took root 
(Abdalla 2012). The Gulf monarchies demonstrated the ability to adapt to 
regional shifts and to address internal issues with policy measures, by using 
their “oil wealth, historical legitimacy, Bedouin culture, demographic scarcity, 
extensive security services, patriarchal regimes, and the absence of an oppo-
sition and political parties” (Abdalla 2012, 30).
Moreover, according to UNDP’s 2015 Human Development Report, 
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are ranked 
among the top countries in the Arab region in terms of average income per 
capita (UNDP 2015) and the economic competitiveness index,
3 which creates 
a certain level of comfort for their people. For example, the United Arab Emir-
ates leads the Arab states, and is considered globally as one of the happiest 
countries: in the 2015 World Happiness Report, it is given special mention as 
an example of a country in which well-being has been made a central tenet of 
the design and delivery of the national agenda (Heliwell, Layard, and Sacha 
2015).

Chapter 10. The Role of Monitoring and Evaluation in the MENA Region, with a Focus on the Arab Uprising Countries  157
However, for the purposes of this chapter, we will discuss the chal -
lenges with an emphasis on the majority of the region, where there has been 
revolutionary upheaval and a large impact on development. We focus on the 
impact of more than 11 million people forced from their homes in Syria; 4 an 
estimated 7 million internally displaced people within Syria; and more than 
4 million who have fled Syria as refugees, a large portion of them landing in 
Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. We focus on the impact of an initially peaceful 
uprising in Libya that quickly became an armed conflict with Western military 
intervention. According to Amnesty International,
5 once Libya had become 
deeply divided, the internal conflict has caused civilians to live in a constant 
state of threat, with nearly 2.5 million people in need of humanitarian assis-
tance, clean water, sanitation, and food since 2014. In this chapter, we focus 
on the areas in crisis, which has drawn international attention and aid, because 
the potential to meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets in the 
region is increasingly bleak. 
DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY
The key driver in this unprecedented regional call for change is the call for 
greater accountability from the government to the people. This root demand 
has thrust the role of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to a new level of 
significance, giving it greater value for all stakeholders. As M&E and account-
ability have been becoming more important to the local populations, donors 
are more interested in the effectiveness of aid in the region. The SDGs that 
are key priorities in MENA countries focus on ongoing and intersecting issues 
of poverty, hunger, health, education, energy, equity, economic downturns, 
climate, peace, and stability in the region. 
As aid funding increased in a progressively complex and challenging 
region during the aftermath of the Iraq War, so did attention to develop-
ing specific mechanisms to ensure aid effectiveness. This promoted solutions 
like the application of results-based management to program, thematic, and 
sectoral evaluations, rather than simple project evaluations (UNDG 2011). 
Solutions such as country-level evaluations that consider coordinating the 
efforts of multiple donors with joint criteria will contribute to ensuring the 
effectiveness of the evaluation processes (Baradei, Abdelhamid, and Wally 
2014). Although this shift is not restricted to the Middle East and North 
Africa, the region has grave challenges in adopting these solutions because 
of traditional social, political, and economic practices that are unaccustomed 
to the three key pillars of results-based management: accountability, national 
ownership, and inclusiveness (UNEG 2011), pillars that happen to align with 
the reverberations of the Arab Uprising.

Given this reality, the M&E community in the region has been increas-
ingly focused on accountability, national ownership, and inclusiveness. Some 
of the issues of core importance to the M&E community follow:
 n Accountability as it pertains to the extent of the relationship 
between the impact of aid effectiveness and the level of effort 
from implementing and donor organizations; and the value added 
of M&E processes in terms of corrective program actions and policy 
changes
 n Inclusiveness as it pertains to the role of the beneficiaries of aid 
efforts in relation to implementing partners; the traditional North-
South paradigm, in which development interventions and M&E are 
conducted primarily for donors; and the lack of shared accrued 
knowledge derived from M&E that adds to the future indepen-
dence of local actors and organizations
 n National ownership as it pertains to the extent of local M&E capac-
ity and professionalism; and the extent of involvement of local 
leadership in assessing the effectiveness of the aid received 
These areas of focus align tightly with evaluation of the SDG plans and 
programs that necessitate the involvement of national efforts to cultivate 
appropriate evaluation capabilities at all levels and across all stakeholders (El- 
Saddik et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that although accountability is a shared 
value across the globe, with good governance as a core element, the Arab 
region lagged behind other regions in most governance indicators in 2015 
(UN 2013). Given that good governance is not only essential for accountabil-
ity, but is also a gateway to inclusion and national ownership, M&E efforts in 
the region are arduous and highly political. Local M&E professionals work 
within very challenging parameters in their attempts to change the landscape 
on the path to meeting the SDG targets.
An illustrative example of the limited role of M&E in the region is the 
need for the Taqeem Initiative, which was established in 2009 by a partner -
ship between the International Labour Organization, Silatech, the World Bank, 
the Jacobs Foundation, and the Swedish International Development Founda-
tion. Taqeem was specifically created to support youth employment policy 
makers and practitioners in enhancing the M&E of their programs (ILO 2009). 
The lack of evaluation information on youth employment programs 
in the region is telling, given that it is mostly populated by youth,
6 and that 
the youth employment challenge is a critical issue that threatens the already 
fragile economic and political state of many countries in the region. Creat -
ing opportunities for Arab youth has long been a leading policy priority for 
international organizations, governments, nongovernmental organizations, 
and social entrepreneurs. Traditional and nontraditional programs, projects,

<<<PAGE=181>>>
Chapter 10. The Role of Monitoring and Evaluation in the MENA Region, with a Focus on the Arab Uprising Countries  159
initiatives, and partnerships have been thrust upon the region by both local 
and foreign organizations. The Taqeem Initiative targets these particular solu-
tions and helps local organizations drive quality M&E while creating a regional 
database of evaluation information that will help policy decisions concerned 
with solving the youth employment challenge.
Although institutionalization of the Taqeem Initiative is laudable, it is 
regrettable that the culture of the region did not already have the demand 
and supply of M&E for these solutions to meet a vital regional challenge. 
The reality of the situation is well summarized in a recent study of the state 
of M&E in post-revolutionary Egypt, in which the authors highlight the fact 
that the government urgently needs effective support “to demonstrate and 
measure the results of each policy” (Baradei, Abdelhamid, and Wally 2014).
THE CHALLENGES OF EVALUATING RESULTS FOR 
DEVELOPMENT
The regional M&E community has been sharing knowledge to identify key 
issues that contribute to promoting the demand for the evaluation of devel-
opment results in response to a rising public demand. A series of strategic 
discussions and debates across MENA countries have taken place to better 
appreciate the current situation of M&E processes and practices in the region 
(El Kabbag 2011). The following key challenges have been identified as barri-
ers to normalizing supportive M&E in the region. 
A deterring culture of evaluation (El Kabbag 2011) . In most MENA coun-
tries evaluation is tightly coupled with undesirable beliefs about the impact 
of the results. In this context, evaluation has either no influence at all, or grave 
consequences for local stakeholders and projects. Evaluation is believed to 
be restricted to audits and financial reviews that demonstrate inefficiencies 
or corruption, or public reviews that expose fraud. It is also believed that it 
is only relevant to donors for the purpose of satisfying bureaucratic require-
ments; that it is conducted apart from the beneficiary communities; and that 
it is tied solely to outputs, with no regard for outcomes and impact, and all 
of the other traditional high-stakes and potentially harmful ways evaluation 
has been used in the past. 
The status quo is the norm . Most of the organizations in MENA have a 
culture of following evaluation processes that are stagnant within the organi-
zation. This static reality is in contrast to an evaluation approach that focuses 
on a dynamic and holistic perspective designed to transform the organization 
for the better. 
National capacities are not ready for change . Given that the MENA region 
has not had a strong historical integration of M&E into their public gover -
nance, it is not surprising that there is a less than adequate national capacity 
in many of the countries, at both the governmental and civil society levels. 
In particular, evaluators in the region generally do not have ready access 
to accredited M&E training, and have gaps in some of their knowledge and
<<<PAGE=182>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
160
skills. For example, there are gaps in adopting minimum standards of ethics 
during the evaluation process. There is also a gap in knowledge on how to use 
system-level data, because many governments have incomplete, inaccurate, 
insufficient or dated data. 
Lack of good governance affecting good evaluation . As previously stated, 
the Arab region has one of the poorest governance records globally. When 
we consider the indicators of good governance, such as voice, accountability, 
and governmental effectiveness, it is evident that poor governance will have a 
significant influence on evaluation practices (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 
2010). This situation is part of the overall socio-political context that is being 
called into question with the Arab Uprising. 
A non-enabling environment for developing evidence-based policy  . Evi-
dence-based policy is rooted in responsible government, which has become 
a mantra in the post-Arab Uprising MENA region. Evidence-based policy is 
expected to reduce wasteful spending, expand innovative programs, and 
strengthen accountability (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2010). Part 
of the framework for this approach, which enables governments to make 
better choices, is program assessment, outcome monitoring, and targeted 
evaluation. Regrettably, a lack of good governance is often tied to a lack of 
evidence-based policy. The situation in the Arab region is such that the track-
ing of progress at the policy level for SDGs and Millennium Development 
Goals has been, and continues to be, a key challenge. This means that in 
addition to a low supply, there is a low demand for M&E.
PROFESSIONALIZATION OF M&E IN THE MENA REGION
The challenges presented in the previous section are directly tied to the 
systematically poor governance that created the conditions for the Arab 
Uprising. M&E supply and demand have been less significant in the past, but 
the uprising, and the subsequent attention to SDGs have exposed an urgent 
need for M&E. Local governments and the international community are now 
promoting accountability and unveiling a substantive demand. At the same 
time, the M&E communities of professionals have been working to create an 
enabling environment for M&E. The regional professionalization of M&E spe-
cifically promotes national ownership and inclusion, and activates an evolved 
accountability that goes beyond the conducting of external audits to appease 
donor distrust (Segone 2009).
The increasingly high demand for M&E professionals in the MENA 
region is an issue, especially since quality M&E requires an investment of 
time and resources in order to plan, collect data, and report appropriately. 
Increasing efforts to professionalize the field are leading to improved evalu-
ations and better evidence. This increases the demand for more and better 
evidence, which in turn stimulates further improvements in professionalism. 
However, program and operational funds in organizations in this region often 
neglect to budget for appropriate M&E, for various reasons. The key issue, 
a lack of data culture, which makes for a situation in which it is difficult to
<<<PAGE=183>>>
Chapter 10. The Role of Monitoring and Evaluation in the MENA Region, with a Focus on the Arab Uprising Countries  161
cultivate M&E professionals, has been addressed with multiple efforts by 
international and local organizations. 
In particular, the launch of the Middle East and North Africa Evaluators 
Network (EvalMENA) in 2012 galvanized M&E professionals at the regional 
level. EvalMENA is an informal network of stakeholders who are dedicated to 
professionalizing M&E in the region. It aims to promote and strengthen M&E 
culture and practices in all the MENA countries by encouraging country-level 
professional M&E associations, and by offering a networking platform for 
thoughtful debate about local issues and solutions. 
The work of EvalMENA is practical and addresses local issues. The 
success of the organization is largely due to the fact that inclusiveness was–
and continues to be—a fundamental building block of the organization and 
all the practices of EvalMENA. This success includes lobbying for M&E, net -
working events, capacity building, creating new evaluation associations, and 
professionalization efforts. The inception of the organization was a research 
and development project championed by the Environment and Sustainable 
Development unit of the American University of Beirut, with technical and 
financial support provided by the International Development Research Centre 
in Canada (IDRC). However, even with donor funding and appropriate sup-
portive guidance from IDRC, the leadership and working teams have always 
been local Arab professionals. Since its inception in 2008, EvalMENA has 
managed to achieve the following (Moussa 2015).
Bringing MENA evaluators together, in the region and around the world . 
In 2013, the membership was made up of 146 evaluators from 23 countries. 
By 2015, the membership had grown to 360 members from 38 countries. 
Most of the members were from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, 
and Tunisia, with a small minority from North America. Currently, the mem-
bership is over 500 members, indicating a growing interest and support for 
the vision of EvalMENA.
Promoting and supporting seven new national evaluation associations . 
National ownership and local inclusion has been a top priority of EvalMENA 
since the inception of the network. The formalization and maturation of the 
Moroccan Evaluation Association (MEA) has been an important catalyst in 
the region. MEA has now matured to the point where its work with policy 
makers in Morocco is allowing them to take an important seat at the same 
table with the highest level of government. The success of MEA has proved 
to be a catalyst in the formalization of six more new networks: the Egyptian 
Research and Education Network (EREN) in 2012; the Palestinian Evaluation 
Association (PEA) in 2013; the Jordan Evaluation Association (EvalJordan) in 
2014; the Tunisian Evaluation Association (RTE) in 2014; the Lebanese Evalua-
tion Association (LebEval) in 2014; and the Egyptian Development Evaluation 
Network (EgDEval) in 2015.
All of these new associations are now actively contributing to the lead-
ership and management of EvalMENA, and are promoting its vision at the 
national level.

Organizing five annual regional conferences between 2012-16 . The Arab 
culture places a high value on face-to-face networking. Given the critical impor-
tance of bringing M&E professionals together to share and create knowledge 
that is localized for the region, it was—and is—important to hold local 
conferences. As the membership and national ownership has grown, Eval -
MENA has shared and distributed leadership and responsibilities among the 
participating countries, while offering them ongoing support. As table 10.1 
indicates, the national organizations have taken ownership of the regional 
vision. This is especially impressive after the initial IDRC funding ended, as 
the national and regional organizations collaborated to find other funding 
sources to continue the work.
Promoting MENA to an international audience through active leadership 
in the global evaluation movement . The context within the MENA region 
is becoming increasingly challenging, with humanitarian crises becoming the 
norm. The stunted progress in many Arab countries is cultivating high-risk 
zones. This creates a two-pronged problem with respect to local capacities. 
First, local M&E professionals are not plentiful in the region, and donors 
are more comfortable with M&E professionals who have more experience 
and formal training. Second, local M&E professionals are in greater demand, 
because foreign M&E officers are less and less able to access the zones where 
information is most needed. 
EvalMENA has been working strategically to achieve recognition for 
the region’s M&E professionals from the international community. Given 
that most donors are part of the international community, this recognition is 
important for donor trust of local capacity. 
As regional annual conferences have gained traction in the region, M&E 
professionals have gained increasing access, awareness, and encouragement

to be actively involved in the global evaluation movement. For example, 
active EvalMENA members have become executive board members of the 
International Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS), the International 
Organization for Cooperation in Evaluation (IOCE), the Africa Gender and 
Development Evaluators Network (AGDEN), and the African Evaluation 
Association (AfrEA), including the AfrEA presidency in 2012 and the IOCE 
presidency and EvalPartners cochair for 2015–16. These leadership roles 
have demonstrated to many members of the international community that 
high-level M&E professionals are present, and ready to contribute to the work 
in the MENA region. It has also shown Arab M&E officers that there are oppor-
tunities to grow professionally, and to engage with global networks. 
Launching of the first online training course on development evalua-
tion in Arabic  . The first online training course on development evaluation 
in Arabic was launched in 2014 on the “My M&E” portal. This is a significant 
accomplishment because it is an Arabic course that is listed on a high-profile 
site along with courses from UNICEF and UN Women. This course boasts a 
credibility that is valued by donors and international agencies. Since it was 
launched, 276 Arab-speaking individuals with an interest in learning about 
M&E have successfully completed the course. It is noteworthy that many of 
the participants are from Iraq, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, countries where there 
is no national network for evaluators. This online course helps Arabs who 
have limited local access to opportunities learn and share knowledge about 
development evaluation overcome an important barrier to joining the M&E 
community. This is particularly important as online learning, as an information 
and communications technology (ICT)–based solution, becomes increasingly 
vital for promoting access to learning in conflict and poverty-affected areas. 
The course continues to be accessed by Arabs who are hopeful about further 
developing their M&E knowledge, skills, and professional network.

Facilitating South-South collaboration on evaluation within and beyond 
the MENA region . As we move into a new paradigm that values and pro-
motes inclusion and national ownership in M&E, it is essential that there is a 
shift from the traditional North-South donor-recipient mentality to a shared 
values and joint work mentality. South-South collaborations promote the 
notion that all parties to the partnership are equally valuable, and that they 
aim to achieve a shared goal. In strategically bringing together and supporting 
so many actors in the region, EvalMENA has cultivated a culture for knowl -
edge sharing and creation. In addition to the EvalMENA-sponsored national 
workshops and events organized in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco, 
three projects won the 2014 Peer-to-Peer small grants from IOCE:

All of these accomplishments in professionalizing M&E in the region would 
be notable at any time. But it is particularly impressive and relevant given that 
all of these activities took place in the aftermath of the Arab Uprising, one of 
the most turbulent periods in the recent history of the region. The instability of 
the region necessitates rethinking M&E approaches in general, but especially in 
areas where there are humanitarian emergencies. This is particularly true where 
there is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis with predictions for worse to come, 
as is the case in this region. According to the United Nations High Commission 
for Refugees, the conflict and violence in Iraq and Yemen have displaced 4.5 
and 2.18 million people, respectively; and the conflict in Syria has displaced 
4.8 million people who are seeking safety in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and beyond.
8
The commitment of the national M&E communities to develop national 
evaluation capacities for the SDGs was exemplified by Egypt’s willingness to 
conduct a voluntary review of the SDGs at the United Nations High Level 
Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2016. More than 60 repre-
sentatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, foundations, 
academia, youth, special interest groups (women, environment, startups, 
etc.), and development partners were invited by the government of Egypt 
to discuss the road map for implementing and monitoring the SDGs. The 
meeting was hosted by the Ministry of International Cooperation, and co-or -
ganized by UNDP and the World Bank, as part of their joint effort to raise 
awareness about the SDGs in Egypt. This group focused on Egypt Vision 
2030, the national sustainable development strategy.
In a spirit of accountability, Egypt volunteered to report on their efforts 
to achieve the agenda: they reported that engaging with local interest groups 
is pivotal to building ownership of the SDGs; capitalizing on local efforts for 
knowledge and resources; and increasing mutual accountability of national devel-
opment results.
9 The practical outcome of the report is a series of elements that 
need to be addressed through collective action. These are as follows:

 n Tackle the data gap, and map national status . The local groups 
expressed their readiness to support the monitoring and follow-up 
of the SDGs. They identified the need to set baselines for all SDG 
goals and targets. 
 n Integrate the implementation efforts of local groups led by 
national authorities . A big challenge is to integrate the efforts 
of government bodies and ministries for the implementation of 
the SDGs with other nonstate actors. Terms of reference will be 
developed for different goals where a multidisciplinary working 
group composed of government and key group representatives will 
support the implementation of the SDGs. 
 n Build partnerships with nonstate actors, especially the civil 
society sector . In parallel with the review work, Egypt Vision 2030 
was formulated through an extensive nationwide consultation 
process. The 2030 agenda provides a platform for government and 
nonstate actors to initiate discussions around common areas of 
work, and to complement their efforts to achieve national priorities.
As in Egypt, all of the countries in the region are promoting greater 
local capacity and ownership of M&E as a key element in strengthening M&E 
practices in connection with the SDGs. The notion that local M&E talent 
should be used is obvious within a modern paradigm where inclusion and 
national ownership are core values. For those organizations that have yet to 
shift into this approach, there is a more practical reason to leverage local M&E 
capacities. According to a study released in 2015 on M&E practices during 
humanitarian emergencies (Jansury et al. 2015), M&E is a means for inter -
national organizations to use in addressing issues of access and security in 
complex emergencies. Organizations can choose to either work through local 
partners (nongovernmental organizations), or to employ local staff. 
Although there are challenges to including local M&E professionals, the 
benefits have been shown to be important. For example, in 2010 the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission implemented 
the Yemen Monitoring and Evaluation Project. This project used third-party 
local partners to provide on-the-ground performance monitoring, verification, 
and evaluation of USAID activities. They were able to successfully identify 
problems in the quality of some of the Community Livelihood Project’s reha-
bilitation activities, and of goods delivered. This was especially important as 
security deteriorated after the Arab Uprising, and U.S. employees could no 
longer access some regions of the country to monitor and identify problems 
with project activities (Office of Inspector General 2015). 
These are the kinds of success stories that demonstrate that local M&E 
professionals can, and should, be involved in the work of foreign aid projects. 
It is unfortunate that this is not a normative practice despite the discourse 
concerning local engagement among many donors and foreign aid organiza-
tions. For example, the USAID Office of Inspector General conducted a survey 
to identify the challenges USAID faced during the early transition period (Q4 
2010–Q3 2014) in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen. One of their conclusions
<<<PAGE=188>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
166
was a recommendation to employ third-party monitors in transitional situa-
tions because they “can help an office gain access to regions of a country that 
become inaccessible to U.S. direct hires or when U.S. personnel are ordered 
to evacuate” (Office of Inspector General 2015).
Moving beyond the “absolute necessity” argument of international 
organizations delivering foreign aid, local M&E professional communities are 
shifting the role of M&E within their local governance systems. For example, 
PEA has offered training on the evaluation of humanitarian programs that is 
focused on evaluation design and methodology; facilitated national round -
table discussions on the evaluation of SDGs; and collaborated with members 
of the Palestinian Legislative Council to systematize M&E activities within 
government initiatives. Another example is EREN, which has co-offered semi-
nars on evaluation for improving governance practices with Plan International, 
and workshops with government officials on results-based management with 
UNICEF. They have also been working with local governments’ policy briefs, 
and through a national conference on country-led M&E have focused on pro-
moting transparency and efficiency with policy makers. 
These efforts have been matched with those of other local organiza-
tions committed to including M&E professionals on staff despite the supply 
challenge. For example, a recent study in Egypt found that most organizations 
involved with development M&E provide training internally, in which “much of 
the training conducted is done through on-the-job learning” (Baradei, Abdel -
hamid, and Wally 2014). In addition, local organizations face a high turnover 
in the M&E role, in part because qualified M&E officers are in short supply 
and thus often highly sought after by other organizations (ILO 2009). This 
often means that when local organizations do dedicate the time and budget 
to training program officers to become M&E officers, other organizations—
often international ones with greater resources than local ones—poach 
talented and trained program officers once they have the experience and 
background to conduct M&E work in the region (Boitnott 2015). 
CONCLUSION
Well-intentioned external parties often treat the MENA region as a mono-
lithic entity. But the countries within the MENA region are very diverse. UNDP 
identifies four distinct groups of countries within MENA: the Mashreq and 
Maghreb countries, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the 
least developed countries (UN 2013). International organizations that do not 
differentiate the needs within the region learn their lesson after implementa-
tion issues have been identified. For example, in the evaluation of the Media 
Cooperation under the Danish Arab Partnership Programme (2005–12), 
which was commissioned by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was 
found that the cultural context differs in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, 
and Tunisia, creating conditions in which a uniform regional approach across 
all Media Cooperation Programme themes is not conducive to achieving the 
best results (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark 2013). In this regard, it is 
worth saying that commissioners of evaluations tend to lay the responsibility 
for the findings with the evaluators, not with themselves.

Chapter 10. The Role of Monitoring and Evaluation in the MENA Region, with a Focus on the Arab Uprising Countries  167
The inclusion and national ownership movement is essential for finding 
sustainable solutions for one of the most volatile youthful parts of the world. 
The paradigm shift in terms of development in the MENA region is tied to 
the current state of development in general. Cultivating accountability, inclu-
siveness, and national ownership is a challenge in a region where there is a 
continuing war, and a growing humanitarian crisis. (More than 5 million people 
have fled Syria since 2011, seeking safety in neighboring countries, and mil -
lions more are displaced inside Syria.
10) The unprecedented challenges in the 
region are drawing international attention and funding, with various solutions 
to help minimize the loss of life, hope, and health, and to reduce the condi-
tions of indignity for many people. These solutions are being constructed 
as aid provided with a traditional approach, which has yet to move beyond 
external accountability, and to value inclusiveness and national ownership. 
At the same time, measuring aid effectiveness in hazardous areas is opening 
new opportunities for local M&E professionals to gain experience, trust, and 
training from international agencies simply because these are the M&E people 
who are on the ground with access to the conflict areas (Jansury et al. 2015).
The evaluation efforts tied to the SDGs in MENA are increasingly 
aligned with the key principles of accountability, inclusiveness, and national 
ownership. This triad cultivates accountability for sustainable development 
when public policies are subject to local evaluations whose purpose is to 
ensure the best solutions for local issues. This approach means explicitly 
addressing the data gap and mapping national status along the SDG indica-
tors; integrating the efforts of major groups involved in implementation, led 
by national authorities; and building partnerships with nonstate actors, espe-
cially with civil society. This can only be achieved when local M&E systems 
and professionals are involved in the process. 
The country and regional efforts that have been contributed by local 
M&E professionals have been impressive. These initiatives are directly address-
ing the challenge of a low enabling environment coupled with restricted M&E 
skills and trustworthiness, which places Arab countries in an opinion-based 
as opposed to an evidence-based system (Segone 2009). The region’s M&E 
systems, capacities, demands, and professionalism are maturing. Dedicated 
local actors, such as the advocates and participants of EvalMENA, EREN, 
PEA, EvalJordan, RTE, LebEval, and EgDEval, are cultivating the culture for 
national evaluation processes to be aligned with other planning, budgeting, 
and statistics processes to drive the 2030 Agenda (El-Saddik et al. 2016). 
The demands of this era call for more international organizations and foreign 
donors to adopt the perspective of the IDRC and the Taqeem sponsors, in 
which local actors are regarded as partners with the capacity to support M&E 
and learning, and are appreciated as valuable assets to the development of 
their own countries and region.

Abstract . Successful pursuit of the recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals 
by the world community depends on appropriate national development policies and 
actions. These should be guided by considerations of social equity, gender equality, 
and respect for environmental stability, and must be supported by good governance in 
order to contain corruption. This chapter discusses the concept of good governance, 
with an emphasis on the mutually dependent and mutually reinforcing relationship 
between good governance and sound monitoring and evaluation. Recent efforts and 
initiatives to bring about improved governance and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
effectiveness in three South Asian countries—Bhutan, India, and Sri Lanka—are dis-
cussed. Initiatives in India and Sri Lanka designed to contain corruption in public service 
delivery and make it more transparent, and the significance of M&E in promoting good

governance and enhancing Gross National Happiness in Bhutan are described. These 
initiatives suggest some of the options available for leveraging M&E systems for good 
governance.
T
he adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on Sep-
tember 25, 2015, at the United Nations Summit, which formalized the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by the world 
community of nations by 2030, has placed the SDGs center stage in the 
global development process. Attaining the 17 complex, interrelated SDGs in 
various socioeconomic sectors, and achieving the multitude of targets corre-
sponding to each goal within the set time frame, has spurred action by the 
international community as well as by national governments to deliberate on 
what steps should be taken in order to make, measure, and assess progress 
toward these goals. While international action concerns sharpening of the 
goals and targets, and strengthening national capacities in measuring prog-
ress toward these goals, national governments are reviewing the capacities 
of their statistical and nonstatistical systems to respond to the requirements 
of such measurement. Attaining these goals calls for a systems approach, 
because the individual goals are not “in silos”: instead, they are mutually 
impacting, at times reinforcing, and on occasion, retarding other related 
goals. Multiple stakeholders—states, industries, civil society organizations 
(CSOs), and the community at large—must join hands and work together for 
this cause. While well-conceived policies and programs for equitable social 
and economic development through good governance can lead to sustain-
able development, sound monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems would 
accelerate that progress. Policies and programs can lead to far better results 
under a scenario of good governance than when governance is poor. Good 
governance and effective M&E systems, which are mutually dependent and 
mutually strengthening, can contribute to optimizing returns on investment. 
While good governance assumes willingness on the part of policy makers and 
program planners and implementers to be subjected to a critical review of 
their actions, and to learn from such assessment, a robust M&E system can 
operate with a good measure of success only within an enabling environment. 
The imperative need for these two elements to work together has never been 
as obvious as it will be in the pursuit of SDGs by nations over the next decade 
and half. A robust M&E system that integrates within itself the requirements 
of sustainable development, mainstreamed within the national development 
agenda, is essential.
This chapter focuses on the concept of good governance and the 
interrelationships between good governance and sound M&E systems for 
sustainable development. It presents recent experiments and experiences in 
good governance and M&E in three South Asian countries—Bhutan, India, 
and Sri Lanka—and argues that there is more than one viable option avail -
able. The approaches followed in various countries can provide good learning 
that can be replicated in other places.

THE CONCEPT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE
What is “governance,” and what is implied by “good governance”? In Kautilya’s 
Arthasashtra, good governance by a ruling king is described in these terms: “…
in the happiness of his subjects lies his happiness, in their welfare his welfare.”1
The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific (ESCAP) defines governance as “the process of decision-making and 
the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented)” in 
corporate, local, national or international contexts (ESCAP n.d.). Governance, 
therefore, is the result of the collective interaction of the decision making and 
implementing actions of the various actors and institutions concerned includ-
ing those in both the public and private spheres of action: government at the 
national and local levels, industry, trade unions, CSOs, influential individual 
players, and even various organs of the media. 
The World Bank, in its studies in more than 200 countries, has devel -
oped several indicators to measure the quality of governance using six 
dimensions: voice and accountability; political stability and absence of vio-
lence; government effectiveness; regulatory quality; rule of law; and control 
of corruption.
2 The World Bank views good governance as a necessary pre-
condition for development, and the Human Development Report has defined 
good governance “as a democratic exigency [that], in order to [rid] societies of 
corruption, [gives] people the rights, the means, and the capacity to participate 
in the decisions that affect their lives and to hold their governments account-
able for what they do” (Nzongola-Ntalaja, as quoted in UN DESA 2007, 4). 
The United Nations has identified transparency, accountability, respon-
sibility, participation, and responsiveness as the core attributes of good 
governance. Good governance is increasingly viewed as an essential element 
of any well-functioning society: when resources are allocated and used 
effectively, and the delivery of services to citizens in an equitable manner 
is ensured, the government gains a good measure of social legitimacy.
3 The 
essential characteristics of good governance can be summarized as shown in 
figure 11.1.
Whatever the definition, good governance refers to a situation in which 
a set of institutions and actors combine to lead to sound processes of deci-
sion making, and the implementation of policies, programs, and projects that 
contribute to economic and social development, with “no one left behind.” 
“No one left behind” is the theme of the SDG agenda, and it is directly linked

believed to have been authored by Kautilya (also known as Chanakya and Vishnugupta)
c. 350–283 BCE. 
2 The Worldwide Governance Indicators project (http:/ /info.worldbank.org/
governance/wgi/#home) reports aggregate and individual governance indicators on 
these six dimensions of governance for more than 200 countries and territories over 
the period 1996–2016.

to good governance. The concept includes an element of flexibility in relation 
to its application in different country contexts: it may mean different things in 
different countries, depending on the cultures, traditions, political structures, 
economies, and levels of development. In a broad sense, good governance 
is an umbrella concept that covers respect for human rights, rule of law, 
an efficient and effective public sector, and processes of accountability and 
transparency of actions in public sphere. 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND M&E
There is a symbiotic relationship between good governance and M&E. Good 
governance creates an enabling environment for M&E, and M&E contributes 
to good governance. The former includes a keen desire on the part of the 
system to assess its own performance from time to time, to learn from expe-
rience, and to improve the outputs, outcomes, and impacts of the policies and 
programs it is pursuing. This is achieved through better planning, manage-
ment, and implementation (PM&E): and this in turn creates a demand and an 
enabling environment for M&E. 
Participation and responsiveness are two of the core attributes of 
good governance that also tend to increase the demand for M&E from civil 
society and other stakeholders. An enabling environment for M&E would also 
include the adoption of a clear national policy that promotes M&E in all its 
aspects, including the development of evaluation capacity, socially equitable

and gender-responsive elements, and the sustainability of evaluation. In turn, 
M&E works as a “reality check” tool for what authorities are saying about 
development, and what is really happening on the ground, and generates 
evidence-based lessons for the future, thereby contributing to knowledge, 
and suggesting policy and program modifications for enhanced future out -
comes. Good governance provides a way for good M&E systems to exist and 
evolve, while M&E systems provide governments with evidence and learning 
that helps in need-based policy planning, and the improvement of ongoing 
programs and learning. The relationship of good governance and M&E can be 
better understood from figure 11.2.
GOVERNANCE AND M&E IN INDIA: AN OVERVIEW
India’s constitution provides for a republic with a democratic, secular, and 
socialistic form of society: it places the principles of universal equality and 
social justice on a high pedestal. Appropriate affirmative action by the 
administration aims to raise the standard of living for the less socially and 
economically advantaged so that the gap between them and the rest of the 
society tapers off, and they can join the mainstream of development. The gov-
ernment aims to translate this intention into reality through a series of social 
and economic development policies, plans, and programs, through massive 
investment in the social sector. But huge investment does not necessarily 
produce the desired outcomes, unless it is operated in a scenario of sound 
governance. Good governance is critical to ensure that these investments 
lead to significant outcomes and impacts on the ground, through the efficient 
use of allocated resources; optimal management of public service delivery; 
and effective management of natural resources. 
In a democracy, rising income levels also bring with them rising expec-
tations among citizens, and a demand for good governance at all levels of 
the government: national, state, and local. Experience over the past over 
six decades indicates that while significant progress has been made in India

on most of the economic and social parameters, the impacts are not com-
mensurate with the resources utilized, and could have been vastly superior 
with better governance. A significant step-up is required, through systemic 
improvements in implementation; increased efficiency of public agencies in 
the delivery of services to consumers; and tackling the menace of corruption, 
which has siphoned off huge chunks of public investments.
The Indian system of governance has two types of actors—formal and 
informal. Formal actors include the national and state legislative bodies, 
the judiciary, government functionaries, and constitutional bodies such as 
the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Central 
Vigilance Commissioner, and organized industries and services in both the 
public and private sectors. Informal actors are the multitude of civil society 
organizations, academicians, the media, and the community. In the democratic 
set-up in India, both of these types of actors play an important role in plan-
ning and implementation. Together they contribute to the governance of the 
land as policy makers, enforcers of the enacted policies and laws, program 
planners, providers and receivers of various goods and services, and guard -
ians of citizens’ rights. In terms of economic and social development, there 
is broad consensus concerning the goals of inclusive and sustainable growth 
and gender equality, in line with global objectives and standards.
The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), an orga-
nization that replaced the 60-year-old Planning Commission, is currently the 
main think tank for Indian policy makers on developmental issues.
4 NITI is 
looking forward to maintaining a state-of-the-art resource center, to be a 
repository of research on good governance and best practices in sustainable 
and equitable development, as well as to help them disseminate results of 
such research to stakeholders. NITI is also responsible for actively monitor -
ing and evaluating the implementation of programs, and for identifying the 
resources needed to strengthen the probability of success and the scope 
of delivery. This is the main arm for M&E in the country: thus it is aimed at 
both strategic policy and program frameworks, and is monitoring both their 
progress and their efficacy. 
Recent Initiatives for Good Governance in India
India has a long history of policies and programs directed toward economic 
and social development, tuned to the principles of inclusiveness (five-year 
plans; for instance, see Government of India 2013). However, despite lofty 
ideals and goals, performance has often fallen short of expectations. The 
present government came to power with a motto of “minimum government 
and maximum governance.” In its objective of providing good governance, it 
has been seeking to simplify the delivery of services to citizens, and make 
the process as transparent and corruption-free as possible, primarily through 
the application of information technology as an interface between the

government and citizens. Some recent initiatives aimed at these goals can 
provide learning. 
Digital India . Digital India is a flagship program of the government of India, 
with a vision of transforming India into a digitally empowered society and 
knowledge economy. 
The program builds on various e-governance initiatives for wider sec -
toral applications, with an emphasis on citizen-centric services. The main 
pillars of the program include universal access to mobile connectivity, public 
Internet access, e-governance, electronic delivery of services (e-Kranti), and 
information for all. 
Jan Dhan Yojana .
5 A vast majority of the Indian population have tradition-
ally depended on informal financial services and remained outside of the 
formal banking system, making it difficult for service providers to reach them 
through formal channels. This informal system also gave birth to corruption. 
Jan Dhan Yojana is an important step taken by the government to mainstream 
that part of the population that has previously not been covered by banking 
services into the formal system by enabling and encouraging them to do 
so through incentives. Regular monitoring has indicated that until Decem-
ber 21, 2016, about 260.3 million savings bank accounts were opened under 
the scheme, 158.6 million of them in rural areas, and 101.7 million in urban 
areas, accounting for a total deposit balance of Rs 7,155.7 billion (or about 
$110 billion). This is a significant step toward financial inclusion that will 
facilitate seamless and direct transfer of subsidies and other benefits into 
beneficiaries’ accounts, reducing the number of opportunities for funds being 
pilfered en route.
De-monetization and Digi Dhan Yojana . Over 80 percent of the country’s 
economic activities are carried out in the informal sector, through informal 
financial and other transactions, with no accounts kept. This state of affairs 
leaves enormous room for underreporting or nonreporting of incomes, thus 
undercutting the potential for tax collections; allows for corrupt practices of 
paying in cash for irregular services to take place; and enables some people 
to accumulate enormous amounts of black money.
6 This money, in large 
quantities and in fake currency, enables the funding of drug-related activities, 
terrorism, and other antisocial activities. A recent action by the government 
aimed at dealing with corruption, black money, and tax evasion has been 
de-monetizing high-denomination currency of India (notes of value Rs 1,000 
5 Jan Dhan Yojana (literally meaning “people’s money program”) is aimed at 
ensuring access to various financial services including availability of basic savings bank 
accounts, access to need-based credit, remittances facility, insurance, and pension to 
excluded populations (e.g., vulnerable and low-income groups).
6 Black money points to incomes and wealth from undisclosed and often illegal 
transactions, and on which taxes are not paid.

176
and Rs 500), which together accounted for about 85 percent of all cash in 
circulation, and issuing fresh currency to replace the deposits of old currency 
in the banks. Though the process has resulted in some temporary inconve-
nience to the people, long-term gains are expected, through increased tax 
revenue and a reduction in corrupt practices. There has been a visible decline 
in terrorist activities.
7
Simultaneously, the government has launched a massive program 
to enable and encourage both consumers and traders to learn and to use 
noncash (digital) means of money transfers. It is expected that this change-
over to an economy that is less dependent on cash transactions would make 
transactions more transparent, boost tax income, and make it easier to curb 
corrupt practices. A continuous monitoring process has helped to assess the 
problems coming out of these new initiatives, and to take corrective actions 
immediately. For example, to ensure that the lack of Internet connectivity 
and education do not hamper the practice of digital money transactions, a 
new app, Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), which does not require Internet 
connectivity and can be used even by people without education, has been 
launched.
8
Clean India Mission . This is another major initiative of the government aimed 
at making India open defecation–free by 2019 and making people aware of 
the importance of keeping their environs neat and clean, through an aggres-
sive awareness-generation campaign involving prominent people from all 
walks of life, and providing financial assistance for building household and 
institutional sanitation facilities. M&E is a regular part of this program. Cities, 
towns, and villages are being ranked according to their level of cleanliness. 
Success stories are being disseminated across the country, and the work is 
going on with active community participation. 
Make-in-India and Skill India . Other major developmental initiatives with an 
equity focus include the Skill India and the Make-in-India programs. The main 
goal of Skill India is to create opportunities, space, and scope for the devel -
opment of the talents of Indian youth, and to further develop those sectors 
that have already been playing a role in skill development for the last so 
many years, and also to identify new sectors for skill development. This new 
program aims to provide training and skill development for 500 million youth 
by 2020, and to cover each and every village. 
7 See, for instance, India News October 8, 2017, referring to the finance minis-
ter’s observations on the subject, www.dnaindia.com.
8 The BHIM app enables people to make simple, easy, and quick payment trans-
actions using a unified payments interface (UPI) with just a mobile number or UPI ID. 
Pioneered and developed by the National Payments Corporation of India, BHIM was 
launched by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, on December 30, 2016, to usher in a 
financially inclusive nation and a digitally empowered society.
<<<PAGE=199>>>
Chapter 11. Leveraging Monitoring and Evaluation Systems for Good Governance  177
The purpose of Make-in-India is to encourage local and international 
manufacturers to set up production facilities within the country to boost pro-
duction and employment.
All of these initiatives include M&E components: thus, M&E is being 
mainstreamed into the development process.
Strengths and Weaknesses of M&E in India 
India, with its history of more than six decades of developmental planning 
supported by a network of M&E institutions and activities, is not new to 
this sphere of activity. But the growing importance of SDG-oriented M&E 
demands a stronger and more focused approach to M&E, supported by an 
M&E-enabled atmosphere, capacity building, and evaluation knowledge-shar-
ing mechanisms. 
Institutional mechanisms . The Development Monitoring and Evaluation 
Organization, a component of NITI Aayog, aided by its 15 regional offices 
across the country, keeps track of the developmental agenda in the context 
of SDGs, with evaluation as a priority. Apart from this centralized institution, 
most of the ministries and departments in the national and state govern-
ments have their own M&E systems. 
Capacity building in M&E . Multipronged efforts are being made to develop 
national M&E capacities. A number of national institutions, such as the National 
Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development (NILERD), and 
international institutions such as the International Initiative for Impact Evalua-
tion (3ie) and the Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR) are 
organizing workshops, sensitization programs, and both short and long-term 
training programs for this purpose. Various states have approached NILERD, 
asking them to organize short-term programs for their officials. This indicates 
a growing awareness of the need for M&E capacities. 
Toward a national evaluation policy . In spite of a long history of develop-
ment evaluation, and the amount of emphasis currently being placed on M&E, 
India still does not have an explicit national evaluation policy. The strong need 
for a national evaluation policy that will provide a framework that defines the 
principles governing the role of M&E in development; the approach, quality, 
methods, and ethics to be ensured in the practice of development evaluation; 
utilization of the evidence-based results of such evaluations; and, importantly, 
the human and material resources to be optimally allocated for this purpose, 
is increasingly being recognized. 
The Evaluation Community of India . Due to the growing demand for eval -
uations, and for capacity building from various corners, it was felt there was 
a need for a platform where planners, implementers, evaluators, and commu-
nities could come together to discuss various issues relating to M&E. Such a 
platform was launched in 2015, through the Evaluation Community of India 
(ECOI), a voluntary organization for professional evaluation (VOPE) with
<<<PAGE=200>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
178
the motto “to share and learn.” ECOI has action groups working on various 
aspects of evaluation, such as preparing a draft national evaluation policy, 
capacity development in evaluation, and so on. ECOI is looking forward to 
networking and interactions with various partners to collaborate in further 
developing evaluation culture.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN M&E AND GOVERNANCE IN  
SRI LANKA
Over the years the important role of M&E has been well recognized by 
the government of Sri Lanka.
9 Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to 
establish a web-based project monitoring system, e-PMS, to track projects 
implemented across all ministries. A homegrown electronic system was a 
significant aspect of that set-up. It was established in the then Ministry of 
Plan Implementation, to track financial and physical progress in implementa-
tion, and the results of all development projects and programs. The system 
could generate project information donor-wise, sector-wise, and ministry-wise. 
The Department of Project Management and Monitoring (DPMM), which has 
the mandate for M&E, has now replaced this system with a new Integrated 
National Development Information System.
However, the system is more or less confined to output-based progress 
monitoring of various development programs. In the context of SDGs, and 
the growing demand for effective monitoring and higher-level impact evalua-
tions, the need for a comprehensive national M&E system is being increasingly 
felt. The Global Evaluation Agenda that evolved at Kathmandu in 2015 (Eva-
lAgenda 2020) aims to strengthen the enabling environment for evaluation; 
develop institutional capacities; build individual capacities for evaluation; and 
support links among these first three dimensions by all stakeholders—gov -
ernments, parliamentarians, VOPEs, the United Nations, foundations, civil 
society, the private sector, academia, and other interested groups—working 
together. In response to these developments, the Parliamentarians’ Forum for 
Development Evaluation (PFDE) South Asia project team organized a series 
of events to facilitate the establishment of a national M&E system in Sri 
Lanka. Groundwork for such a system has recently been laid by the initiatives 
of VOPEs, the Sri Lanka Evaluation Association, the South Africa Monitoring 
and Evaluation Association, and the Malaysia Evaluation Association, together 
with their respective government agencies, and with the support of the Eval-
Partners Peer-to-Peer Small Grants Programme. 
Sri Lanka’s National Evaluation Policy
Although Sri Lanka commenced evaluations in the 1990s, the National Evalu-
ation Policy (NEP) process had not been continued consistently until recently: 
one reason for the delay was the lack of its endorsement by the government. 
The DPMM is the department within the Ministry of National Policies and

Economic Affairs that has the mandate for M&E, under the leadership of the 
Prime Minister. DPMM was stimulated to take a lead in the NEP process after 
the implementation of EvalPartners Peer-to-Peer Small Grants Programme 
2015: one of outputs of this was the draft preliminary action plan formulated 
to roll out the NEP. A draft of the policy initially developed by Sri Lanka Eval-
uation Association is being refined through a series of consultative processes 
between DPMM and other stakeholders that has been organized by PFDE 
and supported by EvalPartners, the EvalGender+ initiative, and UNICEF. A 
road map—another output from the stakeholder consultation—is expected 
to help guide the process for obtaining Cabinet approval for the NEP. 
Motions in the Sri Lankan Parliament
Two significant and highly encouraging events have recently taken place in 
the Sri Lankan Parliament. Two adjournment motions were moved in the 
Parliament: one to formulate a NEP, and the other to allocate funds for evalu-
ation. The first motion was made in August 2016 by a member of parliament 
who proposed formulating a NEP, and an evaluation system for the country 
to assess whether the anticipated results from development programs have 
been achieved. Making the motion, the honorable member stated that Sri 
Lanka had pledged to achieve the SDGs by 2030, and emphasized the impor-
tance of the role of evaluation in assessing whether the anticipated results 
from development interventions have been achieved. He cited examples from 
several countries where evaluation systems have been established, and stated 
that around 20 countries have already formulated NEPs, demonstrating his 
interest in and commitment to the cause. The same member also called for 
a separate allocation of funds from the national budget to be set aside for 
evaluation. All of the parliamentarians who participated in the debate were 
in favor of both motions. It seems likely, therefore, that the Sri Lankan Parlia-
ment is keen to adopt a NEP. 
The parliamentarians who joined the debate agreed in unison that 
the present national government, with the president and the prime minister 
representing the two leading parties, presents a good opportunity for imple-
menting a NEP. PFDE–South Asia is closely supporting reactivation of the 
NEP process, to be backed by evaluation capacity development. Being the 
heads of the ministries concerned with the subject, the prime minister and his 
deputy are encouraging the initiatives. 
During the debate, Malaysia, Nepal, and South Africa were cited as 
examples of countries that had commenced the process ahead of Sri Lanka. 
It is noteworthy that globally this may be the first-ever motion on evaluation 
moved in a parliament. Nevertheless, if the evaluation process is to function 
independently, a systematic framework that includes ministries, departments, 
boards, and so on, would have to be developed. For this purpose, a sizable 
allocation of funds is needed. These funds are worthy investments, since 
evaluation will facilitate the achievement of the objectives of the projects. 
Furthermore, the lessons learned from the process will help in effective 
decision making in the short, medium, and long term for the projects being 
evaluated, as well as when implementing future projects of a similar nature.

An Online Web-Based Project Monitoring System
During the stakeholder consultations, the need to integrate areas of interre-
lated work, evaluation, data, and indicators with a strong information system 
that would be backed by relevant, high-quality, disaggregated, comparable, 
and timely data was emphasized. The existing system needs to be modified 
and upgraded so that it can cater to current needs. However, because it has 
no local partner the cost of maintenance is exorbitant. The system has been 
handed over to the Information Communication and Technology Agency, the 
government’s information and communications technology arm, which is in 
the process of entering into a memorandum of understanding to modify 
and upgrade to a more user-friendly system. Some of the other issues cur -
rently faced by DPMM are inadequately trained staff in line ministries due to 
transfers to other departments with no succession planning, and delays in 
updating the system by the line ministries. Furthermore, it is difficult to verify 
the accuracy of data when the observations of senior management are not 
entered into the system. More stakeholders would be encouraged to use the 
system if it could be made more user-friendly, and if project progress could 
be tracked and used to contribute to informed decision making. PFDE–South 
Asia has also recognized the need to build awareness and strengthen the 
Department of Census and Statistics, and has invited them to participate in 
evaluation capacity development programs.
Capacity Building of Public Sector Officials
In Sri Lanka, several capacity-building initiatives have taken place, including 
training workshops for government officials, and study tours to Malaysia and 
South Africa. The training workshops included evaluation, the Logical Frame-
work Approach in evaluation and designing and managing evaluations. 
A four-member delegation comprised of representatives of DPMM, and 
two representatives from PFDE–South Asia, visited South Africa with the 
objective of developing a preliminary action plan to implement a national 
evaluation system in Sri Lanka. The delegation had the opportunity to learn 
about the South African system of government and the application of 
planning, monitoring, and evaluation by the South African Department of Per-
formance Monitoring and Evaluation. Discussions included the timelines used 
in developing a macro PM&E system, the rationale for PM&E, the various roles 
and responsibilities of different organs of the government, the outline of the 
department’s work in the context of the central government, the National 
Development Plan 2030, the National Evaluation Plan, and the problems 
PM&E aims to address. The web-based system of frontline monitoring of the 
presidential hotline for community problem solving was also demonstrated. 
The delegation also visited a participatory workshop on preparing 
terms of reference for an integrated development plan to ensure safety in 
the Republic of South Africa where they learned about the Management 
Performance Monitoring Tool (MPAT) and how performance is measured in 
departments using scorecards. The study tour was an important step in the 
long-term evaluation capacity-building program in Sri Lanka, supported by
<<<PAGE=203>>>

the EvalGender+ network and the UNICEF country office. Such international 
experiences are very important if countries are going to work together to 
achieve the SDGs within the scheduled time frame. 
In short, substantial efforts have been made to develop an evaluation 
culture in Sri Lanka, but there is a still need for the following:
 n Strengthen parliamentarians’ desire to use and demand evaluation
 n Strengthen the evaluation capacity of district development commit-
tees where a decentralized budget is used
 n Government endorsement of the national evaluation policy
GOOD GOVERNANCE AND M&E IN BHUTAN: OVERVIEW
Bhutan’s economic plans and programs are guided by an overarching devel -
opment philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH). The concept of GNH 
attempts to ensure that an economic activity not only reaps material benefits 
but also positively impacts issues like equity, sustainability, preservation of 
the environment, and culture. GNH is supported with four pillars: good gov -
ernance is the fourth pillar, which is the underpinning for the success of the 
other three pillars. 
Good governance in Bhutan is characterized by four features: account-
ability, transparency, efficiency, and professionalism. While the concept of 
M&E is a cross-cutting phenomenon transcending all four pillars of GNH, the 
practice of M&E is more obvious and apparent with respect to good gover -
nance. Evidence-based practice of good governance is desirable for ensuring 
success of the other three pillars. Figure 11.3 presents a flowchart depiction 
of GNH, good governance, and M&E in the Bhutanese context.
Because of its success in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, 
under the development strategies of the GNH philosophy, Bhutan involun-
tarily has already begun the implementation of development activities for the 
SDGs. This is due to the fact that under the GNH development strategies, 
activities desired under the SDGs have inherent links with existing develop-
ment plans and programs. For instance, the GNH pillar concerning “regionally 
balanced equitable socioeconomic development” has inherent links with 
SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Similarly, the pillar of “preservation and 
promotion of culture and tradition” has links with SDGs 11 and 12. The third 
pillar, “conservation of the environment” can conveniently absorb SDGs 6, 7, 
12, 13, 14, and 15, while the “good governance” pillar is related to SDGs 16 
and 17. 
Bhutan’s Planning Commission, known as the GNH Commission 
(GNHC), is the central coordinating agency for development PM&E. In a bid 
to streamline and institute an effective system for M&E of development 
plans in the country, in 2006 the GNH Commission developed a national 
M&E system, as a standard system for monitoring and evaluating the devel -
opment plans and programs administered by ministries and agencies. A 
dedicated unit, known as the Research and Evaluation Division, is in place at 
the GNH Commission.

The Status of M&E in Bhutan
A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of 
Bhutan’s M&E system was undertaken during one seminar on evaluation in 
Bhutan in March 2013, conducted by the GNHC and UNICEF-Bhutan. It was 
found that the evaluation system was weak; the technical capacity to conduct, 
commission, and manage evaluations was lacking; and the demand for eval -
uation was low. It was also noted that evaluations in Bhutan were generally 
donor-driven. These factors posed challenges for strengthening the evalua-
tion culture in Bhutan. It was also recommended that a nonprofit association 
and a network of evaluators be established, to provide the much-needed 
platform to promote evaluation in Bhutan.
Therefore, evaluation is still at the nascent stage to this day. Evaluation 
is less understood and appreciated. Neither is there a demand for evaluation 
nor the supply. To this extent, there is a lack of capacity in evaluation. 
On the contrary, there has been a considerable progress on the mon-
itoring aspect. The sense of monitoring is not only becoming firmer in the 
system, but it is easier and more straightforward for agencies for implemen-
tation and oversight purposes.
In order to streamline, strengthen, and institutionalize the evaluation 
system, the national evaluation policy, and the national evaluation protocol 
and guidelines have already been formulated, and are awaiting the govern-
ment’s approval. Several evaluations of development policies and programs 
have also been conducted since 2013, through the Research and Evaluation 
Division of the GNHC, and in collaboration with government ministries. These

initiatives are geared toward promotion of the demand and use of evaluation 
by governments and parliaments so as to inform policy development and 
increased social accountability to citizens through evaluation.
Bhutan’s Planning and Monitoring Process
Bhutan’s development plans and programs are based on overall five-year 
plans (FYPs); currently, the country is in its 11th FYP (2013–18). FYPs are pre-
pared through government consultations with implementation agencies, both 
at the national and grassroots levels. Plan consultations are preceded by issu-
ance of planning guidelines to agencies. As part of results-based planning and 
management practices, plans are corroborated with identified result areas 
known as national key result areas, sectoral key result areas, key performance 
indicators, and specific key interventions. Individual FYPs are prepared by the 
respective ministries, autonomous agencies, and local government agencies, 
and their plans must be aligned with the national priorities. Based on the 
approved FYPs, annual work plans (AWPs) and budgeting are prepared and 
executed during the year.
Appropriate information technology (IT) systems are employed at 
various stages in the planning and monitoring continuum. The formulation 
of overall FYPs is based on information provided by planning and monitor -
ing systems (PLaMS). PLaMS also provide support during the preparation of 
AWPs and their implementation. 
Annual budgets are prepared using a multiyear rolling budget system. 
Budget releases are made on a quarterly basis, upon receiving plan monitor -
ing and progress reports, which are essentially both physical and financial 
progress reports. While these reports will be made by implementing agen-
cies through the PLaMs, the Ministry of Finance will release periodic budgets 
through another IT system known as the public expenditure management 
system (PEMS). Every government transaction is conducted online through 
PEMS, upon submission of progress reports. Thus, the AWPs and the budget, 
during the implementation phase only, will have periodic monitoring and 
reporting requirements that must be followed by the agencies.
It is customary for the government to conduct midterm reviews of FYPs 
in the middle of the Five-Year period, typically when the plan has progressed 
two and a half years into the FYP. In addition, the present government has 
initiated the drawing of annual performance agreements between the prime 
minister and individual agencies to ensure successful implementation of the 
AWPs. The activities identified in the AWPs would be determined by the 
respective agencies and duly agreed upon with the prime minister. There will 
be an annual review of annual performance agreements with the implement-
ing agencies. 
Status of the Evaluation Profession in Bhutan
Reaffirming the importance of evaluation within the system, UNICEF-Bhutan 
has been engaged along with the GNH Commission since the first day of the 
dialogue on promoting evaluation in Bhutan. Equally, parliament, through its
<<<PAGE=206>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
184
various standing committees, has always been on the frontline to promote 
evaluation culture in the country.
In an attempt to promote evaluation culture in Bhutan, with the techni-
cal and financial support of UNICEF-Bhutan, and the administrative support of 
the GNH Commission, the Evaluation Association of Bhutan (EAB) was formed 
in 2013, with a multibackground membership. Its registration for formal rec -
ognition of CSO status is already in process. In collaboration with UNICEF, 
the Community of Evaluators-South Asia, and the GNH Commission, the EAB 
regularly conducts training and experience-sharing events for its members 
and other stakeholders. Thus, the EAB is working on creating a network of 
high-quality evaluators and linking them with other evaluation communities.
From 2009 until mid-2015, about 16 officials from the government 
had attended the International Program for Development Evaluation Train-
ing (IPDET) funded by various sources of training, a major portion of which 
was supported by Danida. This training contributed immensely to enhanc -
ing awareness and capacity in the Royal Government of Bhutan. About 24 
Bhutanese with an interest in evaluation are members of the International 
Organization for Collaborative Outcome Management, which was estab-
lished in 2010. In 2013, a few Bhutanese evaluators joined the Community 
of Evaluators as individual members: this has strengthened the discourse on 
development evaluation, and the evaluation culture in the country. 
However, despite these steps forward, the evaluation profession has 
not progressed very much. Except for donor-funded programs, no evaluation 
by independent practitioners has been conducted for government programs. 
And even for donor-led evaluations of programs and projects, the evaluations 
are mostly carried out without established processes and standards. None-
theless, there is a silver lining, with the government’s relentless effort toward 
the promotion of both demand and use of evaluation, and the disclosing of 
policy development through increased social accountability mechanisms.
The more plausible solutions, at this stage, are to:
 n Expedite formal government approval of the national evaluation 
policy, guidelines, and protocol;
 n Recognize the EAB as a legal CSO;
 n Upgrade the capacity of evaluation practitioners; and
 n Enhance the utilization of evaluation reports by agencies.
CONCLUSION 
Bhutan, India, and Sri Lanka are all South Asian countries, but their approaches 
to governance and M&E vary. Analysis indicates that Sri Lanka is still con-
fined to an output-based monitoring system, although recent events suggest 
a growing realization of the importance of, and gradual transition to, higher 
levels of evaluation. The emphasis in India, with its long-entrenched M&E 
systems, has been on outcome monitoring and impact evaluations. However, 
it has no evaluation policy. This often results in inadequacy or a multiplicity 
of efforts in M&E, a lack of standardized practices of evaluations, and more
<<<PAGE=207>>>

importantly, their inadequate utilization. Sri Lanka on the other hand, has initi-
ated the process of developing an NEP, and outcomes have found a place in 
the national parliament. Sri Lanka has adopted a long and robust process of 
dialogue and consultation with various stakeholders to make their evaluation 
policy a reality, and a motion for specific fund allotment for evaluation has 
been raised in their parliament. In India, there is a strong need for evaluation 
policy, and the allotment of dedicated funds for evaluations to make them 
utility-oriented, as highlighted in recent stakeholder discussions. In recent 
times, India has witnessed initiatives toward good governance and promotion 
of the use of IT to make citizen services efficient and financial transactions 
transparent, thereby reducing corruption. Bhutan, meanwhile, has a totally 
different philosophy of good governance, and measures it by public happi-
ness. Bhutan considers the sole purpose of development is making people 
happy. High incomes may lead to material benefits, but general happiness is 
more important than these material benefits. Therefore, in Bhutan M&E is a 
cross-cutting issue looking to assess impacts in terms of GNH. 
All three of these countries are committed to achieving the SDG 
targets; and M&E, as well as good governance are essential tools in that 
process. All three countries share the view that capacity building in M&E 
is extremely important in order to achieve the SDGs. While in India evalu-
ations are getting mainstreamed into the development agenda and there is 
a demand for evaluation from various stakeholders, in Sri Lanka and Bhutan 
evaluations are generally donor-driven. Now is the time for various countries 
to come together, share their experiences, and learn from each other for 
future action.

Integrating Feminist Approaches to 
Evaluation - Lessons Learned from 
an Indian Experience 
Rajib Nandi and Rituu B. Nanda
Abstract . Feminist approaches to evaluation seek to unpack the nature of gender and 
social inequalities; treat evaluation as a political activity, not as a value-free assessment; 
and use it as part of the change process. In response to the increased attention being 
given to evaluation, and the possible role of feminist evaluation in influencing policy 
that could lead to gender equality along different dimensions, the Institute of Social 
Studies Trust, based in New Delhi, designed a four-year program. The aim of program 
was to enhance capacity and understanding of feminist evaluations of various stake-
holders, with a conviction that it would influence gender-transformative policy making. 
This chapter discusses the objectives and activities of this program, and critically ana-
lyzes the lessons learned. It also highlights the important takeaways that can make 
evaluations transformative as far as gender-based inequalities and power dynamics are 
concerned.

T
he Indian economy and society have been struggling with persistent gender 
gaps and inequalities. Despite substantial progress over the years, gender 
gaps continue to persist in education, health, participation in the workforce, 
and decision making (Hay et al. 2012). Poverty, early marriage, malnutrition, 
and lack of health care during pregnancy are associated with high levels of 
maternal and infant mortality. Data show that in India almost 60 percent of 
girls are married before the age of 18 (UNICEF 2014), and nearly 60 percent of 
them bear children before they are 19 (Young Lives 2016). In addition, almost 
one-third of all babies are born with low birth weight. Although gender parity 
in school enrollment has largely been achieved, there are gender differences 
in the reasons for dropping out, for irregular school attendance, and for the 
pathways that open up through education. Against a male workforce partici-
pation rate of 53.0 percent in rural areas and 53.8 percent in urban areas, the 
female workforce participation rate was 30.0 percent and 15.4 percent in 2011 
(GOI 2016). Women continue to be employed mainly as “marginal” workers, in 
home-based, informal economy work, and as unpaid family labor. They remain 
underrepresented in decision-making positions, even though quotas have 
enabled more than a million women to enter local governance institutions.
Because gender norms affect all aspects of work and life, and gender is 
seen as a cross-cutting issue, it often becomes invisible in policy and planning 
documents. For example, neither India’s midterm appraisal of the Eleventh 
Plan, nor the issues for approach to the Twelfth Plan, mention “gender 
equality and empowerment” as a separate tangible goal, and discussion with 
planners reveals that it is seen as a “cross-cutting” factor (Planning Commis-
sion 2011b, 2011c). The reluctance to make gender concerns more explicit, 
which is derived from ignorance of the facts about gender gaps, suggests 
that there is still significant doubt as to whether any alternative policy or 
program design would significantly alter gender-related outcomes or not. 
However, evidence from the work of feminist and gender-sensitive social sci-
entists shows that identifying and addressing the factors leading to gender 
inequalities can indeed help develop strategies for both policy advocacy and 
implementation for better outcomes from a gender perspective.
The present chapter highlights the discussions and lessons learned 
from a four-year program of capacity building on feminist evaluation that 
was prompted by an apprehension that evaluations with a feminist lens are 
capable of offering evidence-based policy advocacy that is oriented to gender 
equity and social justice.
The authors consulted different program documents including the 
program proposal, narrative reports, workshop reports, and the evaluation 
reports drafted by the external evaluators in order to write this chapter.
ENGENDERING POLICY THROUGH EVALUATION: 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Gender in Indian Policy and Planning
The ways in which a gender and equity lens in evaluation can help improve 
policies and programs is an important message for policy makers to receive.

On the other hand, it is widely recognized that evaluation has been emerg-
ing as a critical space through which gender and equity questions can be 
brought back into policy discourse.
1 The Indian government’s Eleventh Plan 
adopted a gendered lens to initiate a process of systemic improvement in 
the lives of women and children. But the plan’s midterm appraisal shows 
that while certain sectors have shown remarkable improvement, others are 
lagging behind (Planning Commission 2011c). The approach to the Twelfth 
Plan shows that only 35.8 percent of the Eleventh Plan outlay has been allo-
cated during the first three years of the plan (Planning Commission 2011b). 
Schemes for single and internally displaced women, domestic workers, and 
minority women, to name a few, have not found a voice in the first half of the 
Eleventh Plan (Planning Commission 2011a).
During the formulation process of the Twelfth Plan, the coalition of 
civil society organizations and the planning commission was strengthened. 
The planning commission invited civil society groups to contribute to the 
preparation of the approach paper for the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, which is 
aimed at achieving faster, more sustainable, and more inclusive growth. The 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) India supported a facilita-
tion process that provided women and men from marginalized communities 
living in remote corners of the country with an opportunity to voice their 
opinions on key development issues, and in doing so, marked a significant 
step in making the planning participatory. Planners interacted with 16 popula-
tion groups comprised of dalits,
2 migrants, the urban poor, ethnic minorities, 
Muslims, people living with HIV/AIDS, and transgender persons, among 
others (WNTA 2011).
Consequently, the Twelfth Plan approach paper acknowledged that 
the plan must break the vicious cycle of multiple deprivations faced by girls 
and women because of gender discrimination and undernutrition. The paper 
ensures that ending gender-based inequities, discrimination, and violence 
faced by girls and women must be accorded the highest priority, and that this 
needs to be done in several ways. The midterm appraisal report of the Elev -
enth Plan acknowledges a need to undertake impact evaluations of intended 
outcomes. To undertake such evaluation, it has been decided to establish an 
independent evaluation organization linked to, but distinct from, the Planning 
Commission (Planning Commission 2011c).
Within this environment, there is some evidence that greater attention 
is now being paid to government-commissioned independent evaluations, as 
well as to the methods used and the findings. Acknowledgment by the govern-
ment has created a tacit space for discussing gender-responsive evaluations 
in India. A meeting of the evaluation agencies and implementing agencies 
of the Support to Training and Employment Programme (STEP) for Women 
of the Indian government’s Ministry of Women and Child Development was

convened in May 2011 for the first time since the program had started in 
1986, to reflect on the design and evaluation processes of the program. 
The participants provided their thoughts about a systemic development of 
the evaluation process for the program. The increasing demand for greater 
transparency and openness is further reflected in the recent citizen agitation 
demanding an anti-corruption bill,
3 and in the use of the Right to Information 
Act to ensure public accountability. The act is becoming more crucial for the 
vulnerable sections of our society as they battle for social and economic 
justice. This is particularly true for women’s issues. Some recent reports show 
that groups of women have also been able to fight gender-based discrimina-
tions through the Right to Information Act (Bakshi and Bhattacharya 2010).
A meta-evaluation of the STEP was conducted in 2012 by the Institute 
of Social Studies Trust (ISST), using a feminist lens. The study points out 
that care responsibilities and constraints on mobility can influence outcomes, 
and need to be factored into assessments of both design and outcomes. 
This study was an attempt at a formative meta-evaluation using a synthe-
sis method, and with the purpose of using completed evaluation reports to 
inform and strengthen future evaluations (“Introduction,” Sudarshan, Murthy, 
and Chigateri 2015).
The meta-evaluation of the STEP has provided critical insights, as 
follows:
…the importance of assessing whether the trainings were contextualized 
to the sector and catered specifically to the needs of the women was 
also emphasized. The argument made by the evaluating agency was that 
the trainings would not be effective otherwise, and that women would 
just remain recipients of STEP. In order to empower the women, the 
trainings had to be linked to the lives of the women. Furthermore, the 
trainings had to cater to the functional requirements of the women. For 
instance, it was recommended that the legal training not be limited to 
awareness of legal rights but should also address functional and trans-
actional legal literacy in the particular context of the sector, for instance 
to know what happens in the case of non repayment of loans, or to any 
other specific issue from a particular sector like farming or weaving etc. 
Therefore, in order to assess the effectiveness of the training compo-
nent, it is also important for the evaluating agency to assess whether 
the training was contextualized and catered specifically to the needs of 
women. (Chigateri et al. 2015, 65)
Importance of Building Evaluation Capacity in India
There is a strong presence of international evaluators, both organizations and 
individuals, in India today. This has helped to generate a more visible dis-
course about evaluation. Questions are being raised regarding things such

as the extent to which greater professionalization of the evaluation function 
is needed, and how important the role of contextual understanding and 
domain knowledge is.

Whether there is a growing demand for the evaluation of programs 
and projects, or whether there is simply greater visibility of this area of work, 
there is a sense among many commissioners of evaluations that local eval -
uation capacity is weak: this means that even if more evaluations are being 
locally commissioned, there may be a sense of discomfort among the commis-
sioners regarding their credibility. Shiva Kumar, for example, has commented 
that “Professionals carrying out evaluations in South Asia tend to be social 
science researchers, not trained evaluators. Many evaluators of development 
interventions and commissioners of evaluation have not fully realized that 
the competencies needed to become an evaluator are different from, though 
complementary to, those needed for conducting social science research” 
(Shiva Kumar 2010).
Gender-transformative approaches to evaluation seek to unpack the 
nature of gender and social inequalities: further, they see evaluation as a 
political activity, not as a value-free assessment, and use it as part of the 
change process. Responding to the increased attention being given to evalu-
ation, and the possible role of feminist evaluation in engendering policy and 
supporting changes that lead to gender equality along different dimensions, 
a consultation on gender and participatory evaluation was organized by ISST 
in August 2010 in New Delhi. There is, so far, little writing on gender-transfor-
mative evaluation tools and frameworks, and little on the difference made to 
evaluation findings by using a feminist lens. This workshop brought together 
a group of feminist and gender-sensitive equality advocates who, as social 
science researchers, have carried out evaluations and not had the opportu-
nity to reflect on the role of these evaluations within their larger research 
agendas. Examples were given of the ways in which evaluation has been able 
to shift policy perspectives through the redesign of programs, and more 
importantly through systems change.
The participants of the above consultation might have lacked famil -
iarity with mainstream evaluation theories and theorists, and the tools and 
frameworks associated with them, but the presentations by evaluators at 
the workshop showed that they have a good knowledge of the concerned 
sector. Evaluation findings can contribute to developing a future research 
agenda, leading to evidence-based policy recommendations, and drawing on 
the findings of a whole body of knowledge including evaluations. This pos-
itive contribution could be enhanced by strengthening the evaluation skills 
of social science researchers through exposure to evaluation theories and 
tools. At the same time, the immensely valuable set of knowledge and experi-
ence that has been gained by a number of feminist development practitioners 
will be unable to reach wider communities of evaluators if their evaluative

writings are not framed and structured in the language that is recognized by 
the conventional evaluators.
Program Objectives
With this understanding, ISST in New Delhi designed a four-year program 
to address the increasing demand for transparency and accountability from 
program managers, including the government; the increasing interest in evalu-
ation, but equally recognition of gaps in capacity; and the presence of a group 
of feminist social science researchers who have also engaged with evaluation. 
ISST coordinated the program, which was entitled “Engendering Policy 
through Evaluation: Uncovering Exclusion, Challenging Inequities,” from 2011 
to 2015, in response to persistent gender inequalities in Indian society and 
the economy in various spheres.
5 In principle, gender-equitable outcome is 
regarded as a cross-cutting objective across all sectors of development 
in India. However, it is often observed that, at the policy level, there is a 
reluctance to make gender concerns explicit in program design and imple-
mentation. It seems policy makers are not convinced whether a gender- and 
equity-focused lens in program design and evaluation would significantly 
improve outcomes or not. On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence 
from existing research that alternative strategies can indeed help in reducing 
the gender gap. The motivation for the program then was “to try to change 
and improve things on the ground” by demonstrating evaluation approaches 
derived from feminist theories of social inequities.
The overall objective of the program was to strengthen the under -
standing of gendered implications of policies and programs, and to enable the 
formulation of gender-sensitive approaches. In particular, focus was placed on 
evaluating selected key issues related to education, health, governance, and 
livelihood. Specific objectives included building evaluation capacity using a 
feminist lens, and expanding research and inquiry into the benefits of doing 
so. The work would contribute to building the field of feminist evaluation, 
and building an active network of professionals who are engaged in advanc -
ing its theory and practice.
KEY ACTIVITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Over a period of four years, this program has built a strong network of 
individuals and organizations in India that are interested in and working on 
feminist evaluation (table 12.1). For the purpose of capacity building, expand-
ing a network of persons interested in evaluation with a gender and equity 
lens, and engaging policy makers, the following activities were undertaken.
5 The program was jointly sponsored by the International Development Research 
Centre, Canada; and Ford Foundation, New Delhi.

 n The network-building activity was sustained through a feminist eval-
uation Google group; an interactive online community of practice 
on gender and evaluation; a Facebook page; and a Twitter account.
 n The work of capacity building and building a base of knowledge 
on feminist evaluation was sustained through workshops, small 
research grants, and support for participating in international work-
shops and seminars.
 n The knowledge produced through this process was disseminated 
through publications, and both print and online training videos.
 n The program has tried to engage policy makers at different stages.
The program conducted six training workshops, which functioned both 
as capacity-building spaces as well as opportunities to share research and 
knowledge on feminist evaluation. The program also offered scholarships to 
attend international conferences.
The program offered 11 small research grants for reflective research 
on evaluations. Some of the sponsored studies were “A Study of Gender and 
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Evaluations in India” and “The Culture 
of Evaluations: Women Empowerment Programs under the Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) Initiatives.” There were also two studies on meta-eval -
uations: one in the field of education, the other on health programs of the 
government of India.
Four books were published as outputs of this program: a toolkit 
on gender-sensitive participatory evaluation methods; an edited volume, 
Engendering Meta-evaluations: Towards Women’s Empowerment; an edited 
resource pack, Resource Pack on Gender-Transformative Evaluations; and an 
edited collection of feminist evaluations, Voices and Values: The Politics of 
Feminist Evaluation.

Since the inception of the program, knowledge sharing has been a key 
component. The base for this was provided by a feminist evaluation website,6 
various social media pages, and a Google group for those interested in fem-
inist evaluation that was created in the first year of the program, as part of 
the knowledge sharing strategy. In addition, an online community of practice 
was set up in early 2013 to build a network of gender-responsive evaluation 
practitioners and researchers, including the core project participants, but also 
going beyond this group. The purpose was to provide an interactive, iterative 
platform that would build a knowledge base on gender and evaluation for 
the community of practitioners. This online community has more than 3,000 
members from all over the world, and has generated new interest in gender 
and evaluation. It also provided an impetus for several organizations to seek 
collaborations with our feminist evaluation network. Since 2015, the online 
platform is also the online knowledge-sharing hub for EvalGender+.
There has been a widening of the networks beyond the initial base of 
project participants. While the project participants continue to form the core 
of our network, a broader network has been engendered by the online com-
munity, which has provided a much broader base for sustained conversations 
on gender and evaluation. Training videos on What Are Gender-Transforma-
tive Evaluations?, Use of Evaluations in a Gender and Equity Context, and 
Principles, Values and Ethics of Gender-Transformative Evaluations have been 
uploaded, which members have used, and through which they have also 
shared their inputs.
A key component of the program was also to engage policy makers, and 
to communicate the value of a feminist perspective in evaluations. Attempts 
to engage the policy makers have been underway since the beginning of the 
program. However, these efforts did not materialize until year 4, beginning 
with the International Year of Evaluation (EvalYear) events in India, for which 
ISST, the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),
7 and the 
National Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development (NILERD) 
were co-organizers, along with other organizations.
Armed with some of the outputs of the program that directly address 
evaluation policies (for example meta-evaluations of government programs 
and state accountability mechanisms), the process of directly engaging policy 
makers proved to be more productive. Thus, in the fourth year, the program 
organized two policy workshops, in association with NITI Aayog and NILERD. 
And ISST’s efforts to engage policymakers to use a feminist perspective in 
evaluations culminated in the launch of the Evaluation Community of India 
(ECOI), hosted by ISST.
The capacity to conduct evaluation and recognize the value of eval -
uations has been strengthened with each workshop, reflection session, and 
conversation on ISST’s online platform. This group has contributed to building

the field in diverse ways, including the publication of papers and making pre-
sentations at national and international workshops and conferences, and at 
capacity-building workshops.
The group has been actively engaging with ongoing policy debates 
on reproductive and sexual health, particularly through the work on child 
and early marriages, and adolescent girls; on education (for instance, Sarva 
Shiksha Abhiyaan);
8 on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), through a meta-evaluation study; and on liveli-
hoods, through evaluating the governance of the irrigation sector through a 
gender lens.
Some of the participant organizations have incorporated their learning 
from the workshops into their own practice on monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E). For instance, Jabala, a community-based nongovernmental organiza-
tion (NGO) that operates from Kolkata, conducted an internal evaluation on 
their economic rehabilitation program for survivors based on their learning 
from the workshops. The Child in Need Institute (CINI), an NGO based in 
eastern India, collaborated with ISST on using community-led participatory 
M&E tools in their project based in West Bengal. The Centre for Catalyzing 
Change (formerly known as CEDPA) is keen to develop a self-assessment 
tool for an end-line survey in one of their projects. And the Health Institute 
for Mother and Child (MAMTA) has started using participatory evaluation 
methods in their organization.
ANALYSIS
Given the wide variety of stakeholders that were targeted by the program, 
the amount and type of involvement, and the takeaways, also varied.
Practitioners were drawn from organizations that were conducting 
development programs, and were mid-to-senior-level professionals from dif-
ferent disciplinary backgrounds, including social science, management, legal, 
and others. For this group, evaluation knowledge was rudimentary, and their 
experience was a “third-party activity” to which they were subjected by donors. 
Against this background, participation in the project was found to be valuable 
in enabling ownership of evaluation within the organization: in assisting them 
to think evaluatively of their work; in unpacking gender dynamics that had 
been opaque in their program design and implementation; and in showing the 
way for creating an “evaluative culture” within their organizations.
The program has contributed to many key building blocks toward 
improving capacity building for organizations, and professionals engaged in 
development work at the grassroots level. Such organizations typically rely 
on third-party evaluations, and do not engage in viewing their own work using 
a feminist lens. This was the case even for organizations that were working

on equity and women’s rights issues. Such an engagement was found to be 
valuable in identifying dimensions for engagement, or for ongoing analysis of 
their work. Thus, feminist evaluation concepts of power and structures were 
becoming integrated into ongoing and new projects, and these opened up 
new ways of looking at empowerment. This capacity is crucial in order for an 
organization to actively engage in ongoing self-evaluation that can feed into 
the design of more formal periodic evaluations. The capacity-building work -
shops enabled development practitioners to better understand and measure 
change processes, and reflect on their own experiences.
Capacity building for conducting formal self-evaluations by these orga-
nizations was found to be more limiting, especially as there tended to be 
rotation among the staff who attended, and the workshop sessions were 
not geared to be evaluation training per se. With the evaluative thinking on 
feminist issues that was provided by the program, individual organizations 
embarked on their own evaluations, with mentoring support from experi-
enced evaluators, and also with the support of ISST.
More senior practitioners, such as those who were involved with joint 
review missions for the government’s flagship programs, found the feminist 
evaluation concepts very helpful in assisting them to formulate questions 
that helped to push the analysis beyond the data that was available for these 
programs. Integrating these ideas with their government counterparts was 
also well received.
Researchers and evaluators working on feminist evaluation found 
the dynamic interaction on research issues very helpful in furthering their 
work. Such opportunities for reflection, interaction, and feedback are valuable 
for conducting good research.
The researchers who participated in the program were at both the 
junior and senior levels. The junior-level researchers valued the ability to 
conduct work and the opportunity to attend and present results at inter -
national conferences provided by the research grants, and the reviews and 
discussions that enabled them to complete their publications. The senior 
researchers, who had taken on higher-profile meta-evaluations of national 
flagship programs, were supported for conducting and publishing the work in 
an edited volume, which subsequently has been released at a policy seminar 
cohosted by NITI Aayog. Being able to influence policy makers was enhanced 
by the involvement of other experienced evaluators who were also involved 
in this program. The series of workshops provided a space for reflection and 
introduction to innovative ideas that spurred research productivity. And the 
e-network provided an ongoing space for discussion of issues, concepts, and 
methods, and for researchers to get feedback on their work.
There was relatively little engagement with decision makers and policy 
makers from institutional settings where programs were being designed and/
or implemented; where evaluation training was being carried out; or with 
government officials. The concept underlying this work was that results ema-
nating from the capacity building and research output would subsequently 
be able to influence decision makers.
The program outputs have the potential to influence many of these 
groups of decision makers. For example, the training modules and resource
<<<PAGE=219>>>
Chapter 12. Integrating Feminist Approaches to Evaluation - Lessons Learned from an Indian Experience  197
pack could contribute to the integration of these methods in standard evalu-
ation trainings; and research outputs such as the compiled meta-evaluations 
of national flagship programs could influence a closer look at their imple-
mentation and modifications. The dissemination and outreach workshops and 
seminars conducted in the final year of the program highlighted the fact that 
such influence was indeed being generated.
Organizational leaders wanted more hands-on training in order to 
be able to conduct their evaluations. The program has introduced fresh per -
spectives to work being done by the NGOs that participated, and evaluative 
thinking was being integrated into their programs. However, they lacked the 
capacity and expertise to conduct their own evaluations, and would have 
liked to have an ongoing mentoring relationship established to facilitate 
that.
Evaluation practitioners, especially those who were active in main-
stream program evaluations, had a mixed response. Some responded that 
the reflection and research conducted with their participation had enabled 
them to better interject feminist issues into program designing and imple-
mentation, though they felt that the terminology of gender-transformative 
evaluation was more acceptable within their own constituencies. Others felt 
constrained with their ability to apply feminist evaluation concepts in their 
practice. 
Some of the reasons they cited for this included:
 n Commissioners of evaluation, and most donors, pay only lip service 
to gender empowerment/transformative development;
 n The need to demonstrate links to economic productivity with 
equity/gender empowerment programming; and 
 n Logistical issues in conducting fieldwork by female evaluators for 
getting women’s perspectives.
The volume of high-quality research output and publications with 
international visibility has contributed to energizing this field of inquiry: a sig-
nificant majority of participants said that this was a valuable contribution, and 
that a desire for ongoing engagement with the community of practice has 
been established.
PROGRAM OUTCOMES AS A WHOLE 
Short Term
The regular workshops conducted over the course of the four years of 
program implementation created a vibrant space for interaction, reflection, 
and the sharing of innovative methods and approaches that engaged partic -
ipants in a productive manner. Those who attended several of these events 
gained insights that they introduced to their organizations and into their 
work. The shared learning space and commonality of equity and feminist 
program and research interests of the participants was conducive to creating 
an effective community of practice.
<<<PAGE=220>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
198
The external visibility produced both within the participants’ own orga-
nizations as well as in international forums, is likely to enable feedback loops 
that will contribute to benefits in the medium and longer term.
Medium Term
Publications of research on feminist evaluation include one edited collection 
of meta-evaluations of government programs (Sudarshan, Murthy, and Chi-
gateri 2015), one toolkit on gender-sensitive participatory evaluation methods 
(Murthy 2015), one resource pack on gender-transformative evaluations (Chi-
gateri and Saha 2016), and one edited volume on reflective writings on the 
practice of feminist evaluation in India (Sudarshan and Nandi 2018). These 
publications will provide an impetus for additional research and integration of 
a feminist lens in evaluations, program reviews, and their design.
The e-network, established and expanded internationally to more than 
a thousand members during the program period, is expected to be a major 
instrument for providing an open forum and long-term benefits for the con-
tinued development in the field of feminist evaluation that was spurred by 
this program.
Long Term
The yardstick that can be used to assess the longer-term outcomes of this 
program is the extent to which there is institutionalization of the key short 
and medium-term outcomes. The main evidence of this is from interviews 
with NGO practitioners who are integrating evaluative thinking into their pro-
grams, and who have acquired the capacity to apply a feminist lens to their 
programs. Those working in more mainstream programs did not face such a 
positive institutional environment.
The program was able to develop some integration of feminist or gen-
der-transformative lenses in the evaluation training being offered at NILERD, 
which partnered in some of the workshops and outreach events. With the dis-
semination of publications that resulted from the program, there is potential 
for expanding such capacity building.
The impressive volume of high-quality research, and the publications 
that have been produced, will also contribute to longer-term outcomes. 
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM
Human resource capacities built at the individual level by the program will 
be sustainable, given the depth and diversity of the discourse that has been 
provided. It is anticipated that these individuals will carry this capacity into 
their ongoing work, since they have been enabled to establish this type of 
discourse into any of the programs, evaluations, or research contexts in which 
they may find themselves.
Since the program was designed to influence capacity at the individual 
level only, at the organizational level influence is most likely to occur as the 
indirect result of participants who are able to integrate their learning on the
<<<PAGE=221>>>

value and processes of introducing a feminist lens into the work of their 
organizations. As discussed earlier, this type of institutionalization was more 
apparent in the women’s and human rights-based organizations, where the 
shift was related to introducing access to evaluative thinking, and a feminist 
lens enabled them to identify dimensions of their work that were not evident 
earlier.
However, the senior participants from mainstream development organi-
zations felt confident that they would be able to make some inroads into the 
thinking at the institutions they worked with. At the same time, they also iden-
tified the constraints they faced. One of these is the challenge of using the 
terminology. Often the application of the term “feminist lens” has a tendency 
to address gender issues in a superficial manner, with little or no demand for 
systematic, gender-transformative programming and policy formulations, or 
their evaluation. And a number of the junior-level professionals did not feel 
competent enough to influence the work in their respective organizations.
The program has managed to have a small amount of direct engage-
ment with national and state government officials concerning the value of 
using a feminist or gender lens in program evaluation, and in addressing 
program design for equity outcomes. This engagement only happened in the 
final year of the program, and was primarily the result of a few workshops 
and seminars that were cohosted with NITI Aayog. The previous chief execu-
tive officer of NITI Aayog and a number of senior-level officials participated, 
and engaged actively in those events. The program results presented were 
received very positively, and a favorable policy environment was evident. 
However, for this to be sustained and integrated into mainstream program 
evaluations and design will require concerted, ongoing work.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Participants from rights-based organizations found value in learning from the 
program and the workshops. Many of them who are new to evaluation began 
to integrate evaluative thinking in their work.
The program provided a new way of looking at how to make evaluation 
gender responsive. But it was challenging at the organizational level, since 
new learning applications had to go through an internal process of explaining 
and convincing the leadership. Introducing a gender-transformative perspec -
tive in designing and implementing a program even at the organizational level 
would be slow and challenging. 
Researchers opined that the program enabled them to connect with 
practitioners. As for using the learning in their work, a couple of them noted 
that the term “feminist lens” was not always acceptable to their colleagues, so 
they used the concepts but not the terminology. The online community was 
very helpful, and much was learned from the information sharing.
9 Overall, 
there has been a positive contribution to building the field for feminist/

gender-transformative evaluation and opinions on transforming policies and 
programs using gendered evaluation.
However, there are serious challenges in conceptualizing feminist 
evaluation. One major challenge has been confusion around the question of 
whether equity-focused and gender-responsive evaluation is different than 
feminist evaluation. The question was raised time and again, both inside the 
group and outside of it, whether feminist evaluation is a separate methodol -
ogy or simply a frame of mind to use in looking at issues of inequality and 
gender-based power dynamics. There is also confusion as to whether femi-
nist evaluation is an approach that could be used in any evaluation practice. 
This was discussed in some of the group workshops: whether the feminist 
approach should be integrated into the project design, or not. The question 
of whether to use a feminist lens in project monitoring was another area of 
concern.
During the midterm evaluation workshop, some of the participants 
raised the issue of wider acceptance of evaluation reports conducted with 
a feminist lens. One participant raised her concern that policy makers do 
not want complexity: they like to see a few clear results, stated in terms of 
numbers. This may go against the grain of feminist evaluation. The opinion 
was expressed in this workshop that the feminist evaluation approach cannot 
produce figures and numbers: rather, it captures social changes or program/
project outcomes qualitatively. Perhaps this is the reason that policy makers 
and governments rely mostly on a set of institutes who practice and adopt 
more quantitative methods.
This brings up the second level of concerns for the group of feminist 
evaluators. The question was asked, how to bring feminist values into the eval-
uation findings, and how these values can be flagged so that policy makers 
will start noticing them. Other questions discussed were how to create an 
enabling environment for equity-focused and gender-responsive evaluation, 
and how to share lessons learned effectively in lessening gender inequalities. 
On this last question the group agreed that practicing feminist evaluation 
is part of a larger structure of feminist politics that ultimately tries to bring 
equality. This concern enabled the group to name feminist evaluation practice 
as gender-transformative evaluation in an Indian context. 
During these interactive sessions, it was understood that there is a 
need for further dialogue and discussion among the members of the group 
and among both young and senior practitioners and evaluators. A number of 
participants in the program were open to sharing and exchanging. The rec -
ognition of the importance of converging various approaches and methods 
even increased greatly with the progress of the program. The group agreed 
on a crucial issue that feminist evaluation knowledge needs to go beyond 
feminist constituency and reach a wider audience. The group also discussed 
how to deepen the alignment between feminist researchers, mainstream eval-
uators, and formal and informal networks of evaluators, donors, university 
and research institutes, governments, and NGOs in order to build the field of 
feminist evaluation. 
During the midterm external review workshop in 2014, the group 
agreed to strengthen the capacities of a larger group of development
<<<PAGE=223>>>

practitioners and M&E personnel through developing an easy-to-read toolkit 
and the mentoring of young practitioners by senior feminist evaluators. They 
also suggested that the community of practice can facilitate a space where 
people will be able to interact, debate, discuss, and share knowledge.
A feminist evaluation curriculum for India and South Asia that is main-
streamed through the university system would help in developing capacity 
in feminist evaluation. To ensure that feminist evaluation is adopted at the 
organizational level, there is a need to orient staff, particularly the leadership. 
The group also felt a need to engage more with government officials, and 
with a focused and targeted approach.
A series of suggestions was rendered by the evaluators at the end of 
the four-year program. These suggestions came out through conversations 
with members of the group. One important suggestion was to continue orga-
nizing policy workshops, publishing policy briefs, and publishing in reputable 
journals and edited volumes in order to document the process of change 
that feminist evaluation has created. The second important suggestion was 
to find ways to increase visibility of the group of feminist evaluators in India. 
The third suggestion was to make efforts to integrate equity-focused, gen-
der-responsive evaluation with mainstream evaluation methods such as 
utilization-focused evaluation, or impact evaluation.
In the longer run, organizational capacity building for integrating a 
feminist lens would be aimed at the foundation that has been built by this 
program. Attention is needed to support continued research on documenting 
the approaches and the value gained with feminist evaluation, and its integra-
tion into mainstream development research agendas. 
Continuing the feminist evaluation e-network and community of prac -
tice is a priority. The recent development of EvalGender+ stepping in to 
support this is a big plus, and will help to maintain the momentum that has 
been generated. This platform has been valuable for encouraging exchange 
on theory and practice, creating a space in which to question and have a dia-
logue on issues, challenges, different methods, and their applications.
Outreach and dissemination of key messages and lessons learned from 
the knowledge products that have been produced for different audiences 
will help to expand the audience and understanding gained beyond those 
who are active participants in this work.
As a follow-up of the program, the core group of feminist evaluators 
might consider introducing courses in feminist/gender-transformative evalu-
ation at evaluation training centers in India. Gender is becoming a standard 
cross-cutting objective in development programs, but not enough attention is 
being given to how the objectives can be attained in reality. At the same time, 
building of capacity at the organizational level for integrating a feminist lens 
in the design and monitoring of programs for producing gender-equitable 
results will be another key step. This can be linked to working with donors to 
promote building a culture of evaluation with a feminist lens. 
The core group of gender evaluation network participants, along with 
ISST, are well positioned to expand collaboration with NITI Aayog and the 
state governments to review their evaluation guidelines and methodologies, 
and their M&E review processes. In some states, leaders of this feminist

evaluation network are already assisting with reform of the M&E processes, 
and are documenting their work so that it can be used to assist in cross-learn-
ing mobilizing support.
This would also be an interesting way to get the insights and involve-
ment of the leaders in feminist evaluation, who otherwise do not have time to 
contribute to the online platforms or join the discussion groups.
Research funding for feminist evaluation is an ongoing constraint, and 
the online community of practice can take up this issue and find ways to 
establish a research fund for supporting ongoing research.

Chapter 13
Evaluation Cooperation in  
West Africa
Abdoulaye Gounou
Abstract . Evaluation is an increasing concern for the francophone countries of West 
Africa: however, for the most part impact assessment does not yet have the interest 
it should in these countries. To reverse this trend, under Benin’s leadership, a capaci-
ty-building program has been initiated to promote impact evaluation as a tool for public 
policy analysis, support impact evaluation studies in these countries, and gain consider-
ation for the results of impact evaluation within the framework of public management. 
This innovative project involves South-South cooperation between countries that share 
roughly similar economic, political, and social contexts, as well as a legal and economic 
framework that is converging. The growing interest of West African states in evaluation 
has led several countries to develop their own evaluation systems. In 2012, eight coun-
tries with similar interests met for a workshop on monitoring and evaluation. As a result 
of the workshop, three countries—Benin, South Africa, and Uganda—are continuing 
to cooperate by developing the Twende Mbele (“Let’s All Move Forward”) program to 
strengthen performance and evaluation monitoring. This program aims to strengthen 
national evaluation systems, and to gradually extend its interventions to other African 
countries through the development of appropriate tools for monitoring and evaluation, 
the capitalization of knowledge resulting from evaluations, and the sharing of national 
experiences in evaluation.

rancophone West Africa is identified as an area where there is a need 
for capacity building in evaluation. The practice of evaluation is itself very 
uneven and, depending on the country, the institutionalization of evalua-
tion is still rudimentary. This observation was made during the francophone 
dialogue on evaluation capacity development held in Cotonou on July 7, 2015. 
More specifically, in the countries of the West African Economic and Mone-
tary Union (WAEMU), the production and use of evidence through impact 
evaluations to inform public decision making is still very weak.
1 
Several initiatives at the national and regional levels have been under-
taken to provide answers to this unpleasant picture as it has been observed in 
francophone West Africa. These initiatives include national evaluation days as 
well as regional programs such as Twende Mbele (“Let’s All Move Forward”) 
and the Capacity Building and Impact Assessment Program in West Africa 
(WACIE). 
This chapter will show how such initiatives can help to effectively 
strengthen the institutionalization of evaluation, and improve evaluation prac-
tice in the francophone countries of West Africa. It will also show that the 
development of evaluation in these countries has also brought about the 
design and implementation of regional programs for the sharing of best prac-
tices, and support for sustainable capacity building.
The chapter is structured in four parts, plus a conclusion. The first part 
describes Benin’s experience, in particular progress made in the field of eval-
uation and how cooperation has influenced this evolution. The second and 
third parts, respectively, present the WACIE and Twende Mbele programs. 
The fourth part demonstrates how effective implementation of these two 
programs and their interrelationship offers clear opportunities for the devel-
opment of evaluation at the regional level.
BENIN’S EXPERIENCE IN REGIONAL COOPERATION
In 2007, Benin initiated the process of developing evaluative work by assigning 
this task to a ministry. Within the framework of the operational management 
of this function, the Office of Public Action Evaluation; the Bureau of Public 
Policy Evaluation; the Directorate General of Evaluation; and finally (and 
currently), the Bureau for the Evaluation of Public Policies and Analysis of 
Governmental Action were established.
The strategy adopted by this institution from its establishment in 2007 
until the present basically involves benchmarking and integrating Benin into 
international evaluation networks. By participating in international evaluation 
conferences, Benin realized that South Africa and Uganda are in the lead in 
establishing national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems. In 2012, the 
government of Benin endowed the country with a national evaluation policy 
(NEP 2012–2021), and set up an institutional framework for public policy 
evaluation, which includes the organizations in charge of M&E and develop-
ment planning.

Chapter 13. Evaluation Cooperation in West Africa  207
These advances at the national level have resulted in closer coop-
eration between Benin, South Africa, and Uganda, and as they appreciated 
the country’s efforts in this area and its lead over other francophone West 
African counterparts.
Determination from its national stakeholders, supported by strong 
political will, has enabled Benin to join its peers from South Africa and 
Uganda in the evaluation cooperation program called Twende Mbele.
As members of the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), 
South Africa and Uganda encouraged Benin to join this initiative for help 
in developing the practice of impact evaluation. In 2014, Benin signed a 
memorandum with 3ie that enables it to receive annual grants for the com-
missioning of impact assessments, and for capacity-building activities in 
impact evaluation.
When participating in 3ie’s Evidence Weeks, Benin observed the 
absence of almost all the francophone countries of the WAEMU area. The 
initiative for a regional development program of impact assessment in the 
WAEMU area was designed, and eventually evolved into WACIE.
3ie’s traditional field of intervention is impact evaluation, but the insti-
tution has broadened its scope to include the area of monitoring. Impact 
evaluation remains the organization’s main focus, but a window is now open 
for providing support for the strengthening of national M&E systems, and the 
promotion of researchers from Global South countries, in an attempt to help 
reduce the gap between North and South in the field of evaluation. 
Especially in West Africa, national evaluation systems are weak, the 
culture of evaluation is still in an early stage, and the practice of impact 
evaluation is almost nonexistent. This weak culture is caused by a series of 
difficulties that the promotion and development of evaluation faces, in partic-
ular low demand for evaluation in the region; weakness of national statistical 
systems; and the minimal degree of ownership of evaluation issues by states 
that have left the demand for and funding of evaluations to donors.
WACIE offers opportunities in the West Africa region for collaboration 
with the Twende Mbele program, which is a continental initiative. Benin’s lead-
ership in promoting evaluation has been demonstrated through its official 
support for WACIE, and its support for French-speaking countries in West 
Africa to look to Twende Mbele to help them make progress on governance 
and accountability issues. Benin promotes the Twende Mbele program in 
West Africa. And WACIE, which is a regional initiative, has become an oppor -
tunity for Twende Mbele to reach many more audiences.
THE CAPACITY BUILDING AND IMPACT EVALUATION 
PROGRAM IN WEST AFRICA (WACIE)
It is now recognized that rigorous impact evaluations can help quantify 
the socioeconomic impacts of projects and programs in several areas, and 
can provide a solid basis for consistent policy-making decisions. Although 
there is a growing global interest in impact evaluations, a report on trends 
in Sub-Saharan Africa revealed that there is little to no buy-in from countries 
and nationals of the continent (Mendiratta. 2011). Despite a considerable
<<<PAGE=230>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
208
increase in terms of the number of evaluations since 2004 (77 percent from 
2004 onward), there are still significant disparities. For instance, impact evalu-
ations in Africa are conducted much more frequently in anglophone countries 
(mainly Kenya, followed by Uganda) compared to francophone countries 
(18 percent).
2 In addition, only 11 percent of the studies 3 are conducted 
with African experts involved in the drafting of the research paper, although 
African partners (e.g., local NGOs, ministries, etc.) are involved in various 
stages of the implementation of the programs.
Over the past two years, discussions with key regional stakeholders, 
including the African Development Bank, the West African Development 
Bank, and the governments of Benin, Guinea Bissau, Niger, and Senegal have 
identified a real need for capacity building in order to produce high-quality 
research results, and to promote their use in the development and implemen-
tation of policies. While most governments in the West African region have 
monitoring systems in place, three key conditions limit rigorous impact eval -
uations: a lack of the human resources and institutional capacity that could 
help to conduct and use impact evaluations; a limited monitoring system for 
helping in the implementation of evaluations; and a low level of competence 
to conduct the required studies. WACIE was created to tackle these issues. 
WACIE is a regionally based national initiative to improve welfare and 
development outcomes through decision making that is informed by research 
findings in the West African region. The initial phase of the program will 
begin in year 2017 and will last three years, followed by a consolidation 
phase, which may be carried out by a regional organization within WAEMU. 
The program is promoted by the government of Benin, with partial technical 
and financial support from 3ie.
Key Elements of the Program
As specified in the program documents, WACIE’s overall objective is to 
improve welfare outcomes through informed decision making, based on 
evidence from research findings in the region. To this end, the program is 
characterized by several key elements:
 n Initiating and managing consultations at the national level to iden-
tify key areas where evidence is needed for policy making and 
programmatic decision making
 n Establishing and managing a funding mechanism to sponsor public 
policy impact evaluations
 n Developing a set of standards, guidelines, and databases to guide 
and communicate evaluation results
 n Designing, implementing, and disseminating assessments
2 Angola, Cape Verde, Eritrea, Mauritius, Mozambique, and Rwanda are classified 
as neither English- nor French-speaking countries in the report. They account for about 
12 percent of impact assessments.
3 The statistics are based on 257 evaluations from the years 1982–2010.

 n Providing training and capacity building to support the planning and 
implementation of impact evaluations, and the use of evidence in 
the decision-making process in the region
The proposed initiative covers a number of areas.
 n Capacity strengthening to produce and use research findings . 
 § The capacity to produce scientific evidence will be enhanced 
through the participation of local researchers in the funded stud-
ies.
4 Training in impact evaluation will also be offered within the 
member countries, in collaboration with the Regional Centers for 
Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR).
 § The creation of partnerships, codevelopment, and coeducation 
of training programs with regional academic institutions such as 
the African School of Economics.
5
 § The capacity to use research results will also be developed 
through one or more workshops targeted at decision makers 
that will be organized within the country. 
 § The provision of grants to provide staff for trainings and 
conferences.
 § Support through an assurance of assistance for quality impact 
evaluation of local governments and partners in the region.
 § Development of a network to connect personnel, researchers, 
and decision makers in the region. Furthermore, study teams will 
be made available to conduct workshops with their respective 
implementing agencies, thereby enhancing impact evaluation 
know-how and the use of research findings in institutions for the 
conception and implementation of projects and programs.
 n Creation of a database of research results . This will involve 
support for at least four impact assessment studies. These studies 
will focus on areas and research issues identified by WACIE member 
governments in West Africa. They will be based on consultation ses-
sions supported by WACIE secretariat staff, and supervised by 3ie 
staff. Staff and study teams will liaise with line ministries to discuss 
opportunities for impact evaluation of selected programs and their 
implications, and 3ie will conduct the studies independently. The 
conception phase of the impact evaluation will be subject to forma-
tive evaluation of the implementation process.
 n Policy interpretation of research findings 3ie has a well-devel -
oped system for supporting and monitoring the use of study results. 
Through this system, the project will support the production of the

operational synthesis of results, and one-page research recommen-
dations on all studies, along with other guidelines derived from 
research findings that are relevant to help develop major policies.
 n Learning from international experience . The program will include 
a grant component to enable participation in international confer -
ences and workshops on impact evaluation, including preconference 
training. A total of 16 grants will be offered each year.
 n Program management . The program will be managed by 3ie 
international staff based in New Delhi, supported by a secretariat 
located in Cotonou.
Logic of the Intervention
By the end of its implementation, the program is expected to contribute to 
improving the living conditions of the people of the WAEMU region through 
more effective public policies. The expected effects are:
 n Improving the effectiveness and relevance of national and sub-
regional projects and programs;
 n Making use of systematic and sustainable evidence in the formula-
tion and implementation of public policies; and
 n Ensuring effective program management.
To observe these effects, the following causal pathways should be 
achieved:
 n Evidence is produced and used to influence and support the formu-
lation and implementation of public policies in each country, as well 
as subregional programs in the WAEMU area
 n The WAEMU countries’ national evaluation systems are strength-
ened and able to produce evidence for informed decision making
The intervention of WACIE is therefore designed to produce evidence 
that can highlight public policy choices in francophone West Africa, with a 
view toward contributing to the ultimate improvement of the living condi-
tions of the people of the WAEMU area. We are, however, assuming that 
evidence may not necessarily lead to policy changes for various reasons: for 
example, because other policies have priority; or because doubts are raised 
about the evidence; or because trade-offs have been made to achieve political 
compromises.
In this respect, some of the risks are related to the lack of will of the 
decision makers or the political context in certain countries. 
To lessen these risks, it is necessary to ensure the commitment made 
by all WACIE member states when they join 3ie. This commitment stipulates, 
among other things, that the member countries of 3ie will commit to using 
the results of the impact evaluations financed by 3ie in their countries, in 
order to improve the quality of public policies. Similarly, the ministers respon-
sible for public policy evaluation in each WAEMU country will be involved in
<<<PAGE=233>>>
Chapter 13. Evaluation Cooperation in West Africa  211
defining the program’s orientations, and will avert risks to the judicious use of 
the results and recommendations of evaluations.
To support the planning and implementation of impact evaluations 
and the use of evidence generated by such evaluations, WACIE plans to 
strengthen the technical capacities of the various stakeholders. Scholarships 
for training in impact assessment, or participation in technical workshops on 
impact evaluation in the subregion, will be awarded for this purpose. This 
ambition could be undermined by the lack of a training center or high-level 
technical workshop on impact evaluation in the subregion. For this reason, the 
program will support and encourage institutions and research centers that 
have the capacities to offer quality trainings or technical workshops on impact 
evaluation, to increase their offerings.
Milestones and Stakeholders
Six of the eight WAEMU countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, 
Niger, and Senegal), and the West African Development Bank, are now members 
of 3ie. 3ie has also already supported nine impact assessments (in Benin, Burkina 
Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal). These impact assessments were preceded by 
capacity-building workshops and consultations. 3ie has also supported four 
capacity-building workshops in the region (in Benin, Burkina Faso, and Togo).
WACIE will bring together as stakeholders the member states of 
WAEMU; WAEMU regional institutions (i.e., the WAEMU donor agencies); 3ie; 
and other nonregional donors (i.e., donor agencies outside of WAEMU), as 
well as other stakeholders.
 n WAEMU member states . Each country participating in WACIE 
will be identifying and choosing a focal point for working with the 
WACIE secretariat. Focal points are public institutions with a legal 
mandate to work on impact evaluation issues with the support of 
their respective government authorities. The role of the focal points 
is to facilitate the implementation of WACIE at the country level: 
they will play a key role in the consultation process of identifying 
relevant projects in relation to the socioeconomic context of each 
country. In addition, they will ensure the effective involvement of 
local and national institutions in the initiative.
 n WAEMU regional institutions (WAEMU donor agencies) . These 
are the West African Development Bank and the WAEMU Com-
mission. They represent WAEMU internal donors who will be 
supporting WACIE and helping to define strategic policy by partici-
pating in WACIE Advisory Committee.
 n 3ie . 3ie will act on the one hand as a catalyst throughout the ini-
tiative, by motivating regional involvement and participation in the 
program; and on the other hand, coordinating and supporting some 
WACIE activities. WACIE will be led by 3ie’s main office in New Delhi. 
The design of WACIE assumes that there are resources for impact 
evaluation in the West African region, and that these resources 
need to be channeled through training and technical assistance.
<<<PAGE=234>>>

 n Other nonregional donors (non-WAEMU donor agencies) . 
These are other technical and financial partners from the WAEMU 
member states that will cofinance the program: for example, the 
Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the African Develop-
ment Bank, and others. They will help mobilize resources and define 
WACIE’s strategic policy by participating in the its Advisory Commit-
tee. WACIE support modalities are presented later in this chapter.
 n Other stakeholders . This group includes the project-execut -
ing agencies that will be selected under WACIE. It also includes 
research teams, and all institutions not included in the previous 
groups that will benefit from or contribute to the initiative.
STRENGTHENING PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION 
MONITORING PROGRAMS: TWENDE MBELE 
In March 2012, The South African Department of Performance Planning and 
Monitoring and CLEAR in anglophone Africa organized a regional workshop 
with seven African countries in Johannesburg in March 2012. At this workshop, 
Benin, South Africa, and Uganda recognized the similarity of their approaches 
to developing their national evaluation systems. Since then, they have col -
laborated by sharing guidelines and methodological tools, and attending 
training and events together. This has allowed for some cross-learning and 
the building of a slight, but effective, collaboration between the three nations. 
And in both anglophone and francophone Africa, CLEAR has worked with 
these three countries during the initiative.
Since 2013, the United Kingdom’s Department for International 
Development (DFID) has been supporting the South African Department 
of Performance in their Strengthening Performance M&E project, which is 
focusing on the use of M&E in front-line service delivery and on citizen moni-
toring to inform the government on results delivered to the people of South 
Africa. The result of the project is that effective delivery of front-line services, 
a citizen-based surveillance system, and a results-based evaluation system 
support government accountability to the South African populace. A total 
of £2 million has been made available over 2013–15. The project has been 
successful: the systems have developed rapidly and have had impacts on the 
formulation and implementation of policies. This South African experience 
has been shared as a training in the framework of cooperation between Benin, 
South Africa, and Uganda.
These three countries have been active promoters of regional and 
international networks, including CLEAR and 3ie; both are supported by DFID. 
South Africa and the United Kingdom are also members of the Partnership 
for Open Government, which promotes accountability and transparency in 
government action. Other countries have been interested in what these three 
countries are doing, with study visits from countries such as Botswana, Kenya, 
Lesotho, Mauritius, Niger, Seychelles, and Togo. They are sharing their expe-
riences and tools widely in the region, both in evaluation and monitoring, 
especially when they rely on the regional work CLEAR undertakes.
<<<PAGE=235>>>
Chapter 13. Evaluation Cooperation in West Africa  213
The Twende Mbele program aims to support emerging countries across 
Africa, enabling the three founding partners to intensify learning and to involve 
other partners that are determined to move forward with M&E. The program 
will also be built on global experience, using a range of M&E mechanisms that 
have been proven to improve government performance and accountability.
DFID is currently funding the African Networks Strengthening for Gov-
ernance, Accountability, and Transparency (SANGAT) program, which supports 
three other African networks. SANGAT aims to take advantage of the exist -
ing projects, demand-driven processes, and peer learning in thematic areas. 
There are currently three SANGAT projects, focusing on areas from budget 
transparency and public finance to a high-level network dealing with major 
issues of prosecution and organized crime. Twende Mbele is being funded as 
a fourth component of the SANGAT program.
Key Elements of the Program
As specified in the project documents, the immediate result proposed for 
Twende Mbele is “the improvement of M&E systems (e.g., practices, policies, 
tools and procedures) demonstrated in partner countries based on shared 
experiences.” The theory of change assumes that the M&E systems demon-
strated in the project (immediate outcomes) will be expanded and further 
developed, and will be applied in additional countries over a period of six 
years (wider result) in order to improve the output and accountability of gov-
ernments toward their citizens. This would result in improved services, a better 
use of M&E products by parliaments, and an improved performance culture.
The immediate results—demonstration of improved M&E systems—
will be achieved by:
 n The creation of an M&E application at the level of senior manage-
ment, Parliament, and the public;
 n The conduct of learning and sharing activities to build on, based on 
the experience of current partners; 
 n The development of specific M&E tools in collaboration with part -
ners; and
 n The implementation of programs to ensure ownership and 
cost-effectiveness.
Many countries undertake surveillance activities, but this program 
seeks to work specifically with those seeking to make a systematic assess-
ment within government as well as monitoring, so that there is a desire for 
learning and deeper change, and more systemic effects on the output and 
impact of governments on the living conditions of their people.
Milestone and Stakeholders
The central objective of Twende Mbele is not to constitute a network where 
countries share their experiences a priori, but to help collaborate in the devel-
opment and implementation of M&E systems that improve the performance 
and impact of government actions on citizens.
<<<PAGE=236>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
214
Established in 2015, the plan predicts that by 2018, the number of 
partner countries will increase from three to six. There is already high demand 
for countries to be included in the project, but participating countries must 
maintain a commitment level corresponding to their capacities. It is therefore 
important to define an engagement strategy to include other countries. For 
those countries that do not have a sufficient level of development of their 
national M&E systems, Twende Mbele has put in place an inclusion mecha-
nism based on differentiations between countries. This option works primarily 
with countries that are truly committed to using M&E to improve the lives of 
their citizens.
An initial classification has placed countries in three broad categories:
 n Category A . Those “knocking on the door” are committed to using 
M&E in change processes (the indirect indicator being that they are 
engaged in the evaluation)
 n Category B . Those who are already initiating actions in the field of 
M&E, have individual champions, and are willing to become more 
involved
 n Category C . Those with some interest but who are not actively pur-
suing M&E as a key element in improving government performance
The program wishes to actively target all of these countries, and include 
them to the extent possible in its activities. Their involvement and ability to 
advance the work will be evaluated using explicit criteria, and enabling them 
to become collaborative partners.
Potential partners in Category A are already very active in   M&E, and 
are keen to improve what they are already doing for better government 
performance. In these countries, there is already the political will to expose 
failures and draw lessons from them. These partners could improve their 
activities by appropriating and contextualizing some of the more advanced 
tools that have been operationalized in countries outside of Africa. The most 
effective strategy to employ with these countries is to collaborate on the 
development of their national M&E systems in order to make them more 
effective and inclusive. This category includes Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Niger. 
They can be considered main partners in the program.
The countries in Category B have some involvement in M&E, but have 
not yet committed to extensive systems, or faced rigorous evaluations that 
may reveal weaknesses. For those with significant interest in M&E, participa-
tion in learning and capacity-building activities can be beneficial. However, 
these countries need to demonstrate their interest in using these opportu-
nities. This category includes Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Rwanda, 
Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia.
Category C countries may not be interested in being involved in 
Twende Mbele, but it may be appropriate to involve them in activities such as 
newsletters, and informing them of events they might be able to attend. The 
program should aim to spread M&E focal points across all African countries, 
and to share news about Twende Mbele as well as general M&E activities
<<<PAGE=237>>>
Chapter 13. Evaluation Cooperation in West Africa  215
and information that might stimulate further interest. This category includes 
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
It is essential that this process be based on self-selection, and that 
countries recognize where they stand in relation to Twende Mbele. They must 
also commit to the appropriate roles for each level of participation if they 
wish to participate.
LEARNING FROM THE BENIN EXPERIENCE
Becoming a member of 3ie has allowed Benin to benefit from financial and 
technical support for undertaking the impact evaluation of the Free Support 
for the Scholarship of Girls in Secondary School Level One Program. This 
program is designed to promote the schooling of young girls across the 
country and contribute to reducing the education gap with young boys.
The government of Benin is waiting for the evaluation findings in order 
to improve its sectoral reforms in the field of education. 3ie has also given 
financial support to many Beninese in the field of capacity building, to attend 
courses and seminars around the world that are linked to impact evaluation.
Difficulties Encountered
The major difficulty faced up to now in the area of cooperation to promote 
M&E—both at the country and subregional levels—is related to WACIE, 
which, while it is a country-level initiative, has program objectives that remain 
regional. 
In fact, the promotion of WACIE requires WAEMU country members to 
belong to 3ie. Each WAEMU country member has the responsibility to fulfill 
this essential condition in order for the program to become a reality. Program 
implementation needs the strong engagement of all of its stakeholders, espe-
cially the WAEMU states, and communitarian institutions such as the WAEMU 
Commission and the West African Development Bank.
Perspectives
Benin’s approach to its evaluation system has enabled the country to build its 
international reputation for the innovative cooperation programs it has devel-
oped with its partners. The ultimate expected result of the Twende Mbele 
program is the effectiveness of national M&E systems at the continental level: 
WACIE, which is a regional community program, offers promising prospects 
for the development of Impact evaluation at the regional level.
The sharing of experience and the development of collaborative gov -
ernance tools encouraged by these programs will undoubtedly improve the 
quality of transparency in public management at the continental level.
After its pilot phase, WACIE will be carried out by a community institu-
tion, and will be a reference organization for WAEMU through the research 
results and evidence obtained. Through these results, WACIE will be able to 
feed the process of defining the community directives for WAEMU.
The movement that Benin will instigate through its inclusion in global 
evaluation networks will lead the countries involved to improve their quality

of governance: this could result in the improvement of their standings accord-
ing to the Ibrahim Index of African Governance.6
CONCLUSION
Development policies and programs at the global level demand better per -
formance and more efficiency not only from states but also from partners 
and donors. Evaluation is a mechanism used to report on the commitments 
made in order to ensure good governance: it is a strategic steering tool that 
can help to inform decision makers.
African states must therefore take ownership of evaluation, according 
to their sociocultural contexts, and they should pool their experiences in order 
to improve governance. This pooling calls for the establishment of regional 
and subregional cooperation platforms for the strengthening of national M&E 
systems, with the aim of improving the living conditions of the people.
Benin’s experience in the field of public policy evaluation has shown 
that it is important to open up to other experiences in order to capitalize 
on achievements. It is within this framework that Benin has initiated the 
setting up of a regional program for capacity building and impact assess-
ment in the WAEMU countries, in partnership with 3ie. This program will 
not only develop impact assessment within WAEMU countries, but will also 
strengthen national evaluation systems and the capacities of stakeholders to 
conduct the evaluation.
To achieve this, WACIE will establish a mechanism for the selection of 
evaluation areas, and analysis of the results and conclusions of evaluation 
reports. It will also lead consultations aimed at setting standards, guidelines, 
and supporting funding mechanisms. 
Benin is also relying on the Twende Mbele program, which is the result 
of its cooperation with South Africa and Uganda, to strengthen the collec -
tive learning process at the subregional level through M&E performance 
improvement and evaluation practice. These cooperative regional initiatives 
in evaluation will open new perspectives for the development of evaluation 
in Africa.

6 The Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) provides an annual assessment 
of the quality of governance in every African country. Originally established in associ-

Environmental and Social 
Safeguards in India -  
A Critical Assessment
Shekhar Singh
Abstract . This chapter describes the state of environmental and social safeguards in 
India, as applicable to development projects and activities. A theoretical framework and 
a brief historical background is provided to contextualize the contemporary situation. 
Though traditional human activities were for the most part environmentally sustain-
able, the development of technology and the growth of human population is putting 
increasing pressure on the natural environment. Skewed economic and social devel -
opment, perhaps as a result of selective access to natural resources and technology, 
have also begun to show trends of inequity. This has resulted in human interventions 
that sometimes benefit the few at the cost of the many. In response, most countries 
have set up environmental and social safeguard regimes designed to assess the pos-
sible environmental and social impacts of human activities, to disallow those that are 
not viable, and to establish and monitor measures for minimizing and mitigating the 
adverse impacts of those judged to be viable. Unfortunately, in many countries—as, 
for example, in India—these measures have not been very effective because of vested 
interests both within and outside of the government, whose own objectives are better 
served by undermining, or rendering ineffective, all such safeguards.

ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS
Conceptual Framework
The proposition that most contemporary human activities disrupt the natural 
environment and its processes is widely accepted today. However, there is 
much dispute about which impacts are acceptable, and to what extent. The 
stress here is on contemporary human activities, as many argue that tradi-
tional rural and tribal societies lived in harmony with nature, and in some 
cases still do.
In India, two traditional groups that come to mind are the isolated 
tribes of the Jarawas and the Sentinelese, in the Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands. There is no evidence to believe that the presence of these groups has 
in any significant way degraded the ecosystem they inhabit. Apart from the 
fact that their numbers have been stable over many years, they reportedly 
have many rituals that ensure that they do not adversely affect their natural 
environment. One such ritual is the reported practice of hunting parties 
half-breaking a prominent branch in a prominent tree in the area where they 
have recently hunted a wild pig. This hanging branch serves as a warning to 
other hunters who might venture there, that a pig has been recently killed 
in the area, and therefore they should hunt elsewhere. In a few weeks, the 
half-broken branch dries up and falls to the ground, once again opening the 
area to other hunters.
1
Such practices of the Jarawas—and presumably of the Sentinelese, 
about whom much less is known—ensure that their footprint on nature is 
kept to a minimum and does not have a permanent adverse impact. However, 
most other rural communities in India cannot rightfully claim that their survival 
strategies are in harmony with nature. The conversion from hunting-gathering 
to shifting or settled agricultural practices alone has transformed natural 
ecosystems all over India. 
Whether historical natural processes are the best, or the only, way 
forward is now a somewhat moot philosophical question. The time when the 
answer to this question would have been relevant has long since passed. 
However, the limits of change and manipulation of the natural environment, 
and the consequences of getting them wrong, are still very relevant.
Environmental Safeguards and the Government
Governments have the unenviable task of determining how much use and 
disturbance of nature is permissible, and how to meet the basic needs and 
growing aspirations of their people without overstepping these boundaries.
1 This story was told to me by Samir Acharya, founding president of the Society 
for Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) while I was holding hearings in Port Blair, 
as the Supreme Court of India appointed the commissioner for forests and related 
matters of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (2000). Many such stories describing 
the conservation practices of tribal and indigenous people can be found in Bharucha 
(2016).

Most, perhaps all, governments have adopted policies whereby a 
certain proportion of the nation’s area, representing various types of ecosys-
tems, is conserved in its natural state. In India, these are the national parks, set 
up under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.
Other areas are classified such that only certain types of activities can be 
permitted there. In India these are identified as wildlife sanctuaries, reserved 
forests, conservation reserves, community reserves, notified ecologically sen-
sitive areas and wetlands, and coastal zones, among other classifications: and 
they are protected under a host of laws and regulations. The proportion of 
area that a country protects in this way is mostly dependent on three factors: 
the richness and diversity of ecosystems and species found in the country, 
the demand for land and other natural resources for human use, and the way 
these are balanced against the political will of the government to conserve 
nature and to sustainably use natural resources. Unfortunately, most coun-
tries in the world seem to be struggling to get this balance right.
For the remaining areas, most countries have restrictions on the types 
of land or water use permitted and regulations concerning the extraction of 
resources, the destruction of natural habitats, and the release of effluents. 
These standards vary from country to country and from ecosystem to eco-
system, and are a function of the cost and availability of “green” technology; 
the levels of environmental awareness and activism among the populace; the 
commitment and ability of the government to ensure long-term sustainability 
of growth and development; and the inclination and ability of the nation to 
transfer its environmental costs onto others.
Evaluating Programs
In 1950, the government of India set up a Planning Commission modeled after 
the planning infrastructure in the then-USSR. As a part of the Planning Com-
mission, a Programme Evaluation Organisation (PEO) was created to evaluate 
the various programs being undertaken by the government and supported by 
the Planning Commission. Over the last 60 years or so, many of the import -
ant programs of the government of India and the various state governments 
were evaluated by the PEO.
2 For many years, most of the evaluations focused 
on economic and social outcomes, and on cost and time efficiency. Gradually 
the scope of the evaluations expanded and new aspects were introduced, 
including environmental aspects. However, these evaluations were mostly ex 
post facto, or at best carried out midterm, and dealt with only a few specif -
ically selected programs. They therefore were not adequate for assessing 
the social and environmental impacts of programs, projects, and activities in 
advance of their being initiated, nor for assessing their social and environmen-
tal viability. They did perform the important role of influencing the design and 
implementation of new and ongoing programs. Unfortunately, the Planning 
Commission, and along with it the PEO, were terminated in 2014.

Regulating Use and Disturbance
Experience has shown that in matters related to the environment—because 
once damage is done, it might not be easily undone—it is not prudent to 
simply declare standards enforceable by law and hope that the deterrent 
effect of stringent penalties would adequately protect the environment. 
Therefore, most governments have adopted an environmental safeguards 
regime that requires projects and activities to be subject to prior assessment 
and clearance. 
In India, the environmental safeguards regime was initiated in 1974 
through an administrative order. In 1994, the requirement of prior environ-
mental clearance for most projects was made legally binding under the 
Environmental Protection Act of 1986. 
To appraise projects and recommend environmental clearance, various 
environmental appraisal committees (EACs) were set up at the national level 
under the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
3 separately for different 
types of projects. These EACs were chaired, and had as members, indepen-
dent experts from outside the government. Officials from various of the 
concerned departments were ex officio members. Though the EACs still func-
tion, in 2006 powers were delegated to the state governments to appraise 
and grant clearance for certain categories of projects, essentially the smaller 
and less problematic ones.
The basic process of carrying out appraisal, granting clearances, and 
monitoring compliance essentially involves an environmental impact state-
ment being prepared by an expert body hired by the project proponents for 
that purpose. The regulating ministry has guidelines concerning the prepa-
ration of these impact statements. The statement is then appraised by the 
appropriate EAC of the ministry. 
The EACs recommend to the ministry whether a proposed project or 
activity should be given environmental clearance, with or without certain con-
ditions, or if it should be rejected. These recommendations are based on an 
examination of the impact assessment statement; other relevant documents 
and information; and discussions with experts and concerned stakeholders. 
For most types of projects, there is also a statutory requirement to 
hold public hearings involving interested and affected members of the public. 
In these hearings, the public is given an opportunity to express its views on the 
possible impacts of the proposed project; the suitability of the proposed pre-
ventive and mitigative measures; and the consequent viability of the project. 
EACs also sometimes carry out field visits to monitor and verify the situation 
on the ground.
Based on the recommendation of the EAC, the ministry issues a clear -
ance, a conditional clearance, or a rejection. Legally, since the EAC is only an 
advisory committee, the ministry is not bound by its recommendations.
3 The Ministry of Environment and Forests was renamed, in 2014, the Ministry 
of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). In order to avoid confusion, 
it is here consistently referred to as the environment ministry.
<<<PAGE=245>>>
Chapter 14. Environmental and Social Safeguards in India - A Critical Assessment  223
Apart from this environmental clearance, projects that have any liquid 
or gaseous effluents must also get clearances from the relevant pollution 
control boards. Where forestland is involved, either in the location or in 
the impact zone of the project or activity, a separate procedure for forest 
clearances is mandated, involving the Forest Advisory Committee. Where the 
project or activity is located in, or likely to impact, a wildlife protected area, or 
a protected species of fauna or flora, clearance is required from the National 
Board for Wildlife.
Once accorded, an environmental clearance can be suspended or 
revoked if the conditions for clearance are not complied with. Each project 
proponent is required to submit a report to the regional office of the environ-
ment ministry, under which it is located, every six months. The regional office 
has the responsibility of ensuring that the various conditions prescribed in 
the clearance are complied with. They are expected to do this based on these 
reports and on their own monitoring.
Major Challenges
On paper, India has a stringent and elaborate system of checks and bal -
ances with multiple authorities, professional bodies, committees, scientists 
and other professionals, and institutions, all of them identifying, appraising, 
assessing, and monitoring environmental impacts. However, internal contra-
dictions within the government, and the machinations of external vested 
interests, have made this elaborate system ineffective, and often corrupt. 
Internal contradictions within the government . The environmental safe-
guards regime, though initiated in the 1970s, was fully institutionalized only 
in the 1980s. At least in part, this institutionalization seemed to be the result 
of both direct and indirect international pressure, to which India had become 
susceptible.
4 There was also growing domestic media and judicial pressure, 
and a vocal environmental movement. Countering these pressures were 
domestic economic imperatives, the push for short-term gains that is the bane 
of a five-year election cycle, and the consequent demand for a rapid expansion 
of industrial and commercial activity, and of infrastructure. Growing human 
populations and aspirations created pressure to convert natural habitats into 
agricultural lands and human habitations. 
India’s political strategy relating to environmental safeguards seems to 
have evolved out of these opposing pressures. The 1980s saw the emergence 
of strong environmental policies and laws, and an expansion of environmental 
institutional structures. But it also saw the emergence of a plethora of strat-
egies that effectively negated the effects of these strengthened laws and 
institutions and allowed “business as usual” to continue. It allowed the Indian 
government and political leaders, even while they were showcasing to the 
country and to the world the progressive safeguard measures they had put

224
into position, to simultaneously escape the adverse political consequences of 
a slowdown in economic growth, albeit a temporary one. 
The process of undermining the environmental safeguards regime 
seems to have been spearheaded by four distinct yet interrelated strategies. 
Initially, there was a tendency to bypass or ignore the newly established reg-
ulatory regime. This, however, led to extensive litigation relating to various 
projects in which litigants challenged the legality of the government, ignor -
ing the regulatory agencies that they themselves had statutorily created.
5 A 
second, related strategy was to make sure that these regulatory agencies did 
the bidding of the government, and to refrain from setting up independent 
and objective regulatory agencies, despite orders from the Supreme Court of 
India to do so.
6 The third strategy was to make even these “controlled” reg-
ulatory agencies functionally ineffective by starving them of resources and 
personnel; and the fourth was to roll back the safeguards themselves.
Vested interests . Apart from internal contradictions confronting the Indian 
establishment, almost from the start there were various vested interests 
opposed to the proper implementation of environmental safeguards. At least 
four such interest groups emerged. 
Perhaps the most benign of these were those who saw many of the 
environmental safeguards, especially those seen as imposed by Western 
nations, as unnecessary and unfair, and an impediment to the urgent need 
for providing shelter, livelihood, and food to millions of impoverished Indians. 
To them, natural resources had to be made available, on a priority basis, in 
order to meet the immediate survival needs of the poor, and not be diverted 
or earmarked for long-term conservation imperatives, many of which seemed 
to them to be based on principles that were unproven, or inappropriately 
applied to Indian conditions.
While acknowledging the primacy of the needs of the poor, conser -
vationists argued that there were enough resources in the country to meet 
everyone’s basic needs, while ensuring environmental sustainability. But to 
do this, the existing resources needed to be more equitably used and dis-
tributed. There was, according to them, no justification for compromising the 
future of the people of India, especially the poor, just because the govern-
ment was not able, or willing, to redistribute resources, especially land, water, 
and forest resources, so that they could support the survival needs of the 
poor rather than the luxurious lifestyles of the rich. 
The second, far less benign, interest group militating against environ-
mental safeguards held that the safeguards inhibited national economic 
5 Perhaps the two best cases from that period are those against the proposed 
Tehri Dam and the Narmada project. For details about the Tehri Dam controversy, see

details on the controversy surrounding the Narmada dams, see, e.g., Peterson (2010).

growth and thereby prevented, or at least delayed, India’s transformation 
into a world economic power. The fact that India is now among the fastest 
growing economies in the world has further reinforced this belief among 
many. This group ignored all concerns about the impact of an economy that 
was growing rapidly, but inequitably, on the poor and marginalized segments 
of the society. They also ignored the inevitability of a façade of rapid eco-
nomic growth and expansion soon collapsing, if it was achieved in a manner 
that was not sustainable. 
A third interest group that opposed the environmental safeguards 
regime, sometimes very aggressively, was comprised of the powerful lobby 
of Indian, foreign, and multinational corporations, who saw environmental 
restrictions as impediments to their growth and profitability. The efforts of 
the Indian government to attract foreign investment, recently spurred by the 
launch of the “make in India” campaign, has exacerbated this conflict. This 
interest group argued that the availability, in India, of cheap and plentiful 
skilled labor was not enough to attract foreign investment, and the deal 
needed to be “sweetened” with weakened environmental regulations.
The fourth, and perhaps the most pernicious, of the vested interests 
opposing the proper implementation of environmental safeguards are the 
rent seekers. Much money stands to be made, and is being made, by allowing 
the violation of environmental norms in exchange for hefty political “dona-
tions” and personal bribes. Many political parties, functionaries, bureaucrats, 
scientists, and other professionals, benefit from this system. Ironically, these 
interests are best served if there are, on paper, strong regulations and safe-
guards, but a systemic inability to ensure that the regulators do their jobs 
effectively and honestly. 
The rent seekers also include public servants who are involved in grant-
ing contracts and clearing payments to builders and suppliers for government 
projects. These public servants seek, and often receive, pay-offs from the con-
tractors who are hired to build the project, and from other suppliers. For this 
to happen, the projects have to be initiated and constructed, and therefore 
environmental and social safeguards have to be bypassed. 
Safeguarding the interests of the “weaker  .” Apart from the above four 
vested interests, many countries around the world successfully transfer their 
own environmental costs onto other countries, both by dumping pollutants 
and by unsustainably exploiting their minerals and other natural resources. 
This represents another powerful vested interest that works against the safe-
guard regimes of victim countries. 
The tendency to exploit the “weaker” by forcing them to absorb the 
environmental costs of the “stronger” does not occur only among countries, 
but also happens within countries. In India, the location of environmentally 
destructive activities (such as mines and dams), and of hazardous and pol -
luting activities (such as chemical industries and coal-based power plants) is 
often influenced by the amount of economic and political clout held by the 
adversely affected communities. Certainly, the efficacy of the application of 
safeguards is profoundly influenced by the amount of political and economic 
power those likely to be adversely affected possess.
<<<PAGE=248>>>

226
As a counterbalance to these interests and pressures, India is also host 
to strong environmental movements, a sympathetic media, and a supportive 
judiciary. Nevertheless, the combined interests that have rallied against the 
effective implementation of a strong regulatory regime seem to be winning, 
as described below.
Subversive Strategies
Bypassing or ignoring the regulatory agency  . From the beginning, for 
reasons discussed above, the regulating ministries often came under pres-
sure from other departments and ministries of the national government, 
from state governments, and even from the prime minister’s office, to accel -
erate the process of environmental appraisal, and in some cases to grant 
undue environmental clearance to favored projects. In some cases, as will 
be discussed later, the concerned ministry succumbed to pressure. In others, 
they did not. In some of these latter cases, the central and state govern-
ments decided to ignore the regulating ministry and start work on the project 
before it had been granted environmental clearance and, in some cases, even 
before the environmental studies had been carried out. 
These half-completed projects were then presented to the regu-
latory ministry as a fait accompli. The fact that much of the anticipated 
environmental damage had already occurred, and as such could not be 
prevented or minimized, even if the project had now been abandoned, 
strengthened the arguments in favor of granting it ex post facto clear -
ance. The fact that a huge amount of public money had already been 
invested in the project created further moral and political pressure on the 
regulating ministry, despite the utter illegality and immorality of a project 
being initiated and half completed before the mandatory clearances were 
received.
In a few high-profile cases, the refusal of the regulatory ministry to 
grant clearance was overruled by the prime minister’s office, and the regu-
latory ministry was directed to accord clearance. Perhaps the most famous 
example of this was the granting of environmental clearance, in 1987, to the 
Narmada Sagar and Sardar Sarovar dams, which were two of the largest 
dams on the Narmada River. Despite the environment ministry categorically 
stating that the projects were not yet ready for appraisal, let alone clearance, 
the prime minister’s office overruled the ministry and directed that the proj-
ects be cleared, with a curious pari passu clause that mandated that studies 
and assessments be carried out concurrently with the construction. Following 
this logic, the projects would be ready for assessment only when they were 
fully constructed.
Many of the efforts to bypass or ignore the regulatory ministry were 
challenged in the courts of law and caused serious embarrassment to the 
government, and much adverse publicity. Perhaps because of this, there was 
a gradual shift to other strategies, as described below.
In 2013, there was a qualitative change in the efforts of the govern-
ment to bypass the environment ministry. In January 2013, the government 
of India set up a Cabinet Committee on Investments (CCI) as a part of its
<<<PAGE=249>>>
Chapter 14. Environmental and Social Safeguards in India - A Critical Assessment  227
proposed National Investment Board. 7 The CCI was designed and empow -
ered to intervene in instances where different approval processes, particularly 
those related to the environment, were thought to be impeding the economic 
growth of the country. The CCI had the power to review decisions taken by 
ministries in which projects had been refused approval, or there had been 
“undue” delays. It was also empowered to direct statutory authorities to 
discharge functions and exercise powers under the relevant laws and reg-
ulations within the prescribed time frames, for “promoting investment and 
economic growth.” 
This was widely seen as a strategy to gain political advantage in the 
forthcoming general elections of 2014. The mandate of this committee was 
essentially to bypass the environment ministry and other regulators, and to 
provide speedy, even almost automatic, clearances to proposed projects and 
activities that were pending with the ministry for more than three months, 
regardless of the fact that in many cases the required studies and assess-
ments had not been completed and submitted by the project proponents. 
The CCI then proceeded to ensure environmental clearance to these projects 
without conducting any scientific appraisal, or even having access to any pro-
fessional expertise (Press Information Bureau 2013). Going into the general 
elections of 2014, the Congress party claimed that it had granted environ-
mental clearance to a large number of projects in the previous year.
8
This was perhaps the most blatant and direct effort to bypass the envi-
ronmental regulatory mechanisms and safeguards, obviously necessitated 
because the environment ministry was not fully compliant with the wishes 
of the government, despite being headed by a minister from the ruling party. 
It was also an unprecedented obfuscation of the responsibilities of various 
ministries and levels within the government.
Though there has been no other comparably blatant effort at bypassing 
the regulatory mechanism (and in effect dismantling it), the new government, 
which took office in 2014, has not shown greater concern for the environ-
ment than the previous one. 
Compromising the scientific objectivity and integrity of the assessment 
process . Despite demands for an independent statutory body to appraise 
projects and activities, and to grant and monitor environmental clearances, 
this process continues to remain within the government. This is also despite 
the fact that in a ruling given in the case of Lafarge Umiam Mining Pvt. Ltd 
on July 6, 2011,
9 the Supreme Court of India emphasized the need for such 
an independent regulator. In another judgment, in the case of T.N. Godavar -
man Thirumulpad, the Supreme Court further reiterated that the central

228
government was required to set up a regulator at the national level, which 
would have offices in all of the states; which could carry out an independent, 
objective, and transparent appraisal and approval of the projects for environ-
mental clearances; and which could also monitor the implementation of the 
conditions laid down in the environmental clearances.
10 
The refusal to set up an independent regulatory mechanism was 
adversely commented upon by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India 
(CAG) in its report of 2016, which was prepared for submission to the Presi-
dent of India under Article 151 of the Constitution of India, to be presented 
to the Parliament: 
A National Regulator to oversee the entire process of grant of Envi-
ronmental Clearance and monitoring is yet to be appointed despite 
directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Environmental Clearances were 
granted to the Project Proponents without checking the compliance of 
the conditions mentioned in the previous Environmental Clearances and 
recommendations of the Regional Office. (CAG 2016, viii–ix)
Unfortunately, a high-level committee set up by the new government 
in 2014 recommended against the setting up of an independent authority 
for granting environmental clearances, citing the very reasons that had made 
such an independent authority desirable, as arguments against its creation.
While all technical aspects of an application/proposal for clearance 
would be examined on merits by the NEMA, it was felt that the final 
approval or rejection powers should be retained by the MoEF&CC. This 
is because there may be many other factors, relating to relationship 
with neighbouring countries, need to address regional disparity issues, 
dealing with areas and regions with special problems and issues, and 
need to take national security issues into account etc. etc, which may 
singly or in combination add a further politico-economic-strategic dimen-
sion in the decision making process. (HLC 2014, 59)
Delegating powers to the state government . To make things worse, in 
2006 a decision was taken by the government of India to delegate the power 
to grant environmental clearance for certain types of projects to the state 
governments.
11 This was a controversial decision for at least two reasons. 
First, there is a well-founded belief that state governments by and large are 
much less committed to implementing safeguards, especially environmental 
safeguards, than the central government is. It was this conviction that led 
the government of India, in 1980, to promulgate the Forest Conservation 
Act, which stipulates that no designated forestland can be diverted for non-
forest use by the state government without prior clearance of the central 
10 T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India and Others, 2014, http:/ /

government. Statistics suggest that subsequent to the enforcement of this 
law, the amount of forest land being diverted drastically shrank.
There are many reasons for the seeming indifference of state govern-
ments to environmental damage. Usually the performance of the political 
parties that are in power in a state is judged by its ability to enhance jobs and 
incomes, to provide basic services, and to distribute “freebies” and conces-
sions. Environmental conservation, primarily because of its long-term returns, 
is usually not a significant factor affecting the re-electability of the ruling 
political party.
Also, state governments usually function in a more unified manner, 
in which the head of the state, the chief minister, invariably exercises total 
power and control over all departments. There is little scope for environmen-
tal departments within a state to oppose or even delay and modify projects 
and activities that are politically important and that have the full support of 
the chief minister.
Evaluating the Performance of Government-Controlled 
Regulatory Authorities
Ignoring violations of the law  . The regulating agency is mandated, under 
the Environmental (Protection) Act of 1986, to: “direct (a) the closure, prohi-
bition or regulation of any industry, operation or process; or (b) stoppage or 
regulation of the supply of electricity or water or any other service” for any 
violation of the conditions of environmental clearance. 
However, despite this, and despite there being numerous such vio-
lations, the regulating ministry has rarely taken action against projects and 
project proponents that were in violation of the conditions of clearance. The 
CAG, as part of its sample assessment, identified numerous violations in the 
two years under review:
MoEF&CC had stipulated certain specific conditions in the EC either 
relating to sectors or to the project which were to be followed by PPs. 
It was observed that the monitoring agencies were not able to ensure 
compliance to the EC conditions. (CAG 2016, 69)
Furthermore:
…there was shortfall of 43 to 78 per cent (with reference to compliance 
reports of June 2015) in submission of half yearly compliance reports. 
Further, it was observed in audit that most of the PPs did not submit 
half yearly compliance reports timely and regularly and there was delay 
ranging from one month to 48 months in submission of the compliance 
reports. We noticed that the ROs did not issue reminders regularly for 
submission of compliance report to PPs. Also, no action was taken by 
the MoEF&CC against the PPs under the provisions of the Environment 
Protection Act, 1986 for non-submission of compliance report by PPs. 
(CAG 2016, 84)
<<<PAGE=252>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
230
The CAG went on to observe that despite numerous violations, no 
action was taken by the regulating ministry. 
In reply to a Parliament question, the Ministry submitted (July 2016) that 
no penalty was imposed by the MoEF&CC for violating conditions of EC 
in the last two years. We observed that MoEF&CC did not have a com-
piled database of cases/projects received by it from the ROs where the 
violations were reported by ROs after their monitoring/inspection. Data 
register with year wise breakup of such cases was also not maintained. 
(CAG 2016, 88)
Ignoring the recommendations of the EACs . A popular strategy to under -
mine the environmental safeguards regime that evolved in the 1980s was for 
the environment ministry to overrule the recommendations of the EAC. The 
fact that the EAC was only an advisory body allowed the ministry to adopt 
this strategy. 
Ordinarily, given that the EAC is appointed by the environment ministry, 
the final decision should have been in conformity with the recommendations 
of the EAC. Where the ministry had additional technical inputs or findings 
that were contrary to those of the EAC, these should have been sent back 
to the EAC for consideration and comment. However, this was not done, and 
usually the ministry gave no reasons for rejecting or modifying the recom-
mendations of the EAC.
Perhaps the most well-known of such cases was that of the Tehri Dam 
in the Himalayas. At 260.5 meters, the Tehri Dam is the highest dam in India, 
and among the highest in the world. Located in the Himalayas in what is 
known to be one of the most seismically active zones in the world (Category 
V), the EAC had unanimously determined, in 1989, that the environmental 
impacts and the safety concerns related to the project were such that it was 
not ecologically viable. Despite this, the environment ministry proceeded to 
grant environmental clearance to the project and gave no reasons why it 
chose to overrule the EAC.
12
Another high-profile case was the first of the coal-based superther -
mal power stations in India, at Kayamkullam, Kerala. This power station was 
located adjacent to the ecologically fragile creeks of the coastal region of 
the state of Kerala. In 1991, the EAC rejected the location because of its eco-
logical fragility, and suggested alternate locations that were ecologically less 
sensitive, and economically and logistically preferable. However, allegedly 
because the initial site was within the political constituency of a powerful 
political leader, the environment ministry overruled the EAC and cleared the 
project, without giving any reasons.

In a similar case, a proposed coal-based thermal power station located 
adjacent to a crocodile sanctuary in Dholpur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan, 
was rejected by the EAC in 1992, but cleared by the ministry, again without 
giving any reasons. In this case also, the EAC recommended shifting the 
location to a less ecologically fragile area, but the suggestion was rejected, 
allegedly because the original location was within the political constituency 
of the then chief minister of the state.
13
Fortunately, in all these cases the triumvirate of people’s movements, 
a sympathetic media, and a supportive judiciary, helped. A case filed in the 
Supreme Court of India ensured that the environmental safeguards related 
to the Tehri project were strengthened.
14 Unfortunately, the Supreme Court 
declined to take a view on the safety concerns, indicating, perhaps correctly, 
that this was less a legal issue than a technical one, for which they did not 
have the requisite expertise.
In both Kayamkullam and Dholpur, public and media pressure, and the 
threat of legal action, resulted in the projects being converted from being 
coal-based to naphtha-based and gas-based respectively, thereby reducing 
the adverse environmental impact on their surroundings.
Undermining the independence of the EACs . The EACs are functionally 
dominated by the chairperson, who is responsible for making all final decisions 
after considering the views and advice of the members of the committee, 
and of invited experts. Decisions in the EAC are not taken in a democratic 
manner, in which each member has a vote. This is in keeping with how most 
official committees function, with decisions made mostly by the senior-most 
functionary, and with other members operating more as advisers than as co–
decision makers. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that the chairperson of an 
EAC is competent, independent, and of impeccable integrity.
The experience with EACs during the 1980s and early 1990s taught 
the environment ministry that overruling the EACs would attract much public 
and media criticism, and would give opponents a good legal basis to move 
the courts. Therefore, it quickly revised its strategy and started replacing the 
independent experts who had initially chaired the EACs, with retired civil ser-
vants, or others who were either sympathetic to the concerns of the project 
lobbies, or were pliable and could be pressured. 
Compromising the independence of environmental consultants . The 
EACs were primarily dependent on the environmental impact statements pro-
vided to them by the project proponents. As these statements were prepared 
13 The Kayamkulam and Dholpur projects were appraised in the early 1990s, 
before the web became functional in India. Therefore, documentation regarding these 
and other such projects is not available on the Internet. However, the author was the 
chairperson of the EAC that appraised both these projects and has a copy of all rel -
evant documentation. A relatively recent publication that describes many other such 
cases is Chainani (2007).
14 For details, see Narrain (2003).

Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
232
by consultants who were hired by the project proponents, there was always 
an inherent danger of conflicts of interest.
This situation was aggravated by the fact that the EAC had neither the 
resources nor the mandate to carry out fresh assessments, or even to empir-
ically test some of the claims made in the environmental impact statements. 
At best, it could visit the site of the proposed project, make observations, and 
require additional studies to be done, or studies to be done again. However, 
usually these studies would be carried out by the same consultants. Occa-
sionally there was a possibility of getting independent studies done, but only 
in high-profile projects.
The necessity of introducing a system in which the initial environment 
impact assessment could be carried out by a competent professional body 
that was independent of the project proponent, was stressed from time to 
time.
15 It was suggested that a panel of consultants and professional institu-
tions could be maintained by the environment ministry, or by the Planning 
Commission, which could commission them for the task and pay them from 
funds recovered from the project proponent. Unfortunately, these recom-
mendations have never been accepted, and no reasons have been given for 
the failure to accept them.
Compromising the functional efficacy of the regulatory agency  . Most 
projects and activities were granted conditional environmental clearance, in 
which the clearance was based on adherence to certain conditions, especially 
preventive or mitigative strategies. There were also various statutory stan-
dards that such activities and projects had to comply with. 
The responsibility of monitoring these projects to ensure that they were 
complying with the conditions of clearance was assigned to the 10 regional 
offices of the regulating ministry. Unfortunately, these offices were very 
inadequately staffed, and continue to be so. As a result, there is hardly any 
monitoring of compliance of the conditions of clearance. According to the 
CAG:
There were only 15 scientists available for monitoring of Environmen-
tal Clearance conditions against sanctioned strength of 41. Regional 
Offices have not been delegated the powers to take action against the 
defaulting PPs and they had to report the violations of the Environmen-
tal Clearance conditions to the Ministry. (CAG 2016, 85)
24 State Pollution Control Boards/Union Territory Pollution Control 
Committees did not have in place sufficient infrastructure and man-
power for monitoring despite having sufficient funds. (CAG 2016, 94)
As per the information provided by MoEF&CC and its ROs, a total 9,878 
Category A projects and 12,657 Category B projects were to be moni-
tored by the ROs which had been given ECs since the inception of the 
EIA process, following the notification of 1994. (CAG 2016, 85).
15 See, e.g., Singh and Banerji (2000) and Planning Commission (2007).
<<<PAGE=255>>>
Chapter 14. Environmental and Social Safeguards in India - A Critical Assessment  233
As per MoEF&CC norms (July 2015) each scientist was to monitor at 
least five projects per month. Therefore, minimum 60 projects were to be 
monitored every year by each scientist…it may be seen that MoEF&CC/
ROs would not be able to monitor all projects under their jurisdiction 
even in a period of five years. (CAG 2016, 86-87)
Diluting standards . As described earlier, the initial strategy seemed to be 
to bypass or ignore the regulatory regime. This was followed by an effort 
to make the regulatory mechanism and the safeguards subservient to the 
whims of the government, and without any functional and scientific inde-
pendence. The safeguards regime was also progressively made increasingly 
ineffective, so that it did not even have the ability to perform the required 
functions. 
Essentially the dilution of the safeguards regime is being achieved by 
lowering the standards required; shortening the time available for conducting 
impact studies and assessments; and redefining the parameters that deter -
mine which projects qualify for prior assessment, and to what level, thereby 
excluding an increasing number of projects.
Commenting on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) notification 
and the amendments issued by the environment ministry, a joint committee 
of experts from the various Indian Institutes of Technology observed:
In exercise of the powers conferred by the Environmental Protection 
Act, 1986 (GoI, 1986) Government of India (GoI) on 27th January 1994 
made it mandatory for expansion and modernization of existing proj-
ects to have prior environmental clearance (EC) (MoEF, 1994). Thirteen 
amendments were made to it during 1994 to 2005…and then, in 2006 
principle notification was replaced with a new one. The initial notification 
is no longer in effect, but it is our opinion that in comparison with the 
principle notification, the new one is weak in some of the areas, at least. 
(IIT 2011, 15)
With the installation of the new government in 2014, there now seems 
to be an added focus on the fourth strategy, that of dilution of the safe-
guards themselves, and of the processes involved in implementing them. 
Soon after taking charge, the new government set up at least two com-
mittees to examine the ways and means by which environmental regulations 
could be “rationalized.” The first of these was constituted in August 2014, 
and submitted its report in November 2014 (HLC 2014).
This committee recommended, among other things: 
…the identification of “no go” areas, which are in forest areas or invio-
late zones—primarily with the criteria of over 70% canopy cover and 
“Protected Areas” which should not be disturbed except in exceptional 
circumstances, and that too only with the prior approval of the Union 
Cabinet. (HLC 2014, 11)
The disastrous implications of this recommendation can be judged by 
the fact that only about 3 percent of India’s forests have canopy cover of over
<<<PAGE=256>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
234
70 percent (Forest Survey of India 2015). At present, all the legal forest area 
plus other areas that have tree cover (a total of nearly 30 percent) have legal 
restrictions on their diversion for nonforest uses. If the recommendations of 
the high-level committee are accepted, most of India’s forested area, which 
in any case is well below the required 33 percent, would be opened up to 
industrial and other nonforestry uses.
Under the current regulatory regime, where forestland is allowed to 
be diverted for nonforest use, an equivalent area of nonforest land has to 
be brought under forest cover. In exceptional cases, compensatory afforesta-
tion can be permitted on degraded forestland where appropriate nonforest 
land is not available, and the overall forest cover of that state is at least 
33 percent (the prescribed national minimum). This condition has ensured 
that the overall extent of forestland that either has tree cover, or has the 
legal protection that would allow regeneration of tree cover, does not 
decrease in the country.
Unfortunately, the high-level committee has recommended that this 
clause be dropped:
The Committee recommends that this condition that there must be at 
least 33% forest cover in a State before approval is given for CA on 
degraded forest land should be done away with. (HLC 2014, 36)
The high-level committee has also recommended that:
All the strategic border projects (border roads, fencing, Border Out 
Posts, floodlighting, surveillance infrastructure, power infrastructure) 
falling within 20 km. from the International Border, Line of Actual 
Control, Line of Control; and the projects in power sector and coal 
mining which are the growth engines for national economy may be 
given a fast-track treatment through special procedures. (HLC 2014, 
57)
SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS
Unlike with environmental safeguards, until recently there were no social 
safeguards that were statutorily required for development projects and activ-
ities. For most large projects where human populations were being physically 
displaced, there was invariably a scheme or policy to manage the displace-
ment and to minimize adverse consequences on the affected population. By 
and large, the focus of social safeguards was limited to the physical displace-
ment of families and individuals.
When, in the mid-1970s, environmental appraisal processes were set 
into motion at the national level, along with various environmental param-
eters, human displacement was also mentioned. Therefore, while seeking 
environment clearance, projects also had to describe any human displace-
ment that would take place, and lay out plans for rehabilitation. This became 
a precondition for getting environmental clearance, even though technically 
the regulation of human displacement did not come under the purview of the 
environment ministry.
<<<PAGE=257>>>
Chapter 14. Environmental and Social Safeguards in India - A Critical Assessment  235
It was only in 2007 that the government of India finally came out with 
the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy. 16 It took another six 
years for this policy to get a corresponding statute. In 2013 the Parliament 
finally enacted The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land 
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act (known as the R&R law). 17 
This law, though not very strong, does provide a statutory basis for regulating 
the adverse social impacts of the acquisition of land for development pur -
poses. The overall responsibility for enforcing this act lies with the national 
Ministry of Social Welfare.
Perhaps any R&R law can be assessed on the basis of at least four 
tests: 
 n Does it discourage forced displacement? 
 n Does it comprehensively define affected families/displaced 
persons? 
 n Does it provide for a just and humane compensation package and 
process? 
 n Does it provide for effective implementation?
Discouraging Forced Displacement
India’s R&R law stipulates that forced displacement can only be done when 
it is in the public interest. It defines the public interest as including secu-
rity concerns, infrastructure projects, the resettlement of project-affected 
persons, housing for specified disadvantaged groups, and the resettling of 
disaster-affected populations. It further stipulates that the social costs should 
be justified based on a prior social impact assessment (SIA). However, it does 
not establish any norms to guide or regulate the conduct of an SIA, and it 
exempts irrigation projects where an EIA is being conducted from also con-
ducting an SIA.
The law bans the acquisition of multicropped irrigated lands, except as 
a last resort, though it exempts linear projects from this prohibition. It also 
stipulates that acquisition must be for the least displacing alternative, and of 
the minimum required area. Private companies can acquire land only if at least 
80 percent of the affected families consent to it. The law does not make it 
mandatory to do either an accumulative impact assessment in an area, or on a 
community or an SIA of the overall development model and its components.

236
Defining Affected Families and Displaced Persons
The law defines an affected family as one whose land or other immovable 
property has been acquired. Members of scheduled tribes and other forest 
dwellers who are losing forest rights are also classified as affected families. It 
includes as displaced persons those residing in the area being acquired even 
though they might not own any land or property, and those whose primary 
source of livelihood will be affected. It includes the landless, tenants, share-
croppers, artisans, agricultural laborers, usufruct rights holders, gatherers of 
forest products, fishers, hunters, and boatmen and women–provided they have 
been involved in these activities for at least three years prior to the acquisition. 
Adult unmarried daughters and sons, widows, divorcees, and women 
deserted by their families who are residing in the affected area, are con-
sidered separate families. The law includes dependent minor sisters and 
brothers in its definition of family. 
Providing a Just and Humane Compensation Package
Though various types of compensation are provided under the law, the 
major problem is that the law does not mandate that land must be given in 
exchange for land. This means that when poor farmers are displaced, they are 
not provided with other land where they can again take up farming. Though 
they are financially compensated, the expectation, if indeed there is any, that 
they could then use this money to buy equivalent or an even greater amount 
of land of equal or better quality, is not well founded. 
Bitter and long experience has shown that land prices shoot up in areas 
where there is a sudden demand for land from displaced farmers, making it 
impossible for them to replace the land that they have lost, let alone improve 
on it. Also, most poor farmers have no experience of handling large sums of 
money, and are either cheated out of it, or spend it on immediate needs and 
wants rather than saving it to replace their productive assets. This leaves the 
farmers with no option but to go into some other profession, for which they 
are not trained, and are often not suited.
Effective Implementation
As with environmental safeguards, there are powerful interests opposed to 
the establishment and effective implementation of a progressive R&R regime. 
These include, in the main, the corporate lobby that sees its profits being eaten 
away when huge expenses have to be made to provide relief and rehabilita-
tion for displaced populations. It also includes ministries and departments of 
the government, especially those charged with infrastructure development, 
who find it difficult to justify the overall economic benefits of the project (the 
cost/benefit ratio), if the costs of relief and rehabilitation are high. 
There is also often unresolved tension within host communities, who 
are forced to share their resources with resettled populations. This is aggra-
vated when populations are relocated in distant, or culturally antagonistic, 
locations. All of these factors have combined to inhibit the proper design and 
implementation of an effective social safeguard regime in India.
<<<PAGE=259>>>
Chapter 14. Environmental and Social Safeguards in India - A Critical Assessment  237
The R&R law does not, unfortunately, envisage an independent and 
statutory appellate body and monitoring authority to ensure that the process 
of rehabilitation is fairly and properly executed. This responsibility lies with 
the government which in most cases is neither willing nor able to carry out 
this function. 
Though the law was enacted in 2013, the almost identical policy 
statement has been in force since 2007. Unfortunately, initial assessments 
reveal poor implementation. This can be seen from the observations of the 
CAG, which has surmised that “in over 80% of the projects sampled, the R&R 
conditions required to be followed were not specified in the environment 
clearance, despite there being a statutory requirement to do so” (CAG 2016, 
60).
Unfortunately, the R&R law does not make the provisions of the law 
binding, as a fundamental right under the Constitution, nor does it make 
individual entitlements of project-affected people legally binding through 
contracts. Nor are officials charged with the responsibility of implementing 
provisions of the law made personally liable for any violations. The R&R law 
is somewhat unique among laws Indian laws, in the sense that it mandates no 
punishment or penalty for any functionary involved in infractions of the law: 
in fact, the only penalties envisaged are for members of the public who might 
knowingly supply false information to the authorities,
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
One lesson that emerges from the experiences described in this chapter is 
that for environmental and social safeguards to be effectively implemented, 
there is a critical need for regulators who are functionally, administratively, 
and financially independent of the government. 
The experience of the past 40 years or so has also demonstrated that 
unless there is constant pressure from people’s groups and movements, 
supported by a sympathetic media and a sensitive judiciary, the executive 
on its own is unlikely to pay much attention to either of these two sets of 
safeguards.
18
It is also critical, in order for both the independent regulators and for 
people’s movements to have increased credibility and impact, that there be 
periodic independent assessments by constitutional and statutory authori-
ties in the assessment of the CAG. Assessments by independent scientific 
institutions, and by people’s organizations would also be invaluable, so that 
the findings of all of these can be linked back to the initial appraisals of both 
ongoing and completed programs and activities, and can also be used to 
ensure that future ones are better designed and implemented.
18 For a detailed set of recommendations relating to implementation of environ-
mental safeguards, for which there is now experience of over 40 years, see Planning 
Commission (2007), 7–12. Though somewhat dated, most of the recommendations 
therein are still relevant today.

The Imperfect Use of the Past in 
Resettlement
Inga-Lill Aronsson
Abstract . This chapter discusses the use of the past in the implementation, knowledge 
production, and evaluation of resettlement projects. It argues that heritage and mem-
ories are neglected resources, and necessary analytical elements of the sociocultural 
dimensions of resettled societies. Sociocultural dimensions are the tangible and intan-
gible resources that constitute everyday routine culture, supported and molded by the 
social relations, memories, heritage, and emotions that are attached to the landscape 
and environment. These dimensions are the least studied and the least understood in 
resettlement. It is further argued that the present resettlement models are insufficient 
to grasp the longitudinal consequences of resettlement. A consideration of heritage 
and memory would improve the model. The use of the past from a longitudinal per -
spective is explored through the ethnography of the Zimapán resettlement project.

T
he focus of the special session on resettlement at the International 
Development Evaluation Association (IDEAS) Bangkok conference in 
2015 was to “look back to shape the future.” This is both a theoreti-
cal and a practical challenge, as has been well documented, and has been 
expressed as “lessons learned” in resettlement literature and policy reports. 
Resettlement is not the only field that struggles with how best to accept 
the past. For peace work, it is of pivotal importance to recognize the past, 
as it is expressed in collective memories and traumas, in the process of 
reconciliation. Cultural heritage is another field whose theoretical focus and 
professional praxis is the past. The idea of a past to be used for present 
and future needs is also captured in the expression “learning from history.” 
Its lack of success is well known, and these endeavors have failed to 
implement the old advice of “do no harm” reintroduced in this context by 
Anderson (1999). In development forced displacement and resettlement 
(DFDR), the difficulties are visible in the implementation, where dissonance 
prevails between the stakeholders.
As demonstrated from the 1950s on, DFDR projects are difficult to 
design, implement, assess, monitor, and evaluate, as the literature convinc -
ingly shows. Most recently, Smyth et al. (2015) have once again brought 
this to our attention, in their article outlining five “´big´ issues” for livelihood 
restoration that echoes requests of an urgent need to mitigate the nega-
tive consequences of resettlement. At the IDEAS conference, this ongoing 
problem was channeled into the resettlement evaluation thematic group led 
by Susan Tamondong.
This chapter addresses the special challenges attributed to the socio-
cultural dimensions of resettlement, which are “soft,” “fuzzy,” and difficult to 
discern, identify, and handle during implementation, using the present project 
models. They are related to economic recovery, but how and why they are is 
less known. Foremost, they are interconnected with the past routine cultures 
of society that the project is attempting to rebuild as a joint enterprise. Inter-
national specialists have comparative and wider knowledge of DFDR, while 
local experts have in-depth knowledge about their life-world. These are the 
realms that knowledge production and the ensuing evaluation consist of.
Sociocultural dimensions are meant to include the tangible and intan-
gible resources that constitute people’s everyday, routine culture, which is 
supported and molded by the social relations, memories, heritage, and emo-
tions that are attached to the landscape and the built environment. These 
resources are the peoples´ livelihood and life-worlds, and they are governed 
by “heritage as life-values” (Josefsson and Aronsson 2016) and “heritage 
as ambivalent” (Aronsson 2013). They are conveyed and framed by both 
spatial and temporal orders. They are both material and immaterial—they 
are concrete, visible, and durable as well as fuzzy and subtle, but they can be 
observed, recognized, and studied. There is nothing mystical, metaphysical, 
or esoteric about them. When a society is displaced and resettled, it “falls 
apart from within” (Aronsson 2002), and these are the orders that have to 
be reconstructed and reconstituted. These sociocultural dimensions are not 
static and cannot be frozen in time to easily fit a compensation matrix or an 
evaluation scheme.

Chapter 15. The Imperfect Use of the Past in Resettlement  241
THE PAST IN RESETTLEMENT
To explore the use of the past in resettlement, I will share my deep eth-
nographic knowledge of the Zimapán resettlement project in Mexico, which 
was executed 20 years ago. I have lived through this resettlement together 
with the people in the valley, whose landscape and society was inundated by 
the Zimapán hydroelectric dam in 1994. I returned there in 2013, and have 
had regular contact with the people. I have never been part of any executive 
power structure that has shaped my data. My perspective is longitudinal, 
with an emphasis on the reconstruction of society, and I explore the topic 
from an interdisciplinary perspective. The ethnographic context is pivotal, and 
I have tried to understand how and why certain choices and decisions were 
made, using the lens of heritage, collective memories, and collective traumas. 
This has triggered questions about what kind of knowledge was produced 
during the negotiations between the main stakeholders, and what bearing 
this knowledge had on the longitudinal results of the resettlement project. 
Complex sociocultural data are the building blocks of society, and 
they frame knowledge production as well as the rebuilding of the resettled 
society. These building blocks are fluid, intangible, and embedded in a mate-
rial world. How can we ethnographically describe these sociocultural building 
blocks, which are embedded in the cultural heritage of a resettled society 
undergoing rapid, induced change? What are the challenges for evaluation? 
These are the questions that are discussed here. The combination of theoreti-
cal concepts I have drawn on emanates from my background in anthropology 
and resettlement, humanitarian action, and cultural heritage.

Hermosa, in the state of Querétaro in Mexico, were involuntarily resettled in 
the 1990s because of the building of the Zimapán hydroelectric dam. The 
reservoir is located on the border of Querétaro and Hidalgo: the dam wall 
is 203 meters high and 80 meters wide, and was built in a 400-meter deep 
canyon where the San Juan and Tula rivers join the Moctezuma. The reservoir 
covers 22 square kilometers and has two arms, each 12 kilometers long. One 
stretches up the Tula River and the other follows the San Juan River. The 
water level is calculated to be 180 meters at the highest point, and the dam 
was estimated to run at full capacity in 1998 in order to pay off the invest -
ments. However, this was not the case, according to local informants in July 
2013, because of a lack of rain. They reported that they could see rain on the 
other side of the mountain range as usual, but when the clouds approached 
the reservoir side, they dissolved. During my fieldwork, I noticed a gap of an 
estimated 20 meters between the water surface and the indicated full-water 
level of the reservoir.
Traditionally, the people in the valley lived between two spheres of cul-
tural heritage. Hidalgo is known for its Otomi heritage, but on the Querétaro 
side, the picture is less clear. The identity of the valley people is a mixture 
of Otomi, Spanish, and mestizo cultural heritage, but also with a claim to

242
Chichimecas heritage. The kinship ties to Hidalgo were extensive. Spanish 
was spoken, but with Otomi and Nahuatl words used for everyday, routine 
culture. The elderly generation spoke Otomi at home, but seldom in public. 
In 1994, I asked the villagers about their identity, and they said that they 
could not be Otomi because “we have forgotten how to speak this language” 
(Aronsson 2002). Instead, they identified themselves as “mountaineers” and 
“ejidatarios.”

Their livelihood was based on agriculture, combined with seasonal 
migration work in the United States. Religiously, they were divided: but 
Catholics and Seventh Day Adventists lived side by side, and were roughly 
distributed between Rancho Nuevo (Adventists), Vista Hermosa (mixed), and 
La Vega (Catholic). 
The number of resettled people varies from 2,152 (in 1991) to 2,452 
(in 1996).
2 Counting people in a resettlement project is difficult, because no 
community is spatially closed: family constitutions and homesteads are only 
stable at certain points in time. 
In Zimapán, the gates of the dam were closed on November 27, 1993, 
at five o’clock in the morning, without prior notice. This was an emergency 
measure no one had wanted. The people had refused to move, and after 
countless negotiations, there was no other recourse than to close the gates 
and let the water fill the valley. Some families still refused to go: the water 
rose, and there were no roads, no drinking water, and no electricity. The 
animals were dying or fleeing. The remaining families were forced to move 
when the water level rose. A lifestyle had come to an end, and something 
new had to begin. 
BELLA VISTA DEL RÍO
The valley people chose to move to the nearby semidesert plateau, Mesa 
de León, within the boundaries of the ejido, where they still had some rain-
fed land. The new village of Bella Vista del Río consists of the three former 
villages, with each village demarcated, and clearly divided by wide concrete 
avenues. When the new village was built, it became a hybrid urban enclave 
within a rural environment. There was a strong economic contrast between 
the receiving homesteads and the new village. 
Twenty years later, in 2013, the border between the new village and 
the plateau had become blurred. The resettlement had transformed the set-
tlements and the previously simple and nonpermanent homesteads on the 
plateau. The old houses had been enlarged, and new houses had been added 
along the main road, and new houses encroached on the plateau´s remain-
ing ejido land. The spatial order of the plateau had thus changed, and was 
consolidated by the material manifestation of permanent houses. In addition,

new enterprises had been established. There was a hotel, restaurants, car 
mechanics, hardware stores, information technology shops, butchers, mobile 
food trucks, and typical small tiendas, and the old church had been improved. 
All of this indicates an economic upswing.
In the new village, which is still encircled by a high fence, I was told 
by the resettled people that the people on the plateau had gained, at their 
expense. To understand this statement one must know the history of the 
place. Before the resettlement, the valley had functioned as a node in the 
region: and the people who lived on the plateau were landless squatters 
who had arrived, one family after another. The ejidatarios had allowed them 
to build nonpermanent houses, each one surrounded by a small garden, and 
as long as they themselves did not need the land, they allowed the landless 
occupants to have small herds of goats. There was no water on the plateau: 
therefore, the squatters were allowed to come down to the valley to fetch 
water once a week, to wash their cars and clothes, and swim in the river 
(which “belonged” to the valley people). They also received or exchanged 
products such as prickly pears, for the fruit and vegetables that grew in the 
valley, with its three to four harvests a year of corn, beans, tomatoes, and 
thousands of fruit trees. The valley people had a high socioeconomic status, 
which was directly linked to the richness of the valley. 
The resettlement changed all of this: the former valley people lost 
status and reputation, while the former squatters on the plateau gained 
status, and became more self-assured. Tough negotiations followed between 
the valley people and the former squatters, who did not want to leave their 
houses and lots. They came to an agreement, and the people stayed. By 
2013, some families from the new village had also moved to the plateau. 
The decision to place the new village on the semidesert plateau was a 
joint one, decided with a majority vote. The villagers had the option of moving 
down to the town of Ezequiel Montes, which was closer to the planned res-
titution of their inundated farmland, but that option was rejected for several 
reasons. The main argument was that they wanted to keep their villages, 
with its social matrix of landless people and landowners, intact: this is in line 
with anthropological theories on social coherence and solidarity. Later on, 
the landowners rejected the restitution farmland, and instead accepted large 
cash compensation (Aronsson 2002). The Comisión Federal de Electricidad 
resettlement team had argued against cash compensation, but in vain. A few 
years later, many of the families had lost their money due to unwise invest -
ment and consumption. 
The village soon became known as the “women’s village” because the 
men had left for the United States to find work. The migration cycle had 
thereby changed from that of the 1990s, when the men had migrated in 
harmony with the agricultural cycles. After the resettlement, they stayed in 
the United States much longer, and finally they did not return at all. By 2013, 
more than 1,000 people had left, including entire families and single women.
The name Bella Vista del Río means “beautiful view of the river,” 
but there are no signs of the former river. Names, places, and landscapes 
in Mexico (and elsewhere) are usually coherent: they support narratives 
and function as social memories. In this case, however, there is a cognitive
<<<PAGE=266>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
244
dissonance between the name and its environment. My interpretation of this 
is that the only thing left for the people now was a cognitive category of a 
beloved landscape, which was etched into their minds and bodies. They felt 
they needed to bring this with them, but if so, it was an unconscious process 
on the deepest level of collective memories. I have formulated this earlier as: 
Consequently, naming was a strategy aimed at reconstructing and 
upholding a socio-cultural continuity. People brought with them the 
mindscape of the valley, loaded with emotion, and transformed it into 
names. This may also have been the beginning of a process of encultura-
tion into the new life in the new village… (Aronsson 2002)
Further research is needed to see how this process of enculturation is 
formulated and expressed. In 2016, Bella Vista del Río can be followed on 
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media, and is well 
integrated into the global communication network. It is mainly the younger 
generation that is connected. The Google street-view camera car team has 
also visited the new village. As my task here is to analyze a cultural trans-
formation, this could be highlighted as something extraordinary, but I am 
hesitant to do so. It would be a form of “exoticizing” the village based on an 
outsider´s stereotypical view of rural peasant society. The Internet and social 
media would inevitably have found their way down to the valley with time. It 
is the speed and the profoundness of the changes that creates a dissonance 
between the generations and between families that stands out. Any resettled 
society will be exposed to this kind of dissonance, and there is less need to 
problematize modernity as such than to figure out how to get the pieces to 
fit together: because in 2013, there was a general feeling that the new village 
was in a state of disharmony. 
THE PLACE OF HERITAGE IN RESETTLEMENT
Heritage has never been applied to resettlement, except in its narrowest 
sense of archaeological sites. A working definition of heritage is that heri-
tage is about using the past as a resource for present needs. Consequently, 
a selection of the past is singled out, elevated, and labeled “heritage” in an 
institutionalized setting. This selection also includes “difficult” or “dark” her -
itage that has been translated into popular tourist sites.
3 Within this field 
of “difficult” heritage, there are various types, such as dissonant, unwanted, 
and “uninherited” heritage. The terms dissonant and unwanted heritage refer 
to contested heritage. Uninherited heritage is heritage that exists but that 
does not seem to have any value. A dissonant heritage carries the burden 
of history, the mistakes and atrocities that at any time can burst open again, 
and cause open conflict: it is always present beneath a calm surface. Both

the destroyed Buddha statues in Afghanistan.

low-intensive and long-lasting conflicts are examples of this. I have discussed 
the heritage concept elsewhere and have accepted its ambivalence, but also 
its omnipresence (Aronsson 2013; Josefsson and Aronsson 2016). Hence, 
heritage is grounded in both space and time: and this is fundamental to our 
understanding of the resettlement process. 
The power of heritage is that it connects us to the past and makes us 
believe that there are existential, “God-given” values that can help us return to 
and restore lost values and collective memories from the past. These urges 
to reconcile with the past and make it comprehensible are so strong that 
people who have been forced to migrate due to armed conflicts try to rec -
reate their past, sometimes in a way that denies reality. An example of this 
is Palestinian families living in refugee camps in Lebanon, who have kept the 
house keys to their long-gone homes in occupied Palestinian territory. The 
key is a materialized memory made sacred. The past has been frozen in time 
and made sacred, and is therefore beyond renegotiation and reconstruction. 
There are qualitative differences between a refugee setting and a DFDR dis-
placed community, but I assume, despite the lack of ethnographic evidence 
from longitudinal resettlement research, that making selected elements 
sacred also takes place in the latter.
The link between prevalent resettlement theories (Cernea 1997; 
Downing and Garcia-Downing 2009; Scudder and Colson 1982), and heritage 
would thus lie in a processual view of a past that would offer a framework for 
the understanding of social disarticulation; and a reconstruction of routine 
culture with reference to collective memory and collective trauma as signify-
ing practices. Evaluation practices would gain by learning to use these highly 
qualitative dimensions in resettlement projects.
The Intricate Use of the Past
As in the case of the Palestinian refugees who hold onto their house keys—
frozen in time, sacred, and beyond reconstruction—it can be assumed that 
people in DFDR projects suffer from similar dissonances that hamper them 
in the reinvention of new routine cultures, and thereby influence the process 
of transformation. In Zimapán, the different types of heritage (dissonant, 
unwanted, and uninherited) were all at play in the reconstruction and rein-
vention processes before, during, and after the physical displacement of the 
people. 
Different types of heritage always coexist in a society, but the differ -
ence lies in the intensity of the selection process evoked by the resettlement. 
Under normal circumstances the selection process is slow and well marked: 
this house, tree, site, bridge, temple, and ritual. In DFDR projects, the reset -
tled people have to make these decisions and selections, not only for singular 
objects, places, and traditions, but also for all their heritages and memories, 
in an all-embracing enterprise, during a very short time period (in Zimapán, 
four years). This is of course riddled with conflict, which adds an additional 
dimension to the displacement and resettlement process. 
A particular heritage always belongs to someone, which implies that 
someone else will be disinherited. The selection of the past always signifies a
<<<PAGE=268>>>

246
power dimension. The disinheritance of a particular group may be short-term, 
and a mistake in the process of selection, but it may also be long term, wide-
spread, intentional, important, and obvious (Ashword and Tunbridge 1996). 
Whoever has the power to legitimize the selection is crucial when a particular 
place, monument, tradition, and/or memory is elevated and made into her -
itage. The process usually goes hand in hand with the institutionalizing of a 
particular heritage. The status, legitimization, elevation, and use of the past 
as a resource may lead to dissonant heritage, which is a vital part of being 
assigned the status of heritage (Smith 2006). Who is doing the interpretation, 
and how it is received by the people, is also decisive (Ashword and Tunbridge 
1996).
There is a built-in tension associated with the creation and definition 
of the values, meanings, and symbols of a particular heritage. In Zimapán, the 
resettlement triggered several processes associated with this array of differ-
ent heritages: some of them were contested, others were accepted, but none 
were harmless. The resettlement also trigged a political turnover, with the 
political power being transferred from the smallest, oldest, Catholic village 
La Vega, to the biggest, newest, Adventist village Rancho Nuevo. This power 
struggle was deeply anchored in history. 
Politics and Legacy
La Vega claimed to be the oldest settlement in the valley and the bearer of a 
heritage going back centuries. The villagers tied this legacy to the Otomi iden-
tity, the Catholic religion, and their economy. The people insisted that they 
originated from the Otomi town Tecozautla in Hidalgo, the traditional mar -
ketplace of the valley. They had settled in the valley because of their kinship 
with the Otomi families across the river in Hidalgo. They had built a cable car 
that carried goods, people, and animals across the river, and had sustained a 
walking path to the market in Tecozautla, which was used by all. In the valley, 
they controlled the water through a small irrigation dam behind the village, 
which was occasionally used as a weapon in conflicts with the other villages. 
A spatial analysis reveals that in the past, La Vega was at the front of the 
valley; they were thus the gatekeepers and guardians of the valley. 
The political ejidal structure confirms this. La Vega had upheld the 
office as ejidal president in the majority of the mandate periods (9 out of 
12), since the official foundation of the ejido in 1937 (Aronsson 2002). This 
legacy was broken with the resettlement, when the ejidal president was shot 
and killed during project implementation. This human tragedy is forever doc-
umented in “The Ballad of Zimapán,” which was written and performed by 
the La Vega brothers (Aronsson 2002, 285). From here on, La Vega began to 
withdraw from the negotiations, and the power was transferred to Rancho 
Nuevo.
In the negotiations, La Vega was depicted as the most “traditional” 
of the three villages, while Rancho Nuevo became the “progressive” one. 
Somehow this generated the idea that Rancho Nuevo was better able to 
cope with the resettlement and future needs. This impression influenced the 
negotiations and informed the design and idea of the new village.
<<<PAGE=269>>>
Chapter 15. The Imperfect Use of the Past in Resettlement  247
From a heritage point of view, however, La Vega was the traditional 
village. For one thing, in contrast to the other two villages, it had never 
changed its name. Place names are not random, and they are ethnographic 
evidence of an unbroken continuity with the past. Furthermore, this sense 
of continuity was combined with a strong identification with the landscape, 
in accordance with Wolf´s “bundle of relationships” and Ingold´s “unfolding 
fields of relationship” (Ingold 2000; Wolf 1959, 106). Although all three vil -
lages paid deep attention to the landscape, there was something that made 
La Vega claim that their land was more productive than that of the others, 
and that therefore they were entitled to more compensation. This claim can 
be seen as an economic argument, but it might also be part of a feeling of 
alienation in the resettlement process that stressed “progress” without con-
sideration of a more comprehensive understanding of the past. 
In the new village, the La Vega sector seems to have reinvented (or 
never lost) the routine cultures of the valley to a greater extent than the 
other sectors. Only time will tell, but after 20 years there are signs that La 
Vega has found a way forward by balancing new and old structures, a way 
that promotes a reestablishment of routine culture that is “calmer” and more 
adapted to the past routine cultures that existed down in the valley. The 
spatial reinvention of the section confirms this—there are milpas with all kinds 
of vegetables, prickly pear, fruit trees, and animal corrals in conjunction with 
the houses. The spatial analysis also reveals an adaptation of scale: the school 
with a well-kept garden (La Vega had the first school in the valley), and a small 
church. The built environment is in harmony with the size of the village, and 
lacks the grandeur of the rest of the new village. Furthermore, there are no 
high walls surrounding the houses, and they are not as massive as in the other 
sections; the people can see and talk to their neighbors from their porches. 
This familiar ambiente has been consolidated by the fact that the new 
village extends beyond the La Vega sector, where the villagers build their 
own houses, streets, paths, and gardens. Everyday activities were familiar, 
and included such mundane tasks as the burning of garbage, the hanging 
of laundry, chatting with the neighbors over the fence, parking the car, and 
attending to the animals. These routine cultural activities have created a 
familiar sound and olfactory landscape. The silence and desertedness that 
dominated the other sections of the new village are absent. 
One tentative interpretation is that the other two villages, Rancho 
Nuevo and Vista Hermosa, have become too different from their past, and 
thereby have lost viable elements for repairing and consolidating themselves 
to the same extent that La Vega has done. 
The focus of the negotiations was, thus, not the past, but the future, 
which was accentuated by the fact that the power to legitimize the past was 
put in the hands of Rancho Nuevo, whose past had been driven by radical 
change, revolution, and the liberation from the hacienda in the valley, and the 
adoption of a new religion, Seventh Day Adventism. A low-intensive power 
struggle had always existed between La Vega and Rancho Nuevo, with Vista 
Hermosa functioning as the mediator. 
A resettlement triggers and reinforces the existing sociocultural ele-
ments that rest deeply in the spatial and temporal orders manifested in

248
heritage and memories. Along these lines, the political turnover reconnected 
to intricate past sociopolitical structures, and directed Rancho Nuevo into a 
position—and maybe a perceived right as well—to define and interpret the 
past for the present and future needs, which culminated in the strains of the 
resettlement. The struggle between La Vega and Rancho Nuevo was there-
fore more than a struggle over political and economic resources. It was a 
struggle about the right to define the future by the use of the past, which was 
articulated in the sociocultural dimensions of the society. The resettlement 
“unfolded” the past. To reduce it to a struggle over resources is to diminish 
its potential. This could have been used as a creative force in the rebuilding 
of the society: the ethnography was there, but it was neither seen nor used. 
An opportunity was lost. 
The Devil as Heritage
Heritage is always present, even if the society denies its past, because the 
process of remembering is also a process of forgetting. In other words, part 
of remembering the past is selecting which memories to forget. This creates 
not only a dissonant heritage, but also an unwanted heritage and an uninher-
ited heritage (Grydehøj 2010). In the valley, there were all kinds of heritages. 
Here I will briefly discuss “the heritage of the devil.” 
In Mexico, the devil is frequently mentioned in the ethnography of 
resettlement (Barabas and Bartolomé 1973). The devil is also a recurrent 
theme in South America: it is associated with the fetishization of evil, and is 
seen as a mediator in conflicting views on the objectification of the human 
condition (Taussig 1980).
According to local tradition, the Devil lived in the canyon that bears 
his name, and his body constituted the symbolic landscape of the valley. 
The dam wall was built in his canyon, and that disturbed him deeply. When 
the construction of the tunnels in the mountain began—the “opening up” of 
the mountain—he appeared before the dam workers in the shape of a huge 
woman dressed in black in 1989 and said that the mountains were his chil -
dren (Aronsson 2002, 158). 
The Devil’s body symbolically constituted the natural and cultural 
landscape in the valley by lying down outstretched in the valley in a northeast 
to southwest direction, with his head as the village La Vega to the southwest, 
his stomach as the village Vista Hermosa (in the middle), and his legs as the 
village Rancho Nuevo to the northeast. His feet faced his canyon. 
In the new village, the Devil reappeared in the village´s symbolic spatial 
outline, but with one crucial difference. Instead of lying outstretched, he is 
now in a fetal position. The spatial order corresponds to the positions in 
the valley: the head is the La Vega sector, the stomach is the Vista Hermosa 
sector, and the legs are the Rancho Nuevo sector, but now the Devil is cring-
ing. This was brought to my attention in a spontaneous discussion that took 
place in the new village. The story was told accompanied by big smiles, as 
if the people were distancing themselves from this information. Surprised, I 
asked what they meant by this, and I was told that even the Devil had to give 
in to the World Bank. The symbolic representation was hence not questioned
<<<PAGE=271>>>
Chapter 15. The Imperfect Use of the Past in Resettlement  249
per se: the important thing was seen as, rather, the change in the Devil´s 
body posture. Is this ethnographic evidence of a transformed and reinvented 
expression of a diminished routine culture? Or is it just another esoteric eth-
nographic anecdote? In any case, what makes it conspicuous is that it is a 
dissonant and unwanted heritage made visible, and maybe in the future it 
will be an uninherited heritage as well, present in the collective memory of 
the resettled society. 
The Villages’ Spatial Orders as Heritage
In this project, the World Bank recommended that the resettled villages 
should be lifted up and placed in the same spatial order as they were in the 
original village outline. For Bella Vista del Río, the placing of the three vil -
lages was preceded by tough negotiations between the villagers without the 
involvement of other actors. The negotiations resulted in a spatial order that 
placed Rancho Nuevo and Vista Hermosa closest to the main road and the 
main entrance. La Vega was placed at the back of the village, farthest away 
from the main road. The village sections were thus placed in accordance with 
the valley´s spatial outline as it appeared at project start. 
The past tells us, however, that La Vega had once been the gatekeeper 
of the valley, located at the front, facing Hidalgo, before it was spatially turned 
around in favor of Rancho Nuevo in the 1960s. This happened when the new 
road was built to Cadereyta in Querétaro. Rancho Nuevo had promoted the 
road, and La Vega had argued against it, and refused to collaborate. The 
road was built with state money and labor from the valley, and it entered 
the valley in Rancho Nuevo, which therefore moved into the front position, 
while La Vega was demoted to the back. This was the spatial order that was 
recreated in the new village. 
Twenty years after the resettlement, the pieces of the new village do 
not seem to fit together harmoniously, echoing an early ethnographic obser-
vation I had made. In 1994 I saw a truck parked in the new village in the La 
Vega sector. A motto painted on the truck stated, “My village is in agony” 
(Aronsson 2002, 195). A message like this makes it clear that any “lesson 
learned” policy has failed utterly in this situation.
The Ballad of Zimapán as Intangible Heritage
Another example of heritage that appeared during the resettlement was “The 
Ballad of Zimapán.” The heritage of a place is maintained and reproduced 
across the generations through stories, songs, and poetry. In “The Ballad of 
Zimapán,” which was composed and performed by the La Vega brothers in 
1994, the collective trauma of the society has been documented forever. The 
ballad consists of nine verses that describe the agony of having to leave the 
valley of Ejido Vista Hermosa, the feeling of being betrayed, and the anger of 
being targeted by the state, forced to move, and be “developed” in Ezequiel 
Montes, a town located closer to the main national culture and the majority 
society. The ballad was attainable for analysis during the implementation, 
but it was not used. It was not even considered to be of importance for the
<<<PAGE=272>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
250
understanding of the cultural response to the displacement. In 2013, a fol -
low-up video, Dueto C.V. Bella Vista del Río, was available on YouTube.4 
Both the ballad and the statement painted on the truck are cultural 
expressions of a collective trauma that these villages experienced and lived 
through. This goes beyond individual pain, depression, and memory, and has 
made its way to a higher level of abstraction. This pain belongs to the collec-
tive memories of the community, and its heritage. The collective trauma and 
the feeling of victimization go hand in hand. 
LOST AGRICULTURAL LAND AND NOTIONS OF FREEDOM
As mentioned earlier, the new village was built on the plateau with the 
argument that the villages wanted to preserve their social cohesion, and 
not separate the landowners and the landless. The ejidatarios rejected the 
replacement land located closest to the town Ezequiel Montes. This was a 
majority decision taken at a general assembly. In 2013 the reasons for the 
rejection had been reformulated, and the matter of social cohesion was no 
longer mentioned. The new statements were: “they wanted their freedom,” 
“their independence,” “they were used to dealing with their own stuff,” “it 
is too crowded,” and “it is too close to the municipal authorities.” But these 
arguments mirror the arguments of the conflict about the road in the 1960s. 
The citizens of La Vega insisted then that “they did not want the law of the 
municipality to enter the valley” (Aronsson 2002, 77). 
These arguments could be attributed to the place-attachment model, 
but I find that they rather express underlying existential themes, such as a 
hesitation to come too close to the national society with its values, lifestyle, 
and demands from authorities. There is a perceived ontological distance 
between the valley and the national culture that is connected to a long-term 
strategy of retaining a heritage, collective memories, experiences, and notions 
of freedom that go far back in history. In 2013, other voices were heard, 
claiming that it might have been a mistake not to accept the replacement 
land. 
CONCERNS ABOUT MEMORY AND SACRALIZATION
In DFDR projects different types of heritages and memories are at play 
in the reconstruction and reinvention processes. An understanding of the 
past is needed for a reinvention of routine culture, but at the same time a 
sacralization of the past could block its transformation through generations. 
The structures at play, heritages and memories, are not passive, but active, 
agents that either impede or speed up the reinvention and reconstruction 
processes. I suspect that people in DFDR projects live for years with a disso-
nant, unwanted, and uninherited heritage that they are forced to make livable 
and adapt to a new life-world. They have to learn to forget to remember, and 
4 https:/ /www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIOA-9uwsC0.
<<<PAGE=273>>>
Chapter 15. The Imperfect Use of the Past in Resettlement  251
remember to forget, while they fight for their livelihood. They have to learn 
how to practice selective forgetfulness for the benefit of their community. 
The Zimapán resettlement shows that the creative forces of society 
and the components of reinvention are connected to these intersubjective 
memories, but more research is needed to exploit its full potential for policy 
and evaluation. For example, Misztal, with reference to Halbwachs, points 
out that memory is a community issue that is embedded in societal values 
rather than merely a psychological function of cognitive capacities (Halb-
wachs 1941/1992; Misztal 2005). This line of thought entails that memories 
have a stabilizing effect on societies because of their normative and calming 
functions; memories give people a sense of meaning and place in the world 
(Schwartz 2000).
In DFDR projects, a focus on memories could, however, be both 
sensitive and dangerous. I am concerned that if the “wrong” memories are 
triggered, we might end up with a very complicated resettlement, with a 
sacralization and freezing of the past, similar to what displaced people in con-
flict zones experience. Furthermore, efforts to mitigate this might even create 
a state of mind that would be part of this “freezing” and dwelling in the past 
and a sense of victimization. The victimization syndrome has been a problem 
for a long time in resettlement.
Finally, I encountered methodological problems in the field when I 
tried to ethnographically document memories in Bella Vista del Rio in 2013. 
I did not seem to be able to formulate the right questions: and people did 
not relate to my question, “What do you remember from the past in the 
valley?” However, a breakthrough moment came early one morning in a vil -
lager’s kitchen, when I was told that when they talked about the valley and 
their past life, they “cried and remembered the food, fruit, vegetables, smells 
and sound, all down there.”
5 These are sensory memories, bodily experiences, 
and emotions felt and explained in a holistic view of the past. I realized that 
the cognitive approach I had been using was insufficient. I concluded that 
the use of a phenomenological methodology is more suitable in approach-
ing the memory complex. This would challenge any evaluation scheme for 
resettlement, because the data that is produced with such a methodology 
is qualitative. 
KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION AND EVALUATION
During implementation, a complicated kind of knowledge production is gener-
ated between the local people and the implementing company. The quality of 
this knowledge governs the outcome, and badly implemented projects have 
severe consequences, as can be seen by studying the World Bank Inspection 
Panel (which had 106 cases in 2016).

projects are so complex that they have similarities to art installations, and

performances that result in ad hoc solutions (Aronsson 1992). de Wet has 
also observed this complexity, but relates it to the capacity of the stakehold-
ers to create a “moral space” for meaningful communication (de Wet 2009, 
86). In a similar vein, Hermans, El-Masry, and Sadek (2002) discuss participa-
tion by stressing the pedagogical aspects of communication. My objection to 
these approaches is that knowledge production in resettlement must never 
be reduced to a pedagogical training exercise between more or less rational 
agents. There are aspects of the pedagogical methods that need improve-
ment, but that is not all that is needed. We need to recognize how the past is 
embodied in material objects and expressed in the intangible narratives that 
determine the knowledge product that is to be executed and evaluated. The 
past has to be critically evaluated and reflected upon during implementation, 
as well as in its evaluation. 
In Zimapán, during the implementation the main stakeholders became 
engaged in a ritual dance that had less to do with solving the project´s 
everyday problems than with the upholding of self-defined positions. The 
stakeholders were locked into past structures and positions that regulated 
their behavior and attitudes. The behavior became routine, and the under -
standing and competencies became self-generating categories, similar to 
performative rituals that influence praxis, resulting in the standards (policy) 
not informing and shaping praxis. Standard policy guidelines and praxis had 
failed to build a problem-solving platform for the purpose of generating oper-
ationally useful knowledge for all stakeholders. The knowledge was there, 
but policy and praxis did not interlock. 
Knowledge is not only linked to power: first and foremost it has an 
ability to make itself “true” (Foucault 1977, 27). For resettlement imple-
mentation and evaluation, this is relevant, because all classification schemes 
(understood as spatial-temporal segmentations of the world) have a tendency 
to become “true” and taken for granted with time. They become standards. 
The knowledge produced during resettlement is always categorized 
and put into boxes to become operational entities. The problem arises when 
a knowledge category becomes “true” without any consideration of its 
potential value for the project. The principle must be that in a participatory-in-
formed project all knowledge (both local and expert) must be scrutinized 
and assessed from a systematic perspective. The romanticizing of local 
knowledge, based on a relativistic view of culture, can be devastating. Equally 
devastating is blind faith in blueprint knowledge, based on a classification 
scheme that has become “true in itself.” Instead of either of these, all knowl-
edge produced must prove its solution value regardless of whose knowledge 
it might be. The challenge is in dealing with contradictory knowledge, and 
finding ways to identify, analyze, and address it. 
In the goal-free evaluation method, power and self-generating cat -
egories are in focus, because it is assumed that if an external evaluator 
“intentionally avoids knowledge of and reference to the program´s stated or 
official goals and objectives” neutrality could be upheld (Youker, Ingraham, 
and Bayer 2014). The evaluator moves backward in the project to discern 
the effects of the implementation without any informed knowledge about 
the project goals. Goal-free evaluation is mainly associated with qualitative

data collection methods, a multilayered approach, and evaluation indicators. 
However, in DFDR projects the stakes are high, and when the project moves 
forward, everything is intensified: there is therefore a risk that these soft life-
skills indicators may be set aside in favor of the material and compensatory 
aspects crucial for livelihood. 
Participatory methodologies aim to incorporate local knowledge and 
empower local people. This requires that the locals be trained in participatory 
methods, and that they build their capacity. Participatory evaluations have 
shown, however, that there is a clear division in the tasks and responsibilities: 
program staff design evaluation and data analysis, while local participants 
collect the ethnographic data. 
The intricacy of DFDR projects inevitably leads to complexity theory 
and its application for evaluation. Briefly, complexity theory is not one single, 
coherent body of thought, but rather consists of bundles of interacting 
stakeholders, objects, and processes bound together by interest or functions. 
These interactions are nonlinear, open to feedback, and difficult to predict. 
Because of their uncertainty and nonlinearity, complex social systems are dif-
ficult to evaluate, and there is no consensus in the research literature about 
what can be useful for their evaluation (Walton 2014). 
A final observation from the praxis in Zimapán involves the monitor -
ing team. With time, their reports came to evince strong similarities with the 
implementer’s reports. In fact, it became almost impossible to see the dif -
ference between a monitoring report and a management one. The World 
Bank conclusion was that the team was young and inexperienced, and there-
fore could not uphold their position in the face of the management of the 
Comisión Federal de Electricidad (World Bank 1997). From my everyday 
experiences with the team, I think this had to do with their lack of trust in 
their own knowledge. Much of this knowledge belongs to the “soft” socio-
cultural dimensions, and thus did not fit the matrix—the expected (or “true”) 
knowledge categories. Most of this tacit knowledge was related to the past 
and how to live a good life, but it did not find its way into any of the reports, 
whether they were management, monitoring, or evaluation reports. There was 
no appropriate language, no classification schemes that could be used, and 
these observations were therefore left aside. If we add to this complexity the 
knowledge that “open-ended, non-fixed, non-politicized collective memory is 
good for cooperative relationship” (Misztal 2005), we are faced with an even 
more complex system, which nevertheless might be a step closer to introduc-
ing the use of the past in resettlement—although it will undoubtedly still be 
an imperfect use of the past.

Evaluating the Benefits and Costs 
of Resettlement Projects - A Case 
Study in the Philippines
Marife M. Ballesteros
Abstract . The efficiency and impact of two types of resettlement modes undertaken 
by the Philippine National Housing Authority are compared. Production efficiency was 
measured from the cost/benefit ratio (CBR) of the present value of the total project 
cost and estimated housing rental values of specific resettlement projects developed 
from 2004 to 2011. The socioeconomic impact analysis involved a small sample of 
households, matched based on household characteristics using propensity matching. 
Results show that the use of government resources in in-city developments is more 
efficient: for in-city projects the government spends from P
=0.62– P=0.76 for every peso 
of housing benefit; for off-city projects, the benefit is an estimated CBR of P=1.72. The 
study noted that the initial gains of off-city resettlements—lower investment and 
administrative costs, and the provision of a house-and-lot package to affected fami-
lies—are erased by compromises on the quality and sustainability of resettlement sites. 
The household income of resettled families is lower, and participation in the schooling 
of children is also lower in off-city sites. The government must prioritize in-city reset -
tlement through longer-term planning, and consider alternative in-city housing options

for affected families. It should also review policies on off-city resettlements, specifically 
the selection of sites and the extent of involvement of the community in resettlement 
planning. 
T
he rapid pace of urbanization in the Philippines has led to housing chal -
lenges that are visibly manifested in poor housing conditions. In 2015, it 
was estimated that about 18 percent of the total population was living 
in blighted conditions. Poor housing is most evident in cities, specifically the 
capital city of metropolitan Manila, which is home to about 2 million slum 
dwellers. This condition is as much the result of unplanned urban growth 
as it is of low income levels. In general, the country lacks integrated urban 
planning, and there is poor coordination between spatial and structural trans-
formation in cities (World Bank 2016). A result of this unplanned growth is 
haphazard land development, during which the illegal occupation and conver-
sion into residential settlements of land for public use is commonly observed. 
Over time, there has been a proliferation of these illegal residential settle-
ments (also known as “informal settlements”), and an increase in the number 
of families occupying them. 
This condition has constrained the government to build the critical 
infrastructure needed for effective and efficient urban services. Metro Manila 
was among the world’s top 20 most populous megacities in 2015, but despite 
rapid urbanization, the city has not benefited much in terms of economic 
growth and poverty reduction, compared to other Asian countries (World 
Bank 2016). The city has poor connectivity with peripheral towns and cities, 
and even within Metro Manila there are areas outside of the main transit 
routes, or areas not linked to citywide social services and infrastructure. 
In the last two decades, the Philippine government has put into action 
an infrastructure plan to address these inefficiencies. In particular, the plan 
identified expressways, railroads, and a flood control system as the major 
infrastructure projects for the expanding Metro Manila region. These projects 
are expected to involve massive relocation and urban renewal in some parts 
of the city: involuntary resettlements thus are unavoidable.
The Philippine policy and institutional framework for dealing with 
involuntary resettlement provides for humane procedures for relocation and 
resettlement. Affected communities are engaged in a consultative process 
that covers housing options, government resources, livelihood support, and 
the protection of vulnerable persons. However, resettlement action plans 
have been primarily focused on providing housing, and often have failed to 
account for the loss of incomes and the social networks of households. Often-
times, the government tends to look at resettlement in terms of short-term 
results: that is, how to move out affected families and provide them with 
permanent homes in the shortest time and at the least expense. This action 
tends to favor off-city resettlement, given the tedious process of searching 
for adequate land to fit the large number of affected families, and the limited 
availability of low-priced land in the city. Moreover, providing affected fam-
ilies with their own houses and lots seems to present a better picture than 
housing them in urban, multistory buildings.
<<<PAGE=281>>>
Chapter 16. Evaluating the Benefits and Costs of Resettlement Projects - A Case Study in the Philippines  259
However, the lower initial cost and house-and-lot package in off-
city resettlements do not necessarily result in a cost-effective government 
investment compared to the cost of in-city projects. Off-city projects can be 
counterproductive, since the displacement of families has an impact on their 
livelihoods and other economic opportunities, as well as on their social net -
works and psychological well-being, their access to basic services, and their 
opportunities for skills development. In other words, the initial gains from off-
city resettlement projects can have adverse effects on families’ overall welfare. 
In cases where off-city resettlement cannot be avoided, the provision 
of adequate basic infrastructure in the resettlement area must be ensured 
prior to relocation. Resettlement sites should also at least be in municipal -
ities identified as subregional or provincial urban centers, and not in rural 
municipalities where economic opportunities are scarce. The inadequate basic 
infrastructure and lack of opportunities for jobs and livelihood is the main 
problem for off-city resettlements in the country: many of the involuntarily 
displaced people end up returning to the city after their resettlement. 
This study provides a quantitative methodology for assessing the ben-
efits and costs of resettlement projects that are implemented by the national 
government. Specifically, it compares two resettlement modes—in-city and 
off-city—and determines which mode provides the greater efficiency and the 
best social and economic outcomes. 
The analysis considers resettlement projects of the National Housing 
Authority (NHA), the central government agency in the Philippines mandated 
to undertake housing production for families in the lowest 30 percent of 
income. The NHA is the lead agency in the resettlement of families affected 
by infrastructure projects of the national government: between 2003 and 
2012, it has carried out massive resettlement of families for the proposed 
construction of the North and South Rail infrastructure project, which will 
link Metro Manila to peripheral towns and cities. This period has also coin-
cided with the resettlement of families living along riverbanks, to address the 
flooding problem in Metro Manila.
The first section of this chapter provides an overview of NHA reset -
tlement modalities and processes during this period. The second section 
presents the methodology used to evaluate the efficiency and impact of 
NHA off-city and in-city resettlement projects. The following section dis-
cusses the results of the efficiency and welfare analysis, comparing in-city 
and off-city projects. The final section presents conclusions and provides 
recommendations. 
RESETTLEMENT MODALITY: PROCESS AND PROCEDURES 1
The NHA classifies resettlement projects into either in-city or off-city projects. 
In-city projects refer resettlement sites that are developed in the same city 
or municipality where the affected families reside. Off-city projects refer to 
resettlement sites outside of the original settlement. Off-city resettlement

areas are usually in distant locations, about 40–50 kilometers from the orig-
inal settlement.
In off-site settlements, individual houses and lots can be provided, due 
to the availability of large areas of contiguous low-priced land. Resettlement 
sites within Metro Manila are smaller plots that entail the construction of 
multistory housing, with a higher density population. Multistory development 
also requires higher investment and maintenance costs, which means a higher 
per-unit cost of housing, and is usually unaffordable for most families residing 
in informal settlements. Under the North and South Rail Project, affected 
families in Metro Manila were mostly resettled outside of the city. 
The success of a resettlement project is to a large extent dependent 
on how well it is implemented. The NHA adheres to a humane approach 
to resettlement. It carries out the resettlement process in several phases, 
during which social preparation is the central activity. Social preparation 
involves identifying beneficiaries and resettlement sites, and mobilizing 
resources. Affected families are organized, and the community goes through 
a capacity-building process in order to establish the social, organizational, 
and institutional norms and mechanisms that will enable resettled families 
to cope with their relocation, and encourage them to work together in part -
nership with concerned institutions and stakeholders. This activity covers 
two phases of the NHA’s resettlement work program. It is the most critical 
stage in the resettlement process, since it involves the buy-in of both the 
community and the proposed resettlement sites, the involvement of several 
stakeholders, and the creation of committees and subcommittees at the level 
of the local government and the community. It also requires the longest time, 
because the NHA has to formalize agreements with both the sending and 
receiving local government units (LGUs), the community, and the developer. 
While this entire phase is programmed to be accomplished within three to six 
months for 1,000 affected families, delays often occur, due to the number of 
stakeholders involved in the preparatory work. There can also be prolonged 
resistance, or disagreements among the affected families. Often a longer 
consultation period is needed in order to resolve collective action and/or 
coordination problems with the government and other entities. 
The NHA primarily applies the developer-constructed approach to 
resettlement projects.
2 Under this approach, the NHA partners with private 
developers to undertake the development of resettlement sites and the con-
struction of housing, based on standards of socialized housing.
3 The NHA 
2 An alternative approach is the housing material loan, which is an incremental 
housing approach whereby NHA provides the developed site with core housing (i.e., 
a box house), and beneficiaries take charge of housing improvements based on their 
affordability level. Although this approach has been observed to have better outcomes, 
it is not popular with the NHA: the agency finds it tedious both administratively and 
physically, since it has to be concerned with the process of material acquisition and 
housing construction as well (Ballesteros and Egana 2013). 
3 Socialized housing refers to housing projects for the underprivileged and 
homeless, following the national law Batas Pambansa 220 on subdivision development
<<<PAGE=283>>>
Chapter 16. Evaluating the Benefits and Costs of Resettlement Projects - A Case Study in the Philippines  261
accredits the developer, who then provides a list of proposed resettlement 
sites, with approved development permits and locational clearance, and the 
pricing of the housing units.
4 This approach is administratively less costly to 
the NHA, since the agency does not have to engage in land banking, and 
simply contracts the private developer to supply the developed site and 
housing units. On the other hand, there is incentive for the private developer 
to engage in the project because of the captive market. The developer does 
not have to look for buyers for each unit, since the entire development is 
being purchased by the NHA for the beneficiaries of its resettlement program. 
The private developer can also use the resettlement project for compliance 
with the Balanced Housing Development Act, which requires developers of 
proposed subdivision projects to develop an area of socialized housing equiv-
alent to 20 percent of the total area, or the total cost, of proposed projects.
5 
Upon accreditation by the NHA, the developer offers the community 
the site, and schedules site visits for community officers. The community offi-
cers have to formally endorse the project to the Local Inter Agency Committee 
(LIAC), which in turn endorses the project to the NHA. 6 The endorsement 
from the community, and the recommendation of the LIAC, enables the NHA 
to finance and purchase the housing units for each community member from 
the selected developer. 
It is important to note that the community can select only projects 
offered by NHA-accredited developers, which in most cases might just be a 
choice of two sites from one developer, or two sites from two different devel-
opers. Moreover, although the NHA provides the criteria on site suitability for 
resettlement projects, the endorsement of the LGU, based on the approved 
subdivision plan and locational clearance, is sufficient for the NHA. However, 
the approved subdivision plan considers only the land use and environmental 
standards and price ceilings, as determined by the Housing and Urban Development 
Coordinating Council and the National Economic Development Authority. During 
the period in review, the price ceiling for socialized housing was set at P =400,000 per 
housing unit, which is usually applied in highly urbanized areas. In towns and municipal-
ities, the NHA sets a lower price as determined by its board.
4 The development permit and locational clearance are certifications issued by 
the LGU that certify a specific site for residential use and suitable for residential sub-
division development.
5 Urban Development and Housing Act (RA 279 of 1990). The developer may 
partner with other developers to invest in these projects.
6 The LIAC is formed at the start of the resettlement process. The members 
consist of representatives from the sending LGUs, local nongovernmental organiza-
tions, and representatives of national government offices (e.g., the Department of 
Interior and Local Government, the Housing and Urban Development and Coordinat -
ing Council, the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources, the Department of Public Works and Highways, 
the NHA, the National Poverty Commission, the Metro Manila Commission, and the 
Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor). The LIAC is chaired by the local housing 
board representative and cochaired by the NHA.

suitability of the site: it does not include the socioeconomic feasibility of 
the area, such as conditions of employment (e.g., distance to employment 
centers); access to schools, markets, and tertiary hospitals; or distance of the 
site to energized sources of water and power. The NHA argues that social 
services (e.g., schools, health centers, etc.) can be provided over time, and that 
the concerned national agencies should include the construction of social 
facilities for resettlement sites in their respective budgets. As to basic utilities 
such as water and power, the NHA simply requires the selected developer 
to provide shallow wells and power generators in areas that are far from 
energized sources. 
After social preparation is completed and the approval of the site has 
been obtained from community officers and LIAC, the relocation of affected 
families follows. The relocation phase starts when the NHA, the community 
officers, and the developer have signed contract agreements. This phase 
involves preparatory work such as a period of dismantling structures at the 
evacuated sights, and preparation for staging areas if needed. In most cases, 
the site has been prepared prior to relocation, except for the individual power 
and water connections, which are usually provided at a later period. Upon 
completion of the preparatory activities, the actual relocation usually takes 
about a month for 1,000 beneficiaries (an average relocation rate of 50 fam-
ilies per day). Weather conditions can slow down the process. There are 
relocation guidelines that must be followed. The NHA and representatives 
from the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, and the Presidential Com-
mission for the Urban Poor ensure that relocations are undertaken within the 
legal guidelines. The NHA takes the lead in relocation activities, with support 
from the sending LGU. The sending LGU also provides financial assistance 
of not less than P
=1,000 per family. Some sending LGUs, especially in more 
prosperous cities, provide additional compensation, such as a week’s supply 
of groceries and/or the extension of health privileges to their former con-
stituents for a period of one year. At the resettlement site, the relocated 
families are received by the NHA local office, and the assigned community 
representatives.
The post-relocation phase starts with the termination of the relocation 
operation, and turnover of the evacuated sites to the concerned government 
agency—usually the Department of Public Works and Highways, or the Phil-
ippine National Construction Corporation, or the Philippine National railways. 
The developer has to also turn the resettlement project over to the NHA and 
the community. The resettlement process is deemed completed at this stage. 
Once a site has been approved for resettlement, the developer is 
only responsible for the site development, and for the construction of core 
housing. The developer is not responsible for the construction of community 
facilities, or for the installation of water and power services to individual 
households.
7 In off-site areas that are far from energized sources of water 
and power, developers are only required to provide bulk water facilities 
7 Utility companies usually require 90 percent occupancy of subdivisions prior 
to connections.

sourced from shallow wells, and from generators for power supply. These 
facilities have to be maintained by the community and the NHA upon turn-
over of the resettlement project. While shallow wells and generators are 
considered stopgap or temporary measures, the community may have to wait 
several months or even more than a year before they can be connected to the 
local water or power systems. Meanwhile, these resettlement areas have to 
bear the higher cost, and less effective water and power systems, compared 
to households that have access to the local water districts and power lines. 
Table 16.1 shows the status of in-city and off-city resettlement sites 
for the affected families of the North and South Rail Project. Upon reloca-
tion, in-city resettlement sites are provided with basic infrastructure facilities 
and improved houses made of strong materials. In off-city resettlement sites, 
although all affected families are provided with a house and a lot, and with 
better subdivision roads and houses made of stronger materials, basic ser -
vices—that is, water and power—are not fully available upon relocation. In 
some completed sites, access to water and power are rationed, and are only 
available at specific times. There are also cases when some of the shallow 
wells are not operational, due to water potability. The NHA has not been able 
to readily address this situation, due to the high cost of energizing the sites, 
the limited budget of the agency, and the low income levels of families in the 
resettlement site. The installation of additional generators and water pumps 
would require a higher subsidy per family. On top of this subsidy, the NHA 
has to subsidize the maintenance of these machines. The sites may eventually 
be further improved, but these improvements depend on the availability of 
funds from the NHA, or grants from local politicians or external funders.
The NHA has established an estate management office in each of the 
resettlement areas, but their duties are mainly focused on loan collection and 
monitoring.
8 The NHA considers the resettlement program as a cost-recover-
able program in which beneficiaries share in the cost of the development by 
paying for the cost of housing unit and lot over time. The site development 
cost is part of the government subsidy, while the cost of housing, including 
the lot, is a loan to each family that is paid for on a monthly basis over a 
period of 30 years. NHA collection performance, however, has historically 
been low, with an average collection rate of only 30 percent. This is one 
reason why the NHA has not been able to disengage from resettlement sites, 
as these sites remain assets of the agency unless they are fully paid for by the 
community. Moreover, the NHA has not been able to turn over the common 
areas of resettlement sites to the host LGUs. LGUs usually treat these sites 
as NHA properties, and are not keen to take on the responsibility for mainte-
nance of common areas and utilities. There are several reasons why this is so: 
one, LGUs usually do not generate real property taxes from these areas; two, 
there could be development problems, such as landslides, maintenance of 
8 The NHA’s monitoring and evaluation system is limited to occupancy and col -
lection performance of resettled families. There are no systematic records on whether 
the resettled families have left the area or whether the housing has been transferred 
or sold to current occupants.

water and power systems, and weak community ownership of the area; three, 
some off-site resettlement sites are located in fourth or fifth-class municipal-
ities that do not have enough funds to support the social services needed 
by the communities and the new settlers in the short to medium term, and 
therefore the LGUs require continued support from the NHA. 
METHODOLOGY
The study used both efficiency and welfare measures to compare the two 
resettlement modes—in-city and off-city—that were undertaken by the NHA 
in cases of involuntary resettlement in Metro Manila.
To measure the efficiency of government investments for in-city and 
off-city resettlement projects, cost/benefit ratios (CBRs) were derived, based 
on estimated present values of the total costs of housing provision and the 
expected returns on the investment. This method captures the production 
efficiency in the use of government resources (Olsen 2000). The cost data 
were obtained from NHA records that include data on production, financing, 
and maintenance costs of specific in-city and off-city projects. The benefits 
were derived from the estimated value of market rents of housing in the 
location. The analysis assumes that the housing investment has a useful life 
of 30 years.
9 
In addition to comparing efficiency, the human welfare effects of in-city 
and off-city resettlement projects were also measured, using small-sample 
analysis of affected families. The data were obtained from the socioeconomic 
survey funded through the Social Impact Monitoring Project of the World 
Bank in 2010. The surveyed families were resettled families who had previ-
ously been living along the waterways of the Tullahan and Pasig Rivers, and 
were victims of Typhoon Ondoy (Typhoon Ketsana) in 2009. These families 
were initially moved to evacuation centers after their houses were washed 
out by the typhoon. The NHA, with assistance from the local housing board, 
selected from the list of evacuated families those who would be resettled in 
NHA resettlement sites in-city or off-city. 
A total of 180 sample households was surveyed in the two sites; 
100 households in the off-site resettlement in the province of Laguna (about 
65 kilometers from Metro Manila), and 80 households that were resettled in 
a site in Pasig City, in the eastern part of Metro Manila. The 180 sample house-
holds were matched using household characteristics that were not affected 
by the resettlement project (e.g., age and educational level of the head of 
household, average household size before resettlement, etc.). The propen-
sity-score matching performed on the sample households resulted in 163 
matched households. Regression analysis on the matched households was 
used to determine differences in pre-identified outcome variables such as

useful life than regular housing, which is estimated to have a useful life of between 
50 and 70 years.

health status, and the employment of women. 
COMPARISON OF IN-CITY AND OFF-CITY RESETTLEMENT: 
EFFICIENCY AND WELFARE IMPACT
Production Efficiency of Resettlement Projects
Table 16.2 compares production efficiency in the use of government 
resources for in-city and off-city resettlement projects. The cost components 
include both the investment costs and the operating and maintenance costs 
(including interest subsidies) that the NHA or the government incurs in the 
management of the resettlement site. Note that under the resettlement 
program, the NHA purchases the developed lots and housing from devel -
opers, and the beneficiaries amortize to the NHA the purchase price of the 
house and lot unit at a subsidized interest rate for a maximum period of 
30 years. The benefit or return on the investment is the estimated imputed 
rents of the housing over a period of 30 years. 
Based on recent NHA resettlement projects for Metro Manila, the 
cost of housing in off-city sites is only about P
=348,000 per unit compared 
to P=917,640 per unit for in-city projects. The cost difference is due to the 
higher land prices and higher construction costs for multistory buildings for 
in-city projects. On the other hand, while off-city projects have lower land 
prices, these projects incur additional costs for the construction of commu-
nity facilities. Controlling for size of resettlement and period of construction, 
resettlement sites in Metro Manila actually incur lower expenditures for 
community facilities, since schools, health centers, and livelihood infrastruc -
tures (e.g., markets) are already existing in the area, and are accessible to the 
community. Moreover, the community can readily connect to the local water 
and power districts, since the site is within the energized area. The house-
holds also remain constituents of the same city or municipality: thus they are 
already known by the LGU and are included as recipients of local services. 
For off-site settlements, the total project development cost is lower, 
but this advantage is erased by additional investments in both physical and 
social infrastructures. Aside from government subsidies on the house-and-lot 
packages, resettled families are also given a housing subsidy that includes 
the utilities’ expenses for installing power and water in the area, either by the 
provision of shallow wells or power generators, or as advance payment to 
utility companies to facilitate individual household connections.
10 In addition, 
resettled families are provided with a livelihood subsidy in the form of phys-
ical infrastructure and skills training programs. The infrastructure to support 
livelihoods includes capital outlays for the construction of livelihood facilities 
such as livelihood centers, tricycles, jeepneys, transport sheds, and/or market 
10 Deep wells are installed in areas that are not yet served by existing local 
water systems, and generators are provided for temporary power utilities.

talipapa centers.11 On the other hand, for skills training, the NHA allocates 
about P=3,000 per beneficiary household to link the resettled communities 
to skills training, job placement, scholarship programs, and livelihood-based 
projects, including credit or loan assistance from other national government 
agencies. However, the NHA does not monitor whether these trainings and 
facilitation activities result in actual employment or livelihood. 
In terms of benefits, while off-city projects are designed as house-and-
lot packages, the value of the housing units measured in terms of housing 
rental value is much less than the in-city housing, especially since the sites are 
often located in third or fourth income-class municipalities. 
The results of the CBR analysis show that in-city developments, spe-
cifically resettlements in Metro Manila, are more cost-effective. It costs the 
government less than one peso (between P
=0.76 and P=0.62) to produce one 
peso of housing benefits in Metro Manila. In off-city sites, the cost exceeds 
the benefit, based on a CBR of P
=1.72. This implies that in the long term, 
the return on investment is negative. The benefit is higher for in-city housing 
because of the higher economic value of the property after development. 
Off-city locations have a lower rental value, because these sites are usually 
outside the city or town centers, and in lower-income municipalities. The cost 
effectiveness of the projects is thus affected by the economic potential of 
the area as well as the value that beneficiaries attach to the resettlement 
housing.
Considering that after the 30-year lifespan of the housing unit, the NHA 
usually retains the land, given the low loan repayment performance of bene-
ficiaries, the value of the retained asset becomes part of the benefit from the 
investment. Land values are assumed to increase over time, thus the CBR is 
lower when the value of the land is considered. 
The Socioeconomic Impact of In-City versus Off-City 
Resettlement
The results of the welfare analysis show that off-city relocation distances 
people from livelihood, and pushes them into poverty. The income of the 
off-city relocated households is lower by about P
=3,000 after adjusting for 
cost-of-living differences (table 16.3). The reduced expenditure on basic 
needs (food, water, electricity) of households in off-city resettlement implies 
deepening food insecurity, and could be a coping mechanism to deal with a 
reduction in income and a change in the nature of employment. 
On the other hand, health expenditures appear to have increased, 
although the result is not statistically significant. The lower transportation 
costs may reflect changes in employment. While there is no significant dif -
ference in the proportion of employed households, there are significantly 
more women employed in the off-city relocation sites. This change indicates 
that women may have taken on domestic jobs, or livelihood projects (e.g., 
11 These are informal wet markets housed on temporary structures made of 
mixed materials (wood and salvage materials).

sari-sari stores), while the men are still looking for jobs in nearby areas. There 
are cases where the employed family member rents space in other informal 
settlements in the city and goes home to the family only during weekends 
or holidays. 
A disruption in education was also noted in the off-city sites. The pro-
portion of school-age children (6–22 years old) has dropped, despite the 
construction of new schools in the area. One possible explanation is that the 
new schools may not adequately serve the students, since the resettlement 
schools are considered satellite classes of regular Department of Education 
employees, and there are several cases of a reported absence of teachers 
in the area. It may take time for the Department of Education to hire addi-
tional teachers for these new schools, and given the already high student/
teacher ratio in the public schools, the additional load for teachers further 
compromises the quality of education. The results also indicate dissipation in 
community social capital, from high community involvement to lower interest 
in participating.
This has also been observed in the case of health centers. A community 
volunteer usually stays in these clinics, mainly to dispense over-the-counter 
medicines. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Both off-city and in-city resettlements are meant to improve the housing con-
ditions of resettled families, and both should be welfare-enhancing. However, 
this study has shown that badly planned off-city resettlements are costly, 
and actually reduce the well-being of resettled families. Compared to in-city 
resettlement, government resources are not used efficiently in off-city reset-
tlement. In the long term, the government may even have to spend more for 
off-city resettlement, since the resource requirements in terms of social and 
physical infrastructures tend to rise exponentially the greater the distance to 
the relocation site from the original site, or from the city proper. Moreover, 
the adverse impact on welfare refers not only to reduced income, but also 
to lower participation of school-age children in schooling, and increases the 
responsibility of women to earn needed income for the family. 
Off-city resettlements are often hastily undertaken, and are located 
in marginalized areas, far from livelihood and employment facilities. While 
affected families are provided with houses and lots, there are compromises 
in the quality of the developments. These areas are also far from sources of 
water and power; thus resettlement sites are often deficient in basic services. 
In other words, the objective of expediency rather than efficiency and effec -
tiveness has dominated the choice in the construction of these resettlement 
sites, and has adversely affected the welfare of resettled families in off-city 
sites. 
A policy that advocates for in-city resettlement is far superior to off-city 
resettlement. The initial investment is high, but the socioeconomic outcomes 
are better. Problems of poor maintenance of multistory housing can be 
addressed through better estate management, while land costs can be min-
imized through lease arrangements or rental housing options. Income-based

subsidies for the costs of the housing units should also be explored by the 
government. 
In cases where off-city resettlements are inevitable, the government 
must improve the choice of resettlement sites, and explore an incremental 
housing strategy in which the households and communities are more involved 
in the construction of the housing and in community development. 
The results of this case study have revealed policy shortfalls, and also 
how the policy—and compliance with the policy—needs to be strengthened. 
This study also highlights the need for an inclusive urbanization process, so 
that negative externalities can be minimized and the marginalized people are 
not made to suffer the impacts of development. 
There is also much to learn from a social impact assessment of reset -
tlement projects, specifically how households, and/or the community and 
the government, can undertake the reconstruction process in such a way as 
to restore economic and social well-being. The NHA has resettled more than 
100,000 families in infrastructure development projects in the last 10 years 
alone. Involuntary resettlements are expected to continue under the current 
administration’s accelerated infrastructure spending in the medium term. 
This case study supports other, qualitative studies that were under -
taken to assess the socioeconomic conditions of households in various NHA 
resettlement sites. Impact evaluation of housing programs in the country has 
been constrained by data limitations: thus, many of the assessments of reset-
tlement housing have dealt mostly with implementation issues, activities, and 
inputs. The current approach provides more rigorous analysis of resettlement 
impact. While it was based on small-sample estimates, the methodology can 
be applied to larger samples for more robust results.

Livelihoods in Development 
Displacement - A Reality Check from 
the Evaluation Record in Asia
Susanna Price
Abstract . Development, widely considered a solution to long-term population dis-
placement, can paradoxically create more displacement. This chapter explores this 
paradox through the lens of evaluation studies. Early evaluation studies identified a gap 
between country laws, which positioned development displacement and resettlement 
as a subset of property and expropriation laws, and international policy, which cen-
tralized livelihood measures, living standards, and outcomes for people affected. The 
chapter explores the international policy conceptualization of livelihoods as embed -
ded in a sociocultural context, requiring strategies to recreate livelihoods, monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) and their results in terms of livelihood outcomes. It compares 
international policy perspective and evaluation outcomes with selected evolving Asian 
country safeguard systems, to examine the extent to which livelihoods are addressed 
and evaluated. The gap between international and national standards is narrowing, 
but livelihood measures form the weakest point in many laws concerning land takings. 
Differences in time frames, focus, mandates, and resources in project preparation and 
implementation reflect these divergent objectives. Methods for assessing livelihood

risk, planning livelihood support, and for M&E of livelihood outcomes, are rare in 
country frameworks. Some approaches that may provide a way forward in building 
the knowledge base on livelihood success and sustainability through evaluation at the 
country level are presented. 
G
lobally, the number of people forcibly displaced due to conflicts and 
disasters has escalated to record-breaking levels and protracted time 
frames, renewing the pressing call for longer-term solutions that foster 
sustainable livelihood creation. Some experts expect that development may 
offer such a solution to forced displacement (UNDP 2013). The question is, 
will development itself swell the number of displaced people lacking liveli-
hoods, and thus only add to the problem? 
This chapter approaches this question by first reviewing the case being 
made for livelihood creation to mitigate the costs of displacement generally. 
It then explores livelihoods in development displacement more specifically, 
through the lens of the evaluation record, to understand the key elements 
shaping livelihood loss and potential reconstruction. Evaluations find that 
people affected by development may lose their income and livelihoods along 
with their housing, or independently of housing. The case for considering 
livelihood as an essential and critical requirement in longer-term solutions to 
displacement is examined. The chapter also examines the impact that country 
laws, procedures, practices, and capabilities for land taking and transfer—
that is, the “country framework” or “country system”—have on development 
displacement outcomes, and on livelihoods in particular. 
This analysis serves to highlight a gap, identified at the earliest stages 
by international resettlement specialists, between international policy and 
borrower country frameworks. Lost income and livelihoods in particular fell 
into the gap. The World Bank’s policy was based on an understanding of 
the often complex sociological processes through which displacement could 
damage incomes and livelihoods, and living standards generally, through 
which livelihoods could, eventually, be recreated. In contrast, in 1991 the 
World Bank’s general counsel found that, among borrowers, legal issues in 
resettlement were treated as a subset of property and expropriation law, 
that basically aimed to clear land for development purposes in return for 
cash payments to recognized owners (World Bank 1994). In these circum-
stances the actions and recordkeeping focused on transfer and status of 
the land rather than the Resettlement Plan, its livelihood measures, and its 
socioeconomic outcomes for land losers. Noting that cash would not suffice 
to prevent impoverishment where land and labor markets and safety nets, 
were undeveloped, and where compensation funds risked diversion, siphon-
ing off, or delay, the World Bank recommended “policy reform” and other 
actions to address the gap and, in effect to bring the people affected into 
sharper focus (World Bank 1994). In other words, project proponents would 
be encouraged to move beyond cash compensation to take responsibility for 
regenerated income flows, livelihoods, and living standards among people 
dispossessed by the developer’s own projects (World Bank 2004).
<<<PAGE=297>>>
Chapter 17. Livelihoods in Development Displacement - A Reality Check from the Evaluation Record in Asia  275
This gap is still very evident. International lender policies assign, in 
various circumstances, responsibility to the governments that expropriate 
or restrict access to land involuntarily; to “clients” implementing and oper -
ating the project (IFC 2012); or to the borrower, defined as the “recipient of 
Bank financing for an investment project, and any other entity responsible 
for the implementation of the project” (World Bank 2017, 3). Human rights 
standards require “competent authorities” to ensure that anyone forcibly dis-
placed by development has access to livelihood (UNHRC 2007).
By centralizing a livelihood objective, international lenders such as the 
World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), raise the question 
of socioeconomic rehabilitation, which may require a deeper understanding 
of sociocultural patterns of community interactions in relationship to land 
and resources. This entails assessing risks and impacts for various categories 
of affected people who may use land and other assets differently, and, in 
consultation with all stakeholders, developing income and livelihood options 
that meet social and economic parameters. It may mean detailed assessment 
of loss of income; and strategies to replace or to cost the reestablishment of 
working agricultural and commercial enterprises. It may mean matching skill 
sets, diagnosing training needs, and mobilizing social security or welfare pro-
visions. It may mean formalizing and costing time-bound measures and plans; 
and monitoring outcomes for people’s livelihoods and lives.
Conversely, payment of compensation in cash can seem a simpler and 
easier option that absolves project sponsors of responsibility for any further 
remediation, and readily hands the decision on the use of compensation to 
project-affected people, who may opt to replace the lost asset, if they can; 
look for alternative income sources; consume the proceeds; mix several of 
these options; or do something else. That strategy assigns the livelihood risks 
that arise in displacement squarely to the affected people. It also raises the 
possibility of misdirection; siphoning off or delay of cash compensation funds 
intended for affected people; and hardship among people affected where 
countries lack social welfare. Many officials among borrowers in Asia none-
theless express a preference for this approach. 
This chapter will explore the dynamics at work in some of the differing 
expectations around this central theme, and offer a perspective based on 
evaluation studies, discussions and interviews conducted over many years. 
International standards, whether originating from a focus on human rights or 
on international lending policies on involuntary resettlement, recognize the 
importance of the country role in policy implementation. Across Asia, country 
laws, procedures, and practices for land takings are changing. Is there now 
greater recognition of the importance of livelihoods in crafting sustainable 
solutions for long-term displacement? The chapter explores this question and 
concludes with some relevant recommendations.

(UN) General Assembly adopted the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) in 2015. This has revived the attention given to sustainable live-
lihoods, which “resonate” with all 17 of the SDGs, and underpin the realization 
of the SDG targets, particularly those that aim to end poverty and hunger; 
achieve sustainable growth; reduce inequalities; promote decent work for all; 
and use the earth’s resources in a sustainable manner (Biggs et al. 2015). The 
SDGs encompass all countries, both developed and developing, and include 
developing a plan for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) with indicators that 
work at the regional, national, global, and thematic levels: and evaluation 
plans that must include social, environmental, and economic indicators. These 
factors raise the stakes for a globally adopted and evaluated development 
plan, and they have brought renewed attention to the approaches for devel-
oping sustainable livelihoods (Biggs et al. 2015). 
The SDGs foresee population displacement as a major risk to achiev -
ing sustainable development—and this has implications for livelihoods. As 
population displacement arising from conflicts and disasters breaks records 
and becomes more protracted, the challenge of finding longer-term solutions 
intensifies. Livelihood creation may be viewed as an essential component of 
longer-term solutions, especially for those displaced who have the least nego-
tiating power and the fewest skills to access “new” economic opportunities. 
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates that, glob-
ally, more than 200 million people are unemployed, with 74 million young 
people aged 15–24 looking for work. Some 600 million new jobs will be 
needed in the coming decade, without which UNDP expects the risk of further 
destabilization and intensification of population displacement. UNDP’s resil -
ience-based development approach, for example, builds livelihoods for both 
displaced people and their hosts (UNDP 2013). The SDGs present develop-
ment both as a means of preventing further displacement by diminishing its 
drivers, and as a solution to protracted displacement, by turning short-term 
refugee costs into longer-term gains; lowering the costs of migration; and 
increasing the contribution of migrants to their host countries or communities 
through building livelihoods (UNDP 2013). 
Development, which is the intended solution to displacement, paradox-
ically creates more displacement—at least 15 million displaced persons each 
year (IDMC 2016). Building infrastructure, for example, has social and envi-
ronmental impacts and externalities that, if not properly managed, can result 
in unmitigated displacement that further disrupts livelihoods. This chapter 
explores this paradox through the lens of evaluation studies and of emerging 
new directions in laws, regulations, and procedures on compulsory acquisition. 
LIVELIHOODS IN DEVELOPMENT DISPLACEMENT:  
SOME THOUGHTS FROM EVALUATIONS
The involuntary resettlement policies of international financial institutions 
place livelihoods at the center of resettlement objectives, defining livelihoods 
broadly, for example, as “the full range of means that individuals, families, and 
communities utilize to make a living, such as wage-based income, agriculture, 
fishing, foraging, other natural resource-based livelihoods, petty trade, and
<<<PAGE=299>>>

bartering” (IFC 2012, 1). The World Bank definition, as set out in the new 
Environmental and Social Framework, is similar (World Bank 2017). 
Livelihood replacement or recreation can be complex. For example, 
based on significant project experience, the IFC prefers providing replacement 
land where livelihoods are land-based, or where land is collectively owned 
(IFC 2012); and access to alternative resources where livelihoods are resource-
based, together with resources for their preparation and development. Those 
people losing income from lost or damaged commercial activities may be eli-
gible for compensation for reestablishing the commercial activities elsewhere; 
compensation for lost net income during the period of transition, replacement 
land, and for the costs for relocating and re-establishing plant, equipment, and 
other items (IFC 2012). These efforts may entail, in addition to replacement or 
replacement-rate compensation for income-generating assets and income loss, 
measures to reestablish investment and development assistance such as the 
land preparation, credit facilities, training, or job opportunities needed to enable 
affected people to improve their living standards, income-earning capacity, and 
production levels; or at least to maintain them at preproject levels. 
Lenders may require “gap analyses,” which record any differences 
between their own policy positions and the country frameworks, together 
with the supplementary gap-filling measures that lenders may agree on with 
borrowers in each project case. Livelihood gaps reflect the difference between 
international policies and country laws and standards on land takings (World 
Bank 2014). Engaging with these income and livelihood issues raises ques-
tions on the availability of resources and time for planning; for identifying 
those specifically at risk of losing income and livelihoods; for assessing the 
compensation amounts due in different circumstances; for canvassing feasible 
livelihood-supporting options and opportunities or social welfare possibilities, 
in close consultation with affected people; and for monitoring and evaluating 
impoverishment risks and livelihood outcomes. 
Development displacement is conducted in a very specific context and 
time frame, with legal, valuation, financing, consultation, disclosure, and appeals 
dimensions. An early, internationally financed resettlement evaluation found 
that favorable country policy and legal frameworks, together with sufficient 
financing, capable institutions, and local involvement, were the foundation 
of successful livelihood restoration, which from the beginning was held to 
underpin successful resettlement (World Bank 1994). An Asian Development 
Bank evaluation in 2000 found similar results, and also recommended more 
attention to livelihood risk assessment and restoration, together with stronger 
M&E of outcomes. A subsequent evaluation by the World Bank confirmed 
the importance of livelihood reconstruction: a careful assessment of impacts 
found that more people lost income and livelihood than were physically dis-
placed from their housing for the sampled World Bank Group projects.
1

41 percent of people affected were physically displaced; the rest faced impacts on 
livelihoods (IEG 2011).

278
While evaluations generally have confirmed the importance of con-
ducive country frameworks, it has been difficult to foster such frameworks. 
Successive evaluations found that international involuntary resettlement 
policies, when applied in loan financing, offer better risk assessment and 
more comprehensive corresponding mitigation plans to address income and 
livelihood loss than do country frameworks generally. International policies 
offer fairer compensation and other assistance for nontitled landowners; and 
broaden monetary compensation to include loss of income and measures 
that aim to restore livelihoods taking account of sociocultural context (ADB 
2000; IEG 2011; World Bank 1994, 2014). However, the extent to which these 
additions in planning are carried through into implementation, and reflected 
in monitoring and management depends at least partly upon the level of con-
gruence in borrower frameworks, and more generally, borrower commitment 
to these ideas. 
In densely populated Bangladesh, for example, land is a particularly 
critical asset in social and cultural as well as economic terms. Even though 
land in Bangladesh is not only a means of livelihood but also “a sign of 
social power, pride, status, security and happiness” (Al Atahar 2013, 306) 
the government has not approved a national resettlement policy that would 
recognize and address the wider implications of the substantial losses that 
are experienced when land is acquired for development purposes, including 
loss of livelihood, and its interrelationship with these wider social variables. 
In 2016 the country’s Ministry of Lands approved a new Land Acquisition 
Act, but it does little to address the wider concerns of landowners and 
land users, beyond speeding up the acquisition steps and raising compensa-
tion levels, typically paid in cash with no additional assistance (Zaman and 
Khatun 2017). India, in contrast, has made a significant effort to address 
resettlement, rehabilitation, and livelihood issues in its new law, as discussed 
below. 
It is worth pausing to recap the underlying legal powers in forced 
development displacement. Legal instruments for land expropriation or 
transfer have power to trigger the displacement. If upfront negotiations fail 
between willing buyer and willing seller, or are deemed inappropriate, it is the 
state’s exercise of eminent domain or compulsory acquisition that provides 
a legal foundation for it to expropriate, in the public interest, the property 
of individuals for development purposes. This overrides, in most cases, their 
constitutional rights to property, whether it is their “property” by legally 
verified ownership, or by use rights. Most country constitutions allow expro-
priation, or compulsory acquisition, upon payment of “just terms,” “equitable 
compensation,” or a similar phrase, to citizens for the loss of their property. 
If, rather than acquiring the land the project simply restricts access to it, or 
activity upon it, as with a power transmission line with tower footings, or a 
fragile environmental area that is being protected, other laws, regulations, 
and guidelines may apply. The law and any associated regulations generally 
determine who is eligible for compensation and other assistance, and for 
which kinds of losses. As a subset of property and expropriation law, without 
a livelihood or rehabilitation objective, in most cases these laws fail to recog-
nize the full extent of losses and what might be required to address them.

Several countries have requested that financiers allow them to use 
their own country safeguards rather than financier policies. Early signs are 
that these country safeguard analyses focus closely on the wording of legal 
instruments for compulsory acquisition, and their application in practice. 
Other parameters also deserve careful attention in such assessments. These 
include time frame and planning cycle constraints, valuation methods, and 
grievance and appeals mechanisms that provide a fair outcome, as explored in 
the following sections. These parameters are discussed sequentially in what 
follows. 
Time Frame and Planning Cycle Constraints
Development displacement accompanies the project-planning cycles of 
feasibility, design, appraisal, approval, and implementation. If resettlement 
planning is required, it is situated in a specific, and often a very tight time 
frame. While scoping and socioeconomic surveys can and must begin earlier, 
compensation and resettlement plans often cannot be finalized until com-
pletion of the detailed technical design that will allow the assessment of 
impacts, through a census and asset inventory. The risks to livelihood must 
be assessed quickly, and those at risk of losing income and livelihoods must 
have choices put before them. Compensation must then be delivered before 
construction begins, forestalling arbitrary eviction without compensation. This 
tight time frame favors quick cash payments. It presents a challenge for live-
lihood measures, which may involve longer-term activities such as training, 
project employment, production, business development, and various forms 
of social assistance. This time dimension has been little noted or explored in 
international financier evaluation studies. Nor have the variations in planning 
cycles between countries and sectors received much attention. 
Valuation Methodology—Replacement Costs, Including Social 
Costs
The valuation methodology determines the ultimate value of compensation 
offered. Country laws, which had used lower asset tax values, and various 
administrative formulas, with lesser compensation rates for less certain cate-
gories of land holdings, are now moving in some cases to independently set 
market rates. International practice uses replacement rate, which adds to the 
market rate the additional real costs to people affected by involuntary acqui-
sition, such as administrative and transaction costs and relevant moving and 
transfer costs (Pearce 1999). If the payment is delayed, inflation may erode 
the potential for the compensation to replace lost assets. 
Replacement of losses is the overall principle that international finan-
ciers advocate for—and also that replacement land must be offered to 
land-dependent rural producers. There are some very important questions 
to consider here. Is fair-market appraisal used as a basis for asset valuation? 
Is the highest and best price regularly used, based on accurate data? In 
addition, are out-of-pocket expenses covered? And how are nontangibles 
valued?
<<<PAGE=302>>>

The loss of land may represent not only lost assets and income, but 
also the loss of security for old age and disability, and loss of the locus of 
social networks. Land is often an essential element in the formation of house-
holds, social and cultural systems, and psychological well-being. Replacing 
land with cash or short-term work may destroy these systems, and with it 
prospects for sustainable livelihoods (Cernea 2008; Downing and Garcia 
Downing 2009). 
The full social costs of displacement to affected people may only 
become apparent well after displacement as households, communities, and 
their production systems begin to unravel. These costs may include the loss 
of hard-to-quantify social networks that reflect and sustain communities, 
and offer both economic and social benefits, including health care, infor -
mal support, marketing networks, reciprocal labor exchanges, and backup 
in hard times. They also include the loss of any nonpriced social and cul -
tural assets, such as commonly owned forests, water bodies, and grasslands, 
which provide communities with sacred sites and ritual objects, food, grazing 
land, fuel, medicines, and salable items. Land may also represent the only 
source of security in old age or infirmity. It may encapsulate and represent an 
unquantifiable but fundamental sense of belonging and identity that under -
pins psychological well-being. The loss of production systems and other 
assets may start unraveling the cohesion of households, neighborhoods, 
and communities—the social characteristics that underpin the inter- and 
intra-household agreements that in turn underpin livelihoods (Downing and 
Garcia-Downing 2009; Lam 2015). In short, in losing their tangible assets, 
in addition to income, households may lose essential subsistence, insurance, 
social support, and their place-based identity. 
Consultation, Disclosure, Grievance Redress, and Appeals
Disclosure of critical information to the people affected, and the establish-
ment of grievance redress mechanisms help to set a fair process, in which 
dispossessed people have access to information and can, without prejudice, 
lodge an appeal and expect to have it heard fairly and in a reasonable time 
frame. In these respects, development displacement takes place rather differ-
ently than most other forms of displacement—and with care, the mitigation 
strategies can be built in ahead of the act of displacement. 
HOW ARE LIVELIHOODS ADDRESSED IN NATIONAL 
FRAMEWORKS OR SYSTEMS FOR EXPROPRIATION?
The rapidly developing Asian region features several significant new laws 
concerning land acquisition. This legislation increasingly reflects independent 
asset valuation, social analysis or social impact assessment (SIA), consultation 
opportunities with affected people, and negotiation as a basis for compen-
sation. Most Asian countries now allow project-affected people to challenge 
land acquisition procedures in court—if they can afford to challenge. In addi-
tion to physical assets, many countries now recognize and compensate for 
loss of economic activity and improvements on land. At least three countries
<<<PAGE=303>>>
Chapter 17. Livelihoods in Development Displacement - A Reality Check from the Evaluation Record in Asia  281
(Cambodia, India, and Indonesia) offer land-for-land replacement options, but 
none of them require that the replacement land be ready for cultivation. 
India, Indonesia, and Vietnam offer relocation allowances where relocation is 
necessary (Tagliarino 2017).
India’s 2013 law, The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency 
in Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act (LARR),
2 replaced 
the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, which was based on the state’s power of 
eminent domain. As signaled in its title, where it applies, the LARR accepts the 
proposition that land acquisition may threaten livelihoods; and that in such 
cases, livelihood rehabilitation strategies are necessary. It recognizes that 
“affected families” include those without title to land, who nonetheless have 
depended on the land for their primary livelihood for the preceding three 
years. Nontitled people losing livelihoods may benefit from livelihood recon-
struction through increased compensation rates, SIA, and consent from the 
people affected. LARR includes consultative planning, negotiation, and griev-
ance redress. The LARR is part of a broader legal framework of rights and 
guarantees that increase its legitimacy in protecting affected people (Mariotti 
2015). India is the only Asian country with a legal requirement to minimize 
displacement by exploring alternatives. It has constituted a group of experts 
with social science expertise, to review SIAs and alternative project designs 
that would minimize displacement. 
Indonesia recently introduced a landmark Law on Land Acquisition for 
Development Purposes in the Public Interest (Law 2/2012), which became 
effective in 2014 after the issuance of implementing regulations. The law 
replaces a series of presidential decrees and other regulations that generally 
required only the payment of lesser or no compensation to those land users 
without formal title; and calculated compensation starting at lower rates, 
based on tax value. Law 2/2012 introduces the concept of independent 
market appraisal for lost assets, requiring “reasonable and fair compensation” 
that covers land, assets on land, structures, plants, other objects relating to 
land, and other nonphysical appraisable losses, including loss of jobs, busi-
nesses, the costs of changing location or profession, and the loss of value in 
remaining assets. While not an explicit requirement, this could equal replace-
ment cost. The law allows compensation to be paid as cash, replacement 
land, resettlement, shareholding, or other forms agreed upon between the 
parties (Article 36). 
There is no mention of livelihoods in the law. In cases where the 
affected household is selecting the resettlement option, this may include live-
lihood assistance under a related law of 2011. Generally it is unclear how Law 
2/2012 will deal with audit rules that require depreciation to be deducted 
from asset compensation; or with budgeting regulations that do not allow 
“double counting” in the form of additional livelihood measures on top of 
compensation. Law 2/2012 does include a greater opportunity for affected 
people to seek consultation, negotiation of compensation, and redress of

grievances; and these mechanisms may offer opportunities to counter earlier 
regulations that in effect limited livelihood assistance. 
Vietnam’s new Constitution (2014) and Land Law No 43 (2013) 
strengthen legal protections for people affected by development displace-
ment, with provisions to identify them, inform them, and consult with them 
prior to any acquisition; to recognize certain customary land-tenure rights; to 
recognize and compensate for loss of economic activity on land; to provide 
replacement land as a compensation option; to compensate before posses-
sion; and to pay a relocation allowance when people must relocate. 
In 2102, Cambodia introduced a Law on Land Expropriation that 
strengthens information and consultation requirements, allows compensation 
for loss of economic activity, and encourages land-for-land compensation, but 
does not require that replacement land to be ready for cultivation. Sri Lanka 
introduced an authoritative but nonbinding National Involuntary Resettle-
ment Policy in 2001, a Compensation Policy in 2008, and several gazette 
notifications under the Land Acquisition Act of 1950, the latest of which 
(2013) which applies very selectively, mainly to certain transport projects; 
brings compensation payments to replacement rates; and significantly boosts 
consultation and negotiation possibilities for people losing land.
The Kyrgyz Republic, like some other Central Asian republics, has trans-
formed its legal and regulatory framework to allow privately owned land for 
its citizens. However, the legal basis for compulsory acquisition lacks clarity, 
and there is little commitment to consultation with the people affected in 
practice, or to the development of livelihood programs. 
China has introduced measures in the reservoir sector that address 
livelihoods (Cernea 2016), and has several other laws and regulations that 
provide some assistance for livelihood that covers expropriation in certain 
circumstances. It still lacks an overall, transparent and consistent law on land 
acquisition that covers all sectors; unambiguously sets a livelihood objective; 
and requires a resettlement plan and SIA as a basis for developing livelihood 
options. 
While a complete analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter, there 
are positive examples of the movement toward fairer, more consultative, and 
more transparent land acquisition laws and regulations across Asia. However, 
the legal requirements generally stop short of statements in law that define 
livelihood standards; propose risk assessment tools and methods to deter -
mine when livelihoods are at risk; formulate income and livelihood measures 
in meaningful consultation with those affected; mobilize the necessary exper-
tise, management capacity, and financing; and establish requirements to 
evaluate whether livelihood objectives have been achieved. The laws do not 
take the additional step of recognizing the rationale for livelihood measures: 
the unquantifiable social costs, opportunities foregone during downtime, and 
the transition and reconstruction costs that so often accrue for people along 
the way.
Nationally ratified human rights conventions, declarations, and treaties 
would, if applied in tangible ways within the process of planning and man-
aging resettlement, strengthen consultations and protection for a range of 
vulnerable groups.

Chapter 17. Livelihoods in Development Displacement - A Reality Check from the Evaluation Record in Asia  283
NEGOTIATING FOR LIVELIHOODS
Many new laws and regulations offer increased scope for negotiation, even 
within the context of compulsory acquisition. Does the negotiation process 
hold something that would foster income and livelihood choices for people 
affected? This section briefly explores this possibility. 
Negotiation may take place around choices within a framework for 
involuntary land acquisition, or entirely outside the existing framework, as 
an agreement negotiated between a willing buyer and a willing seller, in the 
form of a market transaction. The former type of negotiation is subject to the 
applicable national legal framework, which has the legal power to involun-
tarily displace people, even while offering them an opportunity to negotiate 
on some elements. 
Most Asian countries require such negotiation: the exceptions are Ban-
gladesh, Taiwan, and Thailand (Tagliarino 2017); and Sri Lanka, except for 
selected projects named in the 2013 Gazette. Most reports indicate that such 
negotiations revolve around the level of cash compensation in terms of the 
assets recognized, and the level of compensation offered, with little scope 
for negotiation on the reconstruction of livelihood opportunities. 
Even within this involuntary framework, however, the laws increasingly 
provide opportunities for negotiation. Among Asian countries, Indonesia, for 
example, in its new Land Acquisition Law of 2/2012 (Articles 34, 37, and 38), 
introduced a specific requirement for negotiation of compensation between 
the land administrator and the “entitled parties,” with the express intention 
that the acquisition is not carried out entirely under duress. Before the possi-
bility of expropriation for development in the public interest, for example, Law 
2/2012 requires the government to consider other options, including buying 
land under a “willing buyer-willing seller” transaction. If the land parcel is less 
than five hectares, Presidential Regulation 40 of 2014 permits the acquiring 
agency to negotiate directly with the land user in the form of sale-pur -
chase land exchange, or other means agreed on by the parties. Beyond this, 
however, the law envisages a negotiation with affected people with regard 
to compensation options, including money, replacement land, resettlement, 
shareholding, or other forms of compensation, as agreed between the parties 
(Article 36). All of these options hold possibilities for restoring livelihoods, 
but nothing is explicitly spelled out. 
The second type of negotiation takes land transactions into the market 
arena, which may be shrouded by commercial in-confidence concerns. There 
are some indications that private sector models can be more flexible, expan-
sive, and responsive to the articulated concerns of affected people when 
compared to models applied by government agencies. Private developers can 
work outside the government planning, project cycle, and budgeting systems 
that may limit the options available for government projects, particularly 
where livelihood measures are not mandated by law. For example, a private 
oil and gas project developer in Indonesia provided a resettlement plan for 
the affected communities. The plan was considerably more generous than a 
comparable government-funded project would have been (Price 2015). The 
plan articulated a resettlement-with-development objective that was higher
<<<PAGE=306>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
284
than either the international or national standards in place at the time. It also 
required a high level of public scrutiny and disclosure, and strong corporate 
commitment. 
Negotiating directly with affected people as an integral part of a 
framework for land acquisition, compensation, and involuntary resettlement 
increases the transparency of the process, possibly leading to fewer com-
plaints (Tagliarino 2017). However, a “willing buyer, willing seller” arrangement 
might not necessarily mean a level playing field between buyer and seller 
that will result in a fair outcome. Rather, it can signal the influence of asym-
metries in power and information. It may reflect a loss of entitlements to fair 
treatment designed to forestall the impoverishment of affected people, in 
favor of a nebulous system of negotiated rules and remedies that in effect 
do away with entitlements altogether (Bugalski 2016).
Private developers and proponents may simply rely on government to 
clear the land with no questions asked; or to waive any requirements for envi-
ronmental and social safeguards, including even basic compensation. This has 
been the case with certain notorious mining ventures, such as the Freeport 
mine in Indonesian Papua; or, more recently, in agriculture, as in some of the 
Cambodian Economic Land Concessions. Asymmetries in status, resources, 
power, and information are key features of interactions between the nego-
tiating parties. If developers have financing from international banks with 
involuntary resettlement policies, or have signed onto voluntary agreements 
such as the Equator Principles, this may offer additional protection to the 
affected people. However, land deals negotiated between unequal parties 
may still result in divided and disempowered land-owning groups, and their 
resulting marginalization and impoverishment, even where both international 
and human rights standards are respected (Narula 2013). New guides are 
being written with the aim of informing and supporting small landholders 
faced with the daunting prospect of negotiations with powerful, well-re-
sourced developers who often have government backing (e.g., a community 
guide to negotiation issued by Inclusive Development 2016). 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENHANCING LIVELIHOODS IN 
DEVELOPMENT DISPLACEMENT 
…in order to have continued relevance and application, livelihoods 
perspectives must address more searchingly and concretely questions 
across …four themes:…knowledge, politics, scale and dynamics. These 
are challenging agendas, both intellectually and practically. For those 
convinced that livelihoods perspectives must remain central to devel -
opment, this is a wake-up call. The vibrant and energetic “community of 
practice” of the late 1990s has taken its eye off the ball. A certain com-
placency, fuelled by generous funding flows, a comfortable localism 
and organisational inertia has meant that some of the big, emerging 
issues of rapid globalisation, disruptive environmental change and 
fundamental shifts in rural economies have not been addressed. Inno-
vative thinking and practical experimentation has not yet reshaped 
livelihood perspectives to meet these challenges in radically new ways. 
(Scoones 2009)

Chapter 17. Livelihoods in Development Displacement - A Reality Check from the Evaluation Record in Asia  285
Changing laws and practices are creating new ways of addressing losses in 
incomes and livelihoods across Asia. Some recommendations are presented 
below. 
 n Include explicit livelihood objectives in the country’s property and 
expropriation legal instruments, or introduce a new law that rec -
ognizes the need for livelihood rehabilitation, as India has done; as 
well as supporting guidelines and procedures.
 n Mobilize resources and capacities to address livelihood objectives 
through the development of appropriate management mandates, 
staffing skills, and feasibility assessments and arrangements.
 n Develop definitions and diagnostic tools and strategies to assess 
quickly and effectively whether livelihoods are at risk among the 
people affected. 
 n Test principles, valuation methods, and forms of compensation and 
other assistance that may help rebuild livelihoods. For example: 
 § The value to the owner compensation principle, which is made 
up of market value together with other losses suffered by the 
claimant; and
 § Payment of other consequential financial losses, such as the cost 
of finding alternative accommodations; extra costs for living in a 
new district; fees for discharging mortgages; temporary business 
losses pending removal; loss of business goodwill; and the costs 
of notifying customers and clients about the removal, and other 
related losses.
 n Recognize the principle that it is an interest in land that is actually 
acquired: this comes close to recognizing nontitled people.
 n Proactively test baseline socioeconomic surveys as a basis for sub-
sequent M&E, by project sponsors, developing effective feedback 
links to enhance livelihood program outcomes. 
 n Test more sensitive needs assessments as a basis for developing for 
livelihood programs, taking into account the needs and priorities of 
different groups.
 n Research the question of which types of compensation contribute 
more effectively to restore lost income and livelihoods.
 n Explore and test a wider range of feasible livelihood options. For 
example:
 § Benefit sharing, such as in-kind assistance, project employment, 
and related on-the-job training, direct revenue sharing, develop-
ment funds, links with employers’ and government programs 
and equity sharing. 
 § Other options include assistance for business development, 
access to credit and other services, and other forms of training 
and skills development. These forms of assistance may be rea-
sonably and readily deployed by the average project sponsor 
or proponent, whether in the public or private sector, although
<<<PAGE=308>>>

286
without proper needs assessments, targeting, and monitoring of 
results, or without the support of experienced livelihood practi-
tioners, the measures offered to affected people may be poorly 
utilized and quickly abandoned. 
 § Certain other options require the waiving of local taxes and 
preferential rates for financing livelihood reconstruction. This 
requires concurrence with revenue-raising bodies that might 
be outside the land acquisition framework. Finally, putting into 
place social safety nets through pensions, project insurance, con-
tingency funds, vulnerability support schemes, and/or project 
special funds may be a logical way to proceed, but may also raise 
practical problems of specifically targeting the affected people. 
Safety nets usually operate through national-level coordination, 
again necessitating concurrence from national-level agencies.
 § Consider accessing land on a lease basis so that the land is not 
lost in perpetuity to the original owners.
 § Build the knowledge base of what works effectively and how, 
through the development of M&E methods of measuring liveli-
hood outcomes. 
 § Share results from the development displacement experience 
with livelihood programs more generally. 
CONCLUSION
This chapter argues that finding livelihood solutions is an urgent matter as 
development, conflict, disasters, and, increasingly, environmental change 
displace ever more people around the globe. Of all these forms of displace-
ment, development displacement has a long track record in addressing 
livelihood issues, and in prioritizing international policies and standards of 
livelihood improvement, or at least restoration. The earliest evaluation of 
involuntary resettlement highlighted the sociocultural context of livelihoods 
and the links between livelihood restoration and the overall objective of 
poverty reduction (World Bank 1994). Despite its importance, however, 
livelihood outcomes have routinely suffered not just from the absence of 
systematic data and analysis, but also from lack of visibility in the form of 
articulated objectives in legal instrument, and methods for assessing losses. 
This has meant a corresponding lack of resources for planning, monitoring, 
and evaluation of livelihood options; a lack of sufficient time allocated to 
planning cycles for significant and meaningful consultation on a wide range 
of choices as a basis for preparing livelihood programs; and deficiencies in 
asset valuation methods for addressing loss of income and the reconstruc -
tion of livelihoods. 
Compensation at replacement cost forms a critical basis of the overall 
strategy to rebuild livelihoods in international policy formulations: but reset-
tlement specialists have found that more is required if livelihoods are severely 
affected. While there is increasing congruence between international and 
national standards in legal and regulatory instruments, livelihood measures 
form the weakest point in many national laws concerning land acquisition.

Chapter 17. Livelihoods in Development Displacement - A Reality Check from the Evaluation Record in Asia  287
Whereas the livelihood objective is central to international resettlement stan-
dards, it barely appears, if at all, in most of the recent national legal and 
regulatory initiatives. 
Yet even where internationally financed projects include livelihood 
measures in resettlement plans, or as stand-alone livelihood restoration plans, 
there is no guarantee of their outcomes. This aspect of policy application 
merits a major rethinking in terms of rationale, legal formulations, financing, 
management, and application. It could benefit, for example, from a reexam-
ination of methods for identifying the affected people who are most at risk 
and will need livelihood support, and meaningfully consulting with them on 
a range of feasible livelihood options. It could also benefit from a compar -
ative assessment of valuing and compensating for lost assets and incomes 
as a basis for livelihood reconstruction, and the management arrangements 
under which these decisions are made. Similarly, a comparison of livelihood 
outcomes from the application of country laws that recognize and address 
the livelihood imperative, such as in India, compared with outcomes when 
country laws do not engage directly with livelihoods, could be illuminating. 
Is it possible to address these issues through negotiations with the people 
affected? Do these negotiations offer better livelihood protections, or simply 
reinforce existing patterns of social exclusion? 
International involuntary resettlement policies offer much in terms 
of methods and procedures for defining livelihood scope and standards; in 
identifying those at risk of losing livelihoods; in formulating livelihood mea-
sures in close consultation with those at risk; in setting forth time-bound, 
costed plans for identifying management arrangements; in addressing the 
socioeconomics of recovery for livelihoods at risk; and in methods for mea-
suring, monitoring, and evaluating outcomes. They also offer possibilities for 
a safeguard on negotiated settlements. Innovative country practices are now 
adding to the body of knowledge on these matters, reflecting better under-
standing of the underlying sociological parameters supporting livelihoods in 
many contexts. International human rights norms and standards can serve as 
additional tests of public interest through project hearings, while the concept 
of consent offers a different approach to defending livelihoods at risk. For 
land-dependent communities with little negotiating power, dismantling pro-
ductive rural livelihoods may be a step too far, especially under legal and 
regulatory frameworks that do not recognize the need for livelihood recon-
struction. Development may represent a strategy for longer-term solutions 
to loss of livelihood, but only if livelihood objectives are explicitly named in 
laws and negotiation procedures; addressed through specific risk identifica-
tion methods; supported by a range of feasible and consultatively developed 
livelihood strategies; underpinned by fair legal and grievance mechanisms 
that are accessible to all those affected; and independently monitored and 
evaluated to ensure good outcomes.

New Frontiers for Evaluation in a  
Fast-Changing World
Chris Barnett and Rachel Eager
Abstract . The world has changed significantly in the past decade: rising inequality, 
conflict and insecurity, mass migration, terrorism, and climate change all present major 
global challenges. The responding United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Devel-
opment sets out a holistic approach, cognizant of the interconnectedness between 
society, economy, and the environment. In addition, many private investors and busi-
nesses are increasingly aware of their long-term interdependence on natural systems. 
These changes provide both an opportunity and a significant evaluative challenge for 
those who have traditionally operated within the aid/development sphere. This chapter 
considers new frontiers for the evaluation profession in terms of methodology, engage-
ment with new actors, and how best to provide evaluative evidence within complex 
and rapidly changing contexts. Responding to global challenges requires more than 
just methodological improvement and innovation. There is a need for a bolder eval -
uation agenda, recognizing the evaluators’ role in contributing to change: acting not 
just as providers of evidence, but to proactively engage in an ethical obligation to 
society, stimulating deliberation and re-examination of evidence by a broader range 
of citizens—citizens who can be emboldened to use such evidence to improve their 
situations and hold others to account.

Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
294
T
he world has changed significantly in the past decade, with rising inequal-
ity, conflict and insecurity, mass migration, terrorism, and climate change 
all presenting major challenges for our collective future. New influential 
trading powers like China and India challenge the economic status quo, while 
the choices of voters in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest 
a re-emergence of protectionist and populist policies in response to increas-
ing globalization and a new multipolar political order. The old East-West, 
North-South, developed-developing divides look increasingly irrelevant. 
Meanwhile, over the past few decades, evaluation as a field has developed 
largely in response to public policy and government intervention, by assessing 
effectiveness and impact on behalf of governments and their taxpaying con-
stituents. In international aid particularly, this has been underpinned largely 
by assumptions from an old-world order: it has been focused on public expen-
diture commissioned by donors for recipient countries, and dominated by 
large-scale interventions managed mostly by international nongovernmental 
organizations (INGOs), agencies of the United Nations (UN), or “managing 
agents” (Western private companies). 
In this chapter, we consider how the field of evaluation might best 
respond to a changing world, and in doing so set out new frontiers for the 
coming decades. The first part describes major global trends, with billions 
of people continuing to live in poverty, and with growing inequality between 
the richest and the poorest; threats to the environment and our ecosystems; 
and insecurity, migration, and conflict. In response to these challenges, the 
international community has set out an ambitious vision for the future: the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs); the Addis Ababa Development Financing Action 
Agenda; the World Humanitarian Summit; and the Paris Climate Change 
Agreement. In parallel, there has been a rising tide of private capital and 
businesses consciously aiming to become a force for good (Social Impact 
Investment Taskforce 2014a). This includes various forms of socially and envi-
ronmentally responsible private and blended capital (e.g., impact investing 
and venture philanthropy), as well as new modalities and changes in the ways 
of doing business such as the Blueprint for Business.
1 In the second half of 
the chapter, we explore the implications of these changes for evaluation in 
terms of both methodology and new partnerships with new actors. Finally, 
we argue that these global challenges require something more fundamental 
than just changing the way in which evaluators respond and adapt to a chang-
ing context. Rather, we argue that they imply the need for a bolder evaluation 
agenda, in which evaluators contribute to the change itself and take up a 
more value-driven mantra: not only to provide evidence-based assessments, 
but also to engage in an ethical obligation to society to make evidence avail-
able in such a way that it can be deliberated upon and reexamined by a 
broader cross-section of the population. At a time when many of the most 
vulnerable feel disenfranchised by global trends, it is perhaps even more

pertinent for evaluators to embrace technology, new ways of working, and 
new partnerships in order to focus increasingly on the ultimate “client” (the 
poor and marginalized), by empowering citizens to better use evidence to 
inform, challenge, and call to account politicians, policy makers, development 
professionals, and private companies. 
GROWING INEQUALITY
There is increasing recognition that inequality is one of the major challenges 
of our time. In recent years, seminal work by leading economists has high-
lighted a growing divide between the world’s richest and poorest citizens 
(Atkinson 2015; Bourguignon 2015; Picketty 2013). Indeed, inequality within 
countries continues to rise (Oxfam 2014), with the United Nations Devel -
opment Programme (UNDP) reporting that income inequality in developing 
countries increased by 11 percent between 1990 and 2010 (UNDP 2013). 
Furthermore, the location of the poorest is changing, and the distribution 
is no longer concentrated in low-income countries. Research shows that 
72 percent of the world’s poor (960 million) now live not in poor countries, 
but in middle-income countries (MICs), a dramatic shift from two decades 
ago, when the vast majority (over 90 percent) lived in low-income countries 
(Sumner 2012). Increasingly, the problems of poverty are a challenge for 
MICs that are less dependent, and may not be at all dependent, on devel -
opment assistance. As such, poverty reduction in many MICs becomes less 
about having enough resources and more about having the political will to 
address issues of redistribution. This has implications for development assis-
tance, which is increasingly being used to target the most stubborn problems 
in the least developed countries, especially among fragile and conflict-af -
fected states (Picciotto 2015a). Not only is this a challenge to the traditional 
North-South model of development assistance: it also affects evaluators 
and the role of evaluation. While evaluators need to retain some focus on 
development assistance, increasingly there is a new role emerging: to support 
national-level (and country-led) policy objectives, and to consider policy 
coherence internationally. This requires not simply evaluating aid-driven (or 
micro level) interventions in isolation, but also assessing the effects of other 
policies—of trade, investment, environmental protection, foreign policy, immi-
gration, and so on—to either mutually support (or to undermine) poverty, 
inequality, and sustainability objectives (Picciotto 2005).
2 Or, as van den Berg 
and Cando-Noordhuizen (2017) have put it, “Evaluators need to point out to 
policy makers and decision makers that what they promote with one hand, 
is more than sufficiently undone with a very active and much bigger other 
hand.”

PUSHING PLANETARY BOUNDARIES
At the same time, our understanding of the environment is changing. New 
thinking and new science suggest that there are planetary boundaries, i.e., 
that there are thresholds within which there exists a safe operating space for 
humanity. For instance, Rockström et al. (2009) suggest a framework of nine 
planetary boundaries (including stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acid -
ification, and biogeochemical flows) within which humanity can continue to 
develop and thrive for generations to come. Work on climate change also 
suggests that growing global resource demands will continue to exacerbate 
the likelihood of increased flooding, heat waves, earthquakes, and other 
natural disasters, the consequences of which are linked in many countries 
to food security concerns and increased levels of conflict (UN 2015c; World 
Economic Forum 2016). Economic, social, and environmental developments 
are increasingly viewed as interlinked, and pose challenges for policy makers, 
the private sector, and evaluators. The latter can no longer operate purely 
within defined sectoral boundaries, and even social systems are too limit -
ing: there is an increasing need to consider the relationship between social 
and natural systems, as well as longer-term time frames—that is, no longer 
3–5 years, but 20, 50, or 100 years (Rowe 2012).
CONFLICT, SECURITY, AND SAFETY
Alongside a growing gap between the richest and poorest, and a greater 
vulnerability to risks and disaster-related losses especially for the poorest, 
deterioration in indicators of peace in the Middle East and North Africa have 
been so severe they have masked increases in other areas. The global peace 
index has highlighted deterioration in the impact of terrorism and political 
instability indicators as key contributors (Institute for Economics and Peace, 
2014). The severity of the situation in the Middle East has wider implica-
tions. Global levels of displacement are now higher than ever before, with 
65.3 million people living in exile at the end of 2015—a population of forci-
bly displaced people that is greater than the entire population of the United 
Kingdom (UNHCR 2015). Large-scale global migration is now rated as one 
of the most likely and impactful global risks (World Economic Forum 2016). 
The intertwined dynamics of terrorism, conflict, and political instability within 
a small number of countries has consequences at a global level, with the eco-
nomic impact of violence estimated at 13.3 percent of world GDP (Institute 
for Economics and Peace 2014). Evaluation, particularly when undertaken in 
fragile contexts, increasingly has to respond to dynamic situations, where the 
politics of diplomacy, military intervention, and peace-building activities often 
intersect with more traditional forms of humanitarian and development assis-
tance (Broegaard, Bull and Kovsted 2014).
THE POST-2015 ERA: RESPONDING TO GLOBAL CHALLENGES
The above-mentioned challenges of poverty, inequality, insecurity, and the 
environment are increasingly being recognized, with the re-emergence of 
“sustainable development” as a unifying concept—that is, the process of

meeting human development goals while sustaining the very natural systems 
that are needed to provide the resources and ecosystem services for human-
ity (both society and the economy) to thrive. For the coming decades, the 
international community has set out an ambitious vision: the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development (in September 2015), which includes the SDGs; 
the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on development financing (in July 2015); the 
World Humanitarian Summit (in May 2016); and the Paris Climate Change 
Agreement (in December 2015). The SDGs in particular represent a major 
shift toward global responsibility, unlike the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), where the focus was on developing countries. These agreements 
also offer a more holistic vision that acknowledges the interconnectedness 
between objectives (societal, economic, and environmental), and advocates 
partnerships that go beyond governments, and that include the private sector.
The Agenda for Sustainable Development presents a vision for eradi-
cating poverty and tackling inequality, and addressing the need for economic, 
social, and environmental sustainability with a breadth of focus that recog-
nizes the interconnected nature of the issues faced. While the MDGs focused 
on identifying and filling gaps, the SDGs ask a more holistic question about 
how we can stimulate sustainable progress across a much broader range of 
complex and interrelated goals (Weisen and Prokop 2015).
Evidence and learning are also integrated into the 2030 Sustainable 
Development Agenda, which is monitored via a results framework composed 
of the 17 ambitious SDGs, and 169 quantitative and qualitative target indi-
cators. These goals are aspirational and universal, setting a framework within 
which countries define their own targets based on national priorities and 
contexts. In contrast to the tracking of the MDGs, where disparities in per -
formance were masked by aggregate-level reporting, the 2030 Agenda calls 
for the monitoring of targets at all levels, and an increased focus on data dis-
aggregation by a range of characteristics including income, race, age, gender, 
disability, and ethnicity (Weisen and Prokop 2015). Systematic follow-up and 
review processes are also prominent within the agenda, positioning evidence, 
data, and evaluative thinking as critical to the achievement of the strategy. 
Review processes are expected to operate at the national, regional, and global 
levels, in order to “promote accountability to our citizens, support effective 
international cooperation…and foster exchanges of best practices and mutual 
learning” (UN 2015a, clauses 72–73). Follow-up and review processes will be 
informed by the tracking of progress toward goals, and rigorous country-led 
evaluation, and are expected to make “a vital contribution to implementation 
and will help countries to maximise and track progress…in order to ensure 
that no one is left behind” (UN 2015a, clauses 72 and 74g).
The Agenda poses many challenges for evaluation. First, it requires 
country-led evaluation which requires strengthening national evaluation pro-
grams through enhanced capacity-building support for developing countries. 
Although as highlighted by the International Institute for Environment and 
Development (IIED), little guidance is given on how countries may set their 
own national agendas, and evaluation will need to address issues such as 
whether or not progress made is equitable, relevant, and sustainable (Ofir 
et al. 2016; Schwandt 2016). Second, lessons from the monitoring and

evaluation (M&E) of the MDGs suggest that the MDG approach oversim-
plified the development narrative, essentially creating sector-based silos. In 
response to this, the interrelated nature of the SDGs demonstrates the need 
for a more holistic development—and therefore evaluation—approach. 
Third, moving away from the public sector, donor-centric MDG approach, 
there is a clear recognition of the need for diversification in funding mecha-
nisms. The new agenda emphasizes the role of multiple change agents, and 
recognizes the need for contextual flexibility and the disaggregation of data 
(Ofir 2015).
MOBILIZING RESOURCES FOR THE POST-2015 AGENDA
Financing this ambitious global agenda requires a significant increase in 
resources allocated, and a mobilization of resources far beyond that of 
development assistance. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Devel-
opment (UNCTAD) has estimated the total investment needs in developing 
countries to amount to $3.9 trillion annually. Current investment report -
edly stands at $1.4 trillion, highlighting a substantial investment gap of 
$2.5 trillion per year (UNCTAD 2014, 145). In many MICs, the public reve-
nues generated are sufficient to meet costs: however, insufficient funds are 
being allocated to basic services. The current political climate in both Europe 
and the United States increasingly challenges the commitment to deliver 0.7 
percent of gross national income as official development aid (Nakhooda et al. 
2016). In this resource-constrained context, the importance of private sector 
investment is heightened, changing the dynamics of development finance sig-
nificantly. The role of the private sector is clearly acknowledged within the 
2030 Agenda, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda encourages philanthropic 
donors to continue their engagement through impact investments, with calls 
for increased transparency and accountability across the sector (UN 2015a, 
2015c).
Meanwhile, there is a potential convergence between this globally 
agreed agenda and the individual interests of some in the private sector. Over 
the past decade, the private sector has been evolving considerably, with the 
emergence of businesses with a more deliberate social or environmental con-
science. The long era of corporate social responsibility (CSR) continues, but 
this has sometimes been plagued by accusations of tokenism, or “greenwash-
ing.” Indeed, claims of CSR are rarely evaluated (Picciotto 2015b), therefore 
little is known about the effectiveness of these approaches in creating social 
and environmental change (Flynn, Young, and Barnett 2015). But whereas 
CSR has sometimes been viewed as an add-on to the core business, there 
is now a growing movement that is advocating using business as a force 
for good—for example, initiatives such as Blueprint for Better Business, the 
World Forum on Natural Capital, and B-Corp. Building on the pioneering work 
of businesses such as The Body Shop as well as fair trade and other certifica-
tions, these movements aim to encourage businesses to define and operate 
with a purpose that serves society and the environment. B-Corp, for instance, 
now has more than 2,000 businesses that are certified to its standards of 
social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.

The investment field provides a good example of the multiplicity of 
challenges faced by more traditional forms of evaluation. In recent decades, 
new variants of purpose-driven, or mission-based, capital have emerged, 
aiming for both social and environmental returns along with their financial 
benefits. The boundaries between traditional public sector–driven inter -
national aid and private sector investment are becoming more and more 
blurred with the emergence and proliferation of a huge range of social and 
environmental investment funds, financial intermediation schemes, and insur-
ance products aimed at achieving profit with purpose (Picciotto 2015a; Social 
Impact Investment Taskforce 2014a). Private sector resources are now being 
directed toward socially responsible purposes, with new investment modal -
ities seeking to achieve both financial and social or environmental returns. 
There is a broad range of approaches to socially or environmentally 
responsible capital, existing across a spectrum that ranges from philanthropic 
giving to traditional, profit-driven investment (Avantage Ventures 2011). As 
shown in figure 18.1, investment modalities can be broadly categorized into 
five groups: socially responsible investments; environmental, social, and gov -
ernance investments; impact investing; program-related investing; and venture 
philanthropy. Toward the profit-oriented end of the spectrum, socially respon-
sible investing focuses mainly on “do no harm” principles that involve avoiding 
investments in companies with ethically, socially, or environmentally ques-
tionable business practices. However, a new breed of environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) investments are oriented more toward “doing good” 
by incorporating ESG factors consciously into their investment decisions, and 
aiming to improve the sustainability and ethical impacts of an investment 
(Avantage Ventures 2011). 
At the other (socially oriented) end of the scale, there has been a rise 
in philanthropy, which has more direct, charitable-giving purposes. Venture 
philanthropists in particular provide flexible financial support and mentoring 
to social entrepreneurs and organizations that are aiming to drive innovation 
and social change, and to achieve operational sustainability. Financial support 
has traditionally been focused on grant giving, but has broadened recently 
to include other mechanisms, such as equity-like investments and loans.
3 Pro-
gram-related investments go further still, and are made where there is a 
potential for return on investment within a specific period of time, allowing 
recipients to access capital at lower rates. 
The growing industry of purpose-driven investments has already lev -
eraged a substantial amount of private capital for social and environmental 
“goods.” The potential of social impact investing to bring new capital to devel-
oping economies, and to advance development using market principles, is 
well recognized (Picciotto 2015a; Social Impact Investment Taskforce 2014b).

Beijing langlang learning potential development Centre
In China, little attention has been paid to dyslexia, a learning disability that affects 10% of its children or roughly 15 million 
persons. Parents with dyslexic children at times blame schools for not teaching their children how to read and write properly. In 
response, teachers will often penalise children with additional homework, further exacerbating the problem. As a result, these 
children have a tendency to develop low self-esteem and lose the ability to fit in socially with their peers. While the Chinese 
government is conscious of this issue, treatment of dyslexia is presently not a high priority for the education sector.
Established in 2009 by Ms. Huang Lanzi, Beijing LangLang Learning Potential Development Centre (LangLang)  has grown to 
become the largest education centre to address this learning disability amongst primary school students in Beijing. As a social 
enterprise, LangLang aims to develop the industry standard for treating dyslexia, as well as assist children and parents overcome 
the technical, social and psychological difficulties associated with the condition. LangLang’s professional training and special 
programs have proven to yield positive results for students in less than one year’s time, reducing reading and writing barriers, as 
well as boosting self-confidence and self-expression. 
Furthermore, through helping parents and teachers develop a better understanding of the neurological condition, learn to 
recognize the symptoms, and administer proper treatment, LangLang has been able to increase public awareness of dyslexia. As a 
result, affected students are able to feel better understood and accepted by their peers and local community. 
In three years of operation, LangLang has established one main office in the Beijing and employs 20 professional Trainers. Over 
100 students have benefitted from the training courses in five schools, and have displayed significant improvement in their reading 
and writing skills. The company has also educated over 20,000 parents about dyslexia and how they create a better environment 
for their children with dyslexia.

A broad spectrum of investment instruments exists for investors who seek to make an impact. 
On one end of the spectrum are commercial investments, typically purely profit-driven and 
without any social purpose. On the other end of the spectrum is pure philanthropic giving 
by individual donors and foundations, which, due to its lack of financial accountability, 
generally does not solve the root of social problems. Traditionally, these two extremes have 
been considered mutually exclusive norms of capital deployment. Currently, however, many 
businesses are shifting away from narrow, profit-driven models to those with a greater focus 
on environmental and social issues. 
Corporate social responsibility, although not a new concept, is gaining traction in the 
mainstream marketplace as governments, consumers, and shareholders demand better 
products and conduct from companies. Interest in corporate social responsibility and its 
financial counterpart, socially responsible investing, have grown substantially. Socially 
Responsible Investment (SRI) and Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance 
(ESG) funds focus on large corporations who, as good corporate citizens, have engaged 
in corporate philanthropy, employee volunteering, promoting diversity, striving for carbon 
neutrality and improving supply chains.

Philanthropy, on the other hand, has been moving away from its traditional form as altruistic 
donations with no expectation of financial sustainability.

13 Philanthropy refers to donations of money, property, or work to service needy persons, by endowment to  
 institutions of learning and hospitals, and by generosity to other socially useful purposes.
14 Venture philanthropy is the philanthropic application of venture capital principles and practice; both donor  
 and grantee will focus on capacity building and measurable results. Donors give not only financial  
 resources, but also intellectual and human capital. This may include sitting on the boards of the non-profits  
 they fund. Funding is typically on a multi-year basis.

from $25.5 billion in 2013 to $35.5 billion in 2016, with survey respondents 
committing an average $8.5 billion per year between 2013 and 2015 (GIIN 
2016). 
Progress in the field has been supported by the creation of new net -
works, approaches and guidance, and standards and metrics (Jackson 2013). 
However, to date there has been a limited focus on evidencing impact and 
systematic, independent evaluation, increasing concerns about the validity 
of current measures and approaches to assessing social and environmental 
impact (Picciotto 2015a). There is a significant risk that sectoral standards 
of impact assessment focus more on marketing claims of impact rather 
demonstrable social change (O’Flynn and Barnett 2016); many key players 
are therefore calling for increased scrutiny of impact claims (Brest and Born 
2013). 
In a review of impact measurement initiatives emerging across the 
impact investing field, Flynn, Young, and Barnett (2015) identified a huge 
range of tools and approaches documented in the gray literature. The most 
prominent of these were the Impact Reporting and Investment Standards 
(IRIS) and the Global Impact Investing Rating System (GIIRS). The IRIS pro-
vides investors with a standardized menu of indicators ranging from jobs 
created through to sector specific changes; while the GIIRS sets out a rating 
system (guided by the IRIS) that can be used to assess companies, funds, and 
their portfolio companies in four key areas: governance, workers, community, 
and the environment.
While these approaches have moved the field forward in terms of 
metric standardization and reporting against output-level indicators, they 
have contributed little to our understanding of investment outcomes or 
impact. This can result, for example, in better measurement of the number 
of people employed by an organization but with limited, or no evidence, of 
the social value that these jobs create (Brest and Born 2013). Flynn, Young, 
and Barnett have concluded that while a wide range of tools and approaches 
exist, the predominant focus on metrics and rating systems concentrates 
on counting inputs and outputs rather than on establishing any meaningful 
understanding of social and environmental change through the measure-
ment of intended outcomes (Flynn, Young, and Barnett 2015; Jackson 2013). 
Moving forward, it is clear that a variety of methods and approaches will be 
required in order to effectively evaluate the diverse range of impact invest -
ments occurring in such a broad spectrum of operating contexts. Many of 
the design approaches, and both the quantitative and qualitative methods 
employed in public sector development evaluation, will add value, especially 
when considering the participation of a wider range of stakeholders within 
the evaluation process (Jackson 2013). 
THE NEW FRONTIERS:  
TAKING UP THE EVALUATION CHALLENGE
To this point, this chapter has considered recent global trends such as 
growing inequality, environmental threats, mass migration, and insecurity 
and conflict, and the international response to them. Over the past decade,
<<<PAGE=324>>>

302
however, evaluation, specifically in international development, has become 
a rather introverted field, with most effort focused on the inadequacies of 
methodology and the need for rigor in impact evaluation (Picciotto 2012). 
Certain methodologies have come to dominate the debate (spearheaded by 
work such as that of Duflo and Kremer 2003; Savedoff, Levine, and Birdsall 
2006; and White 2009), particularly because they offer an apparent certainty 
to (mostly Western) donors under pressure to demonstrate accountability to 
their national parliaments. This pressure to prove “demonstrable impact” has 
trickled down through the system, from the policies and procedures of donor 
agencies, through staff priorities and capacities, and onward through funding 
mechanisms to multilateral agencies, NGOs, researchers, consultancies, and 
so on. Much of the focus has been on selecting the best method, and in many 
cases this rests on an assumption that particular designs and methods are 
superior (a “hierarchy of evidence”).
4 The term “rigorous impact evaluation” for 
instance, has become synonymous with experimental and quasi-experimental 
methods, while definitions of “impact” are often limited to counterfactual 
notions of causal inference (Stern et al. 2012). Even those who take a broader 
view of evaluating impact are still primarily concerned with selecting the best 
method; although admittedly rather than focusing on the intrinsic superiority 
of one method over another, their focus has been on the appropriateness of 
methods in line with the evaluation purpose, the evaluation questions, the 
context, and the characteristics of the intervention (Stern et al. 2012).
Yet far less attention has been paid to the changing demands for eval-
uation—that is, who is now asking the impact questions, and what questions 
really need answering? Indeed, it is clear, as outlined in the preceding sec -
tions of this chapter, that evaluators are now operating in an increasingly 
rapidly changing and volatile environment; and they are facing complex and 
interrelated issues in which the traditional linear approaches are insufficient 
to describe the changes. Linear, cause/effect approaches to evaluation are 
insufficient to understand such complex interactions and the contextual vari-
ation that is influencing progress toward the SDGs (Befani, Ramalingam, and 
Stern 2015; Picciotto 2015b). Going forward, evaluation will need to draw 
on methods and approaches from further afield, including systems thinking 
and complexity science in order to support understanding of change in these 
circumstances (Barder and Ramalingam 2012; Ofir 2016). Monitoring and 
evaluation systems are required at the global, country, sector, and local levels, 
with a wide variety of evaluative approaches needed to assess achievements 
(Picciotto 2015b).
But are these new frontiers only about a methodological revolution—a 
new science for evaluation? In the next sections, we argue that while there are 
undoubtedly implications for methodology, much more is needed. Method -
ological innovation and adaptation is key to meeting the evaluation challenges 
4 Hierarchies are well established in the evidence-based policy tradition (e.g., 
evidence-based medicine), including the Cochrane Collaboration and Campbell Collab-
oration approaches to systematic reviews. In the development field, 3ie has taken this 
tradition on board.
<<<PAGE=325>>>
Chapter 18. New Frontiers for Evaluation in a Fast-Changing World  303
of the SDGs: these methodological challenges will require flexibility, creativ -
ity, and innovation. No one approach or method will be sufficient, and there 
will be no “gold standard” (Picciotto 2015a). In addition, it will require build-
ing partnerships within and beyond the evaluation community in order to 
support both the country-led focus of SDGs through capacity building (Ofir 
2016), as well as the new demands from a range of private and public actors. 
Indeed, the evaluation community should engage more effectively with the 
private sector, by promoting dialogue and mutual understanding, and increas-
ing the demand for evaluative products. There is some level of urgency here 
in order to avoid these roles being filled by management consultancies, audi-
tors, and accountancy firms, many of who have pre-existing relationships with 
investors or private companies, but limited experience in social (i.e., develop-
mental) and environmental impact evaluation.
5 
Finally, we conclude that the evaluation field needs to take on a more 
value-driven approach. The increase in private sector social investments 
and the associated lack of public accountability mechanisms necessitates 
a response from evaluators in order to promote transparency in claims of 
impact; to support inclusive evaluative processes; to stimulate demand for 
(and use of) evidence in decision making; and to include deliberation and 
accountability for, and by, citizens.
METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND ADAPTATION
The methodological challenges facing the evaluation field in this new era are 
multiple and varied. The reframing of global development goals represents 
a conceptual shift in our approach to addressing issues of poverty and 
inequality, as we move from thematically silo-based thinking toward a greater 
understanding and acceptance of the complexity of the issues being faced. 
Understanding issues such as resilience, working in fragile and conflict-af -
fected contexts, and meeting the requirements of private sector approaches 
will increase the complexity of evaluation in various ways, but all of them 
will challenge the reliance on results-based, linear, and experimental designs 
(Picciotto 2015a). We propose that four different responses will be required 
from the evaluation profession in the coming years: 
 n Methodological pluralism within coherent evaluation design
 n Systems thinking and complexity science
 n Increasing agility and flexibility
 n Capitalizing on the data revolution
Methodological Pluralism within Coherent Evaluation Design
Since the early 21st century, development evaluation has been character -
ized by a reliance on experimental and quasi-experimental approaches, 
5 As concluded in Clarke, Barnett, and van den Berg (2015).
<<<PAGE=326>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
304
with proponents declaring counterfactual logic the only valid approach to 
establishing causality (Picciotto 2012). However, limitations in experimental 
designs, and their inapplicability in a wide range of social and environmental 
contexts, have called this thinking into question, leading to increased interest 
in a broader range of evaluation designs and theoretical approaches to estab-
lishing causality (Stern et al. 2012). Today’s evaluators have an increasing 
set of methodologies and tools at hand. However, faced with increasingly 
complex operating environments, multifaceted programs, and interrelated 
issues, the challenge in coming years will be to become more experienced 
in the use of a plurality of methods within broader (and sometimes nested) 
evaluation designs. Indeed, our acceptance of mixed designs, combining dif-
ferent approaches to establishing causality; and our innovating in the use of 
contrasting methodological approaches, will be fundamental to our ability to 
effectively capture and understand impact. 
Systems Thinking and Complexity Science
Evaluators will also need to borrow from other disciplines in order to meet 
the challenges raised in the post-2015 era. The fields of systems thinking 
and complexity science are increasingly drawn upon by evaluators who are 
engaged in the challenging task of understanding “what works” in complex, 
dynamic contexts. The principles of these approaches are well-established 
in many fields, but relatively new to development evaluation (Befani, Rama-
lingam, and Stern 2015). There is still a significant amount of work to do to 
understand the applicability and appropriateness of different methodologies, 
and to adapt and develop the tools used across this incredibly broad field, 
whether as a heuristic device, or as more complicated forms of social sim-
ulation and agent-based modeling. Examples of the application of systems 
thinking and complexity science within evaluations are limited. Further real-
word testing of these approaches is critical to progress in this area (Befani, 
Ramalingam, and Stern 2015). 
Agility and Flexibility
Traditional public sector oriented evaluations can be a costly and time-con-
suming activity. Increased agility and flexibility will be essential in order to 
provide private actors with the information they require for decision making 
and learning. Within the impact investing market for instance, the current 
focus on lean systems presents a risk in terms of an overreliance on sim-
plistic numerical summaries.
6 Outcome-level evaluation is expensive and 
time-consuming, which may be why there are few examples to examine 
(Brest and Born 2013). Evaluators must work to identify cost-effective tools 
and approaches that are able to meet this demand while providing robust, 
6 This is a trend that mirrors the development of the microfinance sector more 
than a decade ago, when what could easily be counted obscured the need to capture 
nonfinancial (social) returns. See Foose and Folan (2016).

high-quality evaluative evidence. This may be partially achieved through the 
blending of M&E, the employment of continuous data-capture approaches, 
and considering real-time monitoring and evaluative approaches (Greeley, 
Lucas, and Chai 2013). 
Big Data and Social Media
Evaluators will also need to capitalize on the flourishing information and 
communications technology market in order to support increased agility in 
data collection and analysis. Mobile phone and smart technologies can enable 
people to communicate more easily, engage in dialogue, and contribute their 
opinions to evaluations. Technological innovation has also made it possible to 
generate data on difficult-to-reach populations, such as those in fragile and 
conflict-affected environments (Bamberger 2016). 
To date, there has been very limited use of social media and big data in 
international development evaluation, which has a greater focus on research, 
planning, and resourcing. When used appropriately, big data can increase the 
reliability of findings through the provision of huge data sets; facilitate data 
collection on sensitive topics and in difficult-to-reach situations; capture a 
range of stakeholder voices and empower vulnerable groups; support the 
evaluation of complex contexts and programs; and finally, play an important 
role in the dissemination of findings (Bamberger 2016). 
The digital data revolution has significant potential to provide cost-ef-
fective, real-time data, and hence to increase the pace at which information 
can be generated for decision making and learning. However, there is pres-
ently insufficient understanding of and practical experience in using these 
approaches in development evaluation. Continued engagement from the pro-
fession will be required to capitalize on these new opportunities. 
GOING BEYOND METHODOLOGY:  
BUILDING NEW PARTNERSHIPS
Methodological pluralism alone, while important, will not lead to a signif -
icant increase in the relevance and utility of evaluation in meeting current 
global challenges. Methodology has dominated the last decade of devel -
opment evaluation, but new demands will inevitably require evaluation to 
expand beyond the public sector and begin working more closely with the 
private sector, philanthropic foundations, and INGOs, with a stronger empha-
sis on dialogue within and between actors. Currently rooted in the public 
sector, the development evaluation profession is likely to have to expand its 
communication horizons; learn the language of the private sector and phil -
anthropic organizations; and develop the skills and experience required to 
interact closely with key stakeholders outside the public sector. It will also 
be important to communicate the experience, knowledge, and approaches 
developed over the last decade in a manner that the private sector finds 
engaging, and that demonstrates a clear value proposition (Jackson 2013). 
Several such attempts have emerged in recent years—for example, the Social 
Impact Investment Taskforce, the Wilton Park event on New Frontiers, and 
ImpCon, among others.
<<<PAGE=328>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
306
Promoting dialogue between evaluators and the private sector is key 
to building understanding and demand for evaluative products. As discussed 
earlier, there is presently a rather nascent demand for evaluative evidence, 
and a lack of clarity about the value evaluators might bring beyond more 
mainstream advisory services from management consultants and accoun-
tancy firms. Evaluators need to not only be open to and able to meet investor 
and business requirements: they must “do more than evaluate or critique…
they also have to become ‘field builders’ to demonstrate their approach and 
its value.”
7 A variety of new platforms and events are required to promote 
discourse on differences in language, expectations, challenges, and values. 
Within the evaluation sector, partnerships between developing, middle-
income, and developed countries will also need to support the building of 
evaluative capacity across the globe. The move toward country-led evaluation 
strategies precipitated by the SDG evaluation agenda will require a substan-
tial increase in national technical capacity, commissioning, and evaluation. 
THE NEED FOR VALUES-DRIVEN EVALUATION
The applied nature of evaluative inquiry means that findings should have 
a direct relevance to decisions, whether program decisions, policy changes, 
strategic changes in direction, or funding allocations. As stated by Patton 
(2014), “evaluation is something that informs action.” That is, it is a distinctive 
form of social science inquiry. The conclusions of an evaluation are expected 
to judge effectiveness, and to place a value on the subject of inquiry; hence 
they are of keen interest to stakeholders (Barnett and Camfield 2016). As 
such, the ethical responsibility of the evaluators extends beyond a focus on 
more traditional research endeavors, in which a “protection of respondents” 
(i.e., human subjects) predominates—in other words, a “do no harm” principle. 
Evaluation now has a perhaps heightened requirement, to also contribute to 
society (a “do good” principle) through deliberations on policy and resource 
priorities, as well as the associated focus on transparency, accountability, and 
participation. This requires evaluators to consider more carefully how evi-
dence and knowledge are created and made available and accessible, in a 
way that facilitates debate among more than just commissioners and immedi-
ate stakeholders (Barnett 2015).
In an emerging profession, where commissioners often have a signif -
icant, and sometimes unhealthy, stake in evaluation findings, maintaining 
independence is a continued challenge, especially where commissioners 
can exert significant control over the scope, methods, approaches, and 
outcomes of evaluation (Scott 2016). Furthermore, the growth of private 
sector and blended modalities in the international development field has 
given rise to heightened concerns over levels of accountability and trans-
parency. Unlike public sector funds, which are generally subject to rigorous 
evaluation and public scrutiny, many investors are primarily accountable to 
shareholders rather than the general public (O’Flynn and Barnett 2016). 
7 As concluded in Clarke, Barnett, and van den Berg (2015).
<<<PAGE=329>>>
Chapter 18. New Frontiers for Evaluation in a Fast-Changing World  307
The lack of widespread use of rigorous tools for the assessment of impact, 
combined with the real risk that the evaluative function is being overtaken 
by management consultants, financial advisors, auditors and so on, presents 
a fundamental challenge in establishing the validity of private sector impact 
claims. 
Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of clarity concerning how and to 
what extent citizens’ voices can and should be heard in the process of private 
sector evaluation (O’Flynn and Barnett 2016). Within the field of impact 
investing, for example, a shift toward capturing impact at the household or 
individual level could significantly contribute to the empowerment of those 
individuals affected, either positively or negatively, by social impact initia-
tives (Jackson 2013; Clarke, Barnett, and van den Berg 2015). However, a 
values-driven evaluation profession can, and it is argued should, take a more 
deliberate stance in addressing the trade-off between methodological rigor 
and ethical principles such as inclusion (Barnett and Camfield 2016).
CONCLUSION
In short, we argue that in this changing landscape—one of increased inter -
connectedness, uncertainty, and new actors—the evaluation field will need 
to both adapt methodologically and form new alliances and partnerships 
that transcend traditional development assistance. But even beyond this, we 
argue that evaluation has an ethical and value-based proposition: after all, 
evaluation is about “value” and “valuing” performance and impact. Evaluation 
can be about more than simply presenting evidence: it can be used to engage 
a range of very different interests, support inclusion, raise the voice of the 
marginalized, and “speak truth to power.” With the necessity of mobilizing 
private sector resources to reach the SDGs also comes an evaluator’s respon-
sibility to perform a new role in supporting transparency and accountability. 
For example, in the absence of traditional public accountability mechanisms, 
development evaluation can play a supportive role, alongside metrics and 
certification, to help hold the burgeoning private sector to account (Jackson 
2013). Other professions (accountants, management consultancies, auditors, 
certification bodies, etc.) are already addressing these emerging needs, but 
with less focus on the effectiveness, transformational change, participation, 
transparency, and accountability that a truly values-based evaluation profes-
sion could offer. Therefore, not only do evaluators themselves need to adapt 
to a changing world: they also have a role to play in helping citizens to adapt 
to globalization through the better use of evidence. This includes advocat -
ing for, and being part of, processes that hold public and private sectors to 
account for their performance and impact—not just in the short term, but 
also in longer-term consequences, both positive and negative.

Rising to the Challenges of  
Impact Evaluation - Insights 
from Piloting a Systemic and 
Participatory Approach
Adinda Van Hemelrijck
Abstract . This chapter reflects on the use and value of a systemic theory-based and 
participatory mixed-methods approach for addressing the challenges of impact eval -
uation in complex development contexts. A Participatory Impact Assessment and 
Learning Approach (PIALA) was developed and piloted with the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development in Vietnam in 2013, and in Ghana in 2015, that engages 
partners and stakeholders in assessing, explaining, and debating systemic impacts 
on rural poverty. An action research was conducted around the pilots to learn about 
the processes and mechanisms that make impact evaluations using PIALA rigorous 
and inclusive but also feasible. The study concluded that inclusiveness and rigor can 
reinforce each other, even more so at scale, with sufficient capacity. Methodological 
complementarity and consistency, extensive and robust triangulation, and cross-valida-
tion are important attributes. Investing in research capacity may help to reduce costs 
over time, while enhancing the value of impact evaluation and the uptake of its findings.

evelopment today takes place in globalized contexts of growing inequality, 
uncertainty, and instability, with new rising powers and an infinite number 
of conflicting issues and interests. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development calls for fundamental systemic changes, and adds demands for 
inclusiveness and sustainability to those of effectiveness, in order to eradicate 
poverty and inequality and protect our planet. Interventions, consequently, 
are becoming ever more complex, with stakes and stakeholders getting more 
diverse, influences more dense, problems more systemic, and outcomes more 
unpredictable. This complexity challenges the field of impact evaluation. 
Traditional counterfactual-based approaches are generally found to 
be too costly and difficult to pursue in complex environments, due to high 
causal density, spillover, time lags, and the unpredictability of events (Befani 
et al. 2014; Picciotto 2014). They focus too narrowly on specific intervention 
components, thus “leaving many evaluation questions unanswered” (White 
2014, 3). They also do not explain impact or assess its sustainability, given 
their focus on specific and isolated cause-effect relationships: therefore they 
cannot tell if, how, or why similar relations would or would not work else-
where (Picciotto 2014; Ravallion 2012; Woolcock 2013). Finally, engagement 
of and learning with partners and stakeholders is inhibited by scientific pro-
cedures, raising questions about inclusiveness and democratic value (Van 
Hemelrijck 2013a, 2017a). 
Alternative theory-based and complex systems approaches, on the 
other hand, tend to be time-intensive and to produce evidence that is not 
comparable across many cases;
1 therefore, they are not suitable for evalu-
ations with larger populations (a larger n) that require estimates of impact 
distribution (Beach and Pedersen 2013). In addition, those studies that allow 
for participation generally do not set out to rigorously assess causality and 
to address concerns of bias and rigor (Copestake 2014; White and Phillips 
2012). Chambers calls this “a strange omission, perhaps even a blind spot,” 
and refers to the Participatory Impact Assessment and Learning Approach 
(PIALA) in this respect as “part of what should be a wave of the future” 
(Chambers 2017, 108). 
PIALA was developed with the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD) between 2012 and 2015 in an attempt to address these 
challenges. IFAD is a United Nations (UN) agency that provides loans and 
support to governments for agricultural and rural development programs 
that aim at reducing rural poverty by changing smallholder production and 
market systems (IFAD 2016). These are generally medium to large-scale pro-
grams that aspire to create sustainable systemic or transformative change, 
and are implemented by public and private partners in often quite complex 
political environments. The PIALA initiative sought not to reinvent the wheel, 
but to develop a model that creatively combines existing designs and meth-
odologies (both quantitative and qualitative) in novel ways to rigorously 
assess such complex programs, and to bring participation in impact evaluation 
1 This is mostly because the cases themselves are not comparable.

to life (Guijt et al. 2013). Inspiration was drawn mostly from the theory-based 
(in particular, realist) and transformative (including rights-based) traditions 
(Holland 2013; Mertens 2009; Pawson 2013; Van Hemelrijck 2013a).
This chapter first describes what PIALA is and briefly presents the two 
IFAD pilots. It then discusses the main insights from the action research that 
was conducted around the pilots on how an impact evaluation using PIALA 
can be rigorous and inclusive. The chapter concludes with some reflections 
on the value-for-money of the approach, how rigor and inclusiveness may 
reinforce each other and generate greater value, and the key attributes and 
conditions for achieving this.
THE PARTICIPATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND  
LEARNING APPROACH
PIALA is a theory-based, mixed-methods approach that is essentially participa-
tory. It aims to enable stakeholders to see and learn about impact collectively 
and systemically, in order to bring about transformative change. It is most 
suitable for assessing the impact of medium to large-scale projects or pro-
grams that are targeting relatively large populations, in contexts where a 
conventional counterfactual approach is insufficient, difficult, or impossible 
to pursue. PIALA is not a specific research or evaluation methodology, but an 
approach that can embed any method and allows for a creative “mixed design” 
(Stern 2015) combining different evaluation traditions and methodologies, as 
long as its two overarching design principles—evaluating systemically and 
enabling meaningful participation—are maintained (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). 
These two principles allow for a flexible design, and make it possible for 
evaluators to adapt PIALA’s five methodological elements to the specific eval-
uation context and purposes. The five elements follow: 
 n A systemic theory of change (TOC) for visualizing the project’s 
causal claims, and engaging stakeholders in framing the evaluation 
and debating the evidence
 n Multistage sampling of/in “open systems” for enabling systemic 
inquiry across medium to large-size populations
 n Standardized participatory mixed methods for collecting, linking, 
and cross-checking the data in all sampled systems, in a systematic 
and comparable way
 n A two-stage participatory sense-making model for engaging 
stakeholders at local and aggregated levels in debating the emerg-
ing evidence
 n A configurational analysis method for assessing systemic change 
patterns and drawing conclusions about the distribution and magni-
tude of their impact across medium to large samples
As shown in figure 19.1, these five elements are designed and put to 
use in three consecutive phases: framing and focusing the evaluation; collect-
ing and linking the data; and analyzing and debating contributions. To further 
uphold the desired quality in the design and conduct of an evaluation for

achieving optimal value within the constraints of available resources, PIALA 
combines standards of rigor, inclusiveness, and feasibility. 
Methodological Elements
The systemic TOC approach forms the backbone for the entire evaluation. 
It is designed in the first phase of the evaluation process, by means of which 
the evaluation is focused and framed. It involves a process of reconstructing 
and visualizing a program’s impact pathways and change hypotheses, and the 
broader trends and influences, based on a thorough desk review and discus-
sions with key stakeholders. Unlike a classic program/project theory,
2 this 
approach uses an evaluative lens, assessing the hypotheses by looking back -
ward, from the envisioned impact back to the interactions and mechanisms 
that presumably have caused or influenced the impact (Funnell and Rogers 
2011; van Es, Guijt, and Vogel 2015). Moreover, it views impact from a sys-
temic perspective, resulting from changes in systems of interactions, rather 
than the direct and isolated relationship between intervention and effect. 
A systemic TOC approach is most useful for evaluating the changes caused 
by many different interventions, implementers, contributors, and funders, 
because it helps to create a shared understanding of complex pathways, and 
enables different stakeholders to critically engage in parts of the analysis 
(Van Hemelrijck 2013a).
2 A program/project theory is constructed from a management perspective, 
and is focused on strategy and performance looking forward, toward the delivery of 
planned results.

Multistage cluster sampling of/in open systems happens right after 
the evaluation focus and framing is agreed upon with the stakeholders, as part 
of the design for the second phase. Its purpose is to ensure sufficient repre-
sentation of the various populations, in order to enable the comparison and 
generalization of findings about systemic impact at the medium-to-large scale. 
If we want to learn about systemic impact, then the system should be the main 
level of analysis, and thus also the main sample unit (Lain 2016). In the case 
of government policies and programs, the system is generally too monolithic 
for a classic counterfactual comparison. However, by focusing on the lowest 
embedded open system at the local level (e.g., the local supply-chain system) 
that is entrenched in and affected by the larger system (e.g., the larger com-
modity value chain, and national policy framework), it is often possible to have a 
sample that is large enough to cover systemic heterogeneity, and to have large 
enough subsamples for statistical comparison. Contrasting evidence can then 
be obtained from the areas where program mechanisms are found absent, dys-
functional, or ineffective, rather than from predetermined control areas that are 
sampled external to the program (Van Hemelrijck 2017b). Multistage cluster 
sampling of these local systems, and of populations within these systems, is 
the most cost-effective method, as it substantially reduces costs and logistics 
compared to other random sampling strategies (Levy and Barahona 2002).
3 
The appropriate selection and mixing of methods to collect qualita-
tive and quantitative data on the different causal claims in the TOC is also 
part of the design of the second phase. The IFAD pilot in Ghana combined 
conventional household surveys for statistical poverty analysis; participatory 
methods for generic change analysis, livelihood analysis, and constituent feed-
back; SenseMaker for quantitative pattern analysis of perceptions; and key 
informant semistructured interviews for inquiring the larger system.
4 Methods 
are selected specific to the causal links in the TOC, and are used on an equal 
basis. They complement and build on each other analytically to enable the con-
struction of the actual causal paths with the data for each locality or sampled 
3 Random sampling is needed for statistical analysis. This depends on the eval -
uation focus. In an impact evaluation for Oxfam GB in Myanmar, for instance, PIALA’s 
sampling protocol was adapted to fit the specific evaluation focus and requirements, 
which did not require statistical analysis and thus also not a random sampling (Van 
Hemelrijck 2017a). 
4 Constituent Feedback (also called Constituent Voice) is a methodology devel-
oped by Keystone Accountability (http:/ /www.keystoneaccountability.org) for collecting 
quantified feedback and engaging in dialogue with key constituents or beneficiaries, 
using standardized metrics similar to the customer satisfaction surveys developed 
in the private sector, and descriptive statistics to produce visual data reports. Sense-
Maker is a software-based methodology developed by Cognitive Edge (http:/ /www.
sensemaker-suite.com) that facilitates mass ethnography and provides a way of nearly 
real-time mapping of social interactions and individual perceptions and motivations 
to inform adaptive management and policy formulation. It collects large amounts of 
self-signified micro-stories that capture people’s experiences and perceptions of past 
and future change in ways that enable us to identify emerging patterns of actions and 
decisions. The software permits statistical analysis at a very large scale.

system, mirroring the envisioned paths in the TOC. They also partly overlap, to 
permit triangulation. Systematic data collation and quality monitoring makes it 
possible to cross-check and link the data for building the causal paths during 
fieldwork in every locality, and to timely identify data gaps or weaknesses 
that need further inquiry before moving to the next locality. To enable com-
parison across the sample of systems as the basis for aggregating findings, 
the methods are more or less standardized. Yet they also remain sufficiently 
open-ended by including sensing tools such as causal flow mapping that can 
capture unintended effects and influences, and uncover broader dynamics 
that are interacting with the program (Van Hemelrijck 2015). 
Participatory sense-making occurs in the third phase of the process: 
analyzing and debating contributions. It involves half-day local workshops with 
30–50 participants (of whom 60–70 percent are intended beneficiaries) during 
the fieldwork in each locality, and a one or two-day program-level workshop 
with 100–130 participants (of whom over 30 percent are intended beneficia-
ries), shortly after finishing the fieldwork and before turning to the final analysis 
and reporting. The stakeholders participating in the workshops typically include 
decision makers, service providers, and intended beneficiaries. They proportion-
ally represent all the different perspectives necessary to cross-validate the 
evidence and inform the final analysis. They discuss the evidence together and 
assign value to observed contributions (among other influences) by comparing 
the actual causal paths revealed by the data with those hypothesized in the 
TOC. Participatory sense-making in all researched localities and at the aggre-
gated level serves to not only cross-check and strengthen the evidence, but 
also to create ownership, enable equal voice, and stimulate systemic learning. 
In essence, it makes an evaluation more democratic (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). 
Finally, the configurational analysis compares systemic change and 
impact across the sample of systems to reach conclusions about the dis-
tribution and magnitude of impact. Its tools are designed and put to use in 
the third phase of the evaluation process, after the sense-making. It employs 
elements of process tracing, contribution scoring, and cross tabulation, and 
involves four major steps. The first is the aggregated data collation in a 
standard Excel matrix format, in which all evidence from the field collation 
matrices as well as secondary sources is synthesized and tabulated alongside 
the TOC. The next step involves the clustering of the evidence across all the 
sampled systems to surface patterns or configurations of systemic changes 
and causal attributes. The third step involves the comparative analysis of 
similarities and differences in configurations for the specific mechanisms or 
parts of the system of interest (including cases with and cases without func-
tioning mechanisms).
5 The final step involves integration of the findings for 
5 Software such as EvalC3 can be applied to assess the conjuncture of different 
mechanisms and causal processes. This novel software, developed by Rick Davies, was 
piloted in an impact evaluation using PIALA for Oxfam GB in Myanmar (Van Hemelrijck 
2017a). The software helped to identify sets of causal attributes that are necessary and/
or sufficient for specific sets of outcome attributes to occur, and to compare and evaluate 
the performance of these causal models to find those with the greatest predictive power.

the different parts and mechanisms as the basis for validating (or refuting) 
the hypotheses in the TOC; zipping up the findings alongside the TOC; and 
drawing conclusions about the distribution and magnitude of the program’s 
contributions to impact (Van Hemelrijck 2016a, 2016b, 2017b). 
Quality Standards
To enable an evaluation to achieve optimal value with limited budgets while 
remaining true to the two core principles of systemic thinking and mean-
ingful engagement, PIALA also features a quality framework that includes 
standards of rigor, inclusiveness, and feasibility. 
Rigor is defined as the quality of thought put into the methodological 
design and conduct of the evaluation in a way that enables robust trian-
gulation of different methods and perspectives in order to defeat bias or 
dominance of a single truth; and to ensure both consistency and respon-
siveness to local contexts and conditions (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). Whereas 
mainstream evaluation practice defines rigor as the controlled avoidance 
of bias through statistical procedure, PIALA builds on the premise that bias 
cannot be avoided by a single method or procedure, but can be mitigated 
through systematic triangulation of different methods and perspectives 
(Camfield, Duvendack, and Palmer-Jones 2014; Carugi 2016; Mertens 2010).
Inclusiveness refers to the legitimacy of the ways in which people are 
engaged in the evaluation, and to the level of impartiality or inclusion of all 
stakeholder views and perspectives. This has intrinsic empowerment value 
but also contributes to the robustness and credibility of the evidence and 
thus to the validity of the findings (Chambers 2015; Pawson 2013). Validity 
is understood as the extent to which findings are well founded, based on 
robust evidence, and correspond with the reality of all stakeholders, in partic-
ular the populations affected by the project or program being evaluated. By 
embracing a wide range of stakeholder perspectives and ensuring their equal 
weight in examining the evaluation questions, the evaluation builds a more 
accurate systemic picture of impact. Meaningful engagement in constructing, 
analyzing, and debating this picture, on the other hand, enables equal voice, 
and contributes to empowerment (Chambers 2017). 
Feasibility concerns the budget and the capacity needed to meet the 
expectations of rigor and inclusiveness, and to enhance stakeholders’ sys-
temic and collaborative learning (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). The investment in 
building the capacity of in-country researchers, and in experimentation with 
novel mixed designs that stretch the limits of conventional evaluation prac -
tice, is critical for doing this at a larger scale. Considering feasibility as an 
explicit and intent-driven (rather than constraint-driven) quality helps to think 
of this investment in a positive way. Much remains to be learned about how 
to do it well. Excessive focus on limiting costs starves the evaluation of the 
oxygen it needs in order to deliver on rigor and inclusiveness and to maximize 
its value (Chambers 2017).

TWO IFAD EVALUATIONS THAT PILOTED PIALA
PIALA was piloted in the evaluation of two IFAD-funded programs: the Doing 
Business with the Rural Poor (DBRP) program conducted in one province in 
southern Vietnam,
6 and the Roots and Tubers Improvement and Marketing 
Program (RTIMP), which was conducted countrywide in Ghana. 7 Both were 
aimed at improving livelihoods and increasing food and income security by 
enhancing smallholders’ capacities to commercialize, and by linking local 
businesses to markets and industries. DBRP focused on developing diver -
sified short-value chain systems; RTIMP was concerned with developing 
much longer commodity chains, linked to national and export markets and 
industries (Guijt et al. 2014; Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015). Both 
programs essentially sought to create the mechanisms needed to facilitate 
rural peoples’ access to services, resources, and markets. 
Despite some important differences in the context and quality of the 
two evaluations,
8 both produced quite convincing evidence of program contri-
butions to the improvement of livelihoods as a result of the increased access 
to services, resources, and markets generated through these mechanisms. 
The RTIMP evaluation in Ghana, for instance, showed significant improve-
ments in roots and tubers-based livelihoods, with 15 percent of households 
increasing their incomes above $2 a day. Very weak or no improvement was 
found in supply chain areas where the RTIMP mechanisms were dysfunctional 
or absent. Although positive, the evidence also showed that these improve-
ments were rather limited, fragile, and susceptible to climate and market 
shocks, particularly for poor and vulnerable households, and in remote and 
marginalized areas. The improvements in roots and tubers-based livelihoods in 
Ghana occurred merely between 2009 and 2013, and in about 52 percent of 
the supply chain areas, or about half of the country. Moreover, no households 
gained profits above $4/day from roots and tubers, even though 61 percent 
6 The DBRP was implemented from 2008 to 2014 in two provinces (Cao Bang 
and Ben Tre), with a total budget of $51 million, including a $36 million loan from 
IFAD. The evaluation Guijt et al. 2014) was conducted in 2013 at a cost of $90,000 in 
Ben Tre province only, where the project was implemented in 50 of 164 communes in 
eight of nine districts. 
7 The RTIMP was implemented from 2007 to 2015 as a national program in 106 
of 216 districts, spread across all 10 regions countrywide, with a total budget of $24 
million, of which $19 million was financed under an IFAD loan. The evaluation (Van 
Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015) was conducted countrywide after project comple-
tion in 2015, at a cost of $233,000, and covered the post-midterm review period from 
2010. 
8 Although the evidence suggested strong connections between all observed 
changes, confidence in causal inference remained relatively weak in the Vietnam eval -
uation. In this first PIALA pilot, data collation, cross-checking, and quality monitoring 
was not yet done systematically with the TOC as a backbone structure. Confidence in 
inference and generalizability was much stronger in the second pilot in Ghana because 
of its systematic and multilayered triangulation and cross-validation procedure (Van 
Hemelrijck 2015). This is further discussed in the next section of this chapter.

of the households had invested in roots and tubers businesses. Access to 
new seeds and farming technologies had initially led to a boom in production 
across the country, triggering a spillover into processing. Adoption of new 
processing technologies, though, remained limited in 83 percent of the cases, 
partly due to limited investment capital. By and large, the finance mechanism 
put into place by the program proved inaccessible, as it required pre-invest -
ment without short-term capital return, posing high risks for smallholders 
(Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015). Both in Ghana and in Vietnam, poor 
and vulnerable households ran considerable risks by engaging in value chains 
and accessing markets (Guijt et al. 2014; Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 
2015). These risks were left largely unmitigated due to inadequate market 
linking and forecast that otherwise could have helped avoiding the observed 
local market saturation and monopolization; and inadequate poverty tar -
geting that should have made the support services and mechanisms more 
inclusive and sustainable (Van Hemelrijck 2016a). Recommendations for how 
to address these issues in similar IFAD-funded programs and projects were 
made by these two evaluations.
KEY INSIGHTS FROM THE PILOTING
As mentioned earlier, the PIALA initiative was conceived as an action research 
to inquire into the conditions, processes, and decisions affecting the rigor 
and inclusiveness of the two pilots. The action research combined multisited 
ethnography with cooperative inquiry, and involved extensive reflections with 
researchers and participants in the two pilot countries, as well as feedback 
sessions with global experts at IFAD headquarters (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). 
Insights from the first pilot (in Vietnam) helped to better address the chal -
lenges in the second pilot (in Ghana) (Van Hemelrijck 2015). This section 
summarizes some of the key lessons learned.
Creating Ownership of the Evaluation
In order to create ownership, key stakeholders need to be sufficiently 
engaged in the framing and focusing of the evaluation. Ownership implies 
that the evaluation is wanted, legitimized, and enabled by a shared sense 
of responsibility for its success. Ownership also enables participation in the 
analysis, and facilitates learning and greater uptake of evaluation findings 
and recommendations (Burns and Worsley 2015; Patton 2011). In the case 
of PIALA, stakeholders are engaged in the framing and focusing of the eval -
uation through a process of reconstructing and visualizing the TOC (Van 
Hemelrijck 2015). 
In Vietnam, insufficient time and budget was spent on this process, 
which affected the rigor and inclusiveness of the approach during the entire 
evaluation. A brief workshop was organized with the program steering com-
mittee and managers to discuss program logic and expectations. The process 
of reconstructing and visualizing the TOC, however, happened after the work-
shop, and independently of the evaluation design. Evaluation questions did 
not focus on the causal links and assumptions in the TOC, which made it

Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
320
difficult for the researchers to relate the evidence back to the TOC and arrive 
at greater precision in causal analysis. Furthermore, limited ownership of the 
TOC by the stakeholders hindered their critical engagement in sense-making 
and contribution analysis (Van Hemelrijck 2013b). 
Learning from the Vietnam pilot, the TOC process was made a priority 
and a key deliverable in Ghana. The researchers organized a design workshop 
to discuss the TOC and design options, and to determine the focus of the 
evaluation together with key stakeholders. The investment in a more robust 
and collaborative TOC process bore fruit and laid the foundation for attaining 
greater quality throughout the entire evaluation, resulting in stronger evi-
dence and ownership of findings (Van Hemelrijck 2015, 2016b). 
Deciding on the Scope and Scale of the Evaluation
Scale refers to the size of the sample of the primary sample unit. In the case 
of PIALA, this was the lowest embedded “open system” that the program 
sought to change, to generate impact. Scope refers to the various com-
ponents and mechanisms of the system that the evaluation should cover. 
Generally speaking, the larger the scale, the more relevant the findings for 
reporting and advocacy will be. Using participatory mixed methods at scale, 
however, is challenging, and requires sufficient capacity and resources. When 
research capacity is weak, more resources are needed for training, coaching, 
and supervision in order to uphold quality (Van Hemelrijck 2015). 
Three relevant design options are available for designing an impact eval-
uation: full scope–limited scale, limited scope–full scale, and full scope–full 
scale.
9 When choosing a full scope–limited scale design, the emphasis is on 
learning about the project’s total contribution to impact in select cases, under 
specific conditions. Fieldwork and analysis are less resource-intensive, given 
the relatively small sample sizes. Yet evaluation findings will not be general -
izable for the entire population: therefore they are less useful for influencing 
policy decisions.10 With a limited scope–full scale design, the purpose is 
to assess the effects of one or two particular aspects or mechanisms of 
the project. The TOC is not strictly necessary in order to conduct such a 
narrow study, but skipping the TOC process may risk missing out on systemic 
understanding, leading to flawed conclusions. Components are studied in iso-
lation, which does not permit analysis of systemic interactions. For example, 
a cost-effectiveness study of Farmer Field Forums (FFF) in Ghana recom-
mended a scaling-up, as the adoption of new technologies had proven the 
success of this mechanism. The PIALA evaluation, however, showed that in a 
9 A limited scope–limited scale option is not really relevant for impact evaluation, 
as it limits the possibility of causal analysis through classic counterfactual comparison, 
frequency statistics, and/or triangulation and cross-validation of sources and methods.
10 This does not hold true if the project/program itself is implemented at a 
limited scale (small n), in which case larger within-samples and more stringent triangu-
lation and cross-validation procedures will take up the resources needed to attain the 
required level of rigor for generalization.

period of weak economic growth, this success in fact contributed to market 
saturation, which negatively affected livelihoods across the entire country 
(Van Hemelrijck 2015; Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015). 
In Vietnam, a choice was made for a full scope–limited scale design, 
but with disparate scales for the different methods. To save resources, par -
ticipatory methods were employed only in a subsample drawn from the 
sample of villages where the statistical household surveys were conducted. 
The assumption was that this would be sufficient to conduct a full scope 
inquiry of contributions to impacts on rural poverty for the entire program 
area. However, it generated a disparity in the data sets that caused problems 
for their subsequent linking. While participatory data on causes and contri-
butions came from only a few villages or cases, survey data on household 
impact were more widely distributed and not related to the specific cases or 
villages covered by the participatory methods. This hindered causal inference 
(Van Hemelrijck 2013b).
In Ghana, by contrast, a conscious choice was made to employ all 
methods in the same sample and at the same scale. The three design options 
were discussed with clients and commissioners before any procurement or 
design work was started, giving them a basic understanding of the cost and 
value of each.
11 As the future Ghana Agriculture Sector Investment Program 
(GASIP) was expected to scale up most of the RTIMP mechanisms, the evalua-
tion was found necessary for both reporting and learning. The commissioners 
therefore chose the most comprehensive design: full scope–full scale. This 
implied six weeks of uninterrupted fieldwork—much longer and far more 
intensive than the pilot in Vietnam, where fieldwork took only two weeks. The 
budget was tighter than in Vietnam because of the larger scale and scope, 
but quality was upheld by a competent research team (Van Hemelrijck 2015; 
Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015). 
Deciding on the Counterfactual
Mainstream impact evaluation assumes that comparative analysis of evidence 
from both treated and nontreated locations is feasible and necessary in order 
to assess causality and reach generalizable conclusions about impact on 
rural household poverty. However, in most “real-world” evaluation contexts 
(Bamberger, Rugh, and Mabri 2012), it is very difficult and costly to arrive 
at an accurate assignment of locations to specific interventions and identify 
credible control groups. The challenge occurs, for instance, in cases of unex -
pected or uncontrolled project expansion and/or spillover, combined with 
high causal density of other interventions and influences. In such contexts, 
it is difficult to discern project from nonproject localities, and to find the 
right matches (Woolcock 2009). In addition, the open systems that form the 
principal sample unit in PIALA generally do not have clear boundaries such 
as villages or other administrative units have. Hence the identification and

matching of control units for these systems and subsampling of various pop-
ulations from these systems, if even possible, requires fieldwork prior to the 
evaluation that substantially increases both costs and risks (Chambers 2017).
In the Vietnam pilot, comparative analysis of treated and nontreated 
units was considered both possible and necessary for assessing house-
hold-level impacts, and the village was thought to be the best proxy unit 
for investigating the short value chains developed by the program. These 
assumptions were flawed and compromised in terms of analytical rigor, 
making it difficult to generalize the findings, for three important reasons. 
First, without a clear definition and identification of the value-chain systems, 
and thus without having sampled proper proxies based on such a definition, 
it was difficult to relate the data on changes in capacities, institutions, and 
livelihoods to the specific value chains and to assess the causal links. Second, 
the matching of treated and nontreated villages was based on variables that 
applied to the village as a unit, not to the value chains, again making it diffi-
cult to relate the difference revealed by the data to the interventions. Finally, 
the high heterogeneity in program delivery and incoherence in its value-chain 
linking efforts, further conflated by the high causal density of other programs 
and influences in the villages, made it impossible within available budgets to 
obtain credible control data (Van Hemelrijck 2013b). 
Learning from this experience, in Ghana much more work was done 
to understand and define the principle sample unit. In the evaluation design 
workshop, the decision was made not to waste resources on identifying and 
inquiring control groups of households, but instead invest all in the systemic 
inquiry of the four main commodity supply chains developed by the program 
(gari, plywood cassava flour, high-quality cassava flour, and fresh export yam). 
These commodity chains comprised medium to large amounts of supply 
chains spread over the entire country. The supply chains are loose catchment 
areas comprising clusters of communities of smallholders supplying the raw 
produce, and small enterprises or off-takers acting as “supply chain leaders” 
and manufacturing higher-value products for bigger markets. The supply 
chains were not entirely homogeneous, as they interacted and overlapped. 
Hence they often differed in reality from what was sampled on paper. Ensur-
ing that the data collected on these systems remained comparable required 
much creativity and coordination. Furthermore, no reliable lists of households 
and beneficiaries were available for the subsampling of farmers, processors, 
and households within the catchment areas of the sampled supply chains. 
Identification and matching of control units and sampling of households thus 
would have required extensive pre-evaluation fieldwork, and the sponsors 
and other participants in the design workshop voted against this. Instead, 
a configurational analysis method, which uses heterogeneity in the sample 
of systems as the basis for counterfactual analysis, was developed. Supply 
chains with different systemic configurations of treatments and causal attri-
butes were randomly sampled (with probability proportional to size) from the 
four commodities’ supply chain populations. The samples were large enough 
to include supply chains with dysfunctional or absent program mechanisms 
that could serve as a “natural” counterfactual (Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Men-
sah 2015).

Maintaining Independence
In order to avoid positive bias, field mobilization of research participants is 
best undertaken independently from project management. 12 When research 
participants suspect that the research is not independent, they are more likely 
to over- or underreport. On the other hand, they are unlikely to trust outsid-
ers who are not authorized and formally introduced by their leaders. Thus, 
for the researchers to organize fieldwork at scale and mobilize participants 
without any help from the program, they need to be good at logistics; know 
the areas and local customs; and be able to obtain authorization and introduc-
tion in ways that do not affect their independence. In contexts where this is 
not possible, strong facilitation skills are needed to minimize undue influence 
or interference (Van Hemelrijck 2015; Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015).
The challenges encountered in Ghana were quite different from those 
in Vietnam. In both pilots, though, participants trusted the researchers’ autho-
rization and independence, which made them feel safe about expressing 
their views and critically engaging in the group inquiries. In Vietnam, field 
research cannot be conducted without government permission and interfer -
ence. Hence, in the DBRP evaluation, local transportation and mobilization 
was organized by local officials and program staff, which was highly efficient, 
but challenging in terms of independence. Local leaders and program staff 
were quite collaborative during fieldwork but omnipresent. The researchers 
artfully managed to maintain sufficient distance, though, and to safeguard 
the privacy of the focus groups (Van Hemelrijck 2013b). 
In Ghana, the researchers took care of the transportation and mobili-
zation entirely by themselves but without prior notification or engagement 
of the local officials, allowing for much greater independence. Staff and offi-
cials were present only at the discussions to which they were invited. This, 
however, made them more suspicious of and resistant to the evaluation. Also, 
the scale of the fieldwork, the remoteness and spread of the communities, 
the large distances to travel over poor roads, and the difficulty of finding 
safe and trusted locations for convening people from different communities, 
made the field inquiries quite onerous. Independence thus came at a substan-
tial effort and cost in Ghana, but compromise in both rigor and inclusiveness 
was avoided (Van Hemelrijck 2015; Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015).
Contextualizing Poverty Analysis
To make it possible to say something about a program’s influences on poverty, 
data on those influences, and on poverty, need to be linkable. Also, poverty has 
to be defined in ways that are relevant to the specific context and conditions 
of the villagers in the program area. In both of the IFAD pilots, a Participatory 
Rural Appraisal (PRA) ranking tool was used for identifying locally relevant 
12 According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 
“independence” implies an evaluation process that is transparent, independent from 
project management, and free from political influence or organizational pressure 
(OECD DAC 2010, 25).

characteristics of wealth and well-being, and assessing changes in relative 
poverty status (Van Hemelrijck 2015). This tool helped create a shared under-
standing among the participants of their wealth and well-being as the basis 
for a causal flow-mapping exercise of the changes they had experienced. It 
also enabled cross-checking and linking of the participatory data with the 
household survey data on poverty. 
The characteristics of wealth and well-being that were obtained from 
the participatory ranking exercise, however, were not used to design the 
household survey. For this, the participatory data collection should have hap-
pened prior to the evaluation, which would have increased the cost of the 
evaluation. It is unclear if, and to what extent, this might have generated more 
rigorous findings on poverty impact, and therefore have justified the extra 
investment. 
In Vietnam, the survey focused only on IFAD’s generic poverty indica-
tors, and used the purely income-based, absolute poverty categories of the 
Vietnamese government. These proved inadequate for assessing changes in 
poverty status related to the program. Learning from this, greater efforts 
were made in Ghana to ensure that the household survey questionnaire was 
sufficiently attuned to the program context and to on-the ground realities. 
Poverty characteristics corresponding with IFAD’s poverty indicators were 
selected from the Ghana Living Standards Survey 2009–14 for assessing 
the households and computing the categories of poverty status (applying 
a proxy means test and principal components analysis). And here, no major 
differences were found between the characteristics obtained from the par -
ticipatory ranking exercise and those used by the household survey (Van 
Hemelrijck 2015; Van Hemelrijck and Kyei-Mensah 2015). 
Arguably, greater rigor could have been obtained in the findings on 
poverty distribution and impact in Ghana if the questionnaire had asked about 
household characteristics in much greater detail. Yet more lengthy surveys 
cost more, and also increase the risk of fatigue and gaming on the part of 
both respondents and researchers (Chambers 2008; White 2015). Therefore, 
in both Vietnam and Ghana, the duration of the household survey was kept 
to a maximum of no longer than 20 minutes. Also the time length of the par-
ticipatory group discussions were limited to a maximum of two hours (Van 
Hemelrijck 2015). 
Thus, instead of spending more resources on collecting and analyzing 
participatory poverty characteristics, or more fine-grained quantitative data 
on household characteristics to identify poverty categories prior to the eval -
uation, in Ghana the choice was made to keep the poverty analysis short 
and instead create room for participation that was more meaningful to the 
participants. This is what Chambers (2017) calls “appropriate imprecision.” The 
group-based causal flow mapping exercises were found particularly useful by 
the participants, as it helped them to recall and understand the changes from 
a systems perspective, and enabled them to engage in collective sense-mak -
ing with other stakeholders. The assumption is that this contributes to the 
ability of people to understand and navigate the system within which they 
are operating, and thus to their empowerment (Burns and Worsley 2015; 
Merrifield 2002).

Dealing with Power and Bias
All methods are susceptible to bias, and biases may occur in every phase 
of the evaluation, from the design to the analysis. Participatory methods, 
however, are considered more vulnerable than traditional survey-based 
methods, as they collect perceptions, meanings, and interpretations instead 
of hard numbers. Yet surveys generating hard numbers are also designed and 
conducted by human beings with value judgments (Camfield, Duvendack, and 
Palmer-Jones 2014; Copestake 2014; White and Phillips 2012). Survey ques-
tionnaires tend to reflect the assumptions of the designers, while qualitative 
interviews and participatory inquiries make room for the assumptions of the 
researched. Both may result in desirability or courtesy bias: the researched 
tell the researchers what they believe is expected from them (Chambers 
2017; White 2015). To overcome such bias, the PIALA evaluations employed 
participatory mixed methods in a way that enabled extensive and systematic 
triangulation of different methods and perspectives, and cross-validation of 
the findings at scale.
13 
Scale, however, can also create bias, as it requires standardization 
that tends to reduce participation to power-blind procedure (Gaventa and 
Cornwall 2006; Mosse 2001). In both pilots, attempts were made to avoid 
this by carefully thinking through how to arrange and facilitate the group 
processes in order to equal out power imbalances, and by using tools that 
inherently empower people (Van Hemelrijck 2015). Visual tools were used, 
such as causal flow and relationship mapping, that enable participants to see 
how data is constructed, and to flag where things are flawed. Appropriate 
group composition further helped outnumber those who tend to dominate 
and empower those with less-heard voices, by means of majority or what 
Chambers (2017, 102) calls “the democracy of the ground.” Of course there is 
always a danger that more powerful and influential participants will dominate 
the discussions. Additionally, there is internalized power: the social norms 
and values that make certain groups believe in and accept their subordination 
and “voicelessness” (Kabeer 1999). Good facilitators know how to overcome 
this, and how to “empower through behaviour and attitudes” through careful 
listening and sharp observation of motives and interactions (Chambers 
2017, 122). The researchers in Vietnam and Ghana were trained in this, and 
13 Triangulation is a principle social science technique that involves the use 
of more than one type of information or data source, method, and even theory and 
researcher, for the purpose of crosschecking in order to overcome weaknesses and 
biases and thus obtain greater credibility of and confidence in findings (cf. http:/ /www.
betterevaluation.org/en/evaluation-options/triangulation). In PIALA, this goes beyond 
merely verifying findings: it values different views and perspectives and crosschecks 
them to build a rich and comprehensive picture of the change processes as the basis for 
identifying and checking all plausible explanations for causality. Cross-validation in the 
case of PIALA is understood in “realist evaluation” terms as the practice of (dis)confirm-
ing findings across multiple independent inquiry cases to strengthen the explanatory 
power and the confidence in the conclusions about causality and contribution (Pawson 
2013).

provided with detailed guidance on facilitation for each of the participatory 
methods and tools (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). 
Rigor then emanates from the combination of good facilitation, and 
systematic triangulation and cross-validation (Chambers 2017). For the latter, 
a strict procedure was developed, involving six essential steps: 
1 . Quasi-standardized data collection, using at least two different 
methods per type or area of change in the TOC, and each with a 
minimum of two different sources or groups of people
2 . Daily reflections on the quality of the processes by which each 
of the methods was used, and of the quality of the data generated 
by these processes
3 . Triangulation of the data from the different methods and sources, 
and identification of data gaps and weaknesses, through systematic 
data collation alongside the TOC, and scoring of confidence in the 
emerging evidence, followed by additional data collection, if and 
where needed, to address the gaps and weaknesses
4 . Participatory sense-making of the evidence in each locality 
together with the local stakeholders, to address remaining gaps 
and contradictions, and to cross-validate initial findings
5 . Aggregated collation and crosschecking of all of the evidence 
and scorings obtained from all the localities
6 . Participatory sense-making of the evidence at the aggregated 
level together with local and program-level stakeholders, to 
cross-validate initial findings for the entire program area, and to 
value program contributions to impact
In Vietnam, this procedure was not yet fully developed, and was found 
challenging by the researchers. The researchers, most of whom came from 
a quantitative research background, struggled with triangulation as a way to 
compile a multiperspective picture, and they were unable to uphold a daily 
practice of critical reflection on quality and process. Moreover, the tools and 
guidance for the data collation and quality monitoring proved insufficient 
(Van Hemelrijck 2013b). 
In Ghana, by contrast, the researchers had a mixed background and 
substantial experience in participatory research. Data collation and quality 
monitoring were undertaken daily and systematically. A standard set of ques-
tions guided the daily reflections on inclusiveness of the processes, and the 
quality and sufficiency of the data, and a standard table structured around 
the causal claims and links in the TOC was used for data collation and tri-
angulation (table 19.1). Methods were tightly focused on the causal links, 
making the triangulation much more straightforward and systematic. A Likert 
scale rubric was used to score the relative strength of emerging evidence 
for each of the causal links in the TOC. Since they were better equipped to 
handle large amounts of data, these researchers were able to finish the data 
collation, and to identify data gaps and weaknesses in each locality in good

time, and to be well prepared for the sense-making workshops (Van Hemel -
rijck 2015).
Deciding on the Scale and Level of Engagement in the Sense-
Making
Participation in evaluation is purely extractive if the findings are not returned 
to the participants and there is no opportunity for them to contest and debate 
them (Gaventa 2004; Mohan and Hickey 2004). Using PIALA’s sense-making 
model, six village-level workshops with 180 participants, and one provin-
cial-level workshop with 100 participants were organized in Vietnam. In Ghana, 
there were 23 district workshops with 650 participants, and one national 
workshop with over 100 participants. The participants in the workshops were 
sampled purposively from the research participants (Van Hemelrijck 2015). 
The outcomes of the participatory sense-making were twofold. First, an 
additional layer of detail and confirmation of evidence was obtained from the 
cross-validations in the local and aggregated workshops, adding to the rigor 
of the evidence, and thus to the validity of the findings. Second, shared own-
ership was created of both the evidence and the findings, which contributed 
to the evaluation’s inclusiveness and empowerment value. Having participated 
merely in data collection, people walked into the workshops knowing and 
owning little: but they left the workshops with a comprehensive picture of 
the systemic changes and the issues that the evidence had revealed, as well 
as of stakeholders’ various perspectives on these.
14 Critical to the success of 
the participatory sense-making was both the scale of the workshops, and the 
way in which they were designed and facilitated. Special competencies are 
required particularly for doing this at scale. When operating with low capacity 
and on a shoestring budget, the amount and size of the workshops may need 
to be trimmed, at the expense of both rigor and inclusiveness (Van Hemelrijck 
and Guijt 2016). 
A truly participatory sense-making process implies the equal and active 
engagement of all stakeholders. Dynamic environments were created, long 
presentations by experts were banned, and the various types of evidence 
were made available in accessible (including visual) formats. Small-group dis-
cussions were held, ensuring that people felt “listened to” rather than just 
“talked at” (Newman 2015). Beneficiaries constituted more than 30 percent of 
the participants in the provincial and national workshops, and 60–70 percent 
in the local workshops, giving them sufficient weight in debates with decision 
makers and service providers.
15 
14 The survey and reflections held at the end of each workshop revealed a 
high degree of satisfaction among the participants, and of the knowledge and insights 
gained by them that they found useful for future individual or collective action.
15 Their group must be larger in the local workshops because they form the 
primary target group of the project at the local level, while at the aggregated level the 
primary targets are policy makers and service providers.

Lessons learned from the Vietnam project helped to improve the 
sense-making model for Ghana. In Vietnam, discussions took place mostly 
in mixed-stakeholder groups, and in plenary sessions, which did not give the 
farmers enough of a chance to collect their thoughts and gain confidence. 
Learning from this, participants in Ghana first worked in peer groups orga-
nized around the part of the TOC that represented their “patch” in the supply 
chain system—for instance, farmers discussed the production part of the 
chain. In Vietnam, the reconstruction of the causal flow was done in plenary, 
which again did not offer sufficient opportunity for farmers to engage in the 
process. In Ghana, this was done in small mixed groups, organized around 
geographic areas, with the farmers and processors systematically given 
the floor first, before all others, to present their views. Plenary discussions 
took place only on the second day, in a fishbowl set-up, in which beneficia-
ries constituted the majority of the discussants. This was quite successful 
and provoked an animated discussion with bankers about the inaccessibility 
(thus failure) of the microenterprise credit mechanism put into place by the 
program (Van Hemelrijck 2013b, 2015).
CONCLUSION
The action research around the two IFAD pilots have demonstrated that a 
participatory and systemic impact evaluation approach such as PIALA can 
produce rigorous, valid, and credible evidence that is useful for reporting 
and learning with partners and stakeholders, in contexts where traditional 
counterfactual analysis is not feasible. Moreover, the pilots have shown that 
using similar methods engaging beneficiaries in assessing and debating con-
tributions to impact can contribute to enhancing the impact even ex post. 
Moreover, using similar methods and processes for collecting, cross-check -
ing, and analyzing data in the two impact evaluations made it possible to 
compare and identify conclusions, and to formulate recommendations that 
have wider relevance for investments elsewhere, thus are beyond the individ-
ual programs in question.
Compared to the usual cost of theory-based, mixed-methods impact 
evaluations in countries like Vietnam and Ghana, these pilots were done with 
shoestring budgets. For example, the estimated budget for a one-year ran-
domized controlled trial study in an IFAD-funded program in Ghana similar to 
the RTIMP was around $200,000. But this study only covered one subcompo-
nent of the program, and eight districts in the northern part of the country. 
The PIALA evaluation of RTIMP, by contrast, cost $233,000 and covered the 
entire program, which consisted of three components, each of which had two 
or three subcomponents. Moreover, it covered 30 districts across the entire 
country (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). 
In every evaluation that aims for greater value with limited resources, 
trade-offs occur. The PIALA pilots have demonstrated that these trade-offs 
can be turned into win-wins by carefully considering how rigor and inclusive-
ness can reinforce each other, and by critically reflecting on the potential loss 
in value-for-money if one were to be prioritized over the other (Van Hemel -
rijck and Guijt 2016). Limiting stakeholder engagement in the TOC process
<<<PAGE=353>>>
Chapter 19. Rising to the Challenges of Impact Evaluation - Insights from Piloting a Systemic and Participatory Approach  331
to save time and resources, for instance, leads to a substantial loss of rigor 
in every phase of the evaluation. Conversely, reducing the scale and level of 
engagement in sense-making limits the cross-validation and thus confidence 
in the conclusions, while also reducing the inclusiveness and empowerment 
value of the evaluation (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). Reducing the sample size 
of the participatory inquiries, as to reduce the cost, not only limits the scale 
of participation and thus its impact on voice, empowerment, and ownership 
of the findings (Burns and Worsley 2015), but also thwarts rigorous causal 
inference. On the other hand, reducing the scope inhibits conclusion validity 
by confining the systemic analysis and thus the understanding of complex 
nonlinear impact trajectories (Woolcock 2009). 
The most essential conclusion from the action research around the 
PIALA pilots is that inclusiveness and rigor can reinforce each other, and that 
this is even more likely to happen when participatory processes and methods 
are employed at a larger scale (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). People’s participation 
in impact evaluation can contribute to their understanding of the system in 
which they are functioning (Burns and Worsley 2015), while also adding to 
the rigor and credibility of findings, if
 n It is both inclusive and meaningful, enabling a robust cross-checking 
of many different authentic voices; 
 n It avoids the dominance of any single truth, power, or particular 
viewpoint, thus mitigating bias; and 
 n It creates space for solid debate and equal voice, including the 
voices of those who are the least powerful and least heard (Van 
Hemelrijck 2016b).
Scale achieved through rigorous sampling and representative inclusion 
of all stakeholder perspectives makes it possible to generate knowledge that 
supersedes isolated anecdotes. Moreover, it also makes it possible to build 
contrasting evidence from “natural counterfactuals” occurring in the sample, 
thus reducing doubt in causal inference. Rigor emanates from the thoughtful 
design and facilitation of the participatory processes at scale, in ways that fore-
stall the dominance of a single truth or viewpoint and enable stakeholders to 
participate equally and meaningfully in the process. Other essential attributes 
of rigor are methodological complementarity and consistency, and extensive 
and robust triangulation and cross validation (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). 
Critical to the quality of delivery at scale, clearly, is the capacity of the 
researchers. In the long run, investing in such capacity helps to reduce costs, 
while enhancing the value of impact evaluation. For the broader development 
sector, this implies building capacity through providing guidance and support 
to new experiments with approaches like PIALA (Van Hemelrijck 2016b). For 
IFAD and its partners, optimizing value-for-money would imply, for instance, 
using PIALA as a longitudinal approach integrated with program design. This 
would create more room for building local research partnerships and capacity 
for impact evaluation, while bringing quality, continuity, and consistency to 
IFAD’s impact learning agenda at the national and global levels.

Evaluating Mitigation Projects 
through a Theory of No Change
Takaaki Miyaguchi
Abstract . Some have argued that, compared to climate change adaptation interven-
tions, evaluating climate change mitigation (CCM) projects is relatively straightforward, 
due to the fact that there can be a clear, quantifiable goal regarding a reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions. However, many donor-funded CCM projects do not seem 
to focus on output-based contributions, but rather on removing certain preconditions 
toward such market transformation. A program theory concept known as the Theory 
of No Change (TONC), put forth by Christine Wörlen, provides an evaluation frame-
work that is especially applicable to such CCM project interventions, and can serve 
as a useful tool in assessing how likely (or not) it is that interventions will achieve 
a market transformation. With close reference to the TONC evaluation framework, 
this chapter identifies and analyzes eight different CCM projects, from five different 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Important findings from this analysis include the 
following: almost all the projects studied addressed barriers of ignorance and lack of 
expertise for all agent groups (consumers, supply chain, policy makers, and financiers); 
none of the projects has specifically addressed the barrier of cost effectiveness; and 
only a few projects specifically focus on harnessing the interest and/or motivation of 
relevant agent groups.

T
he adoption of the Paris Agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties 
(COP21), held in Paris in 2015, has marked an important milestone 
for the international community to unanimously tackle climate change. 
Although the emergence of the inward-looking Trump administration in the 
United States has aroused concerns worldwide, the international community 
needs to remain vigilant and not lose the focus on its fight against climate 
change. The Earth’s climate is indeed changing, and addressing the cause of 
the problem is of prime importance and significance for all human beings. 
Climate change mitigation (CCM) is defined as “human intervention to reduce 
the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.”
1 In other words, mit-
igation mainly concerns measures and actions that reduce greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) by realizing and applying more energy-efficient, or renewable, energy 
technologies and practices. Although adaptation and loss and damage are 
both important and interlinked climate change concepts, CCM interventions 
are the most vital element in solving the root causes of climate change, as 
well as in transforming markets toward more carbon-neutral products and 
services.
This chapter discusses, among other issues, the CCM strategy of the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for its CCM programs that 
are funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and implemented in the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, the types of bar -
riers against realizing CCM contributions and market transformation in these 
countries, and how these barriers correspond to the types of barriers that are 
introduced in the Theory of No Change (TONC) framework. 
The rationale for selecting the ASEAN countries as a test case to apply 
a TONC program theory framework is that in these countries we have seen 
robust and steady economic growth over the past decades, with, on average, 
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.0 percent between 1970 and 1995 
(ASEAN Secretariat 2014). The region’s recent GDP of 2012 was $2.3 trillion, 
which was equivalent to 28 percent of China’s GDP, and to 4.3 percent of 
the world’s total GDP, while their population has grown to 617 million in 
2012 (ASEAN Secretariat 2016). The importance of realizing green growth, 
or low-carbon growth, in these vibrant economies should be emphasized. 
The kinds of CCM projects analyzed are those utilizing funding through 
the GEF. The GEF started its first pilot operation in 1991, and, as of 2016, 
is the largest funder of projects for protecting the environment in the world 
(GEF 2016). The GEF is a partnership involving a number of so-called imple-
menting agencies, and UNDP and the World Bank are among the largest 
implementers of environmental projects supported by the GEF. GEF Council 
approvals of UNDP proposals, for example, have amounted to up to roughly 
40 percent of the available funds for commitments up to 2017 (GEF 2016).

agency—are analyzed. The chapter attempts to identify potential gaps within 
the CCM strategies and the types of barriers being addressed in each of 
these projects so that we will be able to generate an analytical picture of 
more effective CCM projects, upon which to build better and more effective 
strategies in addressing CCM issues not only in the ASEAN region, but also 
elsewhere in the world.
THE THEORY OF NO CHANGE
In several communities of practice on evaluating climate change and devel -
opment, evaluating climate change interventions has been considered to be 
quite difficult compared to, for example, analyzing interventions in the public 
health sector, for a number of reasons. For example, the following challenges 
are posed when evaluating climate change projects: a long time frame, uncer-
tainty about actual climate change patterns and their effects in a given locale, 
shifting baseline data and changing contexts, measuring nonevents, a lack 
of universal indicators, contribution versus attribution, and diversity of key 
definitions and terms (Bours, McGinn, and Pringle 2014). As part of the effort 
to develop a more useful and effective evaluation framework to be applied in 
climate change interventions, Uitto and other scholars have emphasized the 
importance of utilizing a theory of change (Uitto 2014; Vaessen and Todd, 
2008). A theory of change aims to make sure that the underlying assump-
tions through which desired changes are triggered and realized are made 
explicit, by highlighting the contextual conditions that may influence the out-
comes or results of the interventions (Funnell and Rogers 2011; Weiss 1998). 
The theory of change is an important component of program theory, which 
is “an explicit theory or model of how an intervention, such as a project, a 
program, a strategy, an initiative, or a policy, contributes to a chain of inter -
mediate results and finally to the intended or observed outcomes” (Funnell 
and Rogers 2011). The theory of change is thus considered to be a useful 
approach in evaluating complex international development projects and inter-
ventions (Center for Global Development 2006).
However, when it comes to CCM interventions, an otherwise useful 
theory of change approach does not necessarily tend to help render the rela-
tionship between interventions and outcomes explicit. This may be due to 
the fact that most of the CCM interventions funded and implemented by 
donors thus far have tended to focus on improving the enabling environment 
or “preconditions”—that is, they were more input-based than output-based. 
This tendency is represented by the concept of barrier removal. In many 
of the donor-funded projects, the focus is on the removal of certain types 
of barriers, which are believed to be preventing a society from achieving a 
market transformation and becoming carbon-neutral. In reflecting on these 
issues, Wörlen has proposed a “Theory of No Change,” with which one is able 
to “assess whether or not an intervention has been contributing to a more 
favorable framework for market development for a sustainable energy tech-
nology” (Wörlen 2011). Instead of looking at a specific causal relationship 
between inputs and outputs or outcomes, which is done with the help of a 
theory of change, TONC looks at whether certain CCM interventions have

Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
338
met necessary preconditions: that is, whether or not they have the right input 
framework to be able to remove barriers for a market transformation in a 
society. If some of the necessary preconditions are not being addressed, then 
the TONC hints at the possibility of “no change.” That is, it posits that no posi-
tive causal change is likely to occur through CCM interventions. In this chapter, 
the TONC concept is adopted as a test case, to apply to the evaluation of 
CCM projects of several ASEAN member countries. 
METHODOLOGY
Identified Projects
To test the TONC concept, a total of eight CCM programs were selected. 
These projects were implemented by UNDP, were already completed, and 
were ASEAN member countries. The project titles were as follows; see 
table 20.1 for a summary of these projects:
 n Industrial Energy Efficiency Improvement Project in Malaysia 
 n Biomass-based Power Generation and Co-generation in the Malay -
sian Palm Oil Industry in Malaysia
 n Removal of Barriers to Biomass Power Generation and Co-genera-
tion in Thailand
 n Integrated Microhydro Development and Application Program in 
Indonesia
 n Palawan New and Renewable Energy and Livelihood Support 
Project in the Philippines
 n Efficient Lighting Market Transformation Project in the Philippines
 n Energy Efficiency Public Lighting Project in Vietnam 
 n Promoting Energy Conservation in Small and Medium Scale Enter -
prises in Vietnam 
The primary document sources used for this analysis were project doc-
uments (ProDocs) and terminal evaluations of the identified projects. The 
ProDoc is the official, finalized document that lays out important project 
implementation information as background analysis of the target country, its 
development objectives, planned activities, schedules, budgeting information, 
and so on. By evaluating the ProDoc of each of the identified projects, the 
types of barriers intended to be removed or reduced against market trans-
formation within the countries, as well as targeted sectors and stakeholders 
through which such transformation is believed to emerge, were analyzed. 
ProDocs thus provided important information about project activities and 
interventions that were being implemented through the respective projects. 
It is also envisaged that, depending on the status of project formulation and 
implementation, applying an analytical lens (in this case using the TONC 
concept) to ProDocs can be a good meta-evaluation exercise. 
The second type of source for this analysis was terminal ex post evalu-
ations, prepared and submitted by independent evaluators upon operational 
closure of the respective projects. Based on this source, how the implemented

interventions had addressed various barriers and different stakeholders was 
systematically analyzed.
Analytical Framework
In most of the GEF CCM projects, the concept of barrier removal is prevalent. 
This concept is based on the assumptions that: (1) market transformation 
toward a more sustainable and energy-efficient society has been prevented 
because of various types of barriers that exist in many areas, for various agent 
groups; and (2) transformation of markets occurs when these barriers are 
reduced or removed by various interventions or activities proposed in the 
interventions.
The main framework used for analyzing the types of barriers mentioned 
and targeted by each CCM project is called a TONC, as described above. The 
argument based on this concept is that when the preset types of barriers are 
not being addressed by project interventions, it can cause the possibility of 
generating “no change” toward transformation of market and achievement of 
CCM objectives, in the case of reduction of GHG emissions. 
The theory of change concept presents useful guiding paths toward 
the achievement of intended results. But the TONC presents the lack of such

paths: as such, it is able to provide useful insights into whether or not project 
interventions are contributing to building a specific enabling environment 
toward achieving the intended results. When certain interventions are found 
not to be addressing the types of barriers prescribed by TONC, they can be 
thought of as not being prone to realizing the desired market transformation.
The TONC concept presented by Wörlen was only tested for CCM proj-
ects that deal with retail products and heating systems, and she has pointed 
out the need for further research in applying this concept to other fields and 
cases (Wörlen 2011). This meta-evaluation is one such attempt to apply the 
TONC concept to CCM projects that go beyond these fields. 
According to Wörlen (2011), the following seven common types of 
barriers, against which the TONC concept is to be applied, are introduced:
 n Ignorance . A number of the agent groups may not know the bene-
fits, or even the existence, of specific CCM technologies or products.
 n Lack of expertise . The different agent groups may lack the exper -
tise to operate and maintain the technologies and the products.
 n Lack of access to technology . The technologies and the products 
used may be too expensive, or not readily available in the domestic 
market, due to insufficient capacity along the supply chain, or a lack 
of financing.
 n Lack of motivation . The status quo, traditions, or stereotypes may 
continue to prevail as a source of resistance toward new technolo-
gies and products.
 n Lack of cost effectiveness . Running the technologies may become, 
on a total cost of ownership basis, more costly than other tradi-
tional energy and technology choices.
 n Lack of affordability . Such technologies often require large initial 
investment or upfront costs; a lack of financial support from a host 
government or commercial banks can therefore represent a barrier.
 n Lack of demand/business model . It is necessary to generate 
enough demand in realizing the economies of scale for the supply 
or the financier’s side, as well as to develop innovative and finan-
cially robust business models by business owners, especially in 
small and medium enterprises. 
All these types of barriers can be addressed against the four agent 
groups Wörlen introduces: (1) consumers/users; (2) supply chains (such as 
shops and maintenance technicians); (3) policy makers; and (4) financiers. 
Table 20.2 shows the TONC barrier types and relevant agent group types.
Conducted Analysis
This meta-evaluation consisted of two sets of analyses. One was to map the 
types of barriers and addressed agent groups for each project, by referring to 
the respective ProDocs. This analysis is designed to see which activities had 
been planned for implementation and, consequently, which activities did not 
take place because they had not been planned. The second analysis concerns
<<<PAGE=363>>>
Chapter 20. Evaluating Mitigation Projects through a Theory of No Change  341
the respective terminal ex post evaluations in order to collect and analyze 
the evaluative evidence of the activities that were implemented (or were not). 
First, in analyzing the ProDocs of the eight projects, the barriers 
addressed were categorized according to the seven barrier types described 
above.2 Second, by analyzing the ex post evaluations, the author codified 
the reports by assigning and counting positive (+) or negative (-) evaluative 
remarks (or mentions). This was not simply based on the assigned ratings 
within the evaluations (i.e., highly satisfactory, satisfactory, marginally satis-
factory, and unsatisfactory). For example, whenever there was a remark that 
suggested a corrective word, for example “better,” “necessary,” or “needed” 
action, it was counted as negative. Most of the recommendations offered 
within the evaluations were also treated as negative (using keywords such 
2 There are two modifications that have been made by the author to the original 
TONC barrier types, i.e., inclusion of consideration of renewable energy sources such 
as biomass sources to the barrier of lack of access to technology, and addition of 
innovative policy models to the barrier of lack of demand/business model. These barri-
ers were further assigned to the equivalent agent groups—i.e., consumer/user, supply 
chain (e.g., shops, maintenance technician, and those stakeholders engaged in business

as “should” or “recommended”). This was based on the assumption that rec -
ommended actions referred to things that should have taken place during 
the project implementation phase but had not. And of course such directly 
associated negative terms as “difficult,” “risky,” “poor,” “not properly,” etc., were 
noted as negative remarks. Similarly, when assigning positive remarks, the 
author not only referred to the ratings within the evaluation sections, but 
also paid close attention to the remarks related to the assessed project con-
tributions, for example with such terms as “valuable,” “important,” “vital,” “key,” 
“success,” and the like.
One must note, however, that since only evaluators’ remarks were cod-
ified, this analysis did not assign any value where there were no planned 
activities. If there was no remark by the evaluator, even though the project 
may have missed an important barrier entirely, that element was simply left 
without any attribution, either negative or positive. 
The second type of analysis was done without attempting to assign 
different degrees of positive-ness or negative-ness: that is, the author catego-
rized the remarks, regardless of the strength or weakness of the adjectives 
into simply either “positive” or “negative.” The author of this chapter is keenly 
aware of the fact that such way of “quantification” cannot be considered a 
robust quantitative analysis. What was intended was a sort of qualitative 
analysis to discover otherwise unheeded patterns by applying a specific set 
of analytical lens, that is, the TONC framework. 
Findings and Discussion
Table 20.3 summarizes the results of the two types of analyses conducted: 
(1) the types of barriers addressed by each CCM project, and the involved 
agent group type against such barriers, plotted as against those prescribed by 
TONC concept; and (2) the frequency of either positive or negative evaluative 
remarks identified in each ex post evaluation.
Through this analysis and comparison, several important findings were 
discovered.
Ignorance and lack of expertise barriers . With some exceptions, almost 
all of the projects studied addressed the barriers of ignorance and lack of 
expertise for all agent groups where their implemented interventions cover 
as much as 88 percent of all the cells assigned to this barrier type. This may 
be due to the fact that UNDP, the implementing agency of these projects, is 
a development agency that emphasizes and focuses on technical assistance, 
especially through capacity development, be it through government (policy 
makers) or industries (depending on the project, but mainly for supply chains). 
Looking at the high frequency of positive remarks for the implemented inter-
ventions addressed to these barriers, one can say that overall, the projects’ 
intention of increasing a level of awareness and expertise among industries 
and hard infrastructure), policy makers (e.g., government agencies and line ministries), 
and financiers (e.g., commercial banks and investors).

has been well realized. However, an interesting gap identified here is that 
although the agent group of consumers is covered by all the projects for 
ignorance barrier (i.e., for awareness raising), only a few projects address the 
issue of raising expertise or capacity for consumers/users. While it seems 
relevant to focus on those agent groups who have direct contact or business 
relations, such as supply chains and financiers, providing capacity develop-
ment to consumers/users can arguably complement other project activities 
in raising expertise. 
Cost-effectiveness barriers . Throughout the eight projects, only Thailand’s 
biomass project seems to have specifically addressed this barrier, which has 
become visually obvious thanks to the TONC framework, where only 13 
percent of this barrier’s activities (cells) aimed at different stakeholders was 
implemented. On top of raising awareness and developing expertise, the 
issue of a total running cost, or a total cost of ownership basis, is significant 
when one tries to contribute to long-term, sustainable market transformation 
within a country. Such issues may have been considered by UNDP as “external 
risks” to the implemented CCM project interventions, for example, influence 
from fossil fuel subsidies, or the high cost or price of the technologies them-
selves. Nonetheless, the cost-effectiveness barrier seems to be an area that 
should be addressed more consistently in the design of future CCM projects. 
Lack of interest/motivation . Another interesting gap is seen in the lack of 
interest/motivation barrier. Although the barrier of ignorance is universally 
addressed by all of the projects, when it comes to harnessing interest or 
motivation, there are only a handful that specifically incorporated these ele-
ments in project design, and in related implemented activities. Although it is 
acknowledged that the awareness-raising component in each project does 
include certain activities for harnessing interest and motivation, there seems 
to be a lack of emphasis on going beyond the level of simple awareness, 
and toward motivation and induced actions therefrom. For example, letting 
commercial banks know about the technologies and their financial feasibility 
is one thing, but actually inducing their interest and increasing their motiva-
tion for creating a proactive behavior/culture can be quite another. Such a 
potential systemic lack of focus toward this barrier is reflected in the fre-
quency of negative evaluation remarks as well. For example in the Efficient 
Lighting Market Transformation Project in the Philippines, even after trainings 
had been conducted to raise awareness and expertise within the private and 
government banks, at the end of the project, none of them had provided 
loans for energy-efficient lighting. This surely was reflected negatively in the 
evaluation. (This activity component was given a rating of unsatisfactory.)
Policy maker agent group  . When one looks at the interventions imple-
mented by the agent groups, it becomes clear that the agent group of policy 
makers (e.g., government agencies and line ministries) does not seem to be 
well covered under such barriers as lack of (fiscal) affordability, interest/
motivation, and business/policy model. The issue of fiscal or jurisdictional
<<<PAGE=367>>>
Chapter 20. Evaluating Mitigation Projects through a Theory of No Change  345
affordability of certain policies and regulations, as with the case of the fossil 
fuel subsidies for the cost-effectiveness barrier, may be considered to be 
“external” to the range of project activities. For example, a country’s ministry 
of environment may not have jurisdiction or authority over non-environmen-
tal matters, such as financial ones, or those related to taxation/subsidies; 
however, creating cross-sectoral policies and active interministerial collabo-
ration for establishing a development goal within a country still seems to be 
an important area for project intervention. Also related, policy makers who 
are involved with the CCM projects may not be interested or well motivated 
to devise innovative policy packages, or to collaborate with other ministries. 
Moreover, there may be an issue of power balance between an implement -
ing agency (such as UNDP) and an executing partner (such as a government 
and its line ministries). Since government counterparts are one of the most 
important “clients” of implementing agencies, trying to force them to go 
outside their comfort zone of siloed political jurisdictions can well be a sys-
temic challenge for the implementing agency. All in all, the barriers pertaining 
to policy makers can be an important gap that needs to be filled by future 
CCM design and implementation. 
Lack of demand, business/policy model . When analyses of project design 
documents (through ProDocs, as black dots plotted according to the TONC 
framework) and terminal evaluations are combined, a very strong tendency 
has been revealed in the barriers addressing the lack of demand, and the busi-
ness/policy model. In short, for these barriers, much has been implemented 
but much has also failed. This barrier area has had the largest frequency of 
negative evaluative remarks, yet with relatively a high percentage (63 percent) 
of intervention coverage. Activities are indeed happening: however, one can 
estimate that, due to rigidity of the business and policy models prescribed by 
the projects, this barrier area overall has been mostly a failure. 
CONCLUSIONS
The theory of change, though itself a useful concept in evaluating programs, 
often is not an applicable concept in the case of donor-funded CCM project 
interventions. This is because often the proposed activities do not by them-
selves generate GHG emission reduction, but instead are aimed at removing 
certain existing barriers to realizing a market transformation within a country, 
such as awareness, market, technology, policy, and finance-related barriers. 
The TONC concept was proposed by Wörlen (2011) as a theoretical frame-
work for identifying important barriers that were not being tackled in a 
project’s activities. Thus TONC can be a useful tool when evaluating project 
design (through ProDocs) and implementation (through terminal evalua-
tions), as well as the development impact of such projects. 
As a test case, a meta-evaluation was undertaken to apply the TONC 
concept to eight CCM projects that were implemented by UNDP in and 
with ASEAN member countries. The main objective was to apply the TONC 
concept to different CCM projects tested by Wörlen, and to find out what

346
kinds of implications can be drawn through analyzing the projects’ barrier 
removal strategies. 
Though obviously limited in its analytical depth, by focusing on the 
TONC-prescribed types of barriers and key agent groups, it was possible 
to systematically see the institutional weak spots, and the biases found in 
project design. The TONC analytical framework has thus proven to be a 
useful tool for enabling a zoomed-out analysis of CCM project design. It can 
also help identify and facilitate the necessary actors and agencies before 
project implementation. When combined with ex post evaluation analysis 
similar to the one conducted here, the TONC framework can also be a useful 
tool for summative evaluation about the addressed or unaddressed barriers 
and interventions of CCM projects. This type of TONC-applied analysis, when 
accumulated for projects elsewhere, can serve as important reference for 
future CCM project design and implementation.

The Wicked Cases of Education and 
Climate Change -  
The Promise and Challenge of 
Theory-Based Impact Evaluations
Emmanuel Jimenez and Jyotsna Puri
Abstract . To make progress in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of 
the 2030 Agenda, policy makers need to know what works to move the needle of the 
169 targets, and then to act on that knowledge. While more is known now than when 
the Millennium Development Goals were set, there are still important gaps regarding 
the measured attributable impact of interventions on outcomes. This paper focuses on 
two key goals—education and climate change/environment—to illustrate the gaps in 
what has been learned and what still needs to be learned. It assesses why these gaps 
persist, and how future evaluations might address them.

T
he role of evaluation in helping the world make progress on the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development is well argued by other chapters 
in this volume, as well as by many other thinkers. But it is not enough to 
monitor indicators: countries also need to know which policies, programs, 
and other interventions will be effective in moving the 169 indicators of the 
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to which they have committed.
1 
Indeed, in asking for accountable institutions in Goal 16, the SDGs themselves 
underscore the importance of evaluation. 
One key tool in this arsenal is evaluations that address the issue of 
attribution convincingly. Theory-based impact evaluations do so through 
methodologies that measure the effectiveness of interventions by posing a 
counterfactual question: that is, what would have happened without the inter-
vention? In answering this question, they also answer other questions that are 
important for both donors and implementers to consider: Did the program 
or policy make a change (and how do we know if it did)? How much was 
that change? Would the change have occurred anyway, in the absence of the 
policy? Could it have been done better? Why did the change occur? 
Theory-based impact evaluations measure causal change that can be 
attributed to an intervention, and use a prespecified theory of change to 
guide their hypotheses and to explain change. Good theory-based impact 
evaluations usually have the following components: a theory of change; 
pre-analysis plans; variables that are measured as objectively as possible, 
using survey data both at the baseline and end line; good pilots and forma-
tive work; a good understanding of outcome(s); SMART
2 indicators; good 
monitoring data and information on implementation fidelity; a good identifi-
cation strategy; sufficient data size for statistical confidence; and high-quality 
analyses that mitigate a multitude of possible biases that may creep in over 
and above the bias of program placement and selection. 
In this chapter, we investigate the present state of evidence and argue 
that theory-based impact evaluations provide a potential partial solution to 
answering the critical questions that the SDGs are asking. We show that every 
year many more of these evaluations are being published than ever before. 
We also discuss the limitations of current methods employed in theory-based 
impact evaluations, and argue that there are important gaps in the knowledge 
base in terms of topics and methods that need to be filled if we are to accom-
plish the goals of the 2030 Agenda in an evidence-based way. 
We take a deep dive into two sectors to assess both the opportunities 
and the limitations for theory-based impact evaluations. Arguably education 
and environment are sectors that have posed what are termed “wicked” prob-
lems for evaluators (see, e.g., Levin et al. 2012). Interventions in these sectors

resist a single solution because they are applied differently in different con-
texts. Moreover, the solutions are temporary while they address complex 
problems that require the use of multiple interventions simultaneously 
(Schwandt et al. 2016). We discuss how theory-based impact evaluations 
have tackled these issues and where gaps remain.
IMPACT EVALUATIONS: TRENDS AND EVIDENCE GAPS 
The number of theory-based impact evaluations has risen dramatically in the 
past 20 years. Figure 21.1 shows just one indicator—the number of theo-
ry-based impact evaluations of development interventions that are published 
per year and that take the counterfactual adequately into account. Figures 
are derived from the 3ie repository,
3 which was initially analyzed by Cameron, 
Mishra, and Brown (2016) and are currently being updated. In 1995, there 
were fewer than 50 studies being published per year; by 2015, there were 
almost 500 and the repository contained more than 4,500 publications. While 
these figures need to be considered in light of publication lags, they include 
working papers in the gray literature that have shorter time frames between 
when the data are collected and when the results become available. 
These numbers alone do not tell us anything about the need or demand 
for evidence. After all, there are untold hundreds of thousands of public and

ations of development interventions.

private programs in more than 150 lower- and middle-income countries in 
the world. But they can be used as possible indicators of where glaring gaps 
may exist.
Geographic Gaps
Even with these promising global trends, the density of evidence from rig-
orous impact evaluations varies widely across countries. Indeed, this is borne 
out in figure 21.2, which maps countries where studies included in the repos-
itory were conducted. 
Figure 21.2 shows that countries in Asia (especially the largest coun-
tries, China and India), and parts of Latin America (Brazil, Mexico) and East 
Africa (particularly Kenya and South Africa) have more theory-based impact 
evaluations than others. This does not mean that these countries need fewer 
theory-based impact evaluations in the future. In fact, in terms of size of the 
economy and population, these countries may continue to need many more 
evaluations (e.g., the number of evaluations per 10 million people in China is 
about the same as that in Russia; it is more in India but half that of Brazil). But 
it does show that there are some regions that lag. There are extremely few 
(none in many countries) evaluations in West Africa, Middle East and North 
Africa, and Central Asia, the Pacific countries as well as the poorer countries 
in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The relatively uncovered regions are sites of fragile and conflict states 
(FCS), where populations are the most vulnerable. Only about 8 percent of 
published evaluations were done in FCS countries, and almost half of those 
were in just two countries—Pakistan and Zimbabwe.

These geographic gaps pose a significant challenge for the 2030 
Agenda, which is a global action plan: all member countries of the United 
Nations have committed to it. Yet for many there is a remarkably small evi-
dence base that can attribute improved outcomes to interventions.
Thematic Gaps
The majority of all published impact evaluations are in four sectors: health, 
education, social protection, and agriculture. Again, this is not to say that 
these sectors are saturated and have no further need for more evidence. 
But it does point to the key sectors that are consuming vast amounts of 
public and private expenditure, but are not being evaluated. For example, 
according to Miranda, Sabet, and Brown (2016), there are very few published 
theory-based impact evaluations in environment and separately in the energy 
sectors. To put this in perspective, India’s public sector budget allocates a 
significant portion its budget to energy, and the World Bank has devoted 
16 percent of its loans to it as well (World Bank 2016).
Arguably one reason for this lack of impact evaluation-related evidence 
may be the lack of demand in the sector. Indeed in several sectors, the ques-
tions examined by impact evaluations have traditionally not been considered 
important.
4 How much impact does a road make? Do protected areas reduce 
deforestation? Do climate change programs work to reduce greenhouse 
gases (GHGs)? Do children learn once they enroll and attend school? These 
are all examples of questions that have, until recently, not been considered in 
time-consuming and resource-intensive evaluations. 
Another possible reason for this disparity is that it is believed that it 
is much more difficult to apply popular techniques of theory-based impact 
evaluations in some sectors, such as national infrastructure investments, or 
public finance policy, or practices of good governance, than in other sectors, 
where the interventions are smaller, easier to isolate, and have identifiable 
possible counterfactual (or comparison) populations. If so, the question is 
whether rigorous techniques can be developed to address key issues that 
obviously have huge implications for human welfare. Such efforts would have 
to take into account several other reasons why such knowledge gaps persist 
across sectors. For example, there may be disincentives for political economy 
reasons, for evaluating already scaled-up investments in sectors like trans-
port, where large amounts of capital, both political and monetary, may have 
already been sunk (Ravallion 2016).
Aside from the density of evidence across broad sectors, there are 
gaps in thematic areas that are also of programmatic interest. For example, 
Puri et al. (2014) found that there were fewer than 50 studies of human-
itarian assistance, into which the world has pumped over a trillion dollars. 
Another report found a single impact evaluation study in the governance 
4 We use the phrase “impact evaluations” and “theory-based impact evaluations” 
interchangeably. Indeed, we do not believe good impact evaluations can be undertaken 
without good theories of change.

352
and transparency of natural resource management in low- and middle-income 
countries (Puri 2017). Another concern is that in many impact evaluations, 
the costs of interventions are not analyzed. These trends present huge chal -
lenges for informing a comprehensive, global SDG agenda that encompasses 
almost all sectors in promoting people, planet, and prosperity. 
Distributional Gaps
Increasingly, more questions are being asked not only about the overall 
effects of interventions, but also of their effects on specific groups such as 
women and girls, vulnerable ethnic groups, the very poor, and so on. But the 
number of studies that have done such deep distributional analysis is also 
relatively low.
This gap holds even for sectors where there are more impact evalua-
tions. For example, one of the findings of a recently completed systematic 
review by 3ie of what works in education is that while studies reported on 
the average effects on all children, “…[few] studies included in the review 
provided any analysis of sub-populations, including factors such as sex or 
socio-economic status” (Snilstveit et al. 2016a, 14). A large part of this is 
driven by the fact that ensuring that impacts are measured with high sta-
tistical confidence for underrepresented groups means that the statistical 
samples need to be much larger.
 In another study we estimate that in one 
case, in order to ensure that results were representative for men and women, 
the sample sizes needed to quadruple (because women are traditionally 
underrepresented in some economic sectors), which meant a concomitant 
increase in costs (Puri, Rathinam, and Sarkar 2017).
IMPACT EVALUATIONS:  
CHALLENGES OF RELEVANCE AND METHODS 
As the number of impact evaluations have risen, researchers have learned 
more about their limitations and how to address them.
The Challenge of Responding to Questions Important for 
Policy Making
Arguably, theory-based impact evaluations answer several questions that are 
important for policy making: Does the intervention work? How much? For 
whom? But sometimes they are just not the right instrument to answer the 
question. Nowhere is the latter point more salient than when researchers try 
to fit the question to the method. Simply identifying the underlying theo-
ries of change is a complicated enough undertaking, and adding the overall 
requirement of having the measure attributable to change becomes a daunt-
ing task (see, e.g., box 21.1).
The other question is to what degree should research be responding 
to policy, and whether research is important for its own sake. Theory-based 
impact evaluations tend to lie at the intersection of research and applied work 
(see, e.g., Puri, Rathinam, and Sarkar 2017). We argue that impact evaluations

BOX 21.1 The use of impact evaluations in the evaluation of large, 
complex climate change programs: How can theories of change 
help?
Aided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO), the government of Paraguay is implementing a program to alleviate 
poverty and help reforest a large part of eastern Paraguay and increase 
the resilience of approximately 62,000 people. The proposal is to imple -
ment cross-cutting programming that meets both mitigation objectives 
(725,000  tons of carbon dioxide mitigated annually) and adaptation objec -
tives (an expected direct increase in resilience and a reduction in poverty 
for 62,000 people). This three-phase program is spread out over 10 years 
and supports components such as environmental conditional cash transfers, 
cook stoves, and agroforestry programs for households. It aims to simul -
taneously improve the legislative and institutional frameworks mainly of 
forestry, environmental, and energy regulating entities. The overall objec -
tive of the program is to improve the resilience of poor and extremely poor 
households vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in environmentally 
sensitive areas of eastern Paraguay. 
The implicit theory of change of the program is that (1) once authorities 
have the requisite funds and approvals, they will be able to set up environ -
mental conditional cash transfer (E-CCT) payment systems that piggyback 
on existing cash transfer systems that already target poor and vulnerable 
communities through automated banking systems; (2) households will 
be targeted successfully; (3) as a consequence of the incentive of E-CCTs, 
households will start to build and invest in agroforestry systems (for which 
they will be paid for inputs and provided with technical assistance) they 
would not otherwise have; (4) households’ agroforestry systems will be 
measured and detectable, which will then trigger payments to them; and 
(5) forest cover and degradation in eastern Paraguay will be reduced as 
a consequence and climate change mitigation will occur. There are several 
assumptions here, including assuming that households will be able to take 
the surplus produce from the agroforest systems to local and regional bio -
markets, and that they will be able to earn incomes from these which will 
also reduce their income poverty and therefore increase their resilience.
Clearly, all of these statements require either strong previously produced 
evidence or smaller evaluative tests to understand whether the linkages are 
working, and whether the overall effects of the program will be achieved.
<<<PAGE=376>>>

bridge a very important gap, in that they apply science and rigor to questions 
that have previously been hand-waved.
The Challenge of Complexity
Complexity poses a substantial challenge to impact evaluations. Many pro-
grams involve a multitude of sectors: for example livelihood programs include 
interventions in water provision, sanitation, income-generation activities, and 
health. This usually means that causal pathways are not direct, are cross-
linked, and are nonlinear. Separately, it also means that there are a multitude 
of sectors that every program is aiming to target. Arguably this reduces the 
incentive for any one sector team to invest in impact evaluations. Moreover, 
because there are intersectoral links and feedback loops, it becomes harder 
for impact evaluations to answer the “why” questions once the “how much” 
questions have been answered. Woolcock (2013) frames this challenge by 
citing three specific challenges that randomized control trials (RCTs) are 
unable to deal with. He cites the challenges of “causal density,” “implementa-
tion capability,” and “reasoned expectations” as being key features of complex 
systems that also make it difficult for RCTs to be used for understanding the 
overall impact of development interventions. 
Another aspect of complexity is the measurement of relevant out -
comes. For example, test scores may be an important indicator of performance 
in an education project, and RCTs may indeed be able to measure these well. 
It may also be possible to create good indicators and to include these in 
pre-analysis plans. But student stress may be an unintended consequence of 
these score-enhancing programs. There are two difficulties here: the inability 
to prespecify all possible consequences in a protocol, and the difficulty in 
measuring student stress caused by these programs.
Another example of the measurement challenge is climate projects that 
are aimed at increasing adaptation. A recent survey by the Overseas Devel -
opment Institute found that there are at least 43 different frameworks for 
defining and understanding climate adaptation (ODI 2016). Again, because 
climate change programs also typically incorporate poverty alleviation and 
equity as a primary objective, these causal chains become very difficult to 
identify. As Levin et al. (2012) point out, it also becomes more likely that 
a specific solution to one development challenge creates a new problem 
for another one. Road building is touted as one such development solution 
that has clear (negative) implications for forest cover and biodiversity.5 Addi-
tionally, confounding features of programs make it difficult to identify and 
measure the key change the program is seeking to bring about. Given these 
challenges, designing impact evaluations becomes even more difficult. 
5 Cropper, Puri, and Griffiths (2001) and Puri (2016) discuss the exceptions to 
this rule.
<<<PAGE=377>>>
Chapter 21. The Wicked Cases of Education and Climate Change - The Promise and Challenge of Theory-Based Impact Evaluations  355
The Challenge of External Validity
Limited external validity is another limitation of theory-based impact evalua-
tions. Other authors have raised this concern as an important detraction from 
impact evaluations (Basu 2013; Pritchett and Sandefur 2014; Woolcock 2009). 
These are important concerns, and impact evaluations will need to respond to 
them by using new tools. It is of course true that non-impact evaluations are 
typically not externally valid either. We argue that in this case theory-based 
impact evaluations, because they are able to articulate the theories behind 
overall interventions and also provide statistical estimates with confidence 
intervals, become easier to aggregate through meta-analysis. Although limited, 
in these cases it is easier to say something about “net” or “aggregate” effect 
sizes (see Snilstveit et al. 2016b; Waddington and White 2014).
The knowledge gaps and methodological challenges discussed above 
pose challenges for evaluating the effects of interventions that will help coun-
tries address the 2030 Agenda. But they are not insurmountable. In this and 
the next section, we discuss these challenges and how evaluators have tried 
to address them in the “wicked” sectors of education and climate change. 
WICKED SECTOR: EDUCATION
According to UNESCO’s post-2015 Global Education Monitoring report 
(UNESCO 2015), in order to achieve the ambitious SDG targets for education 
by 2030, the spending per primary school student in low-income countries 
needs to be double the current level of spending. The International Edu-
cation Commission calls for total spending in education to triple from its 
present $1 trillion. But more funding is not sufficient for addressing the learn-
ing crisis: resources need to be directed to programs that work. There are a 
large number of reports about education, but there are relatively few that 
address attribution directly. 3ie recently completed a comprehensive system-
atic review of the effectiveness of 21 different types of education programs 
on children’s school enrollment, attendance, drop-out rates, completion, and 
learning outcomes (Snilstveit et al. 2016a). It included evidence covering 
more than 16 million children across 52 countries, participating in 216 edu-
cation programs in 52 low- and middle-income countries. The findings from 
this study can help inform decisions about effective strategies for achieving 
the education targets.
The review drew on evidence from 238 impact evaluations and 
121 qualitative research studies and process evaluations. Interventions such 
as cash transfers, structured pedagogy, and computer-assisted learning pro-
grams were studied extensively. For other programs, such as school-based 
health, information to children, teacher interventions, remedial education, and 
school-day extension, the evidence is more limited. Significant investments 
are being made for funding interventions in understudied areas such as teach-
er-related programs. There is an urgent need for generating more evidence to 
help in informing funding decisions.
The education sector mirrors global variation in the availability of evi-
dence. The greatest number of studies was identified in Latin America and

the Caribbean (87); Sub-Saharan Africa (59); and South Asia (51). Countries 
where several studies have been conducted include Brazil, Chile, China, India, 
Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, and Uganda. Evidence is limited or nonexistent 
for many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and for several countries with large 
populations, such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nigeria. 
Aside from inadequate thematic and geographic coverage of some 
important interventions, the usefulness of impact evaluations for the 2030 
Agenda faces another challenge. Many education interventions are meth-
odologically “wicked” to evaluate. Three aspects are particularly important 
to consider: the logical chain of intervention to results; context; and 
implementation. 
The Logical Chain from Interventions to Results
While some interventions have a relatively simple logical chain from inter -
vention to results, such as the provision of textbooks on learning, or of 
scholarships on school participation, many others are characterized by causal 
density. This means that the interventions are “…highly transaction intensive, 
require considerable discretion by implementing agents, yield powerful pres-
sures for those agents to do something other than implement a solution, and 
have no known (ex ante) solution” (Woolcock 2013).
It is thus not surprising that interventions that have a direct and simple 
link to the desired outcome—short results chains—are more effective. For 
example, cash transfer programs were the most effective intervention to 
boost school attendance. Where the outcomes of any one intervention are 
conditioned by the effectiveness of other interventions that may be beyond 
the scope of the program, the results tend to be more mixed. For example, in 
contrast to their effect on school participation, cash transfers have very little 
effect on learning outcomes as measured by mathematics or reading scores. 
This may not be surprising, given that most of the programs were conditioned 
on school participation and attendance, not on test performance. But the fact 
that learning outcomes were not significantly affected may also be a reflec -
tion of the low quality of schools that children were incentivized attend. 
In Colombia, for example, school vouchers (which are effectively conditional 
cash transfers) had no effect on learning outcomes if they were limited to 
government schools, but had a positive effect in those areas where the recipi-
ents were able to use them for entry into private schools, most of which were 
perceived to be of higher quality (Barrera-Osorio et al. 2011).
Another example is the need to address the incentives of the most 
important actor in affecting students in classrooms—the teacher—in 
almost any intervention. Some of the teachers who were delivering the 
Reading to Learn program in Kenya chose not to accept the class materials 
because they considered them difficult to master. This may have been one 
of the reasons that the program did not improve children’s performance 
in written and oral literacy exams. Similarly, the evidence on computer-as-
sisted learning programs suggests that while the implementation of training 
for teachers is an issue, program designs need to also consider teacher 
workloads, as well as their attitudes and motivation for making radical
<<<PAGE=379>>>
Chapter 21. The Wicked Cases of Education and Climate Change - The Promise and Challenge of Theory-Based Impact Evaluations  357
changes in the way they teach. School-based health programs also require 
teachers to participate in program delivery. Hence, programs need to con-
sider whether this is increasing the workload for teachers and disrupting 
the regular class routine.
Baseline Conditions and Local Context
Many successful interventions have tailored their design well to the existing 
human and social capital of specific contexts. This is particularly important for 
interventions aimed at children and households, and those aimed at improv -
ing governance. 
School feeding programs, for example, have had the largest effect in 
areas characterized by high levels of food insecurity, malnutrition, and low 
school attendance. The effects have been much smaller in better-off areas 
where enrollment was already high, and malnutrition less of an issue. The 
school feeding program in Guyana, for instance, was implemented at a time 
when there was a documented increase in food insecurity for poor families. 
Not surprisingly, the program had large positive effects on school participa-
tion and learning. However, in Chile, the effects of the program on school 
participation were found to be small or nonexistent. In this case, the program 
was implemented at a time when extreme malnutrition had been eliminated, 
and enrollment rates were already high.
The baseline level of social capital has been found to be more import-
ant in interventions aimed at improving the system of governance of schools. 
School-based management and community-based monitoring had the best 
take-up in settings with high levels of social capital and a tradition of local 
participation. In the Philippines, where the effects of school-based manage-
ment were consistently positive, qualitative evidence suggests that parents 
and communities were willing and able to make basic decisions about school-
ing when given the opportunity to do so. In contrast, results in most other 
contexts were disappointing. Evidence from Niger and Gambia pointed to low 
social and human capital as an important constraint for school-based manage-
ment programs.  Programs that rely on parental engagement for successful 
implementation may be better targeted in contexts where there is sufficient 
social and human capital to be able to hold other stakeholders accountable. 
For instance, where school committees are educated, or have experience in 
another community organization, parental monitoring of teacher attendance 
is likely to increase in response to the grant. Where these conditions are not 
met, programs may have a higher chance of success if there is a strong capac-
ity-building component that is focused on facilitating community involvement. 
More generally, when parental engagement is a key part of the theory of 
change of a program it is important to assess the local capacity to engage in 
the way assumed by the theory of change. Programs could then be designed 
to account for any deficit in social and human capital.
It is therefore imperative that decision makers obtain accurate baseline 
information at the design stage of the program. This is required in order 
to tailor new programs to target the main constraints and achieve better 
outcomes.

Capacity to Implement
The success, or more often the failure, of a program has often been attributed 
to the way the program has been implemented. Issues related to implementa-
tion have frequently been reported for a range of programs. The effect sizes 
of some programs were much smaller due to implementation problems. For 
example, in Kenya’s and Uganda’s Reading to Learn, as well as in Mali’s Read, 
Learn, Lead programs, school materials and other tools were not delivered 
in a timely manner, which may partly explain why they had no effects, or very 
small ones, compared to the overall average for structured pedagogy on 
learning outcomes (Snilstveit et al. 2015). Similarly, the distribution of text -
books to students was found to be lower than intended in the case of a few 
programs that were providing school materials.
Several computer-assisted learning programs have faced issues such as 
insufficient, damaged, and dysfunctional equipment, lack of Internet access, 
and software not being compatible with hardware. Insufficient training of 
teachers is another issue that has been brought up as a challenge for several 
programs, including computer-assisted learning. Implementation issues, par -
ticularly with respect to the transfer of funds affected the success of several 
school-based management programs. Grants were not disbursed as intended, 
and significant delays were reported for several programs. Finally, unforeseen 
circumstances such as epidemics and conflicts have also delayed the imple-
mentation of education programs.
In most cases, these issues have cropped up due to the lack of capacity for 
implementation at various levels of the supply chain. In some cases, the inability 
to ensure a sustained and timely supply of resources has affected the effective-
ness of programs. The difficulty in implementation is also often seen in programs 
that include a range of activities, and that have ambitious goals and long causal 
chains. This leaves a lot of room for implementation failure. In contexts where 
there is limited capacity to implement it may be necessary to give up on some of 
the objectives in the interest of making the program capable of implementation. 
Summary Implications
All of these complications point to the need for better-designed impact 
evaluations: those that study multiple options (or arms) to test different com-
binations of interventions would be greatly beneficial in addressing the causal 
complexity of some education interventions. But the examples above also 
point to the need for mixed methods in evaluation. Rigorous case studies, 
such as in Woolcock (2013), as well as incremental approaches to learning as 
in Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock (2012) would be one way to approach 
this. Finally, rigorous estimates of effects must be accompanied by equally 
rigorous studies of implementation.
WICKED SECTOR: CLIMATE CHANGE
In this section we discuss the overall strengths and limitations of using the-
ory-based impact evaluations in climate change programs and policies. It 
is clear that the international policy arena has parsed climate change into
<<<PAGE=381>>>
Chapter 21. The Wicked Cases of Education and Climate Change - The Promise and Challenge of Theory-Based Impact Evaluations  359
several components, perhaps recognizing their overwhelmingly large reach 
and scope. So, for example, there are different conferences of parties (COPs) 
for climate and for forestry. Organizations and funding are also largely seg-
regated into three different areas or sectors—mitigation, adaptation, and 
forestry. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
recognizes these areas. Therefore, we define climate change activities and 
sectors as all those that help to reduce or stabilize GHG emissions, and that 
help to increase adaptation to climate change and its resulting uncertainties 
and weather extremes. 
In the mitigation category, a host of types of policies and programs are 
included—these include policies and programs that increase access to and 
the use of low-emission energy and power generation; programs that increase 
access to and the use of low-emission transport; energy-efficient buildings, 
cities, and industries; and programs and policies that aim to increase sustain-
able land use and forest management, including reducing emissions from 
deforestation and forest degradation, or REDD+, programs. In the adaptation 
category, the range of policies and programs includes those that increase resil-
ience and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable people, communities, and regions; 
that increase resilience of health and well-being; that increase food and water 
security; that increase the resilience of infrastructure and built environment to 
climate change threats; and that increase the resilience of ecosystems. 
Challenges of Evaluating Climate Change Action
Evaluations of programs and policies that deal with climate change encounter 
some of the challenges laid out in the section on education, and others as 
well. First there is the challenge of distal impacts. Climate change mitigation 
takes time (and scale): assessing overall contribution to climate change mitiga-
tion requires long time horizons. With theory-based impact evaluations, some 
of this is dealt with by underlying theories, mapping outcomes, and assess-
ing efficacy and program success (see, e.g., box 21.1). The overall question 
related to understanding and measuring change, however, remains a chal -
lenge. Indeed, an evidence gap map examining the effects of land use policies 
on mitigation (Snilstveit et al. 2016b) found that, although there were 221 
studies that rigorously looked at the impacts of land use policies and inter -
ventions on outcomes such as tree cover, livelihoods, and health, there were 
no evaluative studies that linked these, in an attributable way, in developing 
countries, to GHG emissions. This not only speaks to the difficulty of waiting 
for long periods of time for these impacts to show: it also underscores the 
difficulty of measuring GHG emissions. The other difficulty in these programs 
is that in order for there to be a measurable effect on even GHG emissions, 
programs have to account for “leakages,” that is, the likelihood that mitigation 
programs in one area may lead to the displacement or movement of emission 
activities to other areas. Impact evaluations therefore have to cover large 
areas, in order to ensure that there is a net effect on GHGs. This public good 
nature of climate change action imposes large transaction costs, but it also 
means that impact evaluations that aim to measure attributable change have 
to focus on large-scale action, and this may not always be possible (box 21.2).
<<<PAGE=382>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
360
The second challenge for climate change evaluations is that most 
climate change projects have multiple objectives. This means that other than 
feedback loops and backward and forward links, most climate change projects 
are not just planned and implemented to maximize impact on climate change, 
but to simultaneously affect social, economic, health, and agricultural objec -
tives. This means that the strength of links in a theory of change are frequently 
not the same, that they intersect and impacts mostly depend on the efficacy 
of several links being realized. This makes impact evaluations—which assume 
that a single intervention will lead to the overall impact, all other things being 
held constant—difficult to plan, implement, and realize in this space. 
Third, climate and the environment are inherently public goods. This 
means that the overall impact of interventions is not individually determined 
by the successful implementation of one project over one discrete area. 
BOX 21.2 A large-scale mitigation program: An example of solar 
home systems
Bangladesh’s solar home systems (SHS) program—supported by the World 
Bank, GIZ, KfW, the European Union, the Inter-American Development Bank, 
and the multidonor Global Partnership for Output-based Aid trust fund—
aims to provide energy for poor and vulnerable households. To gauge its 
uptake and effects, an evaluation was undertaken 10 years after its incep -
tion. The findings revealed a complex set of factors at play. To begin with, by 
2013, only 10–12 percent of off-grid households had access to SHS off-grid 
devices, and diffusion rates were low: on average, a maximum of one-third 
of eligible households had adopted SHSs. The households that adopted 
the devices were, on average, much richer (80 percent higher incomes than 
non-adopting households) and better educated, with high percentages of 
non-agricultural income and a higher level of household assets. More than 
78 percent of the adoption had only occurred during the last three years 
of the program. Despite their SHS adoption, most households continued to 
depend on traditional sources of energy. While there was some evidence of 
a substitution effect with SHS replacing kerosene, SHS households overall 
consumed more energy compared to non-SHS households—indicating that 
the income effect was stronger than the substitution effect. An important 
factor influencing adoption is the cost (including interest cost) and main -
tenance of SHS devices. But over a quarter of those taking out loans for 
the SHS devices—which are sold on credit, with loans provided for three 
years with a flat interest rate of 6 percent—were late in their repayments. 
Clearly for the program to conclude that it has been effective in achieving 
its long-term goal, given that the magnitude of change in overall emissions 
will be important, evaluation will need to measure the income effect and 
substitution effect over time.

Rather, in a twist on the problem of tragedy of commons, it is characterized by 
the problem of large numbers with small payoffs. This scale problem has two 
implications for impact evaluations. First, it means that impacts do not show 
unless there are a large number of agents. Second, they do not show unless a 
large number of agents are successfully undertaking these actions. Therefore, 
impact evaluations of climate change programs and policies in most cases 
have to concentrate on measuring attributable change at the outcome level. 
Furthermore, in most cases, although small programs may themselves be 
successful, we still may not see any changes in overall climate change-related 
impacts: this is true for both mitigation and adaptation programs. In some 
cases this means that small climate- related impacts have to accumulate until 
we are able to confidently detect and witness a change. As Bamberger, Rao, 
and Woolcock (2016) and Woolcock (2009) explain it, the impact function for 
climate change programs and policies may be nonlinear, or they may be hori-
zontal straight lines before we see any impact. Examining and understanding 
the role that scale plays in identifying and measuring impact with statistical 
confidence while planning impact evaluations is therefore very critical. 
Credible and high-quality impact evaluations are critically dependent on 
defining the appropriate questions and “system boundaries,” that is, defining 
the type and nature of the interventions that will be examined through impact 
evaluations. This in turn implies that impact evaluations are only able to examine 
a shortlist of interventions that have been defined using a variety of designs, 
such as factorial designs and pipeline designs. They are, by themselves, unable 
to compare interventions that have not been shortlisted. Arguably though, the-
ory-based impact evaluations can deal with these through doing good initial 
formative work and specifying unintended consequences, and by undertaking 
rigorous qualitative work along with data collection that can help inform areas 
that previous theories may have been blind to (see, e.g., Rao and Woolcock 
2002). We believe this is important to understand and concede, primarily 
because theory-based impact evaluations also have the advantage of lending 
themselves to systematic reviews with statistical meta-analyses that help us 
understand aggregate average effects, but also help us view the distribution 
of these effects; identify and analyze outliers; and examine other effects, such 
as “dose-response” pathways. In the next section, we will review some learning 
from impact evaluations in this area, and discuss new areas that theory-based 
impact evaluations should focus on, given the challenges and gaps. 
What Are We Learning?: Recent Evidence from Theory-Based 
Impact Evaluations and Systematic Reviews
Theory-based impact evaluations have helped us understand the amount 
of change that environmental programs are bringing about. In figures 21.3 
and 21.4, we show an illustrative summary of the magnitude of impact that 
several impact evaluations are able to measure in forestry programs.

Bias . The important thing to note is that impact evaluations help deal with 
the problem of endogeneity and placement bias. Cropper, Puri, and Griffiths 
(2001) and Chomitz and Gray (1996) account for the attributes of plots 
where protected areas tend to be sited or located. Since these are areas that 
have low agricultural productivity and are likely to be remote, it is clear that 
any naïve estimate that does not consider this selection bias is likely to have 
extremely biased results. 
Targeting . Impact evaluations can also help us understand the effective-
ness of targeting: Are programs really reaching the populations that they

need to, and are these the populations that programs most need to target? 
Alix-Garcia, Shapiro, and Sims (2012) found that the countrywide Payment 
for Ecosystem Services program (PSA) in Mexico, with a budget of more than 
$5 million, was quite successful in targeting households that were eligible for 
the program. In contrast, Azofeifa et al. (2007) found that in Costa Rica, the 
PSA program did not target those locations that were most likely to change 
land use. As a consequence there were very small changes in forest cover 
caused by the PSA program.
Subgroup effects . Impact evaluations can also help to address questions 
of equity and heterogeneous impacts. Somanathan, Prabhakar, and Mehta 
(2009) have shown that after accounting for potential selection and place-
ment bias, community-managed forests performed better in raising crown 
cover by 12–16 percent when compared to unmanaged commons, but only 
for forests of broadleaf trees, not pine trees. Understanding the effects on 
subgroups, however, requires that sample sizes be selected in such a way that 
they are representative for the subgroups of interest. 
Comparing different kinds of programs . Many studies have examined pro-
grams that engage communities and compare their effectiveness with the 
status quo, such as government managed systems, or unmanaged systems. 
For example, Tachibana and Adhikari (2009) showed that in Nepal, community 
co-managed forests recover much more quickly than forests where communi-
ties are solely managing their forests. And Cropper, Puri and Griffiths (2001) 
found that protected areas are less effective in protecting forests than 
wildlife sanctuaries by themselves, perhaps because the latter have more 
resources devoted to them. 
Are we doing the right things? In our view, one of the key questions that 
impact evaluations should answer is, “Are the right things being done?” A 
study by Wynes and Nicholas (2017) found that of the top four mitigation 
actions that individuals can undertake to reduce GHGs, only two are discussed 
in high school textbooks. The other two actions are completely ignored. If 
we are to focus policy and action on the most effective actions, evaluations 
need to start asking the question of whether the right strategies are being 
pursued programmatically, rather than evaluating only the implementation of 
policies. While traditional evaluations have mostly been unsuccessful in this 
area, impact evaluations can help us respond to this overall question. 
Trade-offs . A relatively but clearly an important question in climate change is 
examining any potential trade-offs between economic outcomes on one side 
and environmental outcomes on the other. This is particularly important in 
the case of programs that aim to reduce the consequences of development 
on the environment. A good example is provided by the Alix-Garcia et al. 
(2013) study of Oportunidades, a conditional cash transfer program, and its 
consequences for forests. The authors of this study found that forests were 
detrimentally affected as a consequence of a cash transfer program, and
<<<PAGE=386>>>
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and Sustainability
364
that the theory-based impact evaluation helped to measure the magnitude of 
this effect. This is important, because program managers and policy makers 
can then measure the magnitude of this effect and make policy decisions 
accordingly.
CONCLUSIONS: ARE THERE COMMON OPPORTUNITIES TO 
ADDRESS THE GAPS?
Theory-based impact evaluations have been used across the development 
and humanitarian sectors to inform the effectiveness of programs. This 
includes investigating the best ways to deliver humanitarian assistance (see, 
e.g., Doocy and Tappis 2016; Puri et al. 2017); examining the effectiveness 
of self-help groups in empowering women through microfinance (see, e.g., 
Brody et al. 2016), community-driven development (King, Samii, and Snil -
stveit 2010), sanitation programs (Buck et al. 2017), farmer field schools 
(Waddington and White 2014), agricultural insurance (Barooah, Kaushish, and 
Puri 2017), reducing poverty (Banerjee et al. 2015), and day care programs 
(Leroy, Gadsden, and Guijarro 2012). In so doing, they have helped to reduce 
ambiguity in our knowledge of the effectiveness of development programs. 
However, many challenges remain. First, theory-based impact eval -
uations have not succeeded in meeting the methodological challenges 
discussed in this chapter. Additionally, it is clear that theory-based impact 
evaluations have not really leveraged the data revolution. The methods tradi-
tionally employed in theory-based impact evaluations have largely remained 
the same, predicated on the assumption that data are scarce and infre-
quent. Advances are being made with machine learning that use frequent, 
high density, spatially disaggregated data to understand especially the het -
erogeneity of impacts, but they are making their way only very slowly into 
theory-based impact evaluations. 
Second, theory-based impact evaluations have largely shied away from 
meso-level or macro investigations. Causal identification through the use of 
controls or comparison groups remains a challenge here. Some studies are 
using innovative methods such as synthetic controls and machine learning 
(see, e.g., Acemoglu et al. 2013; Sills et al. 2015). Others are still ventur -
ing into meso-level investigations using regional controls (see, e.g., Bos et al. 
2017). These applications, however, remain infrequent. 
Third, theory-based impact evaluations have stayed mostly quiet on 
systems thinking and on understanding what changes institutions. Meth-
odologies have been limited in this space. This is important because most 
agencies, especially environmental agencies such as the Global Environment 
Facility, the Climate Investment Fund, and the Green Climate Fund are aiming 
to achieve “transformational change.” An important characteristic of transfor-
mational change is being able to detect and measure systems change. This 
is an important policy imperative not just for environment-related organiza-
tions, but for the development sector as a whole, and it will be useful for the 
evaluation community to engage closely with applied academics to explore 
methodological options that help to identify and measure causal contribution 
in this area.
<<<PAGE=387>>>
Chapter 21. The Wicked Cases of Education and Climate Change - The Promise and Challenge of Theory-Based Impact Evaluations  365
As recent papers have demonstrated (PLOS Collections 2016), the size 
of causal change differs dramatically depending on the spatial resolution of 
data: the less the resolution, the greater the imprecision, but the higher the 
resolution, the greater the heterogeneity in impacts across intervention sites. 
Arguably, therefore, it may be even more important to measure the cost-ef -
fectiveness of programs and projects (PLOS Collections 2016). Unfortunately 
this is not something that a lot of evaluations do. The absence of data on 
costs of implementation is usually cited as a reason for this absence of anal -
ysis. But we believe it as important to understand overall effect size as it is 
to measure cost effectiveness. Unfortunately, as we have shown in one of 
our papers, there are very few studies that examine cost effectiveness (Puri 
et al. 2016). 
We also believe that evaluations that contribute to implementation 
science by examining how programs may be implemented are far more 
important than measuring the overall effects of programs. Although other 
sectors, such as nutrition and health, have long held this as an important area 
of exploration (see, e.g., Menon et al. 2014), impact evaluation techniques, 
especially those related to causal identification, have not found widespread 
use. Comparing different delivery mechanisms and how effective they are in 
realizing results is especially important. An example of this can be seen with 
Doocy and Tappis (2016), where the authors compared the effectiveness of 
cash transfers versus food transfers, versus in-kind transfers in humanitarian 
contexts. Within this class of research we also recommend using impact eval-
uations to examine “last mile” questions. Most programs assume that good 
implementation leads to good results. However, as has been most recently 
explored by the behavioral insights literature, good implementation is a nec -
essary, but not a sufficient condition for success in development programs. 
These last mile problems have been examined in the context of the adoption 
of new technologies (e.g., Burwen and Levine 2012) or for new instruments 
(Barooah, Kaushish, and Puri 2017). Most programs fail because they presume 
that good monetary incentives are in themselves sufficient to ensure results. 
However, the literature on behavioral insights has now shown us that these 
assumptions are unrealistic.
Despite all of these challenges, we remain sanguine. Theory-based 
impact evaluations have been able to answer many difficult questions. They 
have helped policy makers and evaluators understand and measure overall 
results, and deal with a variety of biases while understanding the impact 
of development assistance. They have arguably helped to turn the tide in 
international assistance by providing comparisons of the effectiveness of dif-
ferent programs, that for long periods of time had been accepted as being 
successful and useful. Theory-based impact evaluations have provided us 
with a method for comparing strategies as well understanding their relative 
impact, while developing a systematic way to aggregate effects and under -
stand average impact. Clearly the field is still in its infancy, though, and new, 
customized methodological advances will be required if we are to answer the 
questions that are relevant to the policy community.

Measuring the Impact of the 
Extractive Industry's  
Development Projects
Gwendolyn Wellmann
Abstract . In the past decade and a half, increasing pressure has been put on big 
corporations and, in particular, on the extractive industries—mining, oil and gas, and 
forestry—to go beyond philanthropy, and to make social contributions that contribute 
directly to society’s development, particularly in ways that help to achieve international 
development goals. At the same time, an increase in social unrest directly linked to 
mining operations has led to an increased realization that contributing to the devel -
opment of affected communities is an important risk-avoidance strategy. While many 
community development projects have been implemented over several years, impact 
assessments were not seen as necessary; and it has only been where there has been 
increased pressure from governments, such as Ghana’s, that impact assessments 
of these projects have been done. This chapter discusses the impact of evaluation 
methods used by a mining company in Ghana to measure the impact of their commu-
nity/societal development program. The chapter concludes with an exploration of the 
way forward for impact evaluations of the development activities of big corporations.

T
he term “extractive industry” refers to any industry that extracts 
resources from the Earth: it mainly refers to mining, oil and gas, and 
to a lesser degree, forestry. The extractive industry is enormous and 
occupies a significant space in the economies of many resource-rich coun-
tries. This sector accounts for at least 20 percent of total exports, and at 
least 20 percent of government revenue, in 29 low-income and lower-mid -
dle-income countries (Smith 2012). In eight of these countries, the sector 
accounts for more than 90 percent of total exports, and 60 percent of 
total government revenue. Three of the world’s largest companies are 
extractive companies.
Although the sector is not necessarily more complex than other indus-
trial or economic sectors, it carries with it significant and diverse economic, 
societal, and environmental implications and challenges. Over the past five 
decades at least, the economic and environmental implications have been 
tackled, and their mitigation has been legislated for the most part. The social 
implications have taken somewhat longer to raise hackles, perhaps because 
they are less visible than environmental degradation: it is only since 2002 
that the extractive industry (primarily mining) has begun to mitigate some of 
these effects. Social implications refer to the socioeconomic circumstances 
and health of populations living in the vicinity of the mines. Reserves are often 
found in remote areas with limited economic activity and major social needs, 
and the industry has long-term horizons, with reserves depleted over several 
decades, which means that the mines or oil fields, and their cumulative social 
impacts, will be there for just as long.
The first section of this chapter reports on the use of monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) in the extractive industry’s community development proj-
ects in West and East Africa, as observed during the period 2002–12: the 
second section deals with the assessment of the impact of community devel-
opment initiatives implemented by a mining company operating in Ghana, 
West Africa. The third section explores the way forward for impact evalua-
tions of the development activities of big corporations.
M&E IN EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
The community development projects referred to in this section were imple-
mented by mining, and oil and gas, companies in West and East Africa. These 
development projects were implemented by 10 operational mines and 
3 exploration projects, which were owned by 5 multinational companies. The 
author worked for these companies in the role of independent contractor, 
and as such was involved in the development, implementation, and/or evalu-
ation of the community development projects. As is the norm, nondisclosure 
agreements were signed with the companies before work could commence, 
and these agreements prevent the naming of the companies and/or the rele-
vant projects discussed in this chapter. The development projects discussed 
were spread over four different countries, and were implemented during the 
period 2002–12.

2002–03
In the initial period (2002–03), the companies gave much more attention 
to environmental issues and impact on the environment, primarily because 
pressure from environmental advocates had started in the 1970s, and envi-
ronmental issues were included in the mining codes of various countries in 
the decades that followed. Relationships with directly affected communities 
were not high on the priority list of most companies, and government offi-
cials and local traditional chiefs were the only persons considered to be local 
stakeholders. Community development was not on the priority list. Any infra-
structure project that the company initiated was directly linked to the needs 
of the extractive project. These projects mostly involved the construction of 
roads, and the provision of electricity and potable water. 
Toward the end of 2003, a few projects experienced social unrest 
as traditional environmentally focused nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) started to highlight the social impact of the projects, and stakehold-
ers became more aware of their rights. The reputable extractive companies 
recognized that in order to be responsible corporate citizens, they had to 
address socioeconomic development issues at their operations. It was during 
this time that development initiatives within communities started to shift 
away from pure infrastructure to also include community capacity building, 
and local economic (livelihood) projects. At this time, none of the projects 
included any M&E. Infrastructure projects were monitored by engineers, and 
capacity-building and livelihood projects were monitored against a budgeted 
amount. There was no tracking of the number of beneficiaries, nor of the 
effectiveness or the impact of the project. Once the money was spent, the 
project was considered to have been implemented successfully by both the 
staff and the management of the companies.
2004–07
As governments in resource-rich countries matured, improved access to edu-
cation and the Internet resulted in better-informed stakeholders, and as the 
International Finance Corporation’s approach evolved to include promoting 
environmentally and socially sustainable growth in developing countries,
1 
more countries started to legislate the mandatory implementation of com-
munity development projects by the extractive companies operating within 
their borders (IEG 2011). In 2005, the International Council on Mining and 
Metals (ICMM) released its Community Development Toolkit, to be used as 
a guide to implementing community investment by its member companies 
1 The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is the world’s largest multilateral 
development bank, providing financial support and technical advice to private firms in 
developing countries. Although only one of the companies discussed here is an IFC 
client, all the companies adhere to IFC guidelines (referred to as IPs—performance 
standards for best practice).

globally.2 This toolkit did contain a section on M&E, but it was very basic; and 
even though the ICMM released an updated toolkit in 2012, the M&E section 
was not updated, and the assessment or evaluation of the impact of commu-
nity development projects was not covered. 
By 2007, most mining companies had moved away from seeing commu-
nity development projects as philanthropy, and had begun to see them more 
as an essential part of their risk-avoidance activities. Companies started to 
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on identifying social risks and imple-
menting community development projects, but barely a thousand dollars to 
measure the impact of their development projects. Similarly, including com-
munity development projects as a means for avoiding social unrest did not 
change the methods of resource extraction activities, which remain governed 
by cost effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) considerations. 
In Ghana, three of the companies decided to outsource community 
development projects to professionals, and appointed international NGOs to 
implement them.
3 These community development projects focused on the 
education, health, and local economic development sectors, and were similar 
across all three companies. The NGOs introduced M&E, but it was limited 
to preset indicators developed by the NGOs without input from either the 
affected community members or the company. The tools used were stan-
dardized M&E procedures and tools. 
2008–12
After the initial four-year contract ended, the companies decided not to 
outsource this function anymore, but rather to employ development profes-
sionals. As the external evaluations conducted on the programs implemented 
during 2004–07 indicated that there was a need for more engagement with 
community members when choosing and designing development projects, 
this became a priority. Most of the development professionals employed 
were trained in community liaison and external engagement: thus there 
remained a dearth of M&E skills across the board. The companies required 
data about only these indicators: number of beneficiaries; amount expended; 
number of social complaints directly related to the company’s operations; 
and number of social unrest incidents, irrespective of cause. This was the full 
extent of any M&E. 
In 2012, the government of Ghana, as part of the Ghana Environmen-
tal Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Akoben Programme,
4 for the first time ever 
demanded a report on the impact of community development initiatives 
on affected communities. The Akoben Programme used a rating system

(figure 22.1) to assess the environmental standing of an operating mine or 
mining project (e.g., the development of, or expansion of, a mine).5 The results 
were published in all the leading newspapers, and the competition for praise 
(and/or shame) among the companies was strong.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT IN GHANA
Mining in Ghana
The second-largest gold deposit in Africa is located in Ghana, and the histor-
ical importance of gold mining in the economic development of the country 
is considerable and well documented.
6 Large-scale industrial gold mining in 
Ghana dates back to the last quarter of the 19th century. It was restructured 
and modernized under the post-1983 Economic Recovery Programme, after 
a period of decline under government control in the nationalist era in the two 
decades since the early 1960s (Hilson 2002, 2004). Some of these changes 
included a revised mining code (the Minerals and Mining Law [PNDCL 153] 
of 1986), and resulted in the sector seeing sustained increases in foreign 
investment, output, and export volumes. Investment increased substantially 
between 2006 and 2009, facilitated by a further revised mining code, which 
was consolidated in the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act 703. Under this law, all 
minerals are owned by the state, and the holder of the mining lease must pay 
a royalty to the state of not less than 3 percent and not more than 6 percent 
of their gross revenues. In addition to paying royalties, mining companies also 
contribute to taxes, employment, contracting, and investing in community 
development. 
The gold mining sector contributes significant amounts to the global 
economy through their production activities and expenditure on goods and 
services, but the socioeconomic impacts of this sector are not well under -
stood. The direct economic contribution of the gold mining industry to the 
world economy during 2013 was over $171.6 billion, which is almost seven 
5 Each mine or mining project was assessed individually, irrespective of how 
many mining projects a company owned.

times its contribution in 2000. 7 The biggest in-country expenditures are for 
suppliers and employee wages. 
The gold mining sector in Ghana contributes a significant amount 
of funding toward supporting development, and it is useful at this point 
to highlight both the sector’s contribution and that of international aid to 
the country between 2000 and 2012. Official international aid received by 
Ghana increased by 202 percent during the period 2000–12, rising from 
$598.2 million to $1,807.9 million (Stamp 2015). In contrast, direct gross 
value added amounts during the same period increased by 1,174 percent: 
from $273 million in 2000 to $3,476.4 million in 2012 (Stamp 2015).

Two Mines and Their Community Investment
The mines that are the subject of this chapter, and which belong to one 
company, are located in the Birimian and Tarkwaian gold belts, which charac-
terize the western half of Ghana.
9 Although nowadays companies have large 
community relations departments and sophisticated manuals for stakeholder 
engagement, community development, and impact mitigation, in Ghana in 
2002, on one of Africa’s biggest and most productive mines, none of this 
existed. It can be correctly assumed that this was the case at most mines in 
West Africa, if not in the world. 
However, as discussed above, local and international events, and espe-
cially increased social risks, left the companies no other alternative than to 
start addressing social issues. The initial corporate social responsibility projects 
were primarily community-level infrastructure projects: hospitals, communal 
toilets, schools, and roads. There was very little understanding that these 
buildings meant nothing if people were not using them and benefiting from 
them. There was confusion as to why the recipients were not grateful to the 
companies for providing them with these buildings, and specifically in Ghana, 
some meetings were held among mining companies to address this shared 
problem. It became clear that miners are best at mining, not at development 
work, and that they needed people with expertise in development. At this 
time, any monitoring of any social project was being done by the engineers, 
and was related to the building of the buildings or roads, and the amount of 
money being expended: there was no measurement dealing with the number 
7 The contribution can be assessed by calculating the gross value added (GVA), 
which is a calculation that estimates the contribution of industrial activity to a nation’s 
gross domestic product (GDP). It is important to note that GVA does not refer to pro-
duction, but rather economic value, nor does it refer to profit.
8 Direct gross value added (GVA) estimates the economic value of the gold 
mining industry’s production to the Ghanaian economy. Indirect GVA estimates the 
value of economic production resulting of the industry’s expenditures on raw materials, 
good and services.
9 While the company has provided permission to use the data presented in this 
study, permission is granted on the basis that the company and the mines will remain 
anonymous.

of beneficiaries, and there was definitely no thought given to social impact, 
whether positive or negative. 
The company that is the subject of this chapter began by implementing 
infrastructure projects in the communities that had been most affected by its 
mining activities since 1999. Initially, it adopted an ad hoc approach by simply 
responding to requests made by the communities. This approach changed 
when in 2002 a trust fund, which two years later became a foundation, was 
set up in the names of the affected communities to ensure that sufficient 
funds were set aside annually for the development of these communities. 
One of the first tasks of the foundation was to develop a five-year community 
development plan to ensure a coherent approach to the provision of infra-
structure to the affected communities. 
The vision of the five-year plan was to be a high-impact, results-focused, 
sustainable, and integrated community development program that focused 
on economic growth, quality of life improvement, and empowerment through 
infrastructure development and capacity building. Its immediate goal was to 
improve the quality of life for 30,000 people in the 16 primary stakeholder 
communities by 2010. An international NGO was contracted to develop the 
five-year plan and to implement it.
Each of the individual projects that formed part of the five-year 
program had its own M&E logical framework (logframe). The M&E involved 
preset indicators developed without input from either the affected com-
munities (the beneficiaries) or the client (the company). The NGO was using 
standardized procedures and tools. With the passing years, however, and 
with the realization that the clients were primarily interested in being able to 
report on the amount of U.S. dollars being spent, and how many people were 
being directly assisted, those two indicators became the main measurements 
used by the implementer.
The evaluations involved external experts coming in to measure per -
formance against preset indicators, using standardized procedures and tools: 
there was no focus on the impacts (whether intended or unintended, positive 
or negative) of any of the projects. The evaluation reports of six community 
development programs implemented by various mining companies in the 
country indicated that the M&E of the projects, as reflected in the logframe, 
appeared to be an afterthought. Although the logframes were well executed, 
with the objectives, objectively verifiable indicators, means of verification, and 
assumptions well laid out, one got the sense that this was done merely in 
order to tick a box, and that the logframe was never again looked at until 
it was studied by the external evaluator. Three of the five-year program’s 
project planning documents contained no logframes, and there was only a 
brief paragraph referring to M&E. 
The Impact Assessment
Two years after the completion of the implementation of the community 
development program, this company, like many others in Ghana, was obli-
gated to report on the impact of its community investment projects as part 
of the Ghana EPA’s Akoben Programme. It therefore wanted to measure
<<<PAGE=400>>>

not only the impact of the five-year program, but also the company’s earlier 
infrastructure development projects. It was at this time that the lack of any 
baseline data was discovered. While each of the projects had an M&E plan, 
there had been none for the overall program, and no baseline data had been 
collected before the program was initiated.
As there were only limited other resources that could be used to 
create a baseline against which the program’s impact could be assessed, the 
impact assessment had to adopt a “before” and “after” methodology that was 
designed to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the program’s outputs 
and impacts on the communities. 
Four impact assessment criteria were used: 
 n Individual project relevance and appropriateness
 n Status of individual project implementation
 n Changes in the community’s access to education, water and sanita-
tion and health care
 n Individual project impact and its sustainability 
Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from a sample 
of 990 households randomly selected across 16 communities from a total 
number of 11,677 households. In an attempt to also gather qualitative data 
by using the most significant change approach, other data collection tech-
niques included focus group discussions and key informant interviews (Davies 
and Dart 2005; Serrat 2009). Data gathered were validated with available 
information from the local government.
Results
The results of the assessment were as follows:
 n Appropriateness and relevance of projects . All of the different 
types of infrastructure projects implemented in the communities 
were found to reflect the felt needs of the beneficiary communi-
ties. They also reflected the policy objectives of the Tarkwa Nsuaem 
Municipality, the Prestea Huni Valley District Assembly, and the 
central government, as well as the United Nations’ Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). 
 n Status of implementation . All of the projects had been completed 
at the time of the assessment. 
 n Changes in community access . All of the communities’ access to 
education, health, and water and sanitation services were signifi-
cantly improved.
 n Impacts and sustainability . There was a general consensus among 
stakeholders interviewed within the communities as well as at the 
district level that the company’s interventions had led to signifi-
cant improvements in the provision of quality infrastructure to the 
communities.

Significant improvements are reflected in increased access to basic 
education, health care, water and sanitation services, road transportation, 
and other socioeconomic facilities in the beneficiary communities. This 
increased access has had a positive impact on the living conditions of resi-
dents in terms of improved enrollment in schools, standard of educational 
achievement among pupils, a reduction in morbidity, an enhanced image of 
the communities, and increased productivity. These results from the house-
hold survey were validated using supplementary information supplied by the 
government agencies responsible for health, education, and water and san-
itation. For instance, the Bompieso Junior High School recorded a pass rate 
of 86 percent of the students in 2002, which had improved to a 100 percent 
pass rate in 2011. Similarly, the 2002 pass rate at the Damang Junior High 
School was only 24.5 percent, which had improved significantly in 2011, with 
a 95 percent pass rate. 
Participant perceptions of changes in access to education are shown in 
table 22.1; their perceptions of the impacts of educational infrastructure are 
shown in table 22.2.
In terms of health care, the awareness and practice of family plan-
ning was very low in the communities prior to the introduction of the health 
interventions. Records from the health directorates confirmed an increase in 
acceptance of family planning. The Prestea Huni Valley Health Directorate 
reported that family planning acceptors increased by 6 percent between 2008 
and 2010, and the Tarkwa Nsuaem Health Directorate reported an increase 
in family planning in the community of New Atuabo from 1007 patients in 
2009 to 1225 in 2010. The research respondents indicated that the quality of 
health care has improved after the company’s health interventions, and that 
as a result community members are healthier. 
Table 22.3 indicates the perception of respondents as to how the 
interventions have translated into improving health care facilities in the com-
munities, and the overall effect on the communities’ well-being. 
It is expected that the provision of health care facilities will to some 
degree impact on health education. The assessment therefore examined the 
level of knowledge of participants in relation to health care. Results indicate 
that whereas 27.7 percent of the respondents reported some basic knowl -
edge about health care prior to the company’s intervention, the situation has 
improved significantly, to 80.4 percent after the intervention. The percentage 
of respondents who reported that health education was bad in their com-
munities decreased from 72.3 percent prior to intervention, to 19.6 percent 
post-intervention. 
It is, however, important to note that the increase in health education 
cannot be attributed solely to the company’s intervention, since Ghana Health 
Services had also been involved in health programs in the area at the same 
time.
Access to health care facilities, medications, and health education is 
expected to have a positive impact on the incidence of diseases in an area. 
The director of health services at Prestea Huni Valley reported that disease 
incidence had been reduced by approximately 65 percent in the district, while

health care managers at the community level all indicated that there had 
been no outbreaks of epidemics in the communities in recent years. 
There is a positive correlation between morbidity and mortality: so 
with a decline in morbidity, mortality was expected to fall, and records from 
Prestea Huni Valley Health Directorate confirmed that they did. Records from 
the directorate indicate that maternal mortality in the district had dropped 
from 57 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 43.3 per 100,000 live births in 
2009. 
Many institutions contribute toward the development of health care 
delivery, so it was important to determine the perception of the respondents 
in terms of which institutions were responsible for the improvement in health 
care delivery in the area. According to respondents, the improvement in health 
conditions could be associated with many institutions: the municipalities 
(the assemblies); the company; other mining companies; the community; the 
central government; and private health care providers. However, the greatest 
recognition was given to the company. As many as 414 of 990 respondents 
believed that the improvement in health conditions in their community is as a 
result of the company’s interventions, followed by the Assembly, the central 
government, private health care providers, and other mining companies, in 
that order. 
One of the key indicators of access to water is proximity (or distance) 
to a safe, potable water source. Results of the study show that the com-
pany-funded water projects had led to significant improvements in this 
respect. During the household survey, respondents were asked to describe 
the distance they covered to reach a water source both before and after the 
company constructed a water facility in their community (figure 22.2). 
In addition to distance, household respondents were also asked to 
assess the adequacy and reliability of the water supply in their community 
before and after the intervention (table 22.5). 
Until the company provided them with potable water sources, most of 
the communities relied on water collected from streams and rivers, rendering 
them susceptible to water-borne diseases (figure 22.3). 
Approximately 49 percent of respondents said that prior to the compa-
ny’s intervention, the distance to their toilet facility was either “close” or “very 
close,” while the remaining 51 percent described it as either “far” or “very far.” 
After the intervention 88 percent of respondents indicated that their toilet 
facility was either “close” or “very close” (figure 22.4).
Respondents’ assessment of the level of access, adequacy, and reli-
ability of toilet facilities in their community before and after the company’s 
intervention produced results similar to those described above (table 22.6).
WHAT IS THE WAY FORWARD?
Despite the lack of baseline data, and complicating factors such as the 
implementation of similar projects by other companies, aid agencies, and the 
government in the same communities at the same time, one could draw the 
conclusion that the development projects implemented by the company did

have a positive impact, and did contribute to the country’s MDGs. Neverthe-
less, the situation does raise some concerns. 
The challenge of a lack of baseline social and economic data against 
which the effectiveness of socioeconomic development initiatives can be 
measured, while not unique to the extractive industry, is one that needs to 
be addressed. 
A critical issue for the extractive industry remains the need to secure 
social license to operate.
10 This often results in heavy investment in improv -
ing socioeconomic conditions of affected and/or host communities. It is also 
becoming the norm for companies to make targeted investments that focus 
on the same social and economic challenges that national governments are 
also seeking to address. More and more extractive companies are becoming 
aware of the unprecedented focus on the role of business in attaining the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and there is also more and more 
pressure on companies to report on their impact on society, whether good or 
bad, through reporting platforms such as the Global Reporting Initiative.11 
At the same time, despite a history of sometimes antagonistic relationships, 
some governments have started to engage with extractive companies as 
potential partners in development, and this dialogue has opened up new 
possibilities for these companies to play an active development role in devel-
oping countries. Many of these countries are also heavily reliant on official aid 
from donor countries, although the rate of growth in the economic value of 
the extractive product is significantly higher than the aid received. In recent 
years, the Ghanaian government has opened a dialogue with the extractive 
industries operating within the country to see how development could be 
leveraged. While this initially took the form of requiring the companies to 
report only on their spending on aspects of the country’s development prior-
ities, in recent years there has been a demand that the company also report 
on the impact of their community development investments. This has in turn 
opened the question of how this can be measured, especially in a milieu 
where development initiatives come from several different mining companies 
operating in a small area (e.g., the Tarkwa Nsuaem Municipality
12), and often 
initiate projects in the same communities, while government departments are 
10 “Social license to operate” generally refers to a local community’s ongoing 
acceptance and approval of a company’s project and/or the company’s continued 
presence in the area. It is now internationally recognized as a prerequisite to develop-
ment of any project. Conflict between extractive companies and local communities can 
result in operations being disrupted by protests, damage to property and other violent 
incidents. Franks et al. (2014) found that conflicts between mining companies and com-
munities can cost the company around $20 million per week as a result of production 
delays, and Henisz, Dorobantu, and Nartey (2011) found that between 1993 and 2008, 
the estimated value of two-thirds of the gold controlled by 26 gold mining companies, 
owned by 19 publicly traded companies, was related to the companies’ management of 
external relationships with affected communities and host governments.

also continuing to do their normal development work. Although it is not the 
case in the Tarkwa Nsuaem Municipality, there are also often aid agencies 
and NGOs implementing similar development projects. How then does one 
measure the impact of a single company’s community investments? 
In the evaluation discussed in this chapter, the evaluators tried to 
assess the opinion of the respondents as to whom (i.e., a specific company or 
government agency) any specific improvement in their access to health care, 
education, and water and sanitation could be attributed. In all instances, the 
majority of the respondents attributed the changes to the company that was 
conducting the research, but in “shared” communities (i.e., communities where 
more than one mining company was affecting the community), the results 
were a mixed bag of different companies. Very few respondents indicated 
that government initiatives were responsible for their improved quality of life. 
As we venture into the future with much more emphasis on the role 
of business in development, and business’s contribution to the SDGs, and 
with more pressure than ever for companies to report on their community 
impact to shareholders, stakeholders, and the public in general, more precise 
measuring and evaluating tools will be required. A good start would be a 
reliable and accurate baseline: if that is not possible, the natural experiment 
study methodology could work. While companies cannot take responsibility 
for a lack of national or regional data, they can work in partnership with 
communities and other stakeholders, such as local universities, to support 
systematic data collection to either build or update existing data sets, and 
the analysis thereof. 
Companies should also endeavor to employ not only development 
professionals, but also M&E professionals. These professionals will have a 
difficult task, as the M&E currently being implemented in the extractive indus-
try’s development projects only monitors the implementation of the project, 
not its impact. Evaluation has asked only one question: “Has the project been 
implemented successfully?” It is impossible to effectively measure impact 
without asking the right questions, and without taking the increasing unpre-
dictability of results due to social volatility and climate change into account, 
and developing a more flexible and dynamic approach.
The main question, however, is whether evaluation practices are 
equipped to take on the issues that the extractive industry will encounter, 
such as weaknesses in governance, extreme poverty, inequality, economic 
disparities, and social exclusion. How does one accurately measure human 
well-being (or improved well-being) as an outcome of a community develop-
ment investment? How many companies, even those that employ development 
professionals, would be aware of McGregor and Sumner’s three-dimensional 
model, based on Sen’s concept of development, as the freedom to realize 
human capabilities (McGregor and Sumner 2010; Sen 1999, 2009)? How 
many evaluators would know how to apply it? 
In terms of independent evaluations, which are still being paid for by 
the companies, how does one go beyond client-controlled guidelines that do 
not really allow for much independence, nor allow divergence from evalu-
ating projects or programs against predetermined goals, goals which might 
have been formulated in an era of less awareness of the social justice issues
<<<PAGE=409>>>
Chapter 22. Measuring the Impact of the Extractive Industry's Development Projects  387
pertaining to the industry and its operations? Similarly, how does one do 
a completely independent evaluation in what can sometimes be a hostile 
environment?
Picciotto calls very strongly for progressive and adaptive evaluation, 
which is “based on values and geared to public interest and combines the 
vision of democratic, committed, morally engaged evaluation with an empha-
sis on results that serve the public interest” (Picciotto 2016, 274). The 
extractive industry’s development initiatives must be evaluated using these 
concepts in order to report in a realistic way the companies’ enormous impact 
on communities, and their contributions to the global and host country SDGs.

Evaluation for Agenda 2030
PROVIDING EVIDENCE ON PROGRESS AND SUSTAINABILITY
Rob D. van den Berg, Indran Naidoo, and Susan D. Tamondong, editors
B
uilding on insights and state of the art gathered at a ground-breaking 
conference in Bangkok in 2015, this book presents an authoritative 
overview of the role of evaluation in generating evidence for informed 
decision making and learning to advance sustainable development. Agenda 
2030 includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and evaluation 
has been identified as one of the tools to understand and report on progress 
toward these goals. In the introductory part of the book, the challenges 
as well as the evaluation approaches to tackle them are discussed. An 
overview of how evaluation can contribute to understanding sustainable 
development is followed with the potential of gender- and equity-focused 
evaluation to “leave no one behind,” and participatory evaluation to give 
the people a voice in their future.
The second part discusses capacities and capabilities needed for evaluation 
focusing on sustainable development. The third part looks at regional 
perspectives as evaluation becomes increasingly country-led, focusing on 
their development priorities. The part’s chapters inform the reader on 
developments in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, small island developing states, 
Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa. The fourth part examines 
the negative impacts of development displacement, looks at evaluative 
evidence on the contribution safeguards make toward sustainability, and 
highlights resettlement policies and practices in development. The book’s 
fifth and final part looks at various efforts to provide evidence that an 
intervention, policy, or action leads to impact— not only at the level of 
the intervention, but at national, regional, and global levels. This part also 
explores new frontiers for evaluation as SDGs and the 2030 Agenda require 
new partnerships, new modes of operation, and innovative ways of financing 
that pose special problems for evaluation. 
Evaluation for Agenda 2030: Providing Evidence on Progress and 
Sustainability is written for policy makers, practitioners, academics, 
researchers, and other informed audiences concerned with sustainable 
development and evaluative evidence, systems for monitoring and 
evaluation, and related capacity issues.
