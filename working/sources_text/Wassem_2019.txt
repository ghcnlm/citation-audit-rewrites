Introduction
Capacity building is referred as the development of knowl-
edge, attitude, and skills of the workforce for enhancing the 
abilities to achieve the short-term and long-term goals on 
organizational as well as personal levels (Groot & van der 
Molen, 2000; Millar & Doherty, 2016). According to this, 
capacity building broadly covers the inabilities of all employ-
ees and develops the desirable skills and attitude, which 
enable them to accomplish suitable tasks efficiently (Yamoah 
& Maiyo, 2013). Capacity building has a positive impact on 
the employees’ performance along with external factors sig-
nificantly examined (Ahmad, Farrukh, & Nazir, 2015). In 
general, capacity building improves effectiveness at the 
organizational level.
Elnaga and Imran (2013) argue that managers play an 
integral role to build up employees’ capacities and create an 
efficient work environment. The managers are involved in 
designing the different training programs for enhancing 
employees’ learning, aptitudes, and capacities for the accom-
plishment of organizational goals. These efforts not only 
enhance the employees’ performance but also develops a 
better organizational image (Fang et al., 2010). The manager 
support involves the provision of favorable and reasonable 
conditions of employment, while capacity building deals 
with providing sustainable opportunities to employees, keep-
ing in view their natural talents. So, the capacity building can 
enhance the socioeconomic benefits for the employees as 
well as for the local industry (Hu, Rao, & Sun, 2006).
Importance of Capacity Building and 
Managerial Support in Textile Sector
Textile industry plays a vital role in the economic growth of 
World. Textile sector of Pakistan has 9.5% contribution to 
GDP. And more than 25 million population of the World are

Abstract
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of capacity building and managers’ support on employee performance 
in the textile industry. Moreover, this article also investigates the moderating effect exerted by employee retention on the 
effects of capacity building and managers’ support on employee performance. Data were collected through a convenience 
sampling technique. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted for data collection. Two hundred copies of 
questionnaires were distributed, and data were collected from the lower to middle-level employees who are working in the 
textile sector of Pakistan. SPSS 23 and SmartPLS-3 software were used for analysis. The results indicate that capacity building 
has a positive and significant impact on employee performance. In contrast, managerial support has an insignificant impact 
on employees’ performance. However, the impact of capacity building and managerial support on employee performance is 
positive and significantly moderated by employee retention. The results of this study will motivate owners/policymakers to 
invest in capacity building to enhance their organizational performance/productivity.

employees of the textile sector. The textile industry has pro-
vided employment to approximately 15 million people in 
Pakistan (Safeer et al., 2018). According to the Pakistan eco-
nomic survey 2016 to 2017, the textile sector of Pakistan 
contributes 62% of the total export. Studies and surveys sup-
port that its involvement in total exports is almost 60% and it 
involves almost 38% of manufacturing labor force to get 
more than 46% share in a whole of manufacturing products/
units (Safeer et al., 2018). In this study, we conduct an analy-
sis of the textile industry of Pakistan as a representative of 
manufacturing industries of developing countries. Therefore, 
the hierarchical performance can be increased by adjusting 
the performance management methods with training and 
development (Den Hartog, Boselie, & Paauwe, 2004). 
Superior employees’ performance stimulates the effective-
ness and efficiency of the general procedure of an organiza-
tion. Several factors influence the performance of employees, 
such as managerial support, training programs, employee 
retention, monetary and nonmonetary benefits, and training 
and support programs of an organization for career develop-
ment that ultimately lead to firm profitability through higher 
employees’ performance (Gul, Akbar, & Jan, 2012).
Research Gap
Capacity building is a core component to enhance the 
employees’ performance. However, no systematic study was 
conducted in the manufacturing sector of developing coun-
tries for determining the effect of capacity building and man-
agers’ support on employee performance and productivity. 
This study helps to bridge this gap, focusing on investigating 
the effect of capacity building, managers’ support, and 
employee retention on employees’ performance in the manu-
facturing sector of developing countries. Employee satisfac-
tion lies parallel to the customer satisfaction, that is, 
international customer demands that production process 
must fully satisfy the employees. International customers 
around the world equally weigh the values of the product and 
employees related to the production of the product. So, the 
employees in organizations should be skilled, trained, and 
satisfied with their work, so that they can enhance their pro-
ductivity to meet organizational goals.
Research Problem
Employee performance is the central issue of this study. 
There is a need for human resource (HR) practices, regarding 
skills, training, and development of employees. Capacity 
building is a systematic process to improve employees’ 
knowledge, skills, understanding, values, attitude, motiva-
tion, and capability necessary to perform well at work. 
Usually, the positive impact of the capacity building affects 
organizational revenue, competitiveness, and performance.
However, Ali and Zafar Iqbal discussed the governance 
challenges in the manufacturing industries of developing 
countries, where the employers have the perception that 
there is no contribution of capacity building and managerial 
support on the firm and employee performance (Ali & 
Jadoon, 2012). A few of the organizations’ executives in 
developing countries assume that improvement of the skills 
and knowledge of employees through capacity building 
helps in improving employee performance. However, major-
ity of executives think that there is no role capacity building 
plays in employee performance (Adegoke, Mani, Abubakar, 
and Van Den Broek, 2013), and they believe that the new 
employees would learn from the supervisors, while other 
employees would learn by performing their duties, and this 
approach prohibits them from investing more on the formal 
capacity building of their employees (Mndeme, 2011). 
Nelissen, Forrier, and Verbruggen (2017) discussed that 
there is a perception of how HR activities increase the risk of 
employee turnover. Local management has serious concerns 
about HR development, and they think that if they develop 
their employees, they may leave their organization after get-
ting training. The reason behind this myth is that the employ-
ees perceive more job opportunities in the labor market due 
to their newly acquired skills. This leads to high labor turn-
over along with an increase in the cost of hiring new employ-
ees. We conduct this research to respond to the myth of 
developing countries’ industrialist regarding the effects of 
capacity building on employees.
Research Objectives
This study focuses on examining the relationship between 
variables in the context of employees’ performance in the 
textile industry. The precise aims of the study are to
•• investigate the effect of capacity building on the 
employees’ performance,
•• explore the effect of managers’ support on the employ-
ees’ performance,
•• examine the moderating effect of employee retention 
between capacity building and employee perfor -
mance, and
•• examine the moderating effect of employee retention 
between managers’ support and employees’ 
performance.
Literature Review
Employee Performance
Employee performance can be defined as “the record of out-
comes, produced by specifying job activities or functions 
during a given period” (Bernardin, 2002). The performance 
of an employee is drived from considered as possible job-
related employee work practices are implemented. Employee 
performance is evaluated by a manager every year on a quar-
terly basis or monthly basis that provides insight for the

betterment of employees (Saleem & Amin, 2013). As defined 
by Tzafrir (2005), capacity building is a critical component 
in developing effective human capital. Financing in capacity 
building and training programs can make employees feel 
grateful to a firm.
Employee performance (dependent variable) is a primary 
interest of this research. The main goal is to understand and 
describe the importance of employee performance in the tex-
tile sector, which is a labor-intensive industry. According to 
Delaney and Huselid (1996), clarifications, performance, 
and results depend upon the way the managers are used to 
deal with their employees. So, manager support and capacity 
building can directly affect employee performance and busi-
ness outcome. Employee performance can be developed by 
accepting special measures that include job-related skills, 
knowledge, social capital, organizational capital, leading 
role, employee job development, authorization, redesign of 
work, training and development programs based on skills, 
evaluation, and reward system (Pfeffer & Jeffrey, 1998).
Manager Support
Manager support involves the process of influencing employ-
ees to work for the achievement of organizational goals 
(Lussier, 2011). A manager’s leadership can have direct 
impact on the satisfaction of employees through personal 
contact and indirect impact through shaping supporting poli-
cies (Yukl & Becker, 2006). Manager support is described as 
the degree to which the leaders appreciate the contributions 
of its employees and care about their welfare. Employees are 
probably going to remain in those associations where they 
trust that their capacities, commitments, and positive atti-
tudes are valued (Terera & Ngirande, 2014). A leader with 
excellent support is what makes employees feel heard, appre-
ciated, and favored. With support, people can face adversity 
and overawed challenges and more willing to sustain a posi-
tive image of capable learning and development and demon-
strate its success. A manager performs many functions in an 
organization. A leader makes a clear vision of the organiza-
tion, motivates employees, guides employees through the 
work process, and strengthens the moral (Turk, 2007). The 
most performance enhancement activities, managers can use, 
have a negligible impact on the performance of individual 
employees. The outcomes indicate that managers have an 
excellent opportunity to dramatically improve employees’ 
performance and focus their efforts on a much smaller list of 
benefits. The managers who set criteria of performance 
appraisal and provide fair and accurate informal feedback 
from the management on performance can significantly 
increase the individual performance (Trinka, 2005). Efficient 
fluency of work means managers engage in work with their 
employees and support them in all the problems they have 
encountered during the work.
Many managers recognize themselves at human skill 
level (Scase & Goffee, 1990), and in many organizations, 
training for nontechnical skills is very low. Many managers 
are distressed when they are restrained and restricted by top 
management, and they are not allowed to give innovative 
ideas for overcoming the current problematic situation. 
Those who have reached their position from a technical 
background fear uselessness of their old skills and are ner -
vous about their ability to acquire new skills. In this situa-
tion, senior management should support newly promoted 
employees of the organization. Employees have a stronger 
commitment to their organizations when they perceive that 
their supervisors are committed to their wellbeing (Kwenin, 
Muathe, & Nzulwa, 2013).
“Energy is an essential idea in material science, and com-
paratively, the power is one of the central ideas in social sci-
ence” (Yilmaz & Ergun, 2008). Power is the most critical 
resource; managers use to ensure that they achieve organiza-
tional goals by inspiring, motivating, and supporting their 
employees. According to the organization support theory, the 
perceived organization support would result in perceived 
manager support, and it would create a sense of responsibil-
ity and commitment in employees toward the organization to 
achieve the goals which would help to decrease employee 
turnover (Eisenberger, Stinglhamber, Vandenberghe, 
Sucharski, & Rhoades, 2002).
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Manager support has a significant 
impact on the employees’ performance.
Capacity Building
The term capacity building has been used in varying con-
texts, expressing different meanings and explanations. It was 
considered that the term correlates closely with HR develop-
ment, that is, enhancing employees’ knowledge and training. 
The field was quite narrow, which concentrates on the devel-
opment of staff by formal education and trained workers to 
fill the gap of the qualified personnel in the industrial opera-
tions (Rajabifard & Williamson, 2004). However, the past 
few years have transformed this old concept into a broader 
and global perspective. It focuses on employee development, 
covering institutional as well as specific initiatives of the 
country (Williamson, Rajabifard, & Enemark, 2003).
Each has distinct abilities and needs. On the same day of 
recruitment, employee training should be started. According 
to the nature of the job, employers try to bring knowledge, 
experiences, and skills in their employees. However, some 
employees rely on the knowledge and training provided by 
the organization in their orientation session to perform their 
jobs. All organizations must include on-the-job training and 
off-the-job training in their standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) and manuals. Managers invest in the HR and capac-
ity building of their employees to change and adapt the 
knowledge, behavior, and skills related to their job. As a 
result, the trained employee becomes the ambassador of the 
brand and uses their updated knowledge and skills to do their

job better, which results in the positive outcomes and 
employee retention (Benson, 2006; Gull & Azam, 2012).
Capacity building is the practice of developing and estab-
lishing skills, nature, ability, procedures, and resources that 
are required for the organizations and societies to adapt and 
increase employee performance in a fast-changing world 
continuously. Capacity building, in general, is regarded as 
the tactical steps accepted to enhance employee proficiency, 
showing significant enhancements in performances, devel-
opment of assets, and extra encouragement among working 
persons (Fullan, 2001). Capacity building of employees in a 
great judgment, can be regarded as upgrading the employees 
capacity to perform the right task inside more extended 
arrangement of execution guidelines of the Association 
(Yamoah & Maiyo, 2013).
Employees’ skills may be enhanced by adopting various 
human resource management (HRM) practices. The first and 
the most common are to involve either refining quality of indi-
viduals appointed or enhancing skills of current employees or 
both. It is usually achieved through extensive training regard-
ing the job and other developmental activities after selection 
(Delaney & Huselid, 1996). Training is a continuous process, 
designed according to the individual requirements, and it is 
constantly renewed to meet needs and feedback after training. 
The training programs of the employees vary from industry to 
industry, so one cannot be certain that a specific training 
should be conducted by industry yearly, bi-annually, or quar-
terly. In contrast, capacity building is a continuous process, 
involving intellectual capital, social capital, and firms’ capital 
for the accumulation of value in gaining maximum results 
from the minimum output. Capacity building programs include 
multinational organization planning to improve their employ-
ees’ performance and firm performance.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): The capacity building has a signifi-
cant impact on employee performance.
Employee Retention
“It is the percentage of employees remaining in the organiza-
tion” (Phillips & Connell, 2003). According to the study con-
ducted by Fitz-Enz (1997), on average, a company loses 
almost one million dollars with every 10 executive employ-
ees who leave the organization. Usually, the total cost of 
employee turnover is equal to 2 years’ salary and benefit of 
the uncertain employee. Losing the most significant employ-
ees of an organization not only affects the economical growth 
but also the organizational growth. Knowledge is gained by 
the experience and formal education, and it is applied to meet 
the customer expectations. Knowledge management is a pro-
cess of acquiring and sharing knowledge to improve a firm’s 
performance (Bassi, 1997).
Employee retention is considered as the heart of organiza-
tional success (Khalid & Nawab, 2018). Employee retention 
is a critical component of organizations, which is a common 
approach to talent management. The talent management is 
well defined as “the implementation of integrated strategies 
to increase workplace productivity by improved processes of 
attracting, developing, retaining, and using HRs with the 
required skills and aptitude to meet current and future busi-
ness needs” (Lockwood, 2006).
Employee retention is the most critical aspect of manage-
ment. Managers must have trust and faith on employees to 
build an atmosphere of coordination and peace, which are 
required for a job (Hartline & Bejou, 2012). Retaining top-
level employees is the primary concern for numerous organi-
zations these days. A critical examination of workforce 
movements found that there is a shortage of highly skilled 
workforce who possess required knowledge and capability to 
perform at top level, but a sense that organizations are 
neglecting top performers will eventually upset their capabil-
ity to be competitive (Rappaport, Bancroft, & Okum, 2003). 
The past studies, related to employees’ satisfaction, recog-
nized it as a factor that results in the high turnover of the 
employees (Steel, Griffeth, & Hom, 2002). Maertz and 
Campion (1998) concluded that relatively few studies dis-
cussed how to retain an employee within the organization. 
This study focused on employees’ performance, considering 
employee retention has a positive impact on employee per -
formance. This study examines the moderating role of 
employee retention; by the above literature, the following 
hypothesis was developed.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Employee retention has a moderating 
effect on the relationship between managers’ support and 
employee performance.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Employee retention has a moderating 
effect on the relationship between capacity building and 
employee performance
Conceptual Framework
In the literature review, we have found that managers’ support 
and capacity building have a significant impact on employee 
performance. Organizational performance depends on both 
employees’ and managers’ performance. Capacity building 
and manager support and employee retention are antecedents 
to enhance employee performance in the industries. The fol-
lowing theoretical framework was designed to describe a 
relationship between managers’ support, capacity building, 
and employee performance in the presence of moderating 
variable such as employee retention. Managers’ support and 
capacity building have an impact on employee performance. 
Managers’ support and capacity building not only morally 
develop employees but also organize their abilities for 
enhancing the productivity of organizations (DeJoy & Wilson, 
2003, Figure 1).
Methodology
In this study, a quantitative approach was used, and primary 
data were collected for analysis purpose. The population in
<<<PAGE=5>>>

this investigation consists of lower to top-level management 
employees who are performing their duties in the textile sector 
of Pakistan. Convenience sampling techniques were used for 
data collection, which is called a nonprobability sampling 
technique. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed to 
employees. One hundred seventy-five questionnaires were 
collected back from the respondents. Out of 175, 50 question-
naires were incomplete and not used for data analysis. 
Remaining 125 questionnaires were used for analysis. The 
adapted items of the different variables were used in the ques-
tionnaire. The 5-point Likert-type scale was used for data col-
lection, ranging from “5” for strong agreement with the “1” for 
strong disagreement with the statement. The questions were 
selected based on their previous good reliabilities in Pakistan 
and other countries. The study used already developed mea-
sures to collect data from respondents as shown in Table 1.
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was 
used for descriptive analysis, and SmartPLS (partial least 
squares) was used for a casual modeling approach, that is, 
evaluation of the measurement of the inner model and the 
structural model which was developed by Ringle, Wende, 
and Will (2005).
Results
Descriptive Analysis
A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed to respondents 
and 175 questionnaires were collected back from the respon-
dents, out of which 50 incomplete questionnaires were 
released. Therefore, 125 questionnaires were entered into the 
SPSS to perform the descriptive analysis. In the descriptive 
analysis, the demographic characteristics of respondents 
were discussed. Demographic characteristics included in this 
study were gender, age, education, designation, and experi-
ence that is shown in Table 2.
Model Assessment
The main objective of this study is to predict the relationship 
between the dependent variable and independent variables, so 
partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) 
is used (Henseler, Ringle, & Sinkovics, 2009). Simultaneously, 
all hypotheses were tested by using SmartPLS-SEM. PLS-
SEM is a causal modeling approach that evolves two phases, 
that is, evaluation of the measurement model (outer model)

followed by the assessment of the structural model (inner 
model; Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011). The outer model 
determined the relationship between valuable and related 
items, while the inner model defined the relationship between 
exogenous and endogenous constructs (Hair, Sarstedt, 
Hopkins, & Kuppelwieser, 2014).
Assessment of Measurement Model  
(Reliability and Validity Analysis)
Evaluation of the measurement model has been constructed 
for reliability and validity (Hair et al., 2014). The reliability 
of the proposed model has been decided on the basis of fac-
tor loading and composite reliability (CR; Chin, 2010). 
Table 3 and Figure 2 demonstrates that all factor loadings 
and CR exceeded the recommended value of .70 that con-
firms the model reliability items and construct levels 
(Henseler et al., 2009). The validity of the measurement 
model has been assessed based on the average variance 
extracted (A VE) and CR (Hair et al., 2014). In Table 3, eval-
uation of the measurement model shows that A VE and CR 
for all constructs exceed the minimum acceptable value of 
.5 and .7, respectively, and provide support to the conver -
gent validity (Chin, 2010; Hair et al., 2014) as shown in 
Table 3. The reliability of an instrument is measured by 
using Cronbach’s alpha, which is based on internal consis-
tency. Table 3 and Figure 2 show that all values of factor 
loading are higher than the threshold level. All the values of 
Cronbach’s alpha were also higher than.7, which are shown 
in Table 3.
Discriminant validity of the model is determined through 
Fornell and Larcker (1981) criterion, which is assessed on 
the basis that “square root of the A VE of a construct (diago-
nal values) must be greater than the correlations among 
other constructs (off-diagonals values) in row and columns.” 
Table 4 shows the results of discriminant validity.
Evaluation of Structural Model
The findings are shown in Table 6, which represent beta val-
ues, t values, and significant values. Furthermore, the R
2 
index of the variables demonstrated an adequate level of pre-
dictability, which exceeded the suggested value (Falk & 
Miller, 1992; Hair et al., 2014).
Table 6 shows the results of the structural model from 
SmartPLS yield. Employees’ retention significantly moder -
ates the relationship among capacity building, managers’ 
support, and employee performance.
Table 6 and Figure 3 display the results of the structural 
model through PLS output. As the H1 suggests, capacity 
building has a positive impact on the employee performance 
of the textile sector in Pakistan. Table 6 and Figure 2 show 
positive β value of .536, which means 53% influence of 
capacity building on employees’ performance. The t value 
and p value show a significant relationship between capacity 
building and employees’ performance (β = .536, p < .05,  
t < 5.276). So, H1 is accepted. H2 explains that managers’ sup-
port has a positive relationship with employee performance. 
The t = 1.829 and p value of .068 show the insignificant 
relationship between managerial support and employees’

performance. The results show that H2 is rejected as the val-
ues are (β = .117, p = .068 <.05, t = 1.829 < 1.960). This 
study hypothesized that employee retention has a moderating 
effect on the relationship between capacity building and 
employee performance. Table 6 and Figure 2 highlight the 
positive β value of .093. The t value and p value show the 
significant moderating role of employee retention between 
managers’ support and employee performance. The t value 
and p values show significant values that support the H3  
(β = .093, p < .05, t < 2.981). Furthermore, employee reten-
tion also moderated the relationship between manager sup-
port and employee performance; the results show significant 
p value (β = .073, p < .05, t < 3.687). These results support 
the H4.
Discussion
The findings of this survey indicate that capacity building 
has a substantial effect on employee performance. According 
to Asfaw, Argaw, and Bayissa (2015) and Guest (1997), 
training and capacity building programs are important for 
HR development. According to Fletcher, Alfes, and Robinson 
(2018), capacity building has a significant impact on 
employee performance and employee retention. The impor -
tance of capacity building for employees’ development has 
included different training programs for enhancing an 
employee’s knowledge and skills to perform a task effi-
ciently and effectively. Some other studies also have similar 
findings such as Gul et al. (2012), which explore the impact 
of the capacity building on the employees’ performance in 
the banking sector of Pakistan. They found a significant 
impact of the capacity building on the employees’ perfor -
mance. Another study, conducted by Wanyama and Mutsotso, 
on commercial banks of Kenya, found a positive and signifi-
cant impact of the capacity building on employees’ produc-
tivity (Wanyama & Mutsotso, 2010). HR development plays 
an important role in improving the performance of all indus-
trial sectors of the economy; however, the textile industry 
has to face the challenges due to lack of skilled human capi-
tal and managerial support (Carroll, 2011). The result shows 
that capacity building of employees impacts the individual 
employees’ performance, which is influenced by the psycho-
logical, sociological, educational, physical, economic, and 
chance factors, increasing the probability of career develop-
ment of any individual over the lifespan (McDaniels & 
Gysbers, 1992; Otoo & Mishra, 2018), and capacity building

is the formal program, designed by the organization for the 
employees’ performance in an organization (Noe, 1996; 
O’Dwyer & Ryan, 2002; Wentland, 2003). These findings 
provide support for H2. H1 purposes the effect of managers’ 
support on employees’ performance. The findings show that 
manager support has a positive, but an insignificant impact 
on the employees’ performance. So, H1 is rejected. A study 
conducted by Ahmad et al. (2015) found that supervisory 
support has an insignificant but a positive effect on employ-
ees’ performance in Pakistan. However, Saleem and Amin 
(2013) found a positive and significant impact on firm per -
formance. Furthermore, Noe (1996) worked on position, and

managers’ support had a significant effect on the develop-
ment of an employee’s behavior
In H3, the study proposed that employees’ retention mod-
erates the relationship between manager support and employ-
ees’ performance. The findings show the significant 
moderating effect of employees’ retention on the relationship 
between managers’ support and employees’ performance. 
So, H3 is accepted, and our findings show that employee 
retention is supportive in improving the impact of capacity 
building and managerial support on employee performance. 
It is also illustrated that employee retention is the source of 
enhancement of trust and commitment among the employees 
who tend to acquire skillful knowledge and create culture of 
performance. In the context of the absorptive capacity the-
ory, the knowledge-based firms have been gaining immense 
popularity and valuable position due to the employee reten-
tion, which ultimately leads toward the knowledge acquisi-
tion and employee performance in the most helpful manner 
(Papa, Dezi, Gregori, Mueller, & Miglietta, 2018). Hence, 
the results of our research show that employee retention 
improves the effect of capacity building and manager sup-
port on employee performance. H3 and H4 are accepted. One 
potential reason for these phenomena is that retained employ-
ees show more commitment and trust toward the organiza-
tion and also learn more knowledge related to their job for 
sponsoring the innovative culture that enhances the employ-
ees’ performance (Soto-Acosta, Popa, & Palacios-Marqués, 
2017). Moreover, the absorptive capacity theory also sup-
ports our result, which is related to the moderating effect of 
employee retention (Cohen, 1983).
Conclusion
This study was conducted to explore the relationship among 
the capacity building, managers’ support, employee reten-
tion, and employees’ performance. The efficiency and effec-
tiveness are related to the employees’ performance, leading 
toward the overall progress in the textile sector. This research 
highlighted previous contributions of scholars, which dis-
cussed the factors affecting employees performance. 
Particularly, this research focuses on employees’ capacity 
building, and skill development of employees enhance the 
performance and productivity. Furthermore, the study deter-
mines the role of managers’ support toward his or her team 
members, which is not assistive to enhance employee 
performance. The results of the research show that managers’ 
support does not significantly affect the performance of tex-
tile industry employees. The research findings suggest that 
employee retention has a significant impact on the relation-
ship between manager support and employee performance in 
the textile sector of Pakistan. The retained employees are 
more experienced and capable of handling any situation in 
organizations, so their overall impact is positive on the 
employees’ performance, which provides opportunities for 
organizational growth. Employees’ capacity building 
improves the performance of employees is justified by this 
study. However, the managers’ support cannot significantly 
influence employee performance, but the moderating role of 
employees’ retention makes the relationship significant and 
has a significant role in employee development. Based on the 
results, the study recommended that employees’ capacity 
building is positively linked with the employees’ perfor -
mance. Therefore, firms should arrange training for employ-
ees with the collaboration of the HR department.
The first recommendation, regarding the employees of the 
industries of developing countries, is that they should give 
the utmost preference to the capacity building. The capacity 
building of an employee through training programs should 
be introduced to increase the knowledge, skills, and abilities 
of the employees. Capacity building and managers’ support 
can help to create a sustainable competitive advantage over 
other key players. It should be a continuous process as it con-
tributes to reducing the cost in the end. These things improve 
the efficacy power of employees, and they perform at their 
best of abilities. The retained and committed employees 
make a business successful, so they should be given full 
independence and authorization to make job decisions which 
produce better results.
Another significant social and manager implication of 
this study is that employers have to be compelled to establish 
the most suitable retention policies and strategies and also 
implement the proper bundle of internal customer retention 
practices for the growth and robust the relationship between 
capacity building and internal customer performance.
The importance of the development of intellectual capital 
is highly acknowledged to improve the employees’ perfor -
mance. Currently, the industries of developing countries 
probably need to identify and utilize the human capital of 
employees. The program should provide clear findings that 
draw out the result of the engagement of the coaching.

Recognition of individual weaknesses and strength and how 
they can be improved will ensure that the workers will per -
form better in future.
Limitations and Future Research
This study used cross-sectional data for the interpretation of 
the results in this study, but longitudinal data will give a 
clearer picture of the model. We used nonprobability sam-
pling technique for data collection, but usually, the results of 
probability sampling will be more valid for generalizing 
results. Due to the shortage of time, the sample size of this 
study was small. However, data can be collected from the 
textile industries of Pakistan. Owing to the deficiency of col-
laboration between leading and nonleading organizations, 
training institutes, and universities, it was difficult to collect 
sufficient data from the respondents as they are hesitant and 
do not share their technical knowledge, research, and devel-
opment with each other for the betterment of skills, capabil-
ity, and development of employees, which is helpful for the 
achievement of organizations’ goals.
