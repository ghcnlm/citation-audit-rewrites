abstract
Objective: This study aimed to explore the determinants inﬂuencing training transfer and evaluate how
those factors change over time among nurses who graduated from clinical nurse specialist training to
provide a theoretical basis for improving the training transfer of clinical nurse specialists (CNSs).
Methods: A quantitative longitudinal survey with four rounds of data collection was utilized to measure
the inﬂuencing aspects of training transfer from June 2018 to December 2019. A total of 46 new CNSs
participated in this study, including 30 and 16 nurses receiving training programs for CNSs in Infusion,
Wound and Ostomy. The factor inﬂuencing training transfer (FITT) questionnaire was used to collect data
for theﬁrst month (time 1), the third month (time 2), the sixth month (time 3), and theﬁrst year (time 4)
after training. This questionnaire contains 53 items divided intoﬁve dimensions, including managerial
support (20 items); hindrance in the organization (6 items); the validity of the training program (10
items); organizational and personal facilitators (11 items); and personal attitudes towards training
transfer (6 items).
Results: The inﬂuencing factors of CNSs transfer decreased over time, with managerial support, hin-
drance in the organization, the validity of the training program, and personal attitudes towards training
transfer changing statistically over time (P < 0.05), and no statistical difference in organizational and
personal facilitators over time (P ¼ 0.229). During early after training (theﬁrst month and the third
month after training), hindrance in the organization is the biggest obstacle to training transfer. During
the later of training (the sixth month andﬁrst year after the training), managerial support is the biggest
obstacle to training transfer. Overall level of inﬂuencing factors of training transfer decreased in three
months after training among Infusion nurses (P < 0.001), and Wound and Ostomy nurses decreased in
the ﬁrst year after training (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: The trend and level of training transfer predictors decreased depending on time. Clarifying
the factors inﬂuencing transfer and its patterns may help nursing managers enhance the implementation
and impact of nurse specialist training.

1. Introduction
The clinical nurse specialist (CNS) is a part of advanced practice
nursing (APN) and is deﬁned as an expert nurse with an enhanced
range of practical, theoretical, and research-based skills for patients
in a speciﬁc clinicalﬁeld [1e3]. The need for a knowledgeable and
skilled expert in nursing care delivery in the CNS has increased [4].
Numerous studies have indicated that the CNS is a valuable
resource that delivers high-quality care and enhances health out-
comes. In an emergency setting, the CNS provides effective triage,
extensive assessment, and direct care for patients, and appropriate
onward referral [4]. In addition, the CNS reduces hospital stay
length, improves clinical outcomes and safety in geriatric patients,
and speeds up patient discharge in surgery departments [5,6]. A
systematic review in palliative care showed that CNS-led in-
terventions effectively decrease rehospitalization, length of stay,
and health care costs [7]. Furthermore, CNS-led interventions are
associated with high patient satisfaction in the cancer department
[8].
To become a CNS, nurses must be trained and qualiﬁed to pro-
vide quality care effectively. However, education and training pro-
grams and credentials for CNSs vary in different countries [9]. In the
United States, CNS training programs include a minimum of 500
clinical hours within 1.5e3 years in length for master's degrees, 12
months in length for postgraduate programs, and a minimum of
1,000 clinical hours within 3e5 years for Doctors of Nursing Prac-
tice degrees [10]. In Africa, the most common qualiﬁcation in the
pediatric CNS is a 12-month postgraduate diploma [11].
In recent years, nursing education has placed a high priority on
specialized nurse training in China. According to the Health Care
Reform Plans of 2015 e2020, the Chinese government has
continued to increase its commitment to accelerating training for
the nursing workforce, improving education, continuing profes-
sional development, and growing training standards. One of these
actions is developing nurses’ training programs to encourage clin-
ical nurse specialists in various nursing specialties [12,13]. In China,
excellent nurses with more than two years of working experience
can become CNSs after completing training programs held by
universities or nursing associations at the national or provincial
levels. Although the educational requirement for nurses to be
trained as CNS is moving toward a master’s degree, as in other
countries in China, the education experience of CNS was not strictly
required during our study period [14]. The length of CNS training
programs varies from two to three months based on the type of
specialty, with a common requirement of 160 h for theoretical and
clinical practice, except for the intensive care unit specialized
training program, which requires 320 clinical hours. However,
theoretical courses for geriatric CNS training programs vary from 1
to 3 months, and clinical practice varies from 1 to 12 months
[15,16].
Transfer of training or training transfer is de
ﬁned as the degree
to which the knowledge, skills, and attitudes acquired during work-
related training are employed on the job and maintained over a
period of time [17,18]. Unfortunately, although much effort and
money have been invested in training, only a small amount of
knowledge, skills, and behaviors learned from training are utilized
in job performance, resulting in low training transfer of training,
including CNS training [19e22].
Baldwin and Fords (1988) constructed a transfer process model
that includes trainee characteristics, training design, and the work
environment as determinants contributing to training transfer [17].
Using this model, some later studies corroborated and strength-
ened how trainees’ motivation and self-efﬁcacy, transfer climate,
work environment support, and opportunity to implement training
skills, which are training input components, support the transfer of
training [23e25]. However, in previous research, the transfer
determinant was only measured once without considering how
these factors change over time. Alongside the undeniable signiﬁ-
cance of measuring training transfer factors, examining how these
determinants change over time is equally crucial to gaining insight
into the training transfer process. Understanding training transfer
determinants and dynamics is crucial for hospital administrators to
provide appropriate support, while for the government, it is
necessary for policy formulation and evaluation.
Taken together, training transfer for CNS is quite important. This
study investigated the factors that inﬂuence training transfer and
how these aspects change over time after CNS training. This eval-
uation will beneﬁt CNS training programs in China and provide
references and evidence for optimizing training transfer among
specialist nurses in other countries.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
A longitudinal quantitative research design survey study was
utilized to explore factors inﬂuencing training transfer and how
those aspects change over time among nurses who completed
clinical nurse specialist training. Four rounds of data collection
were conducted between June 2018 and December 2019.
2.2. Study setting and participants
The study site was located in Yunnan, Southwest China, with a
total of 16 districts. The Health Commission of Yunnan Province
held the CNS training programs to guarantee training quality; the
number of participants is usually less than 30 for each program
every year. The sample included nurses receiving training programs
for CNSs in Infusion (September to November 2018) and Wound
and Ostomy (July to September 2018). All nurses who passed the
CNS qualiﬁcation exam were invited to participate in this study at
the end of the training.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. General information
Participants’ demographic data and occupation-related charac-
teristics, including gender, age, marital status, education level,
years worked, working department, professional titles, were
collected.
2.3.2. The factors inﬂuencing training transfer questionnaire
The factors inﬂuencing training transfer (FITT) questionnaire
assessed factors that facilitate or impede training transfer. This
questionnaire was initially developed by Ma, et al. by conducting
interviews with nurses and performing a comprehensive assess-
ment of the relevant literature [26,27]. This questionnaire contains
53 items divided intoﬁve dimensions, including managerial sup-
port (20 items, such as organizational policy demonstrating the
positive link between the utilization of training content and the
reward of trainees; opportunities for use; adequate resources; co-
ordination between departments); hindrance in the organization (6
items, such as opposition from their coworkers and limited pro-
fessional development); the validity of the training program (10
items, such as training content and instruction methods); organi-
zational and personal facilitators (11 items, such as organizational
culture beneﬁting training transfer, self-ef ﬁcacy and colleague
support); and individual attitudes towards training transfer (6
items, the attitudes of trainees towards whether or not training
content is used in practice). The items were answered on a seven-

point Likert scale ranging from 1¼ strongly disagree to 7¼ strongly
agree. The total mean score indicates the level of training transfer
factors, and the higher the total mean score is, the greater the
likelihood that training transfer will occur [27]. In addition, the
mean score in each dimension shows the extent to which it sup-
ports or discourages transfer. The construct validity of the FITT
questionnaire was measured by exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
and conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA), which indicated a moder-
ately goodﬁt for the instrument [27]. The Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient
for the questionnaire was 0.965, and theﬁve dimensions ranged
from 0.869 to 0.964, indicating good internal consistency [27,28].
The created item was subsequently assessed for content validity
through expert assessment. Subsequently, the psychometric char-
acteristics of the ultimate tool were evaluated in a cohort of 960
nurses who had undergone training [27].
2.4. Data collection
This study was a voluntary survey that required participants to
submit answers using postal without any incentive for participants
or drop-out follow-up. The data were collected in theﬁrst month,
the third month, the sixth month, and theﬁrst year post-training.
These intervals were chosen because previous research indicates
that training transfer can diminish either immediately after
training or after more than one year [29e31]. We increased the
time intervals to observe theﬂuctuations and patterns over the
year. Respondents received an invitation letter containing an in-
formation sheet about this study and informed consent. If the
nurses agreed to join the study, they obtained four anonymous
envelopes within each envelope, including a demographic sheet
and the FITT questionnaire. In each envelope, the data for theﬁrst
month (time 1), the third month (time 2), the sixth month (time 3),
and the ﬁrst year (time 4) after training were recorded, which
explained the time at which participants needed to open and
complete the questionnaire. The researcher reminded the partici-
pants via WeChat to complete the questionnaire at each time point.
After completing the questionnaire, depending on when it was
written, the participants returned it to the researchers in a sealed
envelope. Among the 78 participants, 46 completed all the ques-
tionnaires at four time points, resulting in a response rate of 59%.
This level of response may be attributed to the survey’s repetition,
which is likely to induce participant tiredness and thus lead to a
decreased response rate [ 32]. Additionally, previous research
revealed a 25%e39% response rate for longitudinal surveys without
personal approaches and an approximately 10.5%e57.5% response
rate for postal surveys [33e35]. However, although 30 is frequently
employed as the minimum sample size in quantitative survey
research, there is currently no agreement on the minimum sample
size for a longitudinal study [36].
2.5. Ethical considerations
This study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of Kunming
Medical University. Participants were provided with written details
regarding the objectives and methods of the study and their
freedom to withdraw from the study at any point. The researchers
guaranteed that their identities would remain anonymous and that
their shared information would be kept conﬁdential.
2.6. Data analysis
Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied in
this study using SPSS version 26 software. Patients with incomplete
data during the one-year follow-up were excluded, and only
complete data were analyzed. Repeated measures within-subject
ANOVA were used to analyze each dimension of the factors of
training transfer among all nurse specialists without dividing it
based on the nurse specialist groups. In addition, we conducted a
repeated-measures ANOVA within-subject and between-subject to
measure the overall factors inﬂuencing training transfer in each
nurse specialist group. The prior assumptions were explored, such
as normality using the Kolmogorov‒Smirnov test, sphericity eval-
uation using Mauchly’s test, and GreenhouseeGeisser adjustment,
where sphericity was violated. A Bonferroni post hoc correction
was adopted to identify pairwise differences in training transfer
factors and their dimensions between time intervals. A signiﬁcant
difference according to repeated-measures ANOVA was deﬁned as
P < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Participant characteristics
A total of 46 new nurse specialists participated in this study,
including 30 and 16 nurses receiving training programs for CNSs in
Infusion and Wound and Ostomy. The ages of the 46 participants
ranged from 21 to 55 years, with a mean working years of 13.37. A
total of 3 (6.5%) nurses were junior, 26 nurses (56.5%) were inter-
mediate,17 (37.0%) nurses were senior. Of the nurses, 10 (21.7%) had
an associate degree, 35 (76.1%) had a bachelor’s degree, and 1 (2.2%)
had a master’s degree. Regarding gender, most participants were
female, constituting approximately 65.2%, while males constituted
34.8%.
3.2. Factors inﬂuencing training transfer among new clinical nurse
specialists
Table 1 presents the ﬁve factors inﬂuencing training transfer,
and Fig. 1 shows the trajectory among all the nurse specialists,
regardless of group. Repeated-measures ANOVA within-subject
analysis revealed that some dimensions ﬂuctuated and differed
for one year.
The managerial support dimension decreased at each interval
and became the lowest factor supporting training transfer after one
year of training (P < 0.001). However, the signiﬁcant hindrance
initially emerged in the organization diminished with time
(P < 0.001). In addition, the validity of the training decreased within
six months after the training (P < 0.001). The trend observed in the
last two dimensions can be summarized as follows: the organiza-
tional and personal facilitators only exhibited changes between the
sixth month and one year after training (P < 0.001). However, in-
dividual attitudes toward training transfer decreased after one year
(P < 0.05).
3.3. The trajectory of factors inﬂuencing training transfer among
different nurse specialists
Repeated-measures ANOVA with and without a Greenhouse‒
Geisser correction showed that the overall inﬂuencing factors of
training transfer and two groups(infusion, wound and ostomy)
training transfer factors differed over time (P < 0.001). Post hoc
analyses utilizing the Bonferroni correction demonstrated the
period during which the factors inﬂuencing training transfer scores
changed. The trajectory of each group from baseline to the last time
point is displayed inFig. 2.
Compared to time 1, the infusion group experienced a sub-
stantial decrease in time 2 (P
< 0.001), and there were also note-
worthy disparities between time 3 and time 4 (P < 0.001). Although
it shows a similar declining trend, the trajectory shown by the
wound and ostomy group changed only after one year, which was

time 4 (P ¼ 0.001) compared to the initial time.
4. Discussion
This study provided novel insight into the determinants that
impact the transfer of training and how these variables change over
time after training for nurse specialists. Five factors inﬂuenced
training transfer that decreased differently during the year
following training among nurses receiving training for qualiﬁca-
tions such as CNSs. Interestingly, the two groups of nurse specialists
exhibited similar trends, with diverse levels of overall inﬂuencing
training transfer factors. In general, the aspects facilitating the
transfer of training diminished with time; however, they began to
decline substantially across the two groups at different times.
4.1. Factors inﬂuencing training transfer among all clinical nurse
specialists
Generally, managerial support decreased over time and ulti-
mately became the lowest factor of training transfer. This trend
shows that trainees’ perceptions of support to implement new
training skills, knowledge, and behaviors from peers, supervisors,
and organizations tend to decrease. The lack of support could
impede training transfer and sustainment [37]; this may occur
among newly certiﬁed nursing specialists, as not all hospitals in
China have specialized posts for these nurses or are still under
development. As a result, nurses who have completed specialized
training may return to departments and occupational contexts
unrelated to their area of expertise [38]. In addition, although the
CNS is legally recognized and accepted by their hospital, there
currently needs to be a national law to establish speciﬁc roles and
structured career paths for nurse specialists. This study emphasizes
the importance of policymakers and managers focusing on training,
providing regulation, and tailored assistance speciﬁc to nursing
specialties. Moreover, training transfer support should be started
immediately following the training session and within three
months after the training.
The dimension of hindrance in the organization became the
greatest burden in the early months of training transfer, although
this obstacle sharply decreased over time; this probably occurred
during the initial transfer process because of the inability of col-
leagues or organizations to change initially. Indeed, people prefer
no change or action in many circumstances, mainly when they
think more time, energy, and high risk will be required [ 39].
Changes that occur throughout the process of transfer learning
frequently elicit resistance and conﬂict from colleagues, ultimately
causing nurses to abandon their efforts in knowledge and skill
dissemination [30]. This effect might be associated with the
“guanxi orientation,” which motivates many Chinese people to
establish and sustain positive relationships and harmony that

might be disrupted through changing processes [40]. While this
study validated the presence of obstacles inside the organization
during the initial transfer of training, it is crucial to allocate sufﬁ-
cient autonomy to nurse specialists to continue implementing their
training and achieve tangible outcomes. By implementing this
approach, the resistance level decreases, potentially encouraging
other nurses to engage in ongoing training transfers.
Training validity declined tremendously until the sixth month
after training. This trend indicated that nurses’ perceptions of
training content needed to be more sufﬁciently relevant and were
less valuable to their work. This is likely due to the outdated
training content that nurses no longer use in their practice. Previ-
ous studies support theﬁnding that unmatched learning content in
the workplace hinders learning transfer [41].
Formal clinical nurse specialist training programs in China are
provided at different levels. Usually, nurse associations that have
received recognition from the provincial or national government
and public universities are responsible for developing training
programs for nurses [16,42,43]. Thus far, there needs to be more
universally adopted guidelines for training nurse specialists among
training providers. Hence, there is no assurance that the quality of
the training delivered will be consistent when conducted by nurse
associations at varying levels or in different regions. Specialist
nurses are not required to undergo a national examination or cer-
tiﬁcation. This problem has been corroborated by previous
research, which asserts a deﬁciency in standardized assessment
criteria for nurse specialist training and a scarcity of evidence-
based tools to evaluate its quality [44]. Therefore, this study high-
lights the importance of ongoing evaluation and enhancement of
current nursing specialist training.
As the greatest factor, personal attitudes towards training
transfer also changed during the transfer process. This aspect
demonstrates nurses’ willingness to learn and share acquired skills
and knowledge, which is also likely inﬂuenced by other factors,
such as their belief in training utility and environmental support
[45]. Earlier research also revealed that competitive work cultures
in China cause nurses to hoard their training knowledge and abil-
ities and hesitate to share them [30,46]. Hence, despite the positive
outcomes shown in recent studies, it is imperative that we continue
to thoroughly evaluate and choose potential nurses based on
organizational criteria and the personal attributes of the trainees to
enhance the effectiveness of training transfer.
The most stable factor affecting the training transfer was the
organizational and personal facilitator, which gradually decreased
effectiveness from the sixth month to one year following the
training. This ﬁnding apparently indicated little alteration in the
organizational learning climate, neither resistance nor support [47].
The relative stability of this dimension possibly maintains nurses’
self-efﬁcacy as a personal facilitator in the transfer process [48].
This study posits that external aspects may exert a more substantial
inﬂuence on impeding the process of transferring training than
trainee attributes. Nevertheless, further investigation is required
since the current study did not cover this topic.
4.2. Factors affecting training transfer among different clinical
nurse specialist groups
Fig. 2shows, in the Infusion group, a signiﬁcant decrease in the
overall aspects inﬂuencing training transfer started in the third
month after training and continuously declined at subsequent time
points. According to a previous study, training transfer generally
decays three months after training, partly resulting from the
trainee’s lack of chance to apply what they have obtained from
training [34,49]. Notably, unlike wound and ostomy nurses who
mostly practice in wound-related departments, the infusion nurses
in this study are employed in several departments that do not
pertain to their expertise. Infusion nurses work as general clinical
nurses and only perform as specialists “part-time” when some
departments need special skills. The plausible reason behind the
above conditions is the nursing shortage, which pressures nurses,
regardless of their title and specialty, toﬁnish basic workﬁrst [50].
Therefore, the training transfer in this group declined signiﬁcantly
over time.
According to previous research, although learning transfer can
decrease immediately after training to more than one year after
training, the transfer can still be maintained in the third month
until the eighth month after training [29e31]. In this research, the
factors supporting training transfer in the Wound and Ostomy
group might be maintained successfully, yet a booster intervention
may be needed at some time points to return the transfer of

training support to the baseline condition [21].
Fig. 2 reveals that the greatest training transfers might have
occurred in the Wound and Ostomy group. These results may be
related to the rapid development of wound care and ostomy nurses
in China [51]. Since establishing the Wound, Ostomy, and Conti-
nence (WOC) professional committee of the Chinese Nurse Asso-
ciation (CNA) in 2003, WOC nurses have received signi ﬁcant
support in promoting educational, clinical, and research resources
for advancing practice and offering guidance for clinical nursing. In
addition, the WOC nurse licensing scheme in China is ofﬁcially
approved by the World Council of Enterostomal Therapists (WCET),
indicating that nurses’ wound care certiﬁcation is recognized na-
tionally and internationally [52]. Thus, WOC nurses are strong and
well-developed CNSs in China. In addition to the beneﬁt of work-
places being speciﬁc to specialists, the notable acknowledgments
received by wound and ostomy nurses in this study prompted
participants to sense an improved opportunity and facilitators for
transferring their knowledge. These explanations elucidated the
factors that contributed to this group’s outstanding level and tra-
jectory of training transfer.
4.3. Implications for clinical nurse specialists
The number of clinical nurse specialists in China is still in its
infancy [16], and this study indicates some obstacles in imple-
menting training among clinical nurse specialists. Hence, it is
imperative to develop training implementation strategies that align
with the particular needs of nursing specialists to enhance training
transfer in practical settings. The existence of regulations clarifying
the duties and responsibilities of specialist nurses after completing
a training program is also crucial.
In addition, the trend of training transfer factors in recent ana-
lyses highlights the substantial decline of training transfer facili-
tators at some point, which might indicate the necessity of stimulus
actions supporting positive transfer in clinical nurse specialist
training. Nevertheless, the results obtained in this study suggest
that the initial booster post-training intervention should be
promptly started after training and should be completed within
three months for nursing specialists. Further measures might be
implemented between six months and one year after training for
the infusion groups and between the third month and one year
following training for the wound and ostomy groups.
4.4. Limitations
This study examined the important predictors of training
transfer, but the most inﬂuential components among all the vari-
ables investigated were not speciﬁcally identiﬁed. It is important to
note that more than these ﬁndings are needed to provide a
comprehensive justiﬁcation for the level of implementation of
training because we cannot assure whether all nurse specialists in
this study work as full-time CNSs. Further research is required to
observe and objectively ascertain the percentage of training
implementation and its subsequent impact on practice. In addition,
since this is a pilot study, the limitation pertains to including nurses
from two distinct specialized clinical nurse areas from 16 districts
within a province in China. Therefore, the information provided
may only encompass some CNSs in China. Meanwhile, objective
evaluation is needed for further research.
5. Conclusions
Our ﬁndings revealed that factors supporting training transfer
degrade over time. The training transfer predictors level of both
groups decreased, but the infusion group decreased more. In
addition, this study highlights the essential time for starting and
continuing booster transfer interventions to reinforce learning
transfer in each specialist group. Posttraining booster intervention
is suggested to improve some dimensions, such as managerial
support, and address the hindrance in the organization; it is also
essential to continuously update the content before delivering CNS
training to increase its relevance and applicability in clinical prac-
tice. Furthermore, it is imperative to establish regulations about the
work and obligations of nurse specialists. This step is essential in
facilitating the execution of specialized activities and, eventually,
affecting the quality of nursing practice and the well-being of
patients.
