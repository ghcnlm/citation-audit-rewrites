ABSTRACT
This study examined the impact of a job crafting intervention based on job demands-resources
(JD-R) theory. We hypothesized that the in tervention would influence participants ’ job crafting

hypothesized a positive impact of the interv ention on work engagement and self-rated job
performance. The study used a quasi-experim ental design with a control group. Teachers

During the last decade, empirical research has revealed
that employees ’ work engagement is positively related to
organizational performance. A n influential theory through
which we can understand work engagement and its ante-
cedents and outcomes (e.g., job performance) is job
demands-resources (JD-R) theory (Bakker & Demerouti,
2014). Accordingly, work engagement and performance
can be increased through interventions by targeting the
most important job demands and (job and personal)
resources (Bakker & Demerouti, 2014). One way to achieve
this is to encourage employees to proactively optimize
their own job demands and resources. This proactive beha-
viour is also known as job crafting. Stimulating job crafting
behaviour with a job crafting intervention might be a
promising tool for enhancing employee work engagement
and performance.
Recently, a few job crafting intervention studies have been
published (Van den Heuvel, Demerouti, & Peeters,2012; Van
Wingerden, Bakker & Derks, 2016), but none of these have
investigated the sustainability of the effects over time. The
present study contributes to JD-R theory and to the literature
on job crafting by offering a first intervention study that takes
longitudinal effects into account. In addition, this is one of the
first quasi-experimental intervention studies that created
awareness about the current state of participants’job design,
in terms of their job demands and resources, and the oppor-
tunities participants had to craft their job. The central aim of
the present study is to assess the impact of a job crafting
intervention on work engagement and performance both
immediately after the intervention and 1 year later.
Theoretical background
The rapid technological and economic changes that are char-
acteristic of our society today force organizations and their
employees to constantly adapt. For example, teachers can no
longer just use their blackboard but have to work with digital
devices and learning software as well. Thus, advances outside
organizations directly influence employees’jobs. As a conse-
quence, employees may be forced to change their work pro-
cesses. Additionally, employees may also proactively try to
change their jobs themselves. Proactive changes employees
make in their job design is known as job crafting— the focal
variable of the present study.
Job crafting
Many years before the term “job crafting” was coined by
Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001), several studies had already
suggested that employees make self-initiated changes at work
(Nicholson, 1984; Staw & Boettger, 1990). A significant rede-
sign of the work may be accomplished without anyone actu-
ally executing a planned change programme (Kulik, Oldham, &
Hackman, 1987). According to LePine and Van Dyne (1998)
these proactive changes that employees make in their job
design usually focus on resolving problems for the organiza-
tion. According to the conventional definitions of job crafting
(Tims, Bakker, & Derks, 2012; Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001),
employees proactively initiate changes in their work environ-
ment to optimize the fit between their jobs and their personal
needs, abilities, and passions. Thus, the changes employees
make through job crafting focus on optimizing their personal

situation. However, interestingly, research has revealed that
job crafting is an approach to job design that may lead to
both individual and organizational outcomes. Individual out-
comes include better health, well-being, and work engage-
ment (Bakker, Rodriquez-Munoz, & Sanz-Vergel, 2016;
Demerouti & Bakker, 2014). According to Wrzesniewski and
Dutton (2001), employees may craft their jobs by changing
cognitive, task, and/or relational boundaries to shape interac-
tions and relationships with others at work. Through job craft-
ing, employees change the design and social environment of
their job.
Because job crafting involves initiating changes in job
design, Tims et al. (2012) operationalized job crafting accord-
ing to the types of job characteristics suggested by the JD-R
theory.
Accordingly, every job consists of job demands and
resources. Through job crafting, employees can optimize
their job demands and resources, which may result in high
levels of work engagement and performance (Bakker &
Demerouti, 2014). Tims and colleagues argued that job craft-
ing entails the changes individuals make in their level of job
demands and job resources by increasing social job resources
(e.g., asking for feedback and coaching), increasing structural
job resources (e.g., increasing autonomy and creating oppor-
tunities to develop oneself at work), increasing challenging
job demands (e.g., starting new projects), or by decreasing
hindering job demands (e.g., reducing workload). Through job
crafting, employees can improve the fit between their jobs
and their personal needs, abilities, and passions. Since the
introduction and conceptualization of job crafting within the
JD-R model (Tims et al.,2012), several studies based on this
conceptualization and definition were published (e.g., Bakker
& Demerouti, 2014; Lu, Wang, Lu, Du & Bakker, 2014; Tims,
Bakker, & Derks,2013). In addition, over the last few years the
first studies with an intervention design also taking this
approach as a starting point were published. Van den Heuvel
et al. (2012) showed that a job crafting intervention could
successfully encourage employees to adapt their job demands
and job resources. Further, in a qualitative job crafting inter-
vention study among teachers by Van Wingerden, Derks,
Bakker, and Dorenbosch ( 2013), participants indicated that
they became more aware of the importance of continuously
crafting their job. These studies suggest that a job crafting
intervention (i.e., a training) can indeed increase employees’
job crafting behaviours.
The intervention designs used in the studies by Van den
Heuvel et al. (2012) and Van Wingerden et al. (2013) were
based on JD-R theory (Bakker & Demerouti, 2014). One of
the core assumptions of the JD-R theory is that every job is
characterized by a set of job demands and (job and personal)
resources. Besides these job demands and resources, job craft-
ing is included as a core element within JD-R theory (Bakker &
Demerouti, 2014). According to JD-R theory, employees can
optimize the balance between their job demands and
resources through job crafting. Having an optimal level of
job demands and resources is an important precondition for
work engagement, and, consequently performance.
Furthermore, JD-R theory states that engaged employees are
more capable of mobilizing their own resources and
(challenging) demands. The process of mobilizing resources
and (challenging) demands is referred to as job crafting.
Altogether, this explains why, theoretically speaking, job craft-
ing is promising strategy to foster work engagement and
good performance. First, job crafting can contribute to an
optimal balance between demands and resources. Second,
once employees become engaged, enduring job crafting
behaviour can help them to sustain their engagement and
their performance levels.
The job crafting intervention study by Van den Heuvel and
colleagues (2012) examined short-term effects by measuring
2 weeks after the participants have participated in the inter-
vention. There are, as far as we know, no job crafting inter-
vention studies that have investigated possible long-term
effects. However, both for theory and practice it is important
to examine the sustainability of the job crafting effects in term
of increased work engagement and performance. In this study,
we will therefore measure the effects both 2 weeks and 1 year
after the participants have participated in the job crafting
intervention (based on JD-R theory). Our first hypothesis
reads as follows:
Hypothesis 1: Participants’ level of job crafting will signifi-
cantly increase after the job crafting intervention (T2 and T3)
both compared to their level prior to the intervention (T1) and
compared to a control group.
Job demands and resources
Job demands and resources are the core elements of the job
crafting approach developed by Tims and colleagues (2012).
Job demands refer to those physical, psychological, social, or
organizational aspects of the job that require physical and/or
psychological effort and are associated with certain physiolo-
gical and/or psychological costs (Demerouti, Bakker,
Nachreiner, & Schaufeli,2001). Job demands that are typically
found in the educational field are a high workload, and high
levels of emotional and cognitive demands (Hakanen, Bakker,
& Schaufeli,2006; Koppes, De Vroome, Mol, Janssen & Van den
Bossche, 2011). Job demands can be challenging, but may
turn into job stressors when meeting those demands requires
a major effort from employees (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007).
Research revealed that a majority (67%) of the employees
working in the educational field perceive their job demands
are too demanding (Van Grinsven, Elphick, & Van der Woud,
2012). Governmental policies are therefore focussing on
actions to lower the high job demands (Jettinghoff, Van Dijk
& Scheeren,2014). We argue that employees’themselves may
proactively adapt their job demands through job crafting.
Job resources are those physical, psychological, social or
organizational aspects of the job that are functional in achiev-
ing work goals, reducing job demands and the associated
costs, or stimulating personal growth and development
(Demerouti et al.,2001). Job resources that are important for
teachers are feedback, and opportunities for professional
development (Hakanen et al., 2006). Feedback from school
principals, students, or colleagues gives teachers information
about their performance at work, which increases the

likelihood of being successful in achieving work goals (Bakker
& Bal, 2010). Through opportunities for professional develop-
ment teachers can learn and apply new knowledge and skills
that will improve their performance on the job (Colbert,
Brown, Choi, & Thomas, 2008). A longitudinal field study by
Tims et al. (2012) showed a significant increase in levels of
feedback, and opportunities for professional development
between employees who actively crafted their jobs and
those who did not. Thus, through job crafting employees
can optimize their work environment, which may result in an
increase in their job resources.
In the current intervention study, participants make a per-
sonal job crafting plan and are encouraged to put the plan
into action at their workplace. By doing this, participants may
experience how they can optimize their own work environ-
ment. In line with the job crafting approach of Tims et al.
(2013) and the educational context of this study, we propose
that participants’ job demands will decrease after the job
crafting intervention and in contrast their job resources will
increase. Or, more formally, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2: Participants’ levels of workload (2a) and emo-
tional demands (2b), will significantly decrease after the job
crafting intervention (T2 and T3) both compared to their level
prior to the intervention (T1) and compared to a control group.
Hypothesis 3: Participants’ levels of feedback (3a), and oppor-
tunities for professional development (3b) will significantly
increase after the job crafting intervention (T2 and T3) both
compared to their level prior to the intervention (T1) and com-
pared to a control group.
In addition to the proposed intervention effects, our theore-
tical arguments suggest that a job crafting intervention influ-
ences job demands through (changes in) job crafting
behaviour. In line with JD-R theory (2014), we propose that
the relationship between the job crafting intervention and job
demands is mediated by (changes in) job crafting behaviour.
Further, we propose a similar mediation for job resources.
Thus, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2c: J.ob crafting behaviour mediates the relation-
ship between the job crafting intervention and participants’ job
demands.
Hypothesis 3c: Job crafting behaviour mediates the relation-
ship between the job crafting intervention and participants’ job
resources.
Personal resources
Employees who proactively craft their job give direction and
meaning to their work life. Through job crafting, employees
may experience that they are in control of their work environ-
ment, which may contribute to their personal resources.
Personal resources have been defined as aspects of the self
that are commonly associated with resiliency and individuals’
sense of ability to control and impact upon their environment
successfully (Hobfoll, Johnson, Ennis, & Jackson, 2003).
Examples of personal resources are hope, optimism, resilience,
and self-efficacy (Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio,2007). A study by
Bakker and Xanthopoulou (2013) revealed that resilience and
self-efficacy are important personal resources in the educa-
tional field. Resilience is characterized by positive coping and
adaptation in the face of significant risk or adversity (Masten,
2001). Applied to the workplace, resilience is defined as the
“positive psychological capacity to rebound, to‘bounce back’
from adversity, uncertainty, conflict, failure, or even positive
change, progress, and increased responsibility” (Luthans, 2002,
p. 702). Self-efficacy can be defined as the “beliefs in one’s
capabilities to organize and execute the course of action
required to produce given attainments” (Bandura, 1996, p. 3).
Employees who are self-efficacious have the confidence to
take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at challen-
ging tasks (Luthans et al., 2007). According to JD-R theory
(Bakker & Demerouti,2014), personal resources are important
predictors of motivation and these resources can be optimized
through job crafting. Employees who adapt their work envir-
onment through job crafting may, for example, feel self-effi-
cacious because they experience they can proactively
optimize their work situation.
In addition, Berg, Dutton, and Wrzesniewski ( 2007)
argued that job crafting leads to various positive outcomes
like an increase of personal resources because active job
crafters experience increased competence and feel able to
cope with future adversity. For example, employees may
aim to increase their structur al job resources by develop-
ing themselves professionally .E m p l o y e e sc a np r o f e s s i o n a l
develop themselves by following a masterclass, training, or
course, but also by learning on the job from their collea-
gues. In both situations, employees need to discuss the
possibilities (from practical, financial, and time perspective)
with their supervisor and/or their co-workers. It therefore
m a yt a k es o m et i m et os t a r ta n dc o m p l e t et h ei n t e n d e d
professional development, which over time may result in
increased levels of job resources. Professionally developing
oneself may not only help to gain new knowledge and
skills that can be applied in the job, but may also
strengthen one ’s self-efficacy. Therefore, it is to be
expected that employees will undertake similar initiatives
in the future. In line with JD-R theory ( 2014), a recent
intervention study revealed that participants ’ levels of
self-efficacy significantly increased after a job crafting
training (Van den Heuvel, Demerouti & Peters, 2015).
In the present intervention study, participants were encour-
aged to proactively adapt their job demands and job
resources. By doing this, participants may optimize their levels
of demands and resources and experience control over their
work environment, which may foster resilience and self-effi-
cacy. We therefore propose that participants ’ personal
resources would significantly increase after the job crafting
intervention. We hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4: Participants’ levels of resilience (4a) and self-
efficacy (4b) will significantly increase after the job crafting
intervention (T2 and T3) both compared to their level prior to
the intervention (T1) and compared to a control group.

In addition to the proposed intervention effects, our theo-
retical arguments suggest that a job crafting intervention
influences personal resources through (changes in) job craft-
ing behaviour. In line with JD-R theory (2014), we propose that
the relation between the job crafting intervention and perso-
nal resources is mediated by (changes in) job crafting beha-
viour. Thus, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4c: Job crafting behaviour mediates the relation-
ship between the job crafting intervention and participants ’
personal resources.
Work engagement and job performance
Work engagement is defined as a positive, fulfilling, work-
related state of mind that is characterized by vigour, dedica-
tion, and absorption (Schaufeli, Salanova, González-romá, &
Bakker, 2002, p. 74). Vigour is characterized by mental resili-
ence and high levels of energy during the workday, the will-
ingness to put effort into one’s work, and persistence even in
the face of difficulties. Dedication refers to employees’strong
involvement and their experience of significance, enthusiasm,
inspiration, pride, and challenge at work. Finally, absorption is
characterized by being fully focused and happily engrossed in
one’s work, where time passes quickly. Work engagement can
be predicted using the JD-R model (Bakker & Demerouti,
2014), in which job and personal resources are postulated to
be the most important predictors. The JD-R model suggests
that the combination of high demands and high resources
leads to high levels of motivation, involvement, and work
engagement (Tuckey, Bakker, & Dollard,2012), which in turn
leads to high levels of performance (Bakker & Demerouti,
2014). Employees may be able to increase their own work
engagement and performance through job crafting by opti-
mizing their job demands and resources. Several survey and
diary studies have revealed a positive relationship between
job crafting and work engagement (e.g., Bakker, Tims, & Derks,
2012; Petrou, Demerouti, Peeters, Schaufeli, & Hetland,2012)
and between job crafting and performance (e.g., Bakker et al.,
2012; Lyons,2008; Tims et al.,2012). While there are numerous
definitions of job performance, in this study we are specifically
interested in in-role performance. In-role performance is
defined as those officially required outcomes and behaviours
that directly serve the goals of the organization (Motowidlo &
Van Scotter,1994). In the educational field, Leana, Appelbaum,
and Shevchuk (2009) have found that educators who took part
in collaborative job crafting (in which employees work
together to redesign their jobs) displayed improved perfor-
mance compared with those who did not engage in job
crafting.
A job crafting intervention may teach employees how to
optimize their work environment and improve the fit between
their job and their personal needs, abilities, and passions,
which may result in higher work engagement and improved
performance (Demerouti & Bakker,2011). In this intervention
study, participants are encouraged to optimize their own work
environment through job crafting during a period of 4 weeks.
Consequently, participants’ own job crafting behaviour is an
essential part of the intervention. By experiencing how job
crafting can contribute to their work life, participants may
continue to engage in job crafting after the intervention and
integrate it with their common job activities. Employees may
use the job crafting skills when their work environment
changes or when personal needs change, which enables
them to stay engaged and perform well. We hypothesize:
Hypothesis 5: Participants’ levels of (a) work engagement and
(b) in-role performance will significantly increase after the job
crafting intervention (T2 and T3) both compared to their level
prior to the intervention (T1) and compared to a control group.
In addition to the proposed intervention effects, our theo-
retical arguments suggest that a job crafting intervention
influences work engagement and performance through
(changes in) job crafting behaviour. In line with JD-R theory
(2014), we propose that the relation between the job crafting
intervention and work engagement is mediated by (changes
in) job crafting behaviour. Further, we propose a similar med-
iation of the relation between the job crafting intervention
and performance. Thus, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 5c: Job crafting behaviour mediates the relation-
ship between the job crafting intervention and participants’ work
engagement.
Hypothesis 5d: Job crafting behaviour mediates the relation-
ship between the job crafting intervention and participants ’
performance.
Method
Participants and procedure
The sample consists of 62 female (83%) and 13 male teachers
(17%) who work at primary schools for children with special
educational needs. These percentages are representative for
the occupational group. The mean age of the participants was
45 years (SD = 10.05), and 87% successfully finished a higher
vocational education or university education in special educa-
tion needs. The participants worked at two different schools of
the same organization. Because of practical reasons, partici-
pants of the intervention groups and the control group were
grouped by location, resulting in a quasi-experimental design.
By following this procedure, we avoided contamination
effects, where members of the experimental groups influence
members of the control group or vice versa (Cook & Campbell,
1979). Of the 75 teachers who were contacted to participate,
45 participants took part in the job crafting intervention, while
30 participants were assigned to the control group. The tea-
chers participated voluntarily and did not receive any com-
pensation for their contribution.
There were three measurements in time. The first measure-
ment took place 2 weeks before the start of the intervention;
the second measurement took place 2 weeks after the inter-
vention was completed; the third measurement took place
110 J. V. WINGERDEN ET AL.
<<<PAGE=6>>>
1 year after the second measurement (see alsoFigure 1). All 75
participants completed the first and second questionnaire
(100% response rate), while 71 participants completed the
third questionnaire (95% response rate). Two weeks before
the start of the intervention, the managing director introduced
the first questionnaire in an email containing instructions and
a link to the online questionnaire. The procedure and goals of
the study were explained, while also addressing the anonym-
ity of the data. One week before the start, the participants
received a reminder to fill in the questionnaire and additional
information about the content of the intervention. Two weeks
after the intervention was completed, the participants were
asked to fill in the second questionnaire, and 1 year later they
were asked to fill in the third questionnaire.
Job crafting intervention
The job crafting intervention was based on the Michigan Job
Crafting Exercise (JCE) (Berg, Dutton, Wrzesniewski, & Baker,
2008) and operationalized using the principles proposed by
JD-R theory (Bakker & Demerouti,2014). Specifically, the job
crafting intervention consists of exercises and goal setting
aimed at increasing social job resources, increasing challen-
ging job demands, increasing structural job resources, and
decreasing hindering job demands. In this job crafting inter-
vention, we follow the principles of what Parker, Bindl, and
Strauss (2010) describe as proactive goal-setting. A proactive
goal is something to be achieved in the future. Parker et al.
(2010) posit that in the process of proactive goal-setting, the
motivation to achieve a goal depends on: (a) the assessment
of whether one can achieve the future goal, (b) the reason to
achieve it or level of importance felt, and (c) whether one feels
supported and stimulated— or “energized”— to achieve the
goal. Parker and colleagues (2010) further describe the differ-
ent phases that are important to setting and pursuing proac-
tive goals:— proactive goal envisioning: the awareness of a
desirable future work situation;— proactive goal generation:
setting concrete and realistic goals that contribute to this;—
proactive goal planning: describing the ways and means to
achieving the goal;— proactive goal striving: the actual pursuit
of the goal set.
The goals that employees set themselves should be geared
to the short term. They are feasible goals (generation) that can
be achieved by training in a job crafting intervention in which
job fits or job misfits can be visualized (envisioning). Through
training, the roughly formulated goals can be refined and
discussed in a group setting and in terms such as the ways
and means necessary to achieving the goal. Concrete job
crafting actions can be proposed and participants themselves
take note of them (planning). After this, participants put the
actions into effect in order to achieve the goals set (striving).
The job crafting intervention consisted of two training ses-
sions over a period of 6 weeks: the first session took place on
1 day, while the second session of half a day took place
4 weeks later (see also Figure 2). The practical examples
incorporated in the training and the text and pictures in the
workbook were adapted to the specific needs of employees in
the educational sector. The programme involved six core ele-
ments and took place over a total of 12 hours, divided into
two meetings over a period 6 weeks. During the job crafting

intervention, the participants went through six steps. The first
step (job analysis) was for them to summarize all their current
tasks/duties and place them in order of the amount of time
they require, from little to medium to a lot of time. The
participants made an overview of their job tasks and sorted
them into three task categories: tasks they spent a lot of time
on, tasks they had to do often, and tasks that they had to do
sometimes. They also designated whether they did the task
individually or with colleagues. The participants wrote the
outcomes on small, medium, and large post-it notes and
stuck them on a piece of brown paper. After this, they labelled
their tasks in terms of urgency and importance.
The second step (person analysis) was to assess their per-
sonal strengths, motives and the personal or organizational
hindrances they experienced in their work. By asking partici-
pants to also think about what obstacles they felt in their
work, the training programme deviates slightly from the ori-
ginal Job Crafting Exercise (Berg et al., 2008) in which this
aspect is not explicitly explored. Specifically identifying the
hindrances in their work helped participants to make the
connection with the job crafting dimensions proposed by
Tims et al. (2012), which involves activities to decrease the
number or extent of burdensome tasks. In the third step (job +
person analysis) participants coupled their own strengths,
motives, and obstacles with the tasks/duties they carry out.
The objective of the analysis was to make participants aware
of those specific work tasks that reinforce personal strengths
and motives and thereby align what they are good at with
what they actually like to do at work. At the same time, the
task and activities that were hindering became evident and
revealed to them the risks in their work.
In the fourth step, the participants were challenged to
formulate meaningful, personal changes in their work situa-
tions. Subsequently and in line with the principles of the JD-R
model, the participants were asked to discuss which things
they could change in their work to increase social job
resources, increase challenging job demands, increase struc-
tural job resources, or to decrease hindering job demands. The
self-formulated job crafting activities that resulted from the
participants’ analysis and the discussion was then saved in a
personal job crafting action plan. The job crafting plan con-
tained participants’ job crafting goals and the actions they
would take to increase their resources and challenges or to
decrease their hindering job demands. The participants sub-
sequently carried out their action plan on the job in the
subsequent 4 weeks. This strategy is equivalent to the princi-
ples of proactive goal-setting (Parker et al.,2010). The 4-week
period was chosen for both theoretical and practical reasons.
In line with the principles of proactive goal-setting (Parker
et al., 2010), the goals that employees set themselves should
be geared to the short term. A period of 4 weeks is short
enough to be focused and at the same time long enough for
the participants to encounter an adequate number of situa-
tions in which they can craft their job by adapting their job
demands and/or resources.
Finally, the second session assessed the extent to which the
self-initiated job changes had been successful over a period of
4 weeks (step 5). These individual assessments of the success
of one’s own activities provided the opportunity in step 6 to
see the benefits of successful activities and the obstacles to
job crafting. By explicitly stating which job crafting activities
resulted in which benefits, and which organizational or perso-
nal limitations they faced in job crafting, the participants
shared what they had learned. The participants also discussed
what they would need in the future to maintain the fit
between their personal competencies, preferences, and the
job. At the end of the intervention, the participants had
learned what they could do to change elements of their jobs
and their relationships with others in order to increase their
job resources and challenges at work.Figure 2 presents the
design of the job crafting intervention. It is important to note
that in this study, it is the actual changes that employees
made themselves (or in collaboration with colleagues) that
determined the ultimate effectiveness of the intervention.
Measures
The questionnaires were identical for all participants and all
three measurements (T1, T2, and T3).
Job Crafting was measured using the Job Crafting scale
developed by Tims et al. (2012), which consists of four sub-
scales, namely: increasing social job resources, increasing
structural job resources, increasing challenging job demands,
and decreasing hindering job demands. Increasing social job
resources, structural job resources, and challenging job
demands was assessed with five items. Decreasing hindering
job demands was assessed with six items. Examples are:“I ask
my supervisor to coach me.” (increasing social job resources),
“I try to develop my capabilities.” (increasing structural job
resources), “When an interesting project comes along, I offer
myself proactively as project co-worker.” (increasing challen-
ging job demands), and“I make sure that my work is mentally
less intense.” (decreasing hindering job demands). Participants
could respond to each of the job crafting items using a five-
point scale, ranging from (1) never to (5) very often.
Job demands. Workload was measured using a three-item
Dutch version (Furda, 1995) of Karasek’s( 1985) job content
instrument. A sample item is:“Do you have to work quickly?”
All items were scored on a five-point scale where the scale
ranged from (1) never to (5) always.Emotional demands were
assed with a shortened three-item version (emotional
demands) of the scale developed by Van Veldhoven and
Meijman (1994). An example of an emotional demands item
is, “Does your work put you in emotional situations?” All items
were scored on a five-point scale where the scale ranged from
(1) never to (5) always.
Job resources. Performance feedback was assessed with a
three-item scale developed by Bakker, Demerouti, Taris,
Schaufeli, and Schreurs (2003). A sample item is: “I receive
sufficient information about my work objectives”. Participants
had to score the items on a five-point scale, ranging from (1)
never to (5) always.Opportunities for professional development
were assessed with three items from Bakker et al.’s( 2003)
scale. An item is “My work offers me the possibility to learn
new things”. All items were scored on a five-point scale where
the scale ranged from (1) totally disagree to (5) totally agree.
Personal resources. Resilience was measured using a shor-
tened five-item version of the scale developed by Block and
112 J. V. WINGERDEN ET AL.
<<<PAGE=8>>>
Kremen (1996) An example is:“I enjoy dealing with new and
unusual situations”. Participants had to score the items on a
four point scale, from (1) does not apply at all to (4) applies
very strongly. Self-efficacy was measured using a shortened
four-item version of the scale developed by Schwarzer and
Jerusalem (1995). An item is:“I am confident that I could deal
effectively with unexpected events”. Participants had to score
the items on a four-point scale, from (1) absolutely wrong to
(4) absolutely right.
Work engagement was measured with the nine-item
Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES; Schaufeli, Bakker, &
Salanova, 2006). The instrument consists of three subscales to
assess vigour, dedication, and absorption. Here is an example
for each subscale: “At work, I am bursting with energy” (vig-
our), “I am enthusiastic about my job” (dedication), and “Ia m
immersed in my work ” (absorption). Participants could
respond to these items using a 7-point frequency scale, ran-
ging from (0) never to (6) always.
In-role performance was measured using the in-role perfor-
mance scale by Williams and Anderson (1991), which consists of
seven items of which an example is:“Adequately completes
assigned duties”. Participants had to score the items on a five-
point scale ranging from (1) totally disagree to (5) totally agree.
Results
Descriptive statistics
The reliabilities and correlations between all study variables at
the three measurement points are displayed inTable 1.
Hypotheses testing
Our central prediction is that the job crafting intervention will
influence employees’ job crafting behaviour (H1), by which
employees will influence their workload (H2a), emotional
demands (H2b), feedback (H3a), opportunities for professional
development (H3b), resilience (H4a), self-efficacy (H4b), work
engagement (H5a), and in-role performance (H5b). To test
these hypotheses, we conducted repeated measures (RM)
multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) with time
(T1–T2–T3) as a within-person factor and group (intervention
group vs. control group) as a between-person factor, and age
as the covariate. Age was used as a covariate because analyses
revealed a significant correlation between age and the out-
come variables. When the multivariate analysis revealed a
significant effect, we proceeded with the univariate analyses.
In addition, we hypothesized a mediated relation between the
job crafting intervention and job demands through job craft-
ing behaviour (H2c), job resources through job crafting beha-
viour (H3c), personal resources through job crafting behaviour
(H4c), work engagement through job crafting behaviour (H5c),
and in-role performance through job crafting behaviour (H5d).
These hypotheses were tested with Hayes’ PROCESS macro
(Hayes, 2013) for SPSS. The means and standard deviations
of the study variables for the intervention group and control
group at T1, T2, and T3 are presented inTable 2.
Job crafting
In hypothesis 1, we proposed that participants’ levels of job
crafting behaviour would significantly increase after the job
crafting intervention compared to their level prior to the
intervention and compared to the control group. The four
job crafting components served simultaneously as dependent
variables, and age as covariate in the 3 (Time) x 2 (Group)
multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) for RM. The
results of the RM MANCOVA revealed a significant time x
group interaction effect F (4, 67) = 12.77; p < .05, showing
that the changes in job crafting scores were different in the
two groups.
We proceeded with the univariate analysis of covariance
(RM ANCOVA) to examine the changes from time 1 to time 2
and from time 2 to time 3 for the four job crafting compo-
nents. The results of the univariate analyses showed a signifi-
cant increase of increasing challenging job demands (F (1,
72) = 4.82;p < .05) and decreasing hindering job demands (F
(1, 72) = 4.75;p < .05) within the intervention group from time
1 to time 2. No significant change was found for the control
group on these variables. The results of the analyses showed
no changes from time 1 to time 2 on increasing social and
structural job resources for both the intervention and the
control group. From time 2 to time 3, a significant decline of
decreasing hindering job demands (F (1, 68) = 4.28;p < .05),
and a significant increase of increasing structural job resources
(F (1, 68) = 7.82; p < .01) was found within the intervention
group while no significant changes on these job crafting
behaviours were found for the control group. Job crafting in
the form of increasing challenging job demands decreased
within the control group from time 2 to time 3 ( F (1,
68) = 6.15, p < .05) while no changes were found for the
intervention group (F (1, 68) = 0.08, ns). These findings par-
tially confirm hypothesis 1.
Job demands
In hypothesis 2a and 2b, we proposed that participants’levels
of workload, and emotional demands would significantly
decrease after the job crafting intervention compared to
their level prior to the intervention and compared to the
control group. The two job demands served as the three
dependent variables, and age was used as a covariate in the
3 (Time) x 2 (Group) multivariate analysis of covariance
(MANCOVA) for RM. The results of the RM MANCOVA showed
that the changes in job demands scores were similar in the
two groups (F (3, 67) = 6.98; ns). Participants’job demands did
neither decrease from time 1 to time 2, nor from time 2 to
time 3. These findings reject hypothesis 2a–2c.
Job resources
In hypothesis 3a and 3b, we proposed that participants’levels
of feedback and opportunities for professional development
would significantly increase after the job crafting intervention
compared to their level prior to the intervention and com-
pared to the control group. The two job resources served
simultaneously as dependent variables, and age as covariate
in the 3 (Time) x 2 (Group) RM MANCOVA. The results of the
analysis revealed a significant time x group interaction effect

(F (3, 67) = 9.47; p < .05), showing that the changes in job
resources scores were different in the two groups. We pro-
ceeded with RM ANCOVAs for the three separate job
resources.
The results of the RM ANCOVAs showed no significant
changes from time 1 to time 2, for feedback (F (1, 72) = 1.14;
ns), and opportunities for professional development ( F (1,
72) = 3.36; ns) within the intervention group and the control
group. However, there were several significant changes after
1 year. From time 2 to time 3, the results for feedback revealed
a significant increase (F (1, 68) = 8.83;p < .01) from time 2 to
time 3 within the intervention group, but not within the
control group (F (1, 68) = 0.71; ns). Further, the results of the
RM ANCOVA showed a significant increase of opportunities for
professional development (F (1, 68) = 8.83;p < .01) from time 2
to time 3 within the intervention group, but not within the
control group (F (1, 68) = 0.71; ns). These findings show that
feedback and opportunities for development increased over
the 1-year time period. Hence, these results confirm H3a
and H3b.
Hypothesis 3c proposed a mediated relationship between
the job crafting intervention and job resources through
(increase in) job crafting behaviour. To test this hypothesis,
we used Hayes ’ PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013) Model 4.
PROCESS Model 4 allows testing of the mediating relationship
via calculation of 1000 bias-corrected bootstrap 95% confi-
dence intervals for an indirect effect. The bootstrap is a statis-
tical resampling method that estimates the parameters of a
model and their standard errors strictly from the sample
(Preacher & Hayes,2008). Bootstrapping computes more accu-
rate confidence intervals of indirect effects (x→m→y) than the
more commonly used methods, such as the causal steps
strategy (Baron & Kenny, 1986), as it does not assume that
the sampling distribution is normal (Preacher & Hayes,2008).
This is especially relevant for indirect effects, as their distribu-
tions are skewed away from zero (Shrout & Bolger,2002).
We tested the indirect effect of the job crafting interven-
tion on job resources (feedback) through (increase in) job
crafting behaviour. The results of the analysis showed that
this indirect effect was not significant (ns) for all four job
crafting dimensions. Increasing social job resources (b = .28,
SE = .18, ns), increasing structural job resources ( b = .25,
SE = .19, ns), increasing challenging job demands (b = .06,
SE = .17, ns), and decreasing hindering job demands (b = –.32,
SE = 0.17, ns). We repeated this analysis for opportunities for
professional development. The results of the bootstrap analy-
sis showed that this indirect effect was significant for increas-
ing social job resources (b = .41, SE = .17, p < .05), increasing
structural job resources (b = .58,SE =0.18, p < .05), increasing
challenging job demands (b = .33, SE = .16, p < .05). The
analyses did not reveal significant outcomes for decreasing
hindering job demands. Taken together, these findings par-
tially confirm H3c. The outcomes (b, SE, and CI) of the media-
tion analyses are presented inTable 3.
Personal resources
Besides the hypotheses regarding job resources, we hypothe-
sized that participants’levels of resilience (H4a) and self-efficacy
(H4b) would significantly increase after the job crafting interven-
tion compared to their level prior to the intervention and com-
pared to the control group. We conducted a similar 3 (Time) x 2
(Group) RM MANCOVA with resilience and self-efficacy as the

dependent variables. The results of the RM MANCOVA showed
that the two groups differed significantly (F (2, 67) = 7.95;p <. 0 5 ) ,
revealing a main effect of time. The results of the univariate
analyses revealed no significant changes in resilience and self-
efficacy from time 1 to time 2 for both the intervention and
control group. From time 2 to time 3 the univariate analysis
revealed no significant changes in resilience for both the inter-
vention (F (1, 68) = 0.46, ns) and control group (F (1, 68) = 0.55,
ns). However, the univariate analyses revealed that self-efficacy
increased significantly from time 2 to time 3 within the interven-
tion group (F (1, 68) = 9.50;p < .01), while no effects were found
within the control group (F (1, 68) = 2.59, ns). These findings
reject hypothesis 4a but offer support for hypothesis 4b.
Hypothesis 4c proposed a mediated relationship between
the job crafting intervention and personal resources through
(increase in) job crafting behaviour. Because the outcomes of
the RM MANCOVA analyses revealed no effect on resilience we
will only examine mediation for self-efficacy. To test this
hypothesis, again we examined the indirect effects using
Hayes’PROCESS macro (Hayes,2013) Model 4 with calculation
of 1000 bias-corrected bootstrap 95% confidence intervals. We
tested the indirect effect of the job crafting intervention on
personal resources (self-efficacy) through (increase in) job
crafting behaviour. The results of the analysis showed no
indirect effect for increasing social job resources (b = −.09,
SE = .10, ns), increasing structural job resources (b = 0.14,
SE = .10, ns), increasing challenging job demands (b = 0.13,
SE = .09, ns), and decreasing hindering job demands
(b = −0.23, SE = 0.09, ns). Hence, we reject H4c.
Work engagement and in-role performance
Regarding work engagement (H5a) and in-role performance
(H5b), we hypothesized that participants’levels would signifi-
cantly increase after the job crafting intervention compared to
their level prior to the intervention and compared to the
control group. To test hypotheses H5a and H5b, we conducted
a 3 (Time) x 2 (Group) RM MANCOVA in which work engage-
ment and in-role performance served simultaneously as
dependent variables. The results of the analysis revealed a
significant time x group interaction effect (F (2, 67) = 14.00,
p < .01), showing that the changes in work engagement and
in-role performance scores were different in the two groups.
We proceeded with the RM ANCOVA for work engagement
and in-role performance separately. The RM ANCOVA revealed
no changes for work engagement from time 1 to time 2 and
from time 2 to time 3 for both the intervention group (T1–T2:
F (1, 72) = 0.01, ns; T2–T3: F (1, 68) = 0.23, ns) and the control
group (T1–T2: F (1, 72) = 0.01, ns; T2–T3: F (1, 68) = 0.40, ns).
These findings reject hypothesis 5a and 5c.
The RM ANCOVA revealed a significant decrease of in-role
performance within the intervention group from time 1 to
time 2 (F (1, 72) = 7.12;p < .01). Further, the results showed
a strong increase of in-role performance for the intervention
group from time 2 to time 3 (F (1, 68) = 28.67 p < .001).
Because in-role performance decreased from time 1 to time
2 and increased from time 2 to time 3 within the intervention
group, we also examined the changes from time 1 to time 3.
The RM ANCOVA revealed a significant increase of in-role
performance from time 1 to time 3 ( F (1, 68) = 14.30,
p < .001) within the intervention group. No significant change
of in-role performance was found within the control group
(From T1–T2: F (1, 72) = 0.59; ns; T2–T3: F (1, 68) = 0.86; ns; T1–
T3: F (1, 68) = 0.40, ns). Because of these findings we partially
confirm H5b.
Hypothesis 5d proposed a mediated relationship between
the job crafting intervention and in-role performance through
(increase in) job crafting behaviour. To test this hypothesis,
again we examined the indirect effects using Hayes’PROCESS
macro (Hayes, 2013) Model 4 with calculation of 1000 bias-
corrected bootstrap 95% confidence intervals. We tested the
indirect effect of the job crafting intervention on in-role per-
formance through (increase in) job crafting behaviour. The
results of the bootstrap analysis showed that this indirect
effect was significant for increasing structural job resources
(b = .50, SE = .17, p < .05). The analyses did not reveal
significant outcomes for increasing social job resources
(b = −.07, SE = .17, ns), increasing challenging job demands
(b = 0.07, SE = 0.16, ns), and decreasing hindering job
demands (b = −.17, SE = .16, ns). Taken together, these find-
ings partially confirm H5d.
Discussion
The present study among teachers shows that a job crafting
intervention can foster job crafting behaviours. This is the first
study that has examined a job crafting intervention aimed at
optimizing job demands, job and personal resources, and
fostering work engagement and performance. The design of
this study is based on theoretical assumptions derived from
JD-R theory (Bakker & Demerouti,2014; Demerouti & Bakker,
2011), which states that by job crafting employees can opti-
mize their job demands and personal and job resources which
contribute to work engagement and performance.
Theoretical contributions
The present study contributes to the literature in four ways.
First, as far as we know, this is the first job crafting interven-
tion study that has revealed a significant increase of job craft-
ing behaviour compared to a control group. The results not
only showed significant effects 1 week after the intervention
was completed, but also 1 year later. Our results are in con-
trast with the outcomes of a job crafting intervention study by
Van den Heuvel et al. ( 2012) who did not find significant
effects on job crafting behaviour after their intervention,
although the intervention did improve the work environment
in other ways.
The analysis of the four separate job crafting components
showed that decreasing hindering job demands and increas-
ing challenging job demands significantly changed at time 2.
In contrast with the second measurement, the third measure-
ment revealed a significant increase of increasing structural
job resources and a decrease of decreasing hindering job
demands. During the job crafting intervention, the partici-
pants made an overview of their job tasks, the time they
spent on their tasks, and possible risk factors in their work.
By doing this, they may have become more aware of their
hindering job demands and therefore actively tried to

decrease them. At time 3, the participants focused less on
decreasing hindering job demands. The study outcomes
revealed support for this assumption; the means of decreasing
hindering job demands showed that the participants put less
effort into reducing hindering job demands at time 3 than
before the job crafting intervention. The participants may have
succeeded in taking away their hindrances or did not succeed
and stopped trying. Participants, who were unable to imple-
ment their intended job crafting actions, may require special
attention. A negative job crafting experience may feel as fail-
ure and in turn may contribute to cynicism.
A study by Van Wingerden et al. (2013) revealed that it is
not easy for teachers to decrease their hindering job demands.
In their study, 34 teachers tried to decrease their hindering job
demands, and 12 of them (35%) indicated that they did not
manage to succeed. The outcomes of this study revealed that
although participants try to adapt their job demands through
job crafting, their level of job demands did not decrease after
the intervention. The only job crafting component on which
we found no significant effect on both time 2 and time 3 is
increasing social resources. The participants work in direct
contact with students most of their time, not in direct contact
with colleagues. Therefore, the participants may have felt that
they did not have opportunities to increase their social
resources at work. As a consequence, they may have focused
on increasing structural job resources instead of increasing
social resources. The higher means of increasing structural
resources compared to the means of increasing social job
resources for both the intervention group and control group
support this assumption.
As a second important finding, this study revealed signifi-
cant effects of a job crafting intervention on the resources
feedback, opportunities for professional development, and
self-efficacy. As far as we know, this study is the first showing
an impact of a job crafting intervention on these specific
resources. In line with JD-R theory (Bakker & Demerouti,
2014), our study indicates that stimulating employees ’ job
crafting behaviours can result in an increase of both their
job and personal resources. Moreover, these outcomes were
found 1 year after the job crafting intervention. This delayed
effect is also known as a sleeper effect (Frese & Zapf,1988). A
sleeper effect occurs when interventions do not have an
immediate effect but need (incubation) time to reveal their
results (Frese & Zapf,1988; Nesselroade, 1991). Our outcomes
are in line with other intervention studies that also reported
sleeper effects (Bry, Conboy, & Bisgay, 1986; Bry & Krinsley,
1992; Krinsley, 1991). This suggests that it takes time before
increased job crafting behaviour will be effective.
Third, the analyses showed significant effects of a job
crafting intervention on in-role performance 1 year after
the intervention. Participants ’ in-role performance did not
increase at time two, which may be explained by their job
crafting behaviour. Through job crafting, participants
increased their challenging job demands at time 2.
Employees who increase their challenging job demands, for
example, by starting new activities, may learn and apply
new skills and do not feel they are performing right from
the start. In addition, by starting new activities employees
may need to invest extra time. This will not only affect the
time available for their other tasks but consequently may
also influence employees’ perception of their in-role perfor-
mance. Fourth, the mediation analyses revealed that job
crafting is the mechanism through which the intervention
contributed to improved levels of opportunities for profes-
sional development and in-role performance.
Limitations and avenues for future research
We want to mention several limitations of our study. The first
limitation is that all participants worked for the same educa-
tional organization. Socially desirable behaviour and group
pressure are possible risks when participants work in the
same team. Moreover, participants from different organiza-
tions may be less influenced by other participants and may
feel more comfortable showing their vulnerability because of
the anonymity. A second limitation involves the homogeneity
of our sample; the sample consisted of teachers only. This
restricts the generalizability of our findings. Future studies
should try to replicate our study among employees of several
other occupational groups.
A third limitation of this study concerns participants’ job
demands, resilience, and work engagement. We did not find
a significant effect for these variables at time 2 or time 3. In
line with the findings by Van Wingerden et al. (2013), this
study revealed that teachers did not succeed in decreasing
their job demands. In addition, the personal resource resi-
lience did not increase. The job crafting intervention is not
merely focused on enhancing personal resources, which may
explain why resilience did not increase. Work engagement
also did not change at time 2— this may be explained by the
significant increase of decreasing hindering job demands.
Earlier research had revealed that decreasing hindering job
demands is unrelated (Tims et al., 2012)o rn e g a t i v e l y
related to work engagement (Petrou et al.,2012). However,
although decreasing hindering job demands diminished sig-
nificantly at time 3, there was no increase in work engage-
ment at time 3.
A fourth limitation concerns the measurement of in-role
performance. In this study, we only measured participants ’
self-ratings of in-role performance. Future studies may also
pay attention to other ratings of students, colleagues, or
supervisors. These other ratings may offer a more objective
view of the improvement in terms of observable behaviour
or realization of work-related goals. Since the main hypoth-
eses regarding job crafting, personal, and job resources and
performance were confirmed, it would be interesting and
relevant to replicate this first longitudinal job crafting study
with other occupational groups and a heterogeneous sam-
ple. Finally, in this study we only collected quantitative data.
Additional qualitative data may have helped us in interpret-
ing and explaining the results. Earlier studies (Van
Wingerden et al., 2013;V a nW i n g e r d e ne ta l . ,2016) that
did collect qualitative data, gave insights that contributed
to the explanation of the intervention effects. It is recom-
mended for future studies to include a qualitative part as
well since this may be valuable in explaining the study
results.

Practical implications and conclusion
A practical implication of the outcomes of this study is that orga-
nizations should be aware of the opportunities that job crafting
interventions can provide. The rapid technological and economic
changes that are characteristic ofour society today force organiza-
tions and their employees to adapt to continuous change.
Organizations may use interventions to foster employee job craft-
ing behaviours. Such interventions will improve employees’ job
and personal resources, and may consequently have a positive
impact on organizational performance. In addition, this can help
employees to cope with a continuously changing work environ-
ment. Senior management should acknowledge the importance of
facilitating and stimulating a resourceful and challenging work
environment.
The job crafting intervention showed that it is possible to
stimulate employees’ b e h a v i o u ri nr e l a t i o nt oa d a p t i n gj o b
demands and resources. Senior management can actively support
employees, for example, by giving more feedback at work
(Wrzesniewski & Dutton,2001). Because of the negative relation
between decreasing hindering job demands and performance
(Tims, Bakker, Derks, & Van Rhenen,2013), management could
actively try to stimulate employees to increase job resources and
challenging job demands. More specifically, increasing structural
resources seems to be the most effective job crafting strategy in
relation to performance. Therefore, facilitating sufficient opportu-
nities for professional development at work may be an advisable
investment. In addition, organizations can also use surveys or
questionnaires to find out whether employees experience enough
opportunities to craft their jobs. Based on the outcomes of the
surveys, individualized reports could be made including persona-
lized feedback and suggestions on how employees themselves
could optimize their resources and job demands at work. Senior
management should introduce job crafting as a structural conver-
sation topic of staff meetings. By doing this, job crafting will
become a subject that is included in the daily routine.
In sum, we conclude that introducing job crafting interven-
tions in educational organizations may offer opportunities to
enhance employees well-being and performance. The job
crafting intervention may be a promising tool to facilitate a
resourceful work environment which enables employees to
achieve their personal and organizational goals. Although we
found positive effects in this intervention study, we need to
consider the presented results within the context of limita-
tions regarding generalizability. Further research is needed to
examine whether these positive effects will be found consis-
tently among other sectors and in other occupational groups.
