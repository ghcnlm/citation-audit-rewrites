Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
Executive summary
A number of initiatives that commenced in recent years are geared towards achievement 
of the fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG 5: Improving maternal health), most 
notably the launch of the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health in 2010 by 
the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General. Subsequently, the high-level Commission 
on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health was established 
to “determine the most effective international institutional arrangements for global 
reporting, oversight and accountability on women’s and children’s health. ” One of the ten 
recommendations of the commission was specific to improving measurement of maternal 
(and child) deaths. This recommendation requires that “by 2015, all countries have taken 
significant steps to establish a system for registration of births, deaths and causes of death, 
and have well-functioning health information systems that combine data from facilities, 
administrative sources and surveys” . The first report of the independent Expert Review Group 
(iERG) established by the commission for overseeing the progress in achievement of the 
commission’s 10 recommendations indicated insufficient progress in the implementation of 
the recommendations including the one on ‘vital events’ reporting.
Measuring the MDG 5 target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) (target 5A) 
remains a challenge. Less than 40% of countries have a complete civil registration system 
with good attribution of cause of death, which is necessary for the accurate measurement of 
maternal mortality.
The estimates for 2013 presented in this report are the seventh in a series of analyses by the 
United Nations agencies. The Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG), 
comprising the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Population 
Division (UNPD) and The World Bank, together with a team at the National University of 
Singapore, Singapore and University of California at Berkeley, United States of America, 
have been working together to generate internationally comparable MMR estimates. A 
technical advisory group (TAG) provides independent technical advice. The methods, as well 
as the data sources for the estimation of MMR, have improved over time. Building on the 
methodological advancements from the previous round of analyses, newly available data 
collected by MMEIG and obtained during country consultation were incorporated, and trend 
estimates from 1990 to 2013 were generated. As with the previous round of estimates, the 
statistical code and input data necessary to produce the current estimates are made publicly 
available, underscoring the MMEIG’s commitment to open access and transparency.
Globally, there were an estimated 289 000 maternal deaths in 2013, a decline of 45% from 
1990. The sub-Saharan Africa region alone accounted for 62% (179 000) of global deaths 
followed by Southern Asia at 24% (69 000). At the country level, the two countries that 
accounted for one third of all global maternal deaths are India at 17% (50 000) and Nigeria 
at 14% (40 000). The global MMR in 2013 was 210 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, 
down from 380 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 1990. The MMR in developing 
regions (230) was 14 times higher than in developed regions (16). Sub-Saharan Africa has the 
highest regional MMR (510). Of the remaining MDG developing regions, five had low MMR: 
Eastern Asia (33); Caucasus and Central Asia (39); Northern Africa (69); Western Asia (74); and

Latin America and the Caribbean (85). Three had moderate MMR: South-eastern Asia (140); 
Southern Asia (190); and Oceania (190).
Sierra Leone is estimated to have the highest MMR at 1100. A further 15 countries (all in sub-
Saharan Africa) had very high MMR: Chad (980); Central African Republic (880); Somalia (850); 
Burundi (740); Democratic Republic of the Congo (730); South Sudan (730); Côte d’Ivoire (720); 
Guinea (650); Liberia (640); Niger (630); Cameroon (590); Guinea-Bissau (560); Nigeria (560); 
Mali (550); and Malawi (510). Only two countries outside the sub-Saharan African region had 
high MMR: Afghanistan (400) and Haiti (380). In contrast, Cabo Verde and Mauritius were 
the only two sub-Saharan African countries that had low MMR at 53 and 73, respectively. 
Regarding the likelihood that an adult woman will die from maternal causes, Chad and 
Somalia had the highest lifetime risks at 1 in 15 and 1 in 18, respectively. The estimated 
lifetime risk for maternal mortality in high-income countries is 1 in 3400 in comparison to 
low-income countries where the risk is 1 in 52.
Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 6800 (91%) of the estimated 7500 maternal deaths 
attributed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) worldwide. The proportion 
of maternal deaths attributed to AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa was 3.8%, yielding an AIDS-
attributed MMR for sub-Saharan Africa of 19 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. 
Although the MDG regional aggregated proportions of maternal deaths attributed to AIDS 
were relatively small, they were substantial for countries with high HIV prevalence. Thirteen 
countries had a proportion of maternal deaths attributed to AIDS of 10% or more.
While most countries/regions aspire to achieve MDG5 target 5A by 2015, some countries are 
unlikely to attain this goal if current trends persist. Countries with an MMR ≥100 in 1990 are 
categorized as ‘on track’ if their MMR has declined by at least 75% between 1990 and 2013.
The 11 countries categorized as ‘on track’ are: Maldives (93%); Bhutan (87%); Cambodia (86%); 
Equatorial Guinea (81%); Lao People’s Democratic Republic (80%); Romania (80%);  
Timor-Leste (78%); Cabo Verde (77%); Eritrea (77%); Nepal (76%); Rwanda (76%). A further  
63 countries are characterized as ‘making progress’ , while 13 countries have made ‘insufficient 
progress’ . 
When considering progress made towards achievement of MDGs, some common elements 
of success emerge, including: leadership and partnership, evidence and innovation, 
development and implementation of dual short-term and long-term strategies, and 
adaptation to change for sustained progress. Additionally, successful strategies and policies 
related to safer motherhood, neonatal health, nutrition and gender are anchored in the 
principles of human rights. Finally, improving the availability and quality of maternal 
death reviews provides an important tool for capturing maternal deaths, contributing to 
better estimates of maternal mortality, while also helping to initiate necessary actions to 
prevent deaths. 
Discussions on the post-2015 UN development agenda are underway. In light of the steady 
progress observed for MDG 5, we can envision ending preventable maternal mortality in 
this lifetime.

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
1 Introduction
A number of initiatives that commenced in recent years are geared towards achievement 
of the fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG 5: Improving maternal health), most 
notably the launch of the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health in 2010 by 
the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General (1). Subsequently, the high-level Commission 
on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health was established 
to “determine the most effective international institutional arrangements for global 
reporting, oversight and accountability on women’s and children’s health” (2). One of the ten 
recommendations of the commission was specific to improving measurement of maternal 
(and child) deaths. This recommendation requires that “by 2015, all countries have taken 
significant steps to establish a system for registration of births, deaths and causes of death, 
and have well-functioning health information systems that combine data from facilities, 
administrative sources and surveys” . The first report of the independent Expert Review Group 
(iERG) established by the commission for overseeing the progress in achievement of the 
commission’s 10 recommendations indicated insufficient progress in the implementation of 
the recommendations, including the one on vital events reporting (3).
Measuring the MDG 5 target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by three 
quarters between 1990 and 2015 remains a challenge. Less than two fifths of countries 
have a complete civil registration system with good attribution of cause of death, which is 
necessary for the accurate measurement of maternal mortality. Accordingly, the Maternal 
Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG), comprising the World Health Organization 
(WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA), the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) and The World Bank, together with 
a team at the National University of Singapore, Singapore, and University of California at 
Berkeley, United States of America, have been working together to generate internationally 
comparable MMR estimates. A technical advisory group (TAG) provides independent 
technical advice. The estimates for 2013 presented in this report are the seventh in a series 
of analyses by the MMEIG to examine the global extent of maternal mortality (4–9). The 
methods, as well as the data sources for the estimation of MMR, have improved over time.
Consultations with countries were carried out following the development of the MMR 
estimates. The purposes of the consultations were primarily: to give countries the opportunity 
to review the country estimates, data sources and methods; to obtain additional primary data 
sources that may not have been previously reported or used in the analyses; and to build 
mutual understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of available data and ensure broad 
ownership of the results. Appendix 17 presents a summary of the 2013 country consultations.
This report presents global, regional and country estimates of maternal mortality in 2013, 
as well as trends from 1990 to 2013. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the definitions and 
approaches for measuring maternal mortality. Chapter 3 is a detailed description of the 
methodology employed in generating the estimates. Chapter 4 presents the estimates 
and interpretation of the findings. Chapter 5 assesses the progress towards MDG 5. The 
annexes and appendices present the sources of data for the country estimates, as well as 
MMR estimates for the different regional groupings for UNFPA, UNICEF, the United Nations 
Population Division, WHO and The World Bank.

2 Measuring maternal mortality
2.1 Concepts and definitions
In the International statistical classification of diseases health problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) 
(10), WHO defines maternal death as:
The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective 
of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the 
pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.
This definition allows identification of maternal deaths, based on their causes, as either 
direct or indirect. Direct maternal deaths are those resulting from obstetric complications 
of the pregnant state (i.e. pregnancy, delivery and postpartum), interventions, omissions, 
incorrect treatment, or a chain of events resulting from any of the above. Deaths due to, 
for example, obstetric haemorrhage or hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, or those 
due to complications of anaesthesia or caesarean section are classified as direct maternal 
deaths. Indirect maternal deaths are those resulting from previously existing diseases, or 
from diseases that developed during pregnancy and that were not due to direct obstetric 
causes but aggravated by physiological effects of pregnancy. For example, deaths due to 
aggravation of an existing cardiac or renal disease are considered indirect maternal deaths.
The concept of ‘death during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium’ is included in the 
ICD-10 and is defined as any death temporal to pregnancy, childbirth or the postpartum 
period, even if it is due to accidental or incidental causes (this was formerly referred to 
as ‘pregnancy-related death’ , see Box 1). This alternative definition allows measurement 
of deaths that are related to pregnancy, even though they do not strictly conform to the 
standard ‘maternal death’ concept, in settings where accurate information about causes of 
death based on medical certificates is unavailable.
Box 1 
Definitions related to maternal death in ICD-10
Maternal death
the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, 
irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated 
by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.
Pregnancy-related death
the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, 
irrespective of the cause of death.
Late maternal death
the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days, but less than 
one year after termination of pregnancy.
<<<PAGE=15>>>

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
For instance, in population-based surveys, respondents provide information on the 
pregnancy status of a reproductive-aged sibling at the time of death, but no further 
information is elicited on the cause of death. These surveys, therefore, usually provide 
measures of pregnancy-related deaths rather than maternal deaths.
Further, complications of pregnancy or childbirth can lead to death beyond the six weeks 
postpartum period, and the increased availability of modern life-sustaining procedures and 
technologies enables more women to survive adverse outcomes of pregnancy and delivery, 
and to delay death beyond 42 days postpartum. Despite being caused by pregnancy-related 
events, these deaths do not count as maternal deaths in routine civil registration systems. 
Specific codes for ‘late maternal deaths’ are included in the ICD-10 (O96 and O97), in order to 
capture delayed maternal deaths occurring between six weeks and one year postpartum (see 
Box 1). Some countries, particularly those with more developed civil registration systems, use 
this definition.
This report aims to achieve a globally consistent set of estimates of maternal deaths in 
line with the ICD-10 definition of maternal death, although the various ways the data are 
collected do not always allow the above definition to be followed.
2.2 Coding of maternal deaths
Despite the standard definitions noted above, accurate identification of the causes of 
maternal deaths is not always possible. It can be a challenge for medical certifiers to correctly 
attribute cause of death to direct or indirect maternal causes, or to accidental or incidental 
events, particularly in settings where deliveries mostly occur at home. While several countries 
apply the ICD-10 in civil registration systems, the identification and classification of causes of 
death during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium remain inconsistent across countries.
With the publication of the ICD-10, WHO recommended adding a checkbox on the death 
certificate for recording a woman’s pregnancy status at the time of death (10). This was to 
help identify indirect maternal deaths, but it has not been implemented in many countries. 
For countries using ICD-10 coding for registered deaths, all deaths coded to the maternal 
chapter (O codes) and maternal tetanus (A34) were counted as maternal deaths.
In 2012, WHO published Application of ICD-10 to deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and the 
puerperium: ICD Maternal Mortality (ICD-MM), to guide countries to reduce errors in coding 
maternal deaths and to improve the attribution of cause of maternal death (11). The ICD-MM 
is to be used together with the three ICD-10 volumes. For example, the ICD-MM clarifies that 
the coding of maternal deaths among HIV-positive women may be due to:
Obstetric causes: Such as haemorrhage or hypertensive disorders in pregnancy – these should 
be identified as direct maternal deaths.
The interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy: In these cases, 
there is an aggravating effect of pregnancy on HIV and the interaction between pregnancy 
and HIV is the underlying cause of death. These deaths are considered as indirect maternal 
deaths. In this report, they are referred to as ‘AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths’ , and 
in the ICD are those deaths coded to O98.7 and categorized in Group 7 (non-obstetric 
complications) in the ICD-MM.
<<<PAGE=16>>>

WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division estimates
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS): In these cases, the woman’s pregnancy status is 
incidental to the course of her HIV infection and her death is a result of an HIV complication, 
as described by ICD-10 codes B20–24. These are not considered maternal deaths. In this 
report, they are referred to as ‘AIDS deaths’ . 1
Thus, proper reporting of the mutual influence of HIV or AIDS and pregnancy in Part 1 of the 
death certificate will facilitate the coding and identification of these deaths.

The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:
(i) The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.
(ii) The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by 
women of reproductive age). The MMR is defined as the number of maternal deaths during 
a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of 
maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.
By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is defined as the number of maternal 
deaths in a population divided by the number of women aged 15–49 years (or woman-
years lived at ages 15–49 years). The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per 
pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. 
In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk 
of maternal mortality for women in the population (see Box 2). An alternate measure of 
maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due 
to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total 
deaths among women aged 15–49 years.

2.3 Approaches for measuring maternal mortality
Ideally, civil registration systems with good attribution of cause of death provide accurate 
data on the level of maternal mortality and the causes of maternal deaths. In countries with 
incomplete civil registration systems, it is difficult to accurately measure levels of maternal 
mortality. First, it is challenging to identify maternal deaths precisely, as the deaths of women 
of reproductive age might not be recorded at all. Second, even if such deaths were recorded, 
the pregnancy status or cause of death may not have been known and the deaths would 
therefore not have been reported as maternal deaths. Third, in most developing-country 
settings where medical certification of cause of death does not exist, accurate attribution of a 
female death as a maternal death is difficult.
Even in developed countries where routine registration of deaths is in place, maternal deaths 
may be underreported, due to misclassification of ICD-10 coding, and identification of the 
true numbers of maternal deaths may require additional special investigations into the causes 
of death (Appendix 1). A specific example of such an investigation is the Confidential Enquiry 
into Maternal Deaths (CEMD), a system established in England and Wales in 1928 (12,13). The 
most recent report of the CEMD (for 2006–2008) identified 60% more maternal deaths than 
were reported in the routine civil registration system (14). Other studies on the accuracy of 
the number of maternal deaths reported in civil registration systems have shown that the true 
number of maternal deaths could be twice as high as indicated by routine reports, or even 
more (15,16). Appendix 1 summarizes the results of a literature review (updated January 2014) 
for such studies where misclassification on coding in civil registration could be identified.
These studies are diverse, depending on the definition of maternal mortality used, the 
sources considered (death certificates, other vital event certificates, medical records, 
questionnaires or autopsy reports) and the way maternal deaths are identified (record 
linkage or assessment from experts). In addition, the system of reporting causes of death to 
a civil registry differs from one country to another, depending on the death certificate forms, 
the type of certifiers and the coding practice. These studies have estimated underreporting 
of maternal mortality due to misclassification in death registration data, ranging from 0.85 to 
5.0, with a median value of 1.5.
Underreporting of maternal deaths was more common among:
• early pregnancy deaths, including those not linked to a reportable birth outcome;
• deaths in the later postpartum period (these were less likely to be reported than early 
postpartum deaths);
• deaths at extremes of maternal age (youngest and oldest);
• miscoding by the ICD-9 or ICD-10, most often seen in cases of deaths caused by:
 – cerebrovascular diseases;
 – cardiovascular diseases.
Potential reasons cited for underreporting/misclassification include:
• inadequate understanding of the ICD rules (either ICD-9 or ICD-10);
• death certificates completed without mention of pregnancy status;
• desire to avoid litigation;
• desire to suppress information (especially as related to abortion deaths).

The definitions of misclassification, incompleteness and underreporting of maternal deaths 
are shown in Box 3.
Box 3
Definitions of misclassification, incompleteness and underreporting
Misclassification
refers to incorrect coding in civil registration, due either to error in the medical certification of 
cause of death or error in applying the correct code.
Incompleteness
refers to incomplete death registration. includes both the identification of individual deaths in 
each country and the national coverage of the register.
Underreporting
is a combination of misclassification and incompleteness.
In the absence of complete and accurate civil registration systems, MMR estimates are based 
on data from a variety of sources – including censuses, household surveys, reproductive-age 
mortality studies (RAMOS) and verbal autopsies. Each of these methods has limitations in 
estimating the true levels of maternal mortality. Brief descriptions of these methods together 
with their limitations are shown in Box 4.
Box 4  
Approaches to measuring maternal mortality
Civil registration system (12,16)
this approach involves routine registration of births and deaths. ideally, maternal mortality 
statistics should be obtained through civil registration data. however, even where coverage is 
complete and the causes of all deaths are identified based on standard medical certificates, in 
the absence of active case finding, maternal deaths may be missed or misclassified; and therefore 
confidential enquiries are used to identify the extent of misclassification and underreporting. 
Household surveys (17,18)
demographic and health surveys (dhs) and multiple indicator cluster surveys – round 4 
(mics4) employ the direct ‘sisterhood’ method using household survey data. this method obtains 
information by interviewing a representative sample of respondents about the survival of all 
their siblings (to determine the age of all siblings, how many are alive, how many are dead, age 
at death and year of death of those dead, and among sisters who reached reproductive age, how 
many died during pregnancy, delivery or within two months of pregnancy). this approach has 
the following limitations:
• identifies pregnancy-related deaths, rather than maternal deaths.
• Produces estimates with wide confidence intervals, thereby diminishing opportunities for 
trend analysis.
• Provides a retrospective rather than a current maternal mortality estimate (referring to a 
period approximately five years prior to the survey); the analysis is more complicated.

Box 4  
Approaches to measuring maternal mortality
Census (19,20)
A national census, with the addition of a limited number of questions, could produce estimates 
of maternal mortality. this approach eliminates sampling errors (because all women are covered) 
and hence allows a more detailed breakdown of the results, including trend analysis, geographic 
sub-divisions and social strata. characteristics and limitations of a census are:
• this approach allows identification of deaths in the household in a relatively short reference 
period (1–2 years), thereby providing recent maternal mortality estimates, but is conducted at 
10-year intervals and therefore limits monitoring of maternal mortality.
• identifies pregnancy-related deaths (not maternal deaths); however, if combined with verbal 
autopsy, maternal deaths could be identified.
• training of enumerators is crucial, since census activities collect information on a range of 
other topics unrelated to maternal deaths.
• results must be adjusted for characteristics such as completeness of death and birth statistics 
and population structures, in order to arrive at reliable estimates.
Reproductive-age mortality studies (RAMOS) (17,18)
this approach involves identifying and investigating the causes of all deaths of women of 
reproductive age in a defined area/population, by using multiple sources of data (e.g. interviews 
of family members, civil registrations, health-facility records, burial records, traditional birth 
attendants), and has the following characteristics and limitations:
• multiple and varied sources of information must be used to identify deaths of women of 
reproductive age; no single source identifies all the deaths.
• interviews with household members and health care providers and reviews of facility records 
are used to classify the deaths as maternal or otherwise.
• if properly conducted, this approach provides a fairly complete estimation of maternal 
mortality (in the absence of reliable routine registration systems) and could provide sub-
national mmrs. however, inadequate identification of all deaths of reproductive-aged women 
results in underestimation of maternal mortality levels.
• this approach can be complicated, time-consuming, and expensive to undertake – particularly 
on a large scale.
• the number of live births used in the computation may not be accurate, especially in settings 
where most women deliver at home.

Box 4  
Approaches to measuring maternal mortality
Verbal autopsy (21–23)
this approach is used to assign cause of death through interviews with family or community 
members, where medical certification of cause of death is not available. verbal autopsies may be 
conducted as part of a demographic surveillance system maintained by research institutions that 
collect records of births and deaths periodically among small populations (typically in a district). 
this approach may also be combined with household surveys or censuses. in special versions, 
and in combination with software that helps to identify the diagnosis, verbal autopsy is suitable 
for routine use as an inexpensive method in populations where no other method of assessing the 
cause of death is in place. the following limitations characterize this approach:
• misclassification of causes of deaths in women of reproductive-age is not uncommon with this 
technique.
• it may fail to identify correctly a group of maternal deaths, particularly those occurring early in 
pregnancy (e.g. ectopic, abortion-related) and indirect causes of maternal death (e.g. malaria).
• the accuracy of the estimates depends on the extent of family members’ knowledge of the 
events leading to the death, the skill of the interviewers, and the competence of physicians 
who do the diagnosis and coding. the latter two factors are largely overcome by the use of 
software.
• detailed verbal autopsy for research purposes that aims to identify the cause of death of an 
individual requires physician assessment and long interviews. such systems are expensive to 
maintain, and the findings cannot be extrapolated to obtain national mmrs. this limitation 
does not exist where simplified verbal autopsy is aiming to identify causes at a population 
level and where software helps to formulate the diagnosis.

3 Methodology for the 1990–2013 estimates of maternal 
mortality
The methodology employed in this round followed that used in the 2008 and 2010 exercises 
but included updated data inputs (4, 5, 24, 25). A description of sources of data is presented 
next, followed by the methods used depending on the data source. The main differences in 
the methods used to produce the current estimates and previous publications are highlighted.
3.1 Sources of country data used for the 1990–2013 estimates
Data related to maternal mortality and covariates that were made available during the 
country consultation process (in July 2013), or obtained through databases maintained by 
UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNPD, WHO, The World Bank and the Center for International Comparisons 
at the University of Pennsylvania, United States were included in the estimates. New data 
were included until mid-January 2014. As the trend from 1990 to 2013 is estimated, the time 
reference of the data gathered starts from 1985, in order to fully cover the period around 
1990. Deaths due to AIDS were obtained from UNAIDS (2012 estimates published in 2013) 
(26); deaths among women aged 15–49 years from WHO life tables (27); live births from 
UNPD (28); the presence of a skilled attendant at birth (SAB) as a proportion of live births 
from UNICEF (29); and gross domestic product per capita (GDP), measured in purchasing 
power parity (PPP), from The World Bank (30), Penn World Tables (31) and WHO (unpublished 
data, health systems and information). These agencies revise their databases and estimates 
on a regular basis, to take into account new data and improved methods.
Maternal mortality data from civil registration were extracted primarily from the WHO 
Mortality Database (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data/en/) for the years 
1985 and onwards. For civil registration data using the ICD-9, deaths from Chapter X 
Complication of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (codes 630–676) were included. 
For civil registration data using the ICD-10, deaths from Chapter XV Pregnancy, childbirth 
and the puerperium (codes O00–O99) plus maternal tetanus (A34) were extracted in order 
to match the ICD-9, which does not specifically identify late maternal deaths. To maintain 
comparability between these data sets, maternal deaths coded as late maternal deaths 
(ICD-10 codes O96, O97) were not excluded in the total numbers of maternal deaths. These 
late maternal deaths accounted globally for only 1–2% of the deaths coded with the ICD-10.
Periodic population-based surveys (such as DHS and MICS4) and censuses have collected 
information on maternal deaths using recent deaths in the household, reported in the 
time period specified for the survey prior to the actual dates of data collection or the direct 
sisterhood method. Studies have shown that reported deaths in the household surveys 
may lead to biased estimates of levels of maternal mortality (32, 33). Two alternative 
measures of maternal mortality can typically be extracted from surveys. The first, the MMR, 
incorporates information on maternal deaths and live births, but tends to be systematically 
biased downward due to underreporting of deaths. The second, the PM, reflects the ratio of 
maternal deaths to total female deaths and, because both numerator and denominator tend 
to be biased in the same direction and to a similar degree, the PM is relatively unbiased. For 
this reason, the PM is the preferred measure of maternal mortality from surveys when both 
the MMR and PM are available.

WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division estimates
A total of 183 countries and territories were included in this study, representing 99.7% of 
global births; countries and territories with populations under 100 000 in 2013 have not 
been included. In total, the database of observed MMR and PM includes 3347 country-years 
of data, of which 2121 country-years are derived from civil registration data, 1004 from 
survey-based sisterhood data, and the remainder from surveillance systems (119), other 
household surveys (46), censuses (18), sample registration systems (17) and other sources 
(22). Observation intervals refer to 1985 or later. Only national-level studies were included 
in the database, except those considered inadequate in terms of data quality or lacking the 
necessary information.
3.2 Methods used to estimate maternal mortality ratio in 
1990–2013 according to data source
Two broad strategies were followed to develop maternal mortality estimates for 183 
countries and territories. To determine how MMRs were estimated for each country, we 
classified countries according to the availability and quality of maternal mortality data.
Following the group classifications from the 2008 and 2010 rounds, we continued to classify 
countries into groups A, B, or C (Table 1). For Group A countries, data from civil registration 
systems were used directly to calculate estimates of MMR. For countries in Groups B and C, a 
two-part multi-level regression model was developed to estimate MMRs for all target years.

a For Bahamas, Belgium, Iceland, Malta, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (0.1% of global births), the statistical 
multi-level regression model was used to obtain maternal mortality estimates because the scarce number of maternal mortality 
events resulted in erratic trends.
We considered a range of maternal mortality data, including national-level data from civil 
registration, surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, RAMOS, sample registration systems 
and others. A further classification scheme for countries with civil registration systems was 
developed to determine how civil registration data were used in the maternal mortality 
estimation. Box 5 describes the three types of classification groups for civil registration data,
<<<PAGE=23>>>
13
Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
according to specified criteria (Groups 1, 2, and 3). Countries that met the most restrictive 
criteria (Group 1) were classified as Group A countries. For six countries in Group A (Belgium, 
Bahamas, Iceland, Malta, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), which have 
good-quality data from the civil registration systems but very few numbers of maternal 
deaths for the target periods (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2013), the multi-level 
regression model was used to generate estimates for all time periods.
Civil registration data belonging to Groups 1 and 2 were included in the multi-level 
regression model, whereas civil registration data in Group 3 were considered deficient and 
not included in the model. All non-Group A countries with either civil registration data of 
acceptable quality (Group 2) or other sources of quality data were classified as Group B 
countries. Countries with no data of acceptable quality were classified as Group C countries.
The steps taken for estimating maternal mortality with these strategies are summarized 
below. A description of the core methodology (24), data sets including input data sets for 
each country by type of data source, and the statistical analysis code used to prepare these 
estimates, are made available at the WHO web site: www.who.int/reproductivehealth/
publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2013/en/index.html.

Estimation of maternal mortality ratio from Group 1 civil registration data 
(Group A)
As noted above, mortality data from civil registration were extracted from the WHO Mortality 
Database. These data were used directly to estimate maternal mortality for 61 of the 67 
countries that met the criteria of Group 1 in Box 5 (see Appendix 2 for the list of countries).
For these countries, MMR estimates were calculated directly after adjusting the numbers 
of maternal deaths for completeness and misclassification. Completeness refers to the 
extent of death registration, while misclassification refers to incorrect coding in civil 
registration systems. In assessing completeness, deaths of unknown age were distributed 
over the age range in proportion to the number of reported deaths where the age was 
known. Completeness was then assessed and adjusted by methods described by Mathers 
et al in 2005 (34). To further adjust for underreporting of maternal deaths due to potential 
misclassification, the numbers of maternal deaths were multiplied by a factor of 1.5, or by a 
country-specific factor where appropriate evidence is available. The default factor of 1.5 was 
derived from previous studies (Appendix 1).
Having adjusted the numbers of maternal deaths for misclassification and completeness, 
the maternal mortality estimates were computed as follows: for the target years t = 1990, 
1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2013 the number of maternal deaths and the corresponding live 
births were pooled for the 5-year periods, i.e. years t – 2 to t + 2 (35). For the target year 2013, 
data were pooled from the years 2010, 2011, 2012 (2013 data were not available).The pooled 
maternal deaths were divided by the pooled live births.
For any 5-year period where no deaths are reported, the best estimates and uncertainty 
bounds from the main statistical model (multi-level regression model) were rescaled and 
used. For example, if no civil registration data were reported in a country after 2010, the 
estimate for the period 2011–2015 with a reference year 2013 was based on the multi-level 
model estimate for that period, multiplied by a rescaling factor R, where R was given by 
the ratio of the estimated MMR based on civil registration data and the multi-level model 
estimate for the previous 5-year period. By using this approach, the MMR estimate for future 
periods is informed by the estimated level in the most recently observed period and the 
projected rate of change from the multi-level model.
Estimation of maternal mortality ratio using a statistical model (Groups B and C)
For the majority of countries with limited or no reliable maternal mortality data, the multi-
level regression model as developed in the 2008 round of MMR estimates (24) was used 
to derive estimates and projections of maternal mortality with updated information in 
maternal mortality and in covariates. The model permits an integrated comparison of trends 
over the full interval, from 1990 to 2013, for 5-year intervals centred on 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, 2010 and 2013. The full model includes two parts: the first part is a multi-level linear 
regression model that predicts the PM due to direct obstetric causes or to indirect causes 
(other than AIDS) for which pregnancy was a substantial aggravating factor; the second 
part estimates the proportion of AIDS deaths that qualify as indirect maternal deaths out 
of the total number of AIDS deaths among women aged 15–49 years. The three selected 
predictor variables in the regression model are: GDP , the general fertility rate (GFR) and SAB. 
These predictor variables were chosen from a broader list of potential predictor variables
<<<PAGE=25>>>
15
Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
that fell into three groups: (i) indicators of social and economic development (such as GDP , 
human development index, and female life expectancy at birth); (ii) process variables (SAB, 
proportion of women receiving antenatal care, proportion of institutional births, etc.); and 
(iii) risk exposure as a function of fertility (GFR or the total fertility rate).
Annual series of predictor variable estimates
A complete series of annual estimates for each of the three covariates was obtained or 
constructed between 1985 and 2013. Weighted averages of annual values were then 
computed for time intervals corresponding to each of the PM or MMR observations, using an 
algorithm described elsewhere (24).
GDP per capita measured in PPP or equivalent international dollars using 2005 as the base 
year were derived from The World Bank (30). Where a complete series was unavailable, annual 
estimates were obtained using linear interpolation between two observations, and assuming 
constant values before the first observation and after the last data point.
GFR estimates were calculated using annual series of live births and the populations of 
women aged 15–49 years, which were constructed using estimates from UNPD (28).
SAB coverage estimates consist of time series derived using data from household surveys 
and other sources, obtained from a database maintained by UNICEF. Although other sources 
of SAB data were consulted, only the UNICEF data were used because they adhere strictly 
to the indicator’s definition (29). Annual series were estimated by fitting a regression model 
with time as the sole predictor for the logit (log-odds) of SAB; such a model was estimated 
separately for each country. For countries with only one observation or no available SAB data, 
the SAB annual series were estimated using a multi-level model. In the multi-level model, 
logit (or log-odds) of observed SAB proportions for all countries were regressed against time. 
The model included region- and country-specific intercepts and slopes. The country-specific 
estimates of the intercept and slope were used to construct SAB estimates for countries 
with at least one data point, while the region-specific estimates of the intercept and slope 
were used to construct SAB estimates for countries without data. The multi-level model was 
also used in the following cases: 1) among series with more than one observation, when 
the observed change between the first and last observations was less than 20% and either 
the earliest year observed was after 1995 or the observation period was less than five years; 
2) among series with two observations, the observed change was greater than 30% and the 
observed period was greater than two years; and 3) among series with two observations 
where the observed change was less than 5% and either the earliest year observed was after 
1995 or the observation period was less than eight years.
Description of input data
Observed PMs from sisterhood data were age-standardized by imposing the age distribution 
of women in the sample population at the time of survey (rather than the age distribution 
implied by retrospective reports of sisters’ lives). If only the MMR was available from a data 
source, the MMR was converted into a PM using estimates of all-cause deaths of women 
aged 15–49 years, derived from WHO life tables (27), and live births data from UNPD (28).
<<<PAGE=26>>>
16
WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division estimates
Where observations were derived from death registration data meeting Group 1 and Group 2 
criteria in Box 5, adjusted MMRs were derived from PMs calculated for five-year averages and 
adjusted for misclassification. These five-year reference periods were determined by the last 
observed year of death registration data.
Adjustments to the input data
Prior to being used in the regression model, several adjustment factors were applied to 
all maternal mortality observations, to take into account the likely under identification of 
maternal deaths due to unreported abortion-related deaths or other causes.
Deaths from civil registration were adjusted upwards (by a factor of 1.5 by default or by a 
country-specific misclassification factor as noted earlier, see Appendix 1) for misclassification 
and then divided by the number of deaths of women aged 15–49 years to derive the PM. 
Observed deaths from other sources (e.g. surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, RAMOS, 
sample registration system and others) were adjusted upwards by a factor of 1.1 (24).
In addition, in order to improve the comparability of data inputs in terms of the definition, 
as some referred to maternal deaths and others to pregnancy-related deaths, pregnancy-
related deaths were adjusted down by removing a fraction of deaths that were assumed to 
be pregnancy related but not maternal (i.e. accidental or incidental deaths). Although the 
true fraction is typically unknown, an examination of studies that collected information on 
both maternal and pregnancy-related mortality showed average fractions of about 10–15%. 
The numbers of pregnancy-related deaths were therefore adjusted downwards by 10% for 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa and – because data on injury-related deaths (35) suggest higher 
risks outside of sub-Saharan Africa – maternal deaths were adjusted downwards by 15%.
Multi-level regression model
A multi-level linear regression model was used for deriving non-AIDS MMR estimates for 
122 countries (all Group B and C countries as well as six Group A countries as explained 
previously), using available observations of PM from Group A and B countries. In earlier work 
(24), a range of models were compared and the preferred model was chosen by assessing 
the statistical goodness of fit, the within-sample predictive accuracy and the plausibility of 
estimates out-of-sample. Goodness of fit was measured using deviance scores derived from 
standard log-likelihood calculations. The predictive accuracy of each model was evaluated 
by repeatedly holding out a portion of the data, fitting the model to the remaining subset of 
data and then comparing model predictions against the data that had been held out.

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
The model was fitted with three selected covariates (GDP , GFR and SAB) and random 
intercept effects for countries and regions. It can be described as follows:

where the following are associated with each observation i, within country j[i], within region k[i]:
PMina = proportion of maternal among non-AIDS deaths in women aged 15–49 years 
(non-AIDS PM)
GDPi = gross domestic product per capita (in 2005 PPP dollars)
GFRi = general fertility rate (live births per woman aged 15–49 years)

The model was estimated using the lme4 package (36) in R statistical software (37).
Only non-AIDS-related maternal deaths are included in the dependent variable of the 
regression model, PMna. The adjustment to the PM to remove AIDS deaths minimizes the 
influence of the HIV epidemic on observed PM values by removing AIDS deaths from both 
the numerator and the denominator. The methodology employed to remove AIDS deaths 
was unchanged from the previous revision; the adjustment parameters were updated in light 
of new data (see Appendix 5 for details).
Weights were not used in the model to adjust for differential uncertainty of observations. 
However, the weights of civil registration observations were implicitly reduced by a factor of 
five because these observations were collapsed into five-year time periods, and each such 
observation received a weight of one in the regression model. This approach was adopted to 
avoid giving excessive weight to civil registration data, which tend to come from countries 
where maternal mortality levels are low. Most other data sources (a single survey, census, 
special study, etc.) yielded a single observation that also refers to a multiple-year time period; 
such observations also received a weight of one in the regression model. Some surveys, 
however, yielded more than one data point for multiple time periods; in such cases all of the 
various observations were included in the model but with a combined weight of one.
To predict PM using the model, country covariate data and relevant country and regional 
effects were used. To estimate the multi-level regression model, countries were grouped 
into regions according to the global categories used by the UN Statistics Division (38). For 
countries with data available on maternal mortality, predictions of non-AIDS PM were based 
on country and regional random effects, whereas for countries with no available data, 
predictions used regional random effects only. For Indonesia, non-AIDS PM estimates were 
obtained by fitting the same model as described above but using fixed country intercepts 
and random coefficients for the predictor variables to obtain a better fit to the available data.

WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division estimates
After a final adjustment to add back the AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths to the PM (see 
below), the final PM values were converted to estimates of the MMR as follows:
 MMR = PM (D/B)
where D is the number of deaths in women aged 15–49 years estimated from WHO death 
rates (27) and UNPD population estimates (28) and B is the number of live births from UNPD 
population estimates (28).
Estimation of AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths
There is evidence from community studies that HIV-positive women have a higher risk of 
maternal death, although this may be offset by lower fertility (39–41). If HIV is prevalent, 
then there will also be more AIDS deaths2 among pregnant women that were incidental 
to pregnancy. It is thus important to address the issue of incidental and indirect maternal 
deaths among HIV-positive women, in estimating maternal mortality for these countries.
The dependent variable of the regression model described above includes only direct 
maternal deaths, but excludes all AIDS deaths from ’pregnancy-related‘ observations 
(even AIDS deaths that could properly be termed ’indirect maternal’ , in the sense that 
the pregnancy was a substantial aggravating factor for a death caused primarily by HIV 
infection). Thus, the regression model was used to estimate the number of maternal deaths 
not primarily due to HIV infection, and then the estimated number of AIDS-related indirect 
maternal deaths was added back to obtain the total number of maternal deaths (see 
Appendix 5 for details and an overview of changes in adjustment values).
Uncertainty of estimates
In this report, estimates of maternal mortality are presented along with upper and lower 
limits designed to depict the uncertainty of those estimates. The intervals are the product of 
a detailed probabilistic evaluation of the uncertainty attributable to the various components 
of the estimation process. The components of uncertainty can be divided into two groups: 
variability within the regression model (internal sources) and variability due to assumptions 
or calculations outside the model (external sources). Estimates of the total uncertainty reflect 
a combination of these various sources.
The internal component quantifies inferential uncertainty including variability in all elements 
of the multi-level regression model for deriving best estimates for individual countries 
(Groups B and C) and stochastic variability of estimates derived for countries with good civil 
registration data (Group A). Another internal component, predictive uncertainty associated 
with individual data points, was not included in the evaluation. The external component, 
on the other hand, includes uncertainty regarding assumptions about key parameters that 
are inputs into the estimation process (e.g. adjustment factors applied to observed data), as 
well as uncertainty about data inputs used for calculations that occur outside the regression 
model (e.g. estimated births, deaths and fraction of AIDS deaths).
2 The deaths referred to in this document as ‘AIDS deaths’ are referred to as ‘AIDS deaths’ in Joint United Nations Programme 
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) publications. These deaths include the estimated number of deaths related to HIV infection, including 
deaths that occur before reaching the clinical stage classified as AIDS.

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
For estimates computed directly from civil registration data, the level of uncertainty includes 
both an external component, i.e. variability due to inputs and assumptions, and an internal 
component of stochastic uncertainty related to random variation of maternal deaths 
recorded in civil registration.
To obtain the uncertainty intervals presented here, simulations of values using probability 
distributions were performed to depict internal and external components of variability. For 
the internal component, the regression model was estimated and simulations of parameter 
coefficients were performed. Using the simulated results, the distribution of the dependent 
variable was approximated in order to quantify the inferential uncertainty computed 
using lme4 in the R Statistical Package (36, 37). For the external component, probability 
distributions were set after considering a range of plausible alternatives and assessing 
the sensitivity of final estimates to choices within that range. It is worth noting that the 
uncertainty due to the external component is relatively small compared to the internal 
component; thus, the uncertainty due to choices of adjustment factors and unknown 
parameters appears rather small compared with the variability of observed data points 
around estimates of the regression model.
Using the distributions of the simulated estimates, 95% uncertainty intervals were derived 
from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Further details on estimating uncertainty levels can be 
found in Wilmoth et al. (2012) (24), or on the WHO website.

3.3 Computation of adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality
In countries where there is a high risk of maternal death, there is also an elevated likelihood 
of girls dying even before reaching reproductive age. For this reason, it makes sense to 
consider the lifetime risk of maternal mortality conditional on survival to adulthood. 
Information presented here includes a synthetic estimate of adult lifetime risk of maternal 
mortality, corresponding to the probability of a 15-year-old woman eventually dying from a 
maternal cause, assuming she is subjected throughout her lifetime to the age-specific risks of 
maternal death observed for a given population in a given year.
The adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality can be derived using either the MMR or the 
MMRate. However, a precise estimate of lifetime risk requires knowledge of how the MMR or 
the MMRate changes within the reproductive lifespan of women. Although such information 
is not generally available, it can be assumed that neither the MMR nor the MMRate is 
constant over the reproductive lifespan. Because this assumption is more realistic for the 
MMRate than for the MMR, the adult lifetime risk was calculated using the MMRate as shown 
in Box 6. This formula yields an estimate of the adult lifetime risk that takes into account 
competing causes of death.

WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division estimates
Box 6 
Formula for estimating adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality
Adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality =   T15 – T50
 × MMRateℓ15
where ℓ15 equals the probability of survival from birth until age 15 years, and (T15 – T50)/ℓ15 
equals the average number of years lived between ages 15 and 50 years (up to a maximum of 
35 years) among survivors to age 15 years. the values for ℓ15, T15 and T50 are life-table quantities 
for the female population during the period in question.
3.4 Global and regional estimates
Global and regional maternal mortality estimates (according to the MDG, UNFPA, UNICEF, 
UNPD, WHO and The World Bank regional groupings) were also computed. The MMR in a 
given region was computed as the estimated total number of maternal deaths divided by the 
number of live births for that region. Additionally, the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality 
was based on the weighted average of (T
15 – T50)/ℓ15 for a given region, multiplied by the 
MMRate of that region.
3.5 Methodological updates
Generally, the methods used for the 2013 maternal mortality estimation were similar to those 
for 2008 (5) and 2010 (4). The main differences were related to data availability and treatment 
of maternal deaths due to HIV. The 2013 round draws from an expanding global database of 
empirical observations consisting of 3347 country-years of data compared to 3200 country-
years of data in the 2010 round, a 5% increase.
Estimates of total female deaths in the reproductive age group for WHO Member States were 
revised from those used in the 2010 revision (27) to take into account new evidence and 
data on levels of adult mortality. This is a regular updating process carried out by WHO, with 
revised estimates published annually in the World Health Statistics (http://www.who.int/gho/
publications/world_health_statistics/en/). These revisions have resulted in revisions to MMRs 
estimated for a number of Member States, in some cases for countries where the survey data 
available for maternal deaths have not changed.
New series of live birth and GFR data were obtained from the World Population Prospects 
2012 revision (28). AIDS adjustment parameters were updated in light of new data (see 
Appendix 5).

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
4 Results
Globally, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has fallen by 45% between 1990 and 2013. All 
MDG regions of the world have experienced considerable reductions in maternal mortality. 
There were an estimated 289 000 maternal deaths in 2013, yielding an MMR of 210 maternal 
deaths per 100 000 live births among the 183 countries and territories that were covered in 
this analysis. The global adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality (i.e. the probability that a 
15-year-old woman will die eventually from a maternal cause) was 1 in 190 in 2013 (Table 2).
4.1 Maternal mortality estimates for 2013
Table 2 displays estimates of the global and regional maternal mortality indicators including 
the MMR, the range of uncertainty of MMR, the number of maternal deaths and the lifetime 
risk. The uncertainty ranges demonstrate that although a point estimate is presented, the 
true MMR could be somewhere between the lower and upper uncertainty limits.
Developing countries account for 99% (286 000) of the global maternal deaths with sub-
Saharan Africa region alone accounting for 62% (179 000) followed by Southern Asia (69 000). 
Oceania is the region with the fewest maternal deaths at 510.
The MMR in developing regions (230) was 14 times higher than in developed regions (16). 
MMR is considered to be high if it is ≥300–4994 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births and 
extremely high if it is ≥1000 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. While none of the MDG 
regions had extremely high MMR, sub-Saharan Africa was the only MDG developing region 
with very high MMR (510). Of the remaining MDG developing regions, five had low MMR 
Eastern Asia (33), Caucasus and Central Asia (39), Northern Africa (69), Western Asia (74), and 
Latin America and the Caribbean (85).The remaining MDG developing regions, which had 
moderate MMR, are South-eastern Asia (140), Southern Asia (190), and Oceania (190).
The adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality in women from sub-Saharan Africa was the 
highest at 1 in 38, in sharp contrast to 1 in 3700 among women in developed countries.
Country-level estimates are shown in Annex 1. Two countries accounted for one third of all 
global maternal deaths: India at 17% (50 000) and Nigeria at 14% (40 000). The ten countries 
that comprised 58% of the global maternal deaths reported in 2013 are: India (50 000, 17%); 
Nigeria (40 000, 14%); Democratic Republic of the Congo (21 000, 7%); Ethiopia (13 000, 4%);  
Indonesia (8800, 3%); Pakistan (7900, 3%); United Republic of Tanzania (7900, 3%); 
Kenya (6300, 2%); China (5900, 2%); Uganda (5900, 2%). 
4 Extremely high MMR (maternal deaths per 100 000 live births) ≥1000, very high MMR 500–999, high MMR 300–499, moderate 
MMR 100–299, low MMR <100.

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
Of the 40 countries with the highest MMR in 2013, Sierra Leone is estimated to have the 
highest, with an MMR of 1100. As shown in Annex 1 and in Figure 1, 15 countries (all in sub-
Saharan Africa) had very high MMR: Chad (980); Central African Republic (880); Somalia (850); 
Burundi (740); Democratic Republic of the Congo (730); South Sudan (730); Cote d’Ivoire (720); 
Guinea (650); Liberia (640); Niger (630); Cameroon (590); Guinea-Bissau (560); Nigeria (560); 
Mali (550); Malawi (510). Only two countries outside the sub-Saharan African region had 
high MMR: Afghanistan (400) and Haiti (380). In contrast, Cabo Verde and Mauritius were the 
only two sub-Saharan African countries that had low MMR, at 53 and 73 maternal deaths per 
100 000 live births, respectively.
Regarding adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality, Chad and Somalia had the highest at  
1 in 15 and 1 in 18, respectively. The estimated adult lifetime maternal mortality risks in high-
income countries is 1 in 3400 in comparison to low-income countries where the risk is 1 in 52.
Appendices 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 present the MMR, range of uncertainty, number of maternal 
deaths and adult lifetime risk for WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and UNPD regions, 
respectively.
Table 3 shows the number of maternal deaths, MMR and percentage of maternal deaths 
attributed to HIV by MDG region. Percentage of AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths by 
country is presented in Annex 1 for countries with an HIV prevalence ≥ 5.0% (among adults 
15–49 years) between 1990 and 2013. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 6800 (91%) of 
the estimated 7500 maternal deaths attributed to HIV worldwide. Only three other MDG 
regions had more than 100 maternal deaths attributed to HIV: Southern Asia (340), Latin 
America and the Caribbean(130), and South-eastern Asia (110). The proportion of maternal 
deaths attributed to HIV in sub-Saharan Africa was 3.8%, yielding a HIV-attributed MMR for

sub-Saharan Africa of 19 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. Without HIV, the MMR for 
sub-Saharan Africa would be 491 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births instead of 510.
Although the regional aggregates of the proportions of maternal deaths attributed to 
HIV were relatively small, they were substantial for countries with high HIV prevalence. 
Eight countries had a proportion of maternal deaths attributed to HIV of 10% or more: 
South Africa (41.4%); Botswana (23.5%); Swaziland (18.6%); Zambia (15.4%); Lesotho (14.8%); 
Namibia (13.9%); Mozambique (13%); Gabon (10.4%).

4.2 Trends in maternal mortality from 1990 to 2013
Globally, the total number of maternal deaths decreased by 45% from 523 000 in 1990 to 
289 000 in 2013 (Table 4). Similarly, global MMR declined by 45% from 380 maternal deaths 
per 100 000 live births in 1990 to 210 in 2013 yielding an average annual decline of 2.6%. 
Worldwide MMR declined annually by 3.3 % between 2005 and 2013, faster than the 2.2% 
average annual decline observed between 1990 and 2005.
All regions experienced a decline of 37% or more in MMR between 1990 and 2013. The 
highest reduction in the 23-year period was in Eastern Asia (65%) followed by Southern Asia 
(64%), Northern Africa (57%), South-eastern Asia (57%), Oceania (51%), sub-Saharan Africa 
(49%), Caucasus and Central Asia (44%), Western Asia (43%), and Latin America and the 
Caribbean (40%).
Eastern Asia experienced the highest average annual decline between 2005 and 2013 at 5.2% 
while Latin America and the Caribbean experienced the least decline in the same period, at 
1.1%. When interpreting change in MMR, consideration must be given to the relative ease of 
reducing MMR when levels are high compared to when they are low.
Appendices 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 present similar tables for WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World 
Bank and UNPD regions, respectively.
Country-level trends in maternal mortality levels are shown in Annex 2. Of the 183 countries 
and territories that were covered in this analysis, between 1990 and 2013, 166 countries 
experienced total MMR percentage declines, 17 countries had an increase. Notably, 19 
countries have already experienced 75% reduction in MMR between 1990 and 2013, much 
earlier than the target year of 2015. These countries are: Belarus (96% reduction in MMR); 
Maldives (93%); Bhutan (87%); Cambodia (86%); Israel (84%); Equatorial Guinea (81%); 
Poland (81%); Lao People’s Democratic Republic (80%); Romania (80%); Bulgaria (78%); 
Estonia (78%); Timor-Leste (78%); Eritrea (77%); Cabo Verde (77%); Latvia (77%); Oman (77%); 
Lebanon (76%); Nepal (76%) and Rwanda (76%).
For some countries in southern Africa such as Botswana and South Africa, MMR increased 
from the year 1990 to 2000, mainly as result of the HIV epidemic, and then started to decline, 
most likely due to increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (42). In 1990, there were 
nearly 1700 AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths. Following the trend of the HIV epidemic, 
this subset of maternal deaths increased in numbers, peaking in 2005 at 12 000, but then 
showing evidence of decline in 2010 and 2013, when an estimated 8500 and 7500 AIDS-
related indirect maternal deaths occurred.
4.3 Comparison with previous maternal mortality estimates
As explained in Section 3.5, the methodology employed for the 2013 estimates is similar 
to that for the 2008 and 2010 estimates. However, given that the global database used for 
the current 2013 increased in country-years of data by 5%, estimates of total female deaths 
in the reproductive age group were updated, and the number of countries increased from 
181 to 183, the current estimates should be used for the interpretation of trends in maternal 
mortality from 1990 to 2013, rather than comparing to or extrapolating estimates from 
previously published estimates.

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
5 Progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5
The fifth MDG aims to improve maternal health, with a target of reducing the MMR by 
75% between 1990 and 2015 and a second one on achieving universal access, by 2015, to 
reproductive health. While most countries or regions aspire to achieve MDG 5 by 2015, some 
countries will not attain this goal if current trends persist. One way to gauge progress is to 
examine if countries have had the expected average annual MMR decline of 5.5% from 1990 
to 2013.
Accordingly, countries with MMR ≥100 in 1990 have been categorized as ‘on track’ , ‘making 
progress’ , ‘insufficient progress’ or ‘no progress’ in improving maternal health. The cut-off of 
100 was arbitrarily chosen to focus assessment of progress in countries that have started 
with a relatively high level of mortality in the baseline year of 1990, and given the difficulty 
in reducing MMR further for countries that already had low MMR (<100) in 1990. A country is 
considered to be ‘on track’ if the average annual percentage decline between 1990 and 2013 
is 5.5% or more. If the average annual decline in MMR is between 2% and 5.5%, the country is 
considered to be ‘making progress’ . Countries with an average annual decline of less than 2% 
are considered to have made ‘insufficient progress’ and countries with rising MMR have been 
categorized as making ‘no progress’ .
At the country level, as noted in Section 4.2, the 19 countries that had achieved MDG 5 by 
2013 are: Belarus (96% reduction in MMR); Maldives (93%); Bhutan (87%); Cambodia (86%); 
Israel (84%); Equatorial Guinea (81%); Poland (81%); Lao People’s Democratic Republic (80%); 
Romania (80%); Bulgaria (78%); Estonia (78%); Timor-Leste (78%); Eritrea (77%);  
Cabo Verde (77%); Latvia (77%); Oman (77%); Lebanon (76%); Nepal (76%) and  
Rwanda (76%). Among these, 11 had a baseline of MMR ≥100 in 1990, and are indicated  
as ‘on track ‘ to achieve MDG 5 in Annex 2. Further, 63 countries were characterized as  
‘making progress’ while 13 countries have made ‘insufficient progress’ .
Although the decline in MMR between 1990 and 2013 has been slower than expected, 
several countries, as seen above, have made substantial progress in reducing maternal 
deaths. An analysis of 10 countries that have made progress towards achievement of both 
MDG 4 and 5, showed common overarching elements of success including: leadership and 
partnership, evidence and innovation, development and implementation of dual short-
term and long-term strategies, and adaptation to change for sustained progress (44). These 
countries have adapted, tested and rapidly scaled up service delivery models.
The analysis highlights specific strategies that have contributed to success in some of 
the above countries deemed as being ‘on track’ . For example, Cambodia has prioritized 
preventing maternal and newborn deaths through an Emergency Obstetric and Newborn 
Care (EmONC) Improvement Plan. The plan recognizes that implementing targeted EmONC 
requires an enabling environment, and includes improving referral systems, communication, 
transport, equipment, drugs and other supplies. This enabling environment would eventually 
be able to support the effective delivery of a broader range of health services. Rwanda 
deployed community health workers and volunteers to address immediate, urgent health 
needs. At the same time, the country invested in its long-term vision to build a professional 
health workforce and kept colleges open, even if external funders did not think this was a 
priority, and despite there being few professors. Professors from neighbouring countries,

during their holidays, taught at Rwandan colleges. These investments paid off, with the 
country now having fully established colleges and partnerships with international medical, 
nursing, dental and health management colleges. In Nepal, reframing basic health needs 
as health rights has been the main thrust of the policies. Many government strategies and 
policies related to safer motherhood, neonatal health, nutrition and gender are anchored in 
the principles of human rights (44).
Additionally, the rapid roll-out of antiretroviral therapy in the past decade in regions with 
high HIV prevalence has contributed to reduction of female deaths and maternal deaths. 
The 2013 UNAIDS report on AIDS in low- and middle-income countries indicates that 
the number of people on antiretroviral therapy reached 9.7 million in 2012, compared to 
just over 8.1 million in 2011 – an increase of 1.6 million in one year alone (45). At least 10 
countries (Botswana, Cabo Verde, Eritrea, Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe) reported reaching 80% or more of adults eligible for antiretroviral 
therapy (46).
The UN Secretary-General’s launch of the Global strategy for women’s and children’s health 
in September 2010 has helped to mobilize commitments by governments, civil society 
organizations and development partners to accelerate progress towards MDGs 4 and 5 (1), 
especially during the past few years. The Commission on Information and Accountability for 
Women’s and Children’s Health – established to “determine the most effective international 
institutional arrangements for global reporting, oversight and accountability on women’s 
and children’s health” – recommended that all countries take “significant steps to establish 
a system for registration of births, deaths and causes of death, and have well-functioning 
health information systems that combine data from facilities, administrative sources and 
surveys” (2). However, insufficient progress on this recommendation was noted by the iERG 
on their assessment of the implementation of the commission’s recommendations (3). This 
analysis highlights the limited availability of high quality data that is based on such complete 
and accurate registration systems, as shown in the range of data sources available to use for 
the analysis.
Maternal death reviews provide an important tool for capturing maternal deaths, thereby, 
contributing to better estimates of maternal mortality, while also helping to initiate 
necessary actions to prevent deaths. The WHO recent publication of technical guidance 
on maternal death surveillances and response (MDSR) aims to contribute to progress on 
the Commission’s recommendation on registration of every maternal death (47). MDSR is 
aimed at preventing maternal deaths and includes the key components of identification 
and notification of all maternal deaths; in-depth review of maternal deaths; analysis and 
interpretation of aggregated findings from reviews; and response to the recommendations 
of the reviews. Implementation of the MDSR system should help to accelerate progress 
towards MDG 5 and make maternal deaths rare events beyond 2015.
Discussions on the post-2015 UN development agenda are underway. Although levels of 
decline in maternal mortality seen during the past 23 years will not be sufficient to achieve 
MDG 5, the steady progress we have witnessed indicates that ending preventable maternal 
mortality is achievable in this lifetime. Analyses of past progress suggest the feasibility 
of realizing this vision indicated by a global MMR of less than 70 in 2030 (48), within the 
sustainable development agenda beyond 2015.

Estimates have been computed to ensure comparability across countries, thus they are not necessarily the same as official statistics of the 
countries, which may use alternative rigorous methods.
a The MMR and lifetime risk have been rounded according to the following scheme: <100, no rounding; 100–999, rounded to nearest 10; 
and >1000, rounded to nearest 100. The numbers of maternal deaths have been rounded as follows: <100, no rounding; 100–999, rounded to 
nearest 10; 1000–9999, rounded to nearest 100; and >10 000, rounded to nearest 1000.
b Percentage of AIDS-related maternal deaths are presented only for countries with an HIV prevalence ≥ 5.0% (among adults 15–49 years) 
between 1990 and 2013.
c Proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM).
d Group A indicates country estimates based on good civil registration data; Group B indicates modelled country estimates using available 
national data; and Group C indicates modelled country estimates where no national data are available on maternal mortality.
e Vital registration data were available for analysis only up to 2009. Recent hospital surveillance data for Canada excluding Quebec indicate a 
decline of maternal deaths per 100 000 deliveries from 8.8 in 2007-2009 to 6.1 in 2009-2011. 98% of deliveries in Canada occur in hospitals.

Estimates have been computed to ensure comparability across countries; thus they are not necessarily the same as official statistics of the 
countries, which may use alternative rigorous methods.
a MMR estimates have been rounded according to the following scheme: <100, no rounding; 100–999, rounded to nearest 10; and >1000, 
rounded to nearest 100.
b Negative values indicate a decreasing MMR from 1990 to 2013, while positive values indicate an increasing MMR. Percentages have been 
calculated using unrounded estimates. The average annual per cent change is estimated by:
c For countries with MMR ≥100 in 1990, they are categorized as ‘on track’ if MMR has had 5.5% or more average annual decline; ‘making prog-
ress’ if MMR has had 2% to 5.5% average annual decline; ‘insufficient progress’ if MMR has had less than 2% average annual decline; and ‘no 
progress’ if MMR has had an average annual increase. Countries with MMR <100 in 1990 are not categorized.
d Vital registration data were available for analysis only up to 2009. Recent hospital surveillance data for Canada excluding Quebec indicate a 
decline of maternal deaths per 100 000 deliveries from 8.8 in 2007-2009 to 6.1 in 2009-2011. 98% of deliveries in Canada occur in hospitals.

Appendix 5. Estimation of maternal deaths due to HIV
In this estimation process, the full model has two parts, the first part to separately estimate maternal 
deaths not related to AIDS (discussed in Chapter 3) and the second part to estimate AIDS-related 
maternal deaths. AIDS-related maternal deaths refer to HIV-positive women who have died because of 
the aggravating effect of pregnancy on HIV; where the interaction between pregnancy and HIV becomes 
the underlying cause of death, these are counted as ‘indirect maternal’ deaths. It is important to note that 
direct maternal deaths among HIV-positive women are not estimated separately but are rather included 
within the first part of the model.
Thus, the final PM estimates are the result of adding the results of this two-part model: the estimated 
number of non-AIDS-related maternal deaths and the estimated number of AIDS-related indirect 
maternal deaths:
 PM = (1 – a) PM
na + a PMa (A1)
where:
PMna is the proportion of non-AIDS maternal deaths among all non-AIDS deaths 
(women aged 15–49 years);
PMa is the proportion of AIDS-related maternal deaths among all AIDS deaths  
(women aged 15–49 years);
a is the proportion of AIDS deaths among all deaths (women aged 15–49 years).
This appendix describes the second part of the two-part model, that is, the estimation of indirect 
maternal AIDS-related deaths, PMa. The sources of data for estimating the fraction of AIDS-related indirect 
maternal deaths are the UNAIDS 2013 estimates of AIDS-related deaths2 and the total number of deaths 
estimated by WHO from its life tables. The approach used to estimate the proportion of AIDS deaths that 
qualify as indirect maternal deaths, PM
a, is the product of two quantities:
 PM a = υu (A2)
where:
υ is the proportion of AIDS deaths in women aged 15–49 years that occur during pregnancy or the 
childbirth period. The value of υ is computed as follows:
 υ =   ck GFR
1 + c (k–1) GFR    (A3)
u is the fraction of AIDS deaths among pregnant women that qualify as maternal because of some 
causal relationship with the pregnancy, delivery or postpartum period;
GFR is the general fertility rate;
c is the average woman-years lived in the maternal risk period per live birth (set equal to 1 year, 
including the 9 month gestation, plus 42 days postpartum, and an additional 1.5 months to account 
for pregnancies not ending in a live birth);
k is the relative risk of dying from AIDS for a pregnant versus non-pregnant woman.
2 The deaths referred to in this document as AIDS deaths are referred to as AIDS deaths in UNAIDS publications. These deaths include the 
estimated number of deaths related to HIV infection, including deaths that occur before reaching the clinical stage classified as AIDS.

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013
In the 2013 estimates, updated values for k and u were used, in light of new data from the network for 
Analyzing Longitudinal Population-based HIV/AIDS data on Africa (ALPHA).3 Based on the findings in 
the paper and further exploration of the data, both k as well as u were set equal to 0.3. The uncertainty 
distributions for both parameters were updated as well, the standard deviation for k was set to 0.1 and for 
u, a uniform distribution with outcomes between 0.1 and 0.5 was used.

Appendix 17. Summary of country consultations
The generation of global, regional, and country-level estimates and trends in morbidity and mortality is 
one of the core functions of WHO, which is the agency within the UN system that leads the production of 
updated maternal mortality estimates. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB.107.
R8) seeking to “establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives 
from Member States in different WHO regions. ” A key objective of this consultation process is “to ensure 
that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used. ” Since the process is an integral step in 
the overall estimation strategy, it is described briefly here.
The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each 
country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites 
focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation, and the preliminary estimates. Focal 
person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the 
preliminary estimates.
The country consultation process for the 2014 round of maternal mortality estimates was initiated with 
an official communication from WHO to all Member States on 15 April 2013. This letter informed Member 
States of the forthcoming exercise in maternal mortality estimation and requested the designation of 
an official contact (typically within the national health ministry and/or the central statistics office) to 
participate in the consultation. The designated officials received the following items by e-mail: (1) a copy 
of official communication; (2) draft estimates and data sources; and (3) a summary of the methodology 
used. WHO regional offices actively collaborated in identifying focal persons through their networks.
The formal consultation process was officially completed by 22 August 2013. Of the 183 Member 
States included in the analysis, WHO received designated officials from 121 Member States; AFRO
4 (20), 
AMRO (18), EMRO (19), EURO (35), SEARO (10), WPRO (19), and received feedback, comments and/or data 
from 71 Member States. During the consultation period, new data submitted by countries were reviewed 
to determine whether they met the study’s inclusion criteria. Data were considered acceptable to use 
as new input data if they were representative of the national population and referred to a specific time 
interval within the period from the late 1980s until the present
As a result of the country consultation and updated civil registration data, 232 new country-years of data 
observations were included for the maternal mortality estimates from 65 countries and consisted of 94 
country-years of civil registration data and 138 country-years from other sources, mainly from sisterhood 
survey data and maternal mortality surveillance systems.
As in the previous country consultation, the new observations were from civil registration systems and 
surveys; however, the increase in number of other new observations also shows that countries lacking 
functioning civil registration systems are increasingly investing in monitoring maternal mortality with 
empirical data from alternative sources.
