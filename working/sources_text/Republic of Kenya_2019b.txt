Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES

T
he legal mechanisms spelt out in the Constitution of Kenya 2010, have necessitated the development of 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems for county governments. The Constitution requires adherence 
to principles of good governance and transparency in the conduct and management of public programmes/
projects. For devolution to succeed, county and national governments recognize that performance monitoring 
and evaluation are pivotal development and service delivery tools for leaders at all levels. Thus, the focus of both 
county and national governments is increasingly on development results and how they can best be measured 
to achieve the desired goals.
The National Treasury and Planning (TNTP) and the Council of Governors (CoG) are committed to 
developing centers of excellence in performance management for public service delivery. By coordinating 
our efforts, we intend to accelerate progress in the counties to achieve a high quality of life for all Kenyans. 
We also intend to create a strong feedback mechanism that will regularly provide county residents with 
good quality and timely monitoring and evaluation (M&E) information and data regarding implementation 
progress of government development projects 
and programmes.
These guidelines are intended to assist staff in the design and implementation of an M&E system to track policies, 
programmes and projects in the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP). The guidelines will also serve as a 
useful reference for staff of the national government, public agencies, commissions, academic institutions and 
other institutions involved or interested in the design and implementation of a monitoring or evaluation system. 
These County Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation System (CIMES) guidelines have been developed after 
extensive consultations and dialogue with relevant stakeholders. It is expected that implementation across 
all counties will also improve the co-ordination of development planning, policy formulation and delivery 
of development targets and public services by strengthening performance management mechanisms 
for county and national governments. The use of these guidelines also prepares counties for electronic 
support for CIMES and standardized reporting mechanism.

These guidelines were developed as part of the National Capacity Building Framework (NCBF) that aligns 
and guides ongoing capacity building and mobilizing new resources for devolution. The implementation 
of these guidelines requires change in the mind-set and approach of staff. They place a high premium on 
coherent short, medium and long-range planning around results; involving county citizens in the design 
and implementation of development programmes and projects. They emphasize partnerships with key 
stakeholders for development change; capacity building for improving and enhancing ownership of 
M&E activities at county level; and the promotion of knowledge and learning through the use of county 
M&E reports.
We are confident, that these guidelines are a useful tool for those responsible for monitoring and evaluation in 
the counties and that they will contribute to the acceleration of service delivery and an improvement in value-
for-money across county governments.

his document has been developed through consultations and stakeholder workshops on County M&E 
Guidelines organised by personnel from the Monitoring and Evaluation Department (MED) of the 
National Treasury and Planning in collaboration with the CoG.
The document draws upon detailed discussions with County Governors, Deputy County Governors 
and various county officials. It benefited from meetings with Independent Commissions including; the 
Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA), the Controller of Budget (COB), the Kenya National Audit Office, 
the Kenya School of Government, the defunct Commission on the Implementation of the Constitution, 
the Senate, National and County Government Ministries. Others include the Performance Contracting 
Department, the National Treasury and Planning (TNTP). The content draws on the constitutional and legal 
mandates, regulations, acts, policies and identified needs and challenges of these stakeholders.
This document is in line with the Constitution of Kenya, the County Governments Act (2012) and the Public 
Financial Management Act (2012). The content also draws on reviews of County Integrated Development Plans 
(CIDPs), MED training materials and the CIDP Guidelines. It has greatly benefited from District M&E Guidelines 
from Ghana, Budget Service Delivery Implementation Plan Guidelines from South Africa, and the published 
performance management policy and practice of Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, South Africa. This document 
is consistent with the spirit of Kenya Vision 2030 and its Medium Term Plans (MTPs). Best practice from existing 
documents has been used where possible. The documents used are presented in the references section.
The State Department for Planning under the National Treasury and Planning and the CoG, acknowledge the 
support of Gaiasoft International for the technical support in developing the Guidelines and funding from 
the World Bankâs Kenya Accountable Devolution Programme and from the Department for International 
Development (DFID). We also acknowledge the support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),

Lastly, we recognise the role-played by the staff from MED and the CoG Secretariat led by Dr. Samson Machuka 
in revising the 2016 Guidelines. We also thank participants from the 47 counties for their valuable input in the 
harmonization of the Guidelines. The CIMES Guidelines can be found on the website of the State Department 
for Planning (http://www.planning.go.ke/) and the State Departmentâs Resource Centre. The Guidelines can also 
be accessed at the CoG website (http://www.cog.go.ke) and the Maarifa Centre (https://maarifa.cog.go.ke/). We 
call upon all to use the Guidelines to develop M&E systems for programmes and projects, and as a reference 
material in teaching and research.

T
hese guidelines deal with a range of concepts 
and terms, which may need clarification for 
those unfamiliar with the process of designing a 
programme or project monitoring and evaluation 
system. The definitions and concepts offered below 
are mainly those used by the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
the United Nations and the World Bankâs Africa 
Region 
Evaluation Groups.
1. Monitoring: Monitoring is the process of 
collecting, analyzing and reporting data on a 
projectâs or programmeâs inputs, activities, outputs, 
outcomes and impacts, as well as external factors, 
in order to track whether actual investment 
programme results are being achieved. These data, 
when analysed, pin point progress or constraints as 
early as possible, allowing managers to adjust project 
or programme activities as needed. Monitoring aims 
to provide managers, decision makers and other 
stakeholders with regular feedback on progress in 
the implementation of activities specified in the 
development plans.
2. Evaluation: Evaluation is a systematic 
and objective assessment of an ongoing or 
completed project, programme or policy, its design, 
implementation and results. An evaluation determines 
the relevance and fulfillment of objectives, efficiency, 
effectiveness, impact and sustainability. Evaluation 
is linked to monitoring. Monitoring provides the 
basis for evaluation, which involves answering two 
questions: âHas the project or programme activity 
met its objectives?â And âWhat accounts for its level 
of performance?â Evaluation tells managers whether 
project/programme activities are moving toward 
or away from project/programme objective or 
management goals, and why. It provides lessons learnt 
and recommendations for future improvements.
3. Review: An assessment of the performance of 
an intervention, periodically or on anad hoc basis. 
Reviews are usually less comprehensive and/or in-
depth than evaluations. They tend to emphasize 
operational aspects and they are undertaken at mid-
term or end-term of a project/programme.
4. Indicators: An indicator is a measure that can be 
used to monitor or evaluate an intervention. Indicators 
can be quantitative (derived from measurements 
associated with the intervention) or qualitative 
(entailing verbal feedback from beneficiaries).
5. Performance vs. Impact Indicators: Project or 
programme monitoring and evaluation involve two 
kinds of indicators: implementation performance 
indicators (project/programme inputs and outputs) 
and project impact indicators (achievement of 
objectives in relation to socio-economic development). 
Implementation performance indicators measure the 
progress in securing project inputs and delivering 
project outputs against set targets, while project 
impact indicators measure the consequence (the âSo 
whatâ) of implementation.
6. As will be observed in section 3.3 of this 
document, 
M&E revolves around a number of  other 
key elements:
(a) Inputs:  Inputs are all the resources that 
contribute to the production of service delivery 
outputs. Inputs are âwhat we use to do the workâ . 
They include finances, personnel, equipment 
and buildings;
(b) Activities: These are the processes or steps one 
takes to reach the projectâs or programmeâs 
objective. They are written in the sequence 
or order in which they will be implemented. 
Each activity completed brings one closer to 
achieving the project objective;
Basic Concepts and Terminology
<<<PAGE=16>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
viii
(c) Outputs: These are the final products, goods or 
services produced for delivery. Outputs may be 
defined as âwhat we produce or deliverâ .
(d) Outcomes: The medium-term results for specific 
beneficiaries which are the consequence of 
achieving specific outputs. Outcomes should 
relate clearly to an institutionâs strategic goals 
and objectives as set out in its plans. Outcomes 
are âwhat we wish to achieveâ . Outcomes are 
often further categorised into immediate/direct 
outcomes and intermediate outcomes.
(e) Impacts: Impacts are about âhow we have 
actually influenced communities and target 
groupsâ . The results or consequences of 
achieving specific outcomes, such as reducing 
poverty or creating jobs.
(f ) Results are the outputs, outcomes, or impacts, 
intended or unintended, positive or negative of 
a development intervention. The Government 
only encourages results that support sustainable 
improvement in the countryâs outcomes 
bringing real positive changes in peopleâs lives 
especially the poor.
7. Key terms used in evaluation terms include:
(a) Relevance: The extent to which the objectives 
of a development intervention are consistent 
with beneficiariesâ requirements, country needs, 
global priorities and partnerâ and donorâs 
policies. It answers the question whether we are 
doing the right things.
(b) Efficiency: A measure of how economically 
resources/inputs (funds, expertise, time, etc.) 
are converted to results. This examines whether 
the objectives are achieved in a cost-efficient 
manner by the development intervention.
(c) Effectiveness: The extent to which the 
development interventionâs objectives were 
achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking 
into account their relative importance. It answers 
the question whether the objectives of the 
development intervention has been achieved.
(d) Sustainability: The continuation of benefits 
from development intervention after major 
development assistance has been completed. 
The probability of continued long-term benefits 
and the resilience to risk of the net benefit flows 
over time. This answers the question whether 
the positive effects are sustainable over time.

1.1 Background
1. Kenya has undertaken development 
planning since it gained independence from 
Britain in December 1963. However, due to the 
non-existence of an integrated monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) system, execution of development 
plans has been  weak over much of the past 
decades. Complaints of non-implementation, or 
non-completion, of highly ambitious projects were 
common. Information collection, analysis and 
reporting of results were undertaken in an adhoc 
manner. Decision-making and feedback at the local 
level was seldom based on verifiable evidence in 
the absence of a comprehensive M&E system.
2. Efforts were made to establish individual 
project and programme-based M&E in the country 
in the 1980s and 1990s. Most development plans 
prepared during this period included a section 
on M&E. However, most of these M&E plans were 
prepared in response to donor demands, leading to 
very specific project and programme evaluations. 
As a consequence of the dominance of donor 
requirements, the M&E reports produced were 
rarely shared with the intended project/programme 
beneficiaries and were never used for evidence-
based decision making.
3. Development of an integrated M&E system 
in Kenya began in 2000 with the implementation 
of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(I-PRSP) 2000-2003. It was enhanced during 
the implementation of the Economic Recovery 
Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation 
(ESRWEC), 2003-2007. The Investment Programme 
for the ERSWEC recognised the important 
role of M&E in promoting accountability and 
enhancing good governance issues. This resulted 
in the development of the National Integrated 
Monitoring and Evaluation System (NIMES) in 2004; 
and the creation of the Monitoring and Evaluation 
Directorate (MED) in the Ministry of Planning and 
National Development. NIMES has been further 
enhanced during the implementation of Kenya 
Vision 2030, which was launched in June 2008 and 
is being implemented through five-year Medium-
Term Plans (MTPs). Most of the NIMES activities 
have been concentrated at the national level, with 
little emphasis on tracking sub-national project/
programme interventions.
4. With the introduction of NIMES, M&E has in 
the past decade become an integral part of the 
policy formulation and implementation process 
at the national level. The output of the NIMES 
process is used for, amongst other purposes, 
informing national development planning and 
policy dialogue within government and the private 
sector, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and 
development partners.
1.2 Purpose of the Guidelines
5. A County Integrated Monitoring and 
Evaluation System (CIMES), may be defined as a 
tracking system for county development results 
and performance. It verifies whether the activities 
of each countyâs priority project or programme 
are happening according to planning timelines 
and targets presented in the County Integrated 
Development Plan (CIDP); and whether resources 
are being used in a correct and efficient manner.
6. The system will supply the county with a 
regular flow of information throughout the course 
of CIDP programme implementation, to make it 
possible to detect changes in status and utilization

of resources allocated to CIDP priority projects or 
programmes. Disseminating M&E results can raise 
awareness of a countyâs programme and projects 
among the general public and help build positive 
perceptions about the countyâs leadership; and this 
may lead to increased resource allocation towards 
the well performing counties. 
7. These Guidelines serve to assist county 
government staff to set-up, design, implement 
and sustain a functional M&E system that tracks 
county development. The guidelines will also 
serve as a useful reference for other stakeholders 
who are interested in the design, implementation, 
monitoring or evaluating of their programmes and 
projects. Academic institutions, researchers and the 
public can use the Guidelines as a reference material 
in the area of design of M&E systems.
1.3 The Structure of Government
1.3.1 The National Government
8. In 2010, a new Constitution of Kenya was 
promulgated, ushering in a devolved system of 
government. The system comprises two distinct 
but interrelated levels of government: the national 
government; and the 47 county governments. The 
national government retains the three arms; the 
National Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. 
The Judiciary has not been devolved therefore; 
county governments comprise the Executive and 
the Legislature. The National Executive comprises 
the President, the Deputy President, the Attorney-
General, and a maximum of 22 Cabinet Secretaries 
who are appointed by the President with the approval 
of the National Assembly. Other state officers who 
serve with the Cabinet are the Secretary to the 
Cabinet and Principal Secretaries also appointed by 
the President with approval of National Assembly. 
The Constitution of Kenya, Article 93, establishes 
a bicameral parliament consisting of the National 
Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly 
represents the constituencies while the Senate 
represents the counties.
9. The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of 
Kenya specifies the functions to be performed 
by each level of government. The national 
government is primarily responsible for a bulk of 
the policy making functions on matters cutting 
across the nation.
10. The national government also exercises 
oversight over county governments, operates the 
national revenue, national security, and foreign 
affairs. It is responsible for national economic 
policy and planning; monetary policy, currency 
and banking; national statistics; intellectual 
property rights; consumer protection, including 
standards for social security and professional 
pension plans; general principles of land planning 
and the co-ordination of planning by the counties; 
universities, tertiary educational institutions and 
other institutions of research and higher learning, 
and primary schools, special education institutions 
and secondary schools, setting of education 
standards, curricula, examinations and the granting 
of university charters.
11. Other functions of the national government 
include: the use of international waters and water 
resources; immigration and citizenship; promotion 
of sports; transport and communications, including 
road traffic and construction and operation of national 
trunk roads, railways, pipelines, marine navigation, 
civil aviation, postal services, telecommunications, 
and radio and television broadcasting; national 
public works; protection of the environment and 
natural resources; national referral health facilities; 
national disaster management; national elections; 
capacity building and technical assistance to the 
counties;  and public  investment.
12. Some of the National Government functions 
are performed by national government 
agencies at the county level. These functions 
are coordinated by the County Commissioner 
whose responsibilities Include but not limited

governance, accountability and participation of 
the people in the implementation of National 
Government programmes for sustainable 
development; (iv) Ensure prudent utilization 
and accountability of resources of the National

Cabinet Secretary responsible for Coordination 
of National Government with copies to Head of 
Public Ser vice.
1.3.2 The County Governments
13. County governments are established by the 
Constitution of Kenya in Article 176. A county 
government consists of a county assembly and a 
county executive. The County Executive Committee 
comprises of the Governor, the Deputy Governor 
and County Executive Committee Members. The 
County Assembly is the legislative arm of each 
county government. The county public service is 
headed by the County Secretary who is also the 
secretary to County Executive Committee (CEC). 
The CEC members are individually and collectively 
accountable to the Governor in the exercise of their 
powers and the performance of their duties and 
responsibilities.
14. The County Executive operates more or less 
like the National Executive, only that its scope 
is limited to the county. The Governor is the chief 
executive of the county, deputised by the Deputy 
Governor. They are supported by a CEC. The members 
of the CEC are appointed by the Governor subject 
to the approval by the County Assembly, and they 
function as the cabinet.

The national government is primarily responsible for a 
bulk of the policy making functions on matters cutting 
across the nation, including making policies relating to 
agriculture, veterinary, /f_ishing, health, education, 
energy, housing, tourism, labour standards, 
international trade and foreign aï¬airs.
The county governments are responsible for 
policy-making on matters relating to the fourteen 
county functions and for implementation of 
speci/f_ic national government policies, ensuring 
and coordinating the participation of communities 
and locations in governance at the local level.
Figure 1: Structure of Government in Kenya

Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES4
15. The c ounty governments are responsible 
for implementing activities in the following 
areas: agriculture (crop and animal husbandry);  
education (pre-primary education, village 
polytechnics, home craft centers and childcare 
facilities); county public works and services, 
fisheries, county health services, cultural activities, 
public entertainment and  social amenities; 
county transport; county trade development and 
regulation; county planning and development 
including county statistics, land survey and 
mapping; control of air pollution, noise pollution, 
and outdoor advertising; animal control and welfare; 
implementation of specific national government 
policies on natural resources, environmental 
conservation; firefighting services; traffic and 
parking; ferries and harbours; control of drugs 
and pornography; and ensuring and coordinating 
the participation of communities and locations in 
governance at the local level.
16. Some functions fall under the jurisdiction 
of both the national government and the 
county governments and are thus referred to as 
concurrent functions. In this case, the Constitution 
foresees a system of devolution based on co-
ordination, collaboration, consultation and co-
operation. M&E is one of the concurrent functions 
that require coordination of the two levels of 
government at the county.
1.3.3 Planning at County Level
17. The constitution requires county 
governments to plan and budget for the delivery 
of goods and services under their mandate.  
The following plans guide planning, budgeting, 
implementation and M&E within the county: (i)
County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP), (ii)
County Sectoral Plans, (iii) County Performance 
Management Plans; (iv)County Spatial Plan; (v) 
Annual Development Plan (ADP); and (vi) cities and 
urban area plans. These plans are interrelated as they 
deal with different aspects of county development. 
18. The CIDPs are prepared according to the 
County Governments Act (2012) and CIDP 
Guidelines. The CIDP preparation is required to 
be participatory in nature in line with the County 
Public participation Guidelines. This is guided by 
1 2 3 4 5
County governments were established in March 2013 after the /f_irst general
elections under CoK 2010. The constitution requires county governments to plan
and budget for the delivery of goods and services under their mandate through the
following plans:
In additon to CIDP, every county must develop an Annual Development Plan
(ADP) and Annual Fiscal Strategy during the CIDP period.

the principles of integrating national values in all 
projects planning and implementation processes; 
linking priority county investment programmes 
to the Kenya Vision 2030 and its Medium Term 
Plans (MTP); aligning county financial and 
institutional resources to agreed policy objectives 
and programmes; unification of planning, 
budgeting processes; undertaking regular CIDP 
implementation progress and performance reviews; 
and promoting public participation in preparation 
and implementation of government development 
programmes and projects.
19. In addition to CIDP , every county must 
develop an ADP and an annual fiscal strategy 
paper. The CIDP and ADP should integrate the 
projects and services of devolved and un-devolved 
functions, as well as the projects and services of 
Constituency Development Fund (CDF), other non-
devolved funds and non-government organizations 
undertaking public investment programmes within 
the county with clear monitoring and evaluation 
framework.
1.4 Current Status of M&E Systems in 
the Country
20. The Monitoring and Evaluation Department 
(MED) in The National Treasury and Planning 
(TNTP), is responsible for coordinating all 
government monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
activities. To do so effectively, MED has developed 
the National Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation 
System (NIMES)and has also developed mechanisms 
and capacity for working with the various entities 
involved with data collection and analysis.
21. MED provides leadership and coordination 
of the NIMES to ensure constant flow of 
information for planning and budgeting.  The 
NIMES has been improved over the years through 
capacity building and broad consultations to 
incorporate lessons learnt and make it more 
responsive to stakeholder needs.
22. NIMES is used as a mechanism for tracking 
implementation progress of the Kenya Vision 
2030 through the MTPs and CIDPs. NIMES provides 
information that is used to prepare Annual Progress 
Report (APR) and PERs on implementation of 
MTPs and facilitates undertaking of evaluations. It 
provides important evidence and feedback to policy 
makers and the public on the national governmentâs 
performance progress towards achieving various 
economic and social developmental policies and 
programmes set out in the MTP .
23. MED has faced several challenges during 
the implementation of NIMES. The following are 
the challenges that NIMES has faced; inadequate 
capacity both at the national and county levels 
in terms of technical capacity and resources, 
existence of uncoordinated M&E systems, lack of 
M&E culture, lack of M&E standards. Others include 
misunderstanding of the role of M&E where it 
is perceived as an âauditâ function, lack of legal 
backing leading to non-adherence to reporting 
requirements, and quality data gaps leading to poor 
quality reports.
24. At county level, the governments are 
beginning to set up units/departments 
responsible for developing crucial systems 
needed for M&E, performance management, 
and statistical data collection. At this initial stage, 
the counties face a number of challenges relating 
to the development and use of M&E systems. The 
challenges faced by NIMES are replicated in CIMES. 
The draft M&E Policy and M&E Framework, which 
are crucial to formalization of the M&E structures 
that are being established, have been finalized 
awaiting cabinet approval. M&E units are not yet 
operational in most counties, and where they exist, 
they may not have the required skills and capacity. 
In counties that have established M&E units, their 
M&E reports are not well coordinated resulting in 
the use of different M&E definitions and concepts.

1.5 Objective and Purpose of the 
Guidelines
25. The main objective of these Guidelines 
is to provide basic principles for designing an 
effective CIMES that is essential for guiding 
the monitoring and evaluation function in the 
county. The guidelines will: (i) Provide the ten steps 
principle of designing an M&E system; (ii) assist in 
establishing county M&E structures; (iii) outline the 
flow of information and knowledge management; 
(iv) assigns roles and responsibilities of the 
different stakeholders in CIMES implementation; 
(v) standardize reporting through prescribed 
templates; and (v) clarify linkages between 
constitutional, policies and legal frameworks and 
M&E. The Guidelines also provide stakeholders 
and participants involved in preparation and 
use of county M&E system with practical steps to 
operationalize the M&E function.
26. The Guidelines have been prepared through 
extensive collaboration and consultations with 
all key stakeholders, including representatives 
of the national and county governments, and 
development partners. The preparation has 
taken into account the relevant sections of the 
Constitution of Kenya 2010, the draft National M&E 
Policy, laws and regulations relevant to governance, 
accountability and international best practice.
1.6	 Justification	of	CIMES	Guidelines
27. To ensure the availability of timely and 
reliable information for policy decision making 
on projects and programmes being implemented 
at the county level, both levels of government 
should collaborate in the development of an 
integrated M&E system. This will be used to 
track implementation progress of projects and 
programmes outlined in the MTP and CIDP and 
other projects and programmes financed by 
devolved funds, development partners and CSOs. 
These M&E systems usually include important 
social and economic indicators as well as targets 
used to monitor progress of implementation of 
the CIDP . 
28. At the county level, tracking progress 
towards the achievement of the policies, projects 
and programmes outlined in each CIDP will be 
undertaken through the CIMES. Analysis of CIMES 
results will demonstrate whether the resources spent 
on implementing CIDP projects and programmes 
are leading to the intended outcomes, impacts 
and benefits for the county population. The CIMES 
will also provide essential feedback to the county 
budgetary allocation and execution processes, there 
by ensuring that future county budget preparation 
and execution processes are tailored towards 
maximizing their impact on achieving CIDP targets.
29. A CIMES will serve as a vehicle for building 
partnerships within county governments, and 
between national and county governments, the 
private sector, civil society and development 
partners. T he system will improve stakeholder 
communication and help in building agreement 
on desirable poverty reduction outcomes and 
strategies. Like the CIDP , which is prepared through a 
consultative process, the development of the CIMES 
should involve all key stakeholders in the county .
1.7 Data Sources for CIMES
30. Some of the data to be used as inputs in 
CIMES targets and indicators are expected to 
come from surveys and administrative data,  
collected and analysed by the county statistics 
office and other county departments, KNBS, national 
government ministries and agencies located within 
every county. It is therefore, important that each 
county government establishes strong linkage with 
the National Statistical System and all statistics units 
that compile various types of data in the county. 
These statistics producers include statistics units 
located in the county planning department and 
in other relevant national government ministries 
and public agencies. The linkage will ensure that 
these institutions develop robust county statistical 
information databases that will provide a steady 
supply of reliable and timely statistics needed for 
monitoring and evaluation of the key performance 
indicators outlined in the CIDPs.

2.0 Introduction
31. This chapter outlines the legal foundation 
for the establishment and operationalization 
of the M&E function in the devolved system of 
government. The legal framework for CIDP and 
M&E of CIDP implementation is based on the 
Constitution of Kenya and its supporting legislation, 
policy and guidelines summarised below.
2.1 The Constitution of Kenya 2010
32. The Constitution of Kenya is the basis for the 
process of devolution in Kenya. To ensure greater 
transparenc y and accountability, the Constitution 
of Kenya requires that government uses the M&E 
mechanism as an integral part of developing and 
executing government policies, programmes and 
projects, and in resource allocation and management 
at the two levels of government. Monitoring 
and Evaluation is therefore, an important part of 
implementing government activities to ensure that 
transparency, integrity, access to information and 
accountability principles embraced in resource 
allocation and management at national and 
devolved levels of Government as depicted in the 
provisions of the Constitution related to planning 
under Articles 10, 56, 174, 185, 201, 203, 225, 226, 
and 227.
33. Schedule 4 of the Constitution of 
Kenya, defines the functions of each level of 
government, including ensuring and coordinating 
the participation of communities and locations 
in governance at the local level and assisting 
communities and locations to develop the 
administrative capacity for the effective exercise 
of the functions and powers and participation 
in governance at the local level. Both levels need 
to develop sustainable systems to perform these 
functions.
2.2 Legal Framework
34. The County Governments Act (2012) outlines 
the responsibilities of the devolved levels, and 
the processes and procedures governing the 
relationship between the national and county 
levels. This includes the responsibility to design 
a performance management plan and prepare a 
County Integrated Development Plan that must 
include a monitoring and evaluation section 
(Chapter on M&E in the CIDP outlines how county 
programmes and projects are monitored and 
evaluated). 
35. Section 47 requires the Executive Committee 
to design a performance management plan 
to evaluate performance of the county public 
service and the implementation of the county 
policies. The plan shall provide for among others; 
(a) Objective measurable and time-bound 
performance indicators (b) Linkage to mandates, 
(c) Annual performance reports, (d) Citizen 
participation in the evaluation of performance 
of county government, and (e) Public sharing of 
performance progress report.
36. Section 54 provides for structures of 
decentralization and establishes for every county 
a forum known as the county intergovernmental 
forum, which shall be chaired by the governor 
or in his absence, the deputy governor, or in 
the absence of both, a member of the county 
executive committee designated by the governor. 
The county intergovernmental forum comprises 
of; (a) the heads of all departments of the national 
government rendering services in the county; and 
CONSTITUTIONAL, LEGAL AND POLICY 
FRAMEWORKS FOR COUNTY M&E
CHAPTER TWO
<<<PAGE=26>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES10
(b) the county executive committee members or 
their nominees appointed by them in writing. The 
intergovernmental forum is responsible for: (a) 
harmonization of services rendered in the county; 
(b) coordination of development activities in the 
county; (c) coordination of intergovernmental 
functions; and (d) such other functions as may be 
provided for by or under any law.
37. Section 108 (1) states âThere shall be a five 
year CIDP for each county which shall have: (a) clear 
goals and objectives; (b) an implementation plan 
with clear outcomes; (c) provisions for monitoring 
and evaluation; and (d) clear reporting mechanisms.â
38. The Intergovernmental Relations Act 
(2012) in Section7 establishes the National and 
County Government Coordinating Summit. 
Section 8 details the functions of the summit, 
including the following functions related to 
M&E: (a) evaluating the performance of national 
or county governments and recommending 
appropriate action; (b) receiving progress 
reports and providing advice as appropriate; (c) 
monitoring the implementation of national and 
county development plans and recommending 
appropriate action. Others include; (d) coordinating 
and harmonising the development of county and 
national government policies; (e) consideration of 
reports from other intergovernmental forums and 
other bodies on matters affecting national interest; 
and (f ) consultation and co-operation between the 
national and county governments.
39. Section 19 of the Intergovernmental 
Relations Act established a Council of County 
Governors consisting of the Governors of the 47 
counties. Functions of this council are stipulated 
in Section 20. The council provides a forum for: 
(a) consultation among county governments; (b) 
sharing of information on the performance of 
the counties in the execution of their functions 
with the objective of learning and promoting 
best practice and where necessary initiating 
preventive or corrective action. Others are (c) 
considering matters of common interest to county 
governments; (d) facilitating capacity building for 
Governors; (e) receiving reports and monitoring 
the implementation of inter-county agreements 
on inter-county projects; (f ) considering reports 
from other intergovernmental forums on matters 
affecting national and county interests or relating 
to the performance of counties.
 
THE CONSTITUTION OF KENYA
To ensure greater transparency and accountability, the Constitution requires that 
government to use M&E mechanism as an integral part of developing and executing 
government policies, programmes and projects and in resource allocation and management 
at the two levels of government. This requirement is reï¬ected in the several sections of the 
Constitution of Kenya that relate to good governance and planning.

40. The Public Finance Management Act, 
2012 (PFMA 2012) PART IV addresses county 
government responsibilities with respect to 
management and control of public finance. 
Section 104 states that a County Treasury shall 
monitor, evaluate and oversee the management 
of public finances and economic affairs of the 
county government. The county government shall 
plan for the county and no public funds shall be 
appropriated outside of a planning framework 
developed by the county executive committee and 
approved by the county assembly. Section 125 sets 
out the stages in the county government budget 
preparation process.
41. PFMA 2012, Section 104, defines the 
responsibility to monitor, evaluate and oversee 
the management of public finances and economic 
affairs of the county government, including 
the monitoring of the county governmentâs 
entities to ensure compliance with this Act and 
effective management of their funds, efficiency 
and transparency and, in particular, proper 
accountability for the expenditure of those funds; 
and reporting regularly to the county assembly on 
the implementation of the annual county budget.
42. PFMA 2012 Section 126 (1) requires every 
county to prepare a development plan that 
identifies: (a) Strategic priorities for the medium 
term that reflect the county governmentâs 
priorities and plans; (Medium-term [5-Year] 
outcomes) (b) Programs to be delivered with 
details for each program of a) The strategic priorities 
to which the program will contribute (program 
outcomes) b) The services or goods to be provided 
(Outputs) c) Measurable indicators of performance 
where feasible, and d) The budget allocated to the 
program (Inputs).
43. Additional functions given to the County 
Treasury by the PFMA 2012 include: (a) monitoring 
the county governmentâs entities to ensure 
compliance with this Act; (b) upon request, 
providing the National Treasury with information 
which it may require to carry out its responsibilities 
under the Constitution of Kenya and this Act; and 
(c) reporting regularly to the county assembly on 
implementation of the annual county budget.
2.3 Policy Framework
44. The Kenya Vision 2030 outlines the national 
long-term objectives of the country, in particular, 
the achievement of middle-income status by 
2030. A series of 5-year Medium Term Plans (MTPs) 
translates this long-term objective into medium-
term priorities, objectives, and programmes. The 
CIDP aligns these priorities at the county level. 
The governmentâs efforts towards successful 
achievement of these priority programmes is tracked 
through key performance indicators included in the 
M&E sections of CIDPs and MTPs. The alignment 
of national priorities into the CIDP therefore fully 
integrates CIMES into the policy framework.
2.3.1 M&E Policy
45. The draft Kenya National M&E Policy of 2018 
articulates the Governmentâs commitment to 
manage for development results at all levels. The 
policy provides a clear framework for strengthening 
the coverage, quality and utility of the assessment 
of public policies, programmes and projects. It 
proposes that finances for monitoring and evaluation 
are clearly allocated within the national and county 
budget. It will enable the two levels of government, 
and other actors to access greater evidence to inform 
policy and programmatic decisions, and to hold 
the public sector accountable for its use of public 
resources. It sets the basis for a transparent process 
by which the citizenry and other development 
stakeholders can undertake a shared appraisal of 
results; and outlines the principles for a strong M&E 
system as an important instrument for driving the 
achievements of programmes underpinning the 
Kenya Vision 2030. This policy will apply to all public 
policies, strategies, programmes and projects 
managed by ministries, county governments, 
departments, parastatals and executing agencies of 
public programmes.

2.3.2 National Integrated Monitoring and 
Evaluation System (NIMES)
46. The department responsible for M&E 
at the national level (MED) is mandated to 
coordinate the implementation of NIMES as 
part of the governance reforms of the national 
government. NIMES is aimed at strengthening 
governance by; improving transparency, 
strengthening accountability relationships, and 
building a performance culture within the two 
levels of government to support better policy 
making, budget decision making and management. 
It is designed to ensure regular reporting on 
implementation progress of the countryâs priority 
policies, projects and programmes outlined in key 
policy documents such as MTPs, CIDPs, devolved 
funds programmes, the National Accountability 
Management Framework, and Performance 
Contracts and the Performance Appraisal System. 
It is also designed to report on the Governmentâs 
commitments to other international frameworks 
such as the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, 
the African Union Agenda 2063, the New Partnership 
for Africaâs Development (NEPAD), and the African 
Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). The operational 
arrangement of CIMES is a replica of NIMES.
2.3.3 M&E Framework
47. The National M&E Framework builds 
on the M&E policy and brings further detail, 
clarity and direction to the NIMES system. The 
framework captures institutional arrangements and 
responsibilities put in place to implement and co-
ordinate M&E at both national and county levels, 
particularly the mechanisms to co-ordinate and link 
national and county level M&E systems. The M&E 
system and the requirement to report on progress 
encompass all levels of government, including 
national government, counties, the judiciary, 
constitutional commissions and independent 
offices. The independent entities report directly to 
parliament, which represents the people of Kenya. 
To receive a holistic vie w of developments in the 
country, the department responsible for M&E at 
the national level and the line ministries will 
compile the different reports to reflect the national 
governmentâs performance and progress towards 
Vision 2030 and within it the MTPs.
2.3.4 Electronic National Integrated Monitoring 
and Evaluation System (eNIMES)
48. The Electronic National Integrated 
Monitoring and Evaluation System (eNIMES) 
will serve as a platform for data collection,  
analysis, publication and dissemination, building 
on aggregate M&E data collected automatically 
through interfaces with the various management 
information systems that are being established 
at line ministries as well as The National Treasury 
and Planning. This platform will improve access, 
timeliness and publication of national data, 
and will also serve as a useful data- base for 
research and analysis in the country. In addition, 
the dissemination and utilisation of data and 
a communications strategy for M&E data and 
analyses are included in the system. The eNIMES has 
a component to support eCIMES operationalization 
that will enhance county reporting. 
2.3.5 Public Investment Management
49. The Public Investment Management 
Guidelines were developed to streamline 
the use of government resources on projects 
at the national and county governmentsÂ  as 
part of the Public Finance Management 
reforms. The guidelines identify the need for 
monitoring, evaluation and reporting of budget 
implementation to ensure delivery of the projects 
in accordance with the planned specifications. 
The Department of Planning at the County level is 
vested with the responsibilities of: Providing quality 
assurance on monitoring and evaluation; data 
uploaded in the Public Investment Management 
Information System; preparing quarterly and annual 
consolidated project monitoring reports and 
submitting them to County Executive Committee 
Member responsible for Finance to inform policy

Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
13
and decision making and  provide adequate and 
skilled staff for units responsible for Project Planning 
and Monitoring in county governments. In addition, 
the accounting officer will prepare quarterly reports 
for the county government entities. In preparing 
a quarterly report for a county government entity, 
the accounting officer shall ensure that the report 
contains information on the financial and non-
financial performance of the entity.
2.3.6 County Performance Management 
Framework
50. To ensure the accountability of individual 
civil servants involved in the provision of public 
service delivery in the county, a CIMES should be 
linked to the County Performance Management 
System (PMS) as well as performance Based 
Budgeting Process (PBB). PMS involves strategic 
planning, work planning, target setting, tracking 
performance and reporting on individual public 
service providers. CIMES will support PBB through 
provision of vital performance information, which 
will be used systematically to improve efficiency 
and effectiveness of county expenditure by linking 
the funding to the results delivered.
51. Under Section 47 of the County Government 
Act, the County Executive Committee is expected 
to design a performance management system, 
which will evaluate performance of the county 
public service in relation to the implementation of 
county policies, projects and programmes. 
52. Every Governor shall submit the annual 
performance reports of the County Executive 
Committee and Public Service Board to the 
County Assembly for consideration. Since the 
County PMS is expected to report on annual 
work plans for public service providers within 
every county, the system will provide a suitable 
vehicle through which governors and county 
commissioners will prepare combined reports for 
presentation to the Cabinet, Intergovernmental 
Forum, the Council of Governors (CoG), the National 
and County Government Coordinating Summit and 
Parliament. The Performance Management System 
and M&E reports shall be made public. M&E enables 
local accountability, local corrective action and 
local learning, resulting in the fast-tracking of local 
development and results.
53. CIMES provides an integrated structure and 
process for counties to engage stakeholders, 
plan, govern, manage and operate independently 
and yet in synch with one another. Counties 
can operationalise CIMES by adopting these M&E 
guidelines and connect electronically through 
dissemination with the COG, other counties and 
with the national government.
54. The COG has developed a county 
performance management framework (2016) 
aimed at enhancing a common approach to 
public service delivery as opposed to fragmented 
approaches. The county performance management 
framework gives credence to Section 8 (f ); (h) & (j) 
of the Intergovernmental Relations Act, 2012 which 
mandates the Summit to; âevaluate the performance 
of the national or county governments and 
recommend appropriate actionâ . In this respect, a key 
agenda for the Summit will be an assessment of the 
milestones achieved in the implementation of the 
Performance Management Framework for County 
Governments. The framework supports inclusion 
of the CIDPs, ADPs, Performance Contracting, 
Staff Performance Appraisals, Public Participation 
and County Spatial Planning with Monitoring and 
evaluation as an integral part.
2.3.7 The National Capacity Building 
Framework
55. These County Integrated Monitoring and 
Evaluation System (CIMES) Guidelines were 
developed as part of the Government of Kenyaâs 
(GoK), National Capacity Building Framework 
(NCBF). The NCBF provides a mechanism for 
facilitating and coordinating capacity building 
initiatives and provides a basis for monitoring and 
evaluating capacity development for devolution.
Constitutional, Legal and Policy Frameworks for County M&E
<<<PAGE=30>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
14
56. Through the NCBF and GoK strategies, 
national and county governments, development 
partners and other stakeholders will align and guide 
capacity building efforts to leverage on ongoing 
capacity building initiatives as well as mobilizing 
new resources around the devolution nagenda.
57. It is through this framework that county 
staff will upgrade their skills and competencies 
to perform their responsibilities adequately to 
enhance service delivery, build structures and 
systems to promote and ensure sustainable social 
economic development and enhance capacities 
of management of financial and human resources, 
county institutions, community and stakeholdersâ  
participation.
2.3.8 Public Finance Management Regulations
58. The Public Finance Management (National 
Government Affirmative Action Fund) 
Regulations, 2016 section 16. (1) Establishes 
a committee to be known as the National 
Government Affirmative Action Fund Committee for 
every county. Kenya Subsidiary Legislation (2015) 
Section 145 (2) The County Committee shallâ 
(a) ensure that the projects funded under these 
Regulations comply with the objects and purposes 
set out in these Regulations; (b) ensure compliance 
with guidelines on the disbursement of funds for 
projects approved under these Regulations; (c) 
oversee the implementation of projects financed 
through the Fund; (d) oversee the monitoring and 
evaluation of projects and programmes being 
undertaken at the county and funded under these 
Regulations; (e) identify, through a participatory 
process, projects to be funded; (f ) receive proposals 
generated through a participatory process, review 
them and recommend them for approval by Board 
for funding; (g) prepare quarterly and yearly reports 
on the operations of the Fund; (h) sensitize the 
community on the objects and purpose of the 
Fund; (i) ensure projects recommended for funding 
are guided by the national development priorities 
and are not duplicative; and (j) perform any other 
function required under these Regulations or any 
other written law.
2.4 Link between NIMES and CIMES
59. NIMES supports the implementation of 
Vision 2030 and other development efforts in 
the public sector at the national government 
level. The institutional arrangements for 
implementing NIMES at both sector and national 
levels have been designed to facilitate the active 
participation of stakeholders to ensure that policy 
recommendations are relevant and actually 
contribute to policy formulation and efficient 
resource allocation and use.
60. Through the above arrangement, NIMES 
has had appreciable influence on the national 
budgeting process. M&E information drawn from 
line ministries and public agencies is synthesized 
into the Public Expenditure Review that is now 
an important input in achieving better value for 
public investment projects/programmes. These 
improvements are realised through extensive 
budget deliberations in which Sector Working 
Groups and line ministries review proposals, 
consider trade-offs and bid for budget allocations.
61. As mentioned earlier, the process of 
implementing M&E for public projects and 
programmes at national and county levels is 
not yet integrated. The linkages are weak and 
there is a lack of harmonisation among various 
M&E systems within each county. This has led to 
inadequate harmonisation of the multiple data 
collection and reporting systems at county level. 
In addition, there has been little or no stakeholder 
participation in the M&E preparation and reporting 
process in most counties. 
62. CIMES tracks implementation of the Vision 
2030 and other county development priorities 
through the CIDP and seeks to provide solutions to 
the M&E challenges currently being experienced 
by policy and decision makers at the county level.

The CIDP paints the development vision of a county 
and identifies priorities and strategies required to 
achieve the countyâs development agenda. The 
10-Year spatial plan is to be aligned with the CIDPâs 
development priorities. CIMES is anchored on the 
county performance management framework and 
provides essential input into NIMES.

3.0 Introduction
63. This chapter describes general principles 
of M&E, and the ten steps consistent with global 
best practice in M&E design and implementation. 
The guidelines build upon the training that was 
provided by MED to the counties since 2013. 
The Guidelines should be read together with 
the various templates that are presented in the 
appendixes of this document. The templates have 
been developed through hands-on experience and 
consultations with relevant staff in the counties. 
They have been found to be suitable for use for data 
collection, collation, analysis and report writing. The 
templates should however be considered as work-
in-progress, and they may be modified over time to 
make them more appropriate for setting standards 
and norms for the evolving county M&E reporting 
needs. The M&E principles, the ten steps and the 
templates will be supported by M&E curriculum and 
e-learning materials offered by the Kenya School of 
Government, local universities and colleges.
3.1 County M&E Guiding Principles
64. These general principles have been adapted 
from the work of Kusek and Rist (2004), and 
modified through consultations with county 
stakeholders, to meet the specific needs of the 
counties.
65. A well-designed M&E system will ensure 
that good quality data are regularly collected 
during and after implementation of every 
project/programme defined in the CIDP . The data 
will help guide CIDP and all other county project/
programme implementation teams, and to inform 
strategic policy decisions to be taken by the 
County Executive, county commissioners and other 
management teams in the county.
66. These guiding principles provide a practical 
opportunity to ensure the CIMES follows key 
M&E principles as specified in Table 1. It should 
be noted that âmonitoringâ and âevaluationâ are 
closely interrelated. Therefore, ongoing monitoring 
processes should form an integral part of any 
evaluation. There needs to be continual crossover, 
input and mutual enhancement between the 
two. Their separation into two distinct columns 
as presented in Table 1 is intended to provide a 
checklist of the most important aspects to be 
considered in developing an effective monitoring 
and evaluation system.
3.2 Linking Monitoring and Evaluation 
with Other CIDP Phases
67. M&E is not a stand-alone activity. It is an 
integral link to other phases of the CIDP and ADP 
formulation and implementation cycles. The CIDP 
is prepared along the lines outlined in the CIDP 
Guidelines â first issued in 2013 and revised in 
September 2017. The CIDP Guidelines assist counties 
in preparing their CIDPs and will also serve as a 
reference point in county development planning 
and budgeting processes. The starting point for 
CIDP implementation is the CIDP design, which is 
built up through a process of situation analyses; 
problem identification; stakeholder identification; 
organisation analysis; strategy formulation and 
identification and selection of implementation 
options; and these are captured in the relevant 
chapters of the CIDP .

STRENGTHENING CAPACITY OF THE COUNTIES
CHAPTER THREE

68. These analyses are thereafter, summed up 
in a Results Matrix or Logical Framework Matrix 
(LFM). In this case, the CIDP Results Matrix of Template 
A8 (Appendix A8) and the Project Sheet for each CIDP 
project is captured in a Project Sheet â Template A10 
(Appendix A10). The LFM gives a time-frame which 
identifies how much time will be needed for each 
activity. It identifies when an activity can begin and 
by when it must be completed. The LFM of the CIDP 
(A8) and projects (A10) has âIndicatorsâ built into it, 
thus there is an âautomaticâ connection between 
project design and the M&E system.
69. The analysis in preparing the ADP follows 
the performance/programme based budgeting, 
which allocates budget expenditure by 
programme. For effective management and good 
governance of public funds, this programme-based 
budget should be managed through the Integrated 
Finance Management Information System (IFMIS). 
As required in the CIDP Results Matrix and captured 
in Form A8, targets, indicators and objectives are 
included in the LFM or the Results Matrix and any 
actions/activities necessary to undertake M&E 
should be included in the project plan and budget.
70. To ensure simplicity and ease of compliance, 
CIDP projects should be monitored and data 
collected at least quarterly, using the Project 
LFM form presented in Appendix  A10. M&E is a 
dynamic process and one of the characteristics of an 
effective M&E system is that it allows for changes in 
project implementation based on results, evidence 
and evaluation.
Table 1: Principles for Monitoring and Evaluation of County Development Plans
Monitoring Evaluation
(a) Ensure that monitoring is involved at all stages 
of the programme or project design and 
implementation.
(b) Involve all stakeholders in monitoring 
activities, and ensure that there are incentives 
in place for them to engage therein.
(c) Create an environment in which monitoring 
is perceived as beneficial both to individual 
performance and to organisational capacity.
(d) Use a diversity of methods, including both 
qualitative and quantitative indicators.
(e) Ensure that monitoring processes address the 
objectives, outputs of the respective projects and 
programmes.
(f ) Provide opportunities for county M&E staff to be 
trained in effective monitoring techniques.
(g) Building enough time within the programme and 
project implementation process for participants 
to engage in the consultations and discussions of 
M&E results.
(h) Ensure that good practices and lessons learnt are 
shared among all stakeholders.
(i) Involve stakeholders in ongoing revision of 
the programme in the light of insights gained 
from monitoring.
(j) Make provision for costs of monitoring activities 
in original budget
(a) Ensure that clear targets are identified at the start of 
the project/programme implementation process and 
that delivery against these targets are used as the 
main framework for evaluation.
(b) Incorporate a clear framework (such as a Results 
Matrix and Gantt chart) in the design of the project 
or programme to provide the basis for subsequent 
evaluation.
(c) Make provision for costs of evaluation in original 
budget.
(d) Ensure that all stakeholders, and particularly 
the intended beneficiaries, are consulted in the 
evaluation, and that the consultationsâ results are 
used effectively to enhance the implementation 
process of the project/ programme.
(e) Identify and report important non-intended 
consequences.
(f ) Use a diversity of methods, including both qualitative 
and quantitative indicators.
(g) Ensure that insights from the evaluation are 
disseminated externally so that others can learn from 
them.

 3.3 Ten Steps to Designing, Building, 
and Sustaining a Results-Based 
Monitoring and Evaluation System
71. This section presents ten steps that are used 
in designing, building, and sustaining a results-
based M&E system. Following these steps will 
enable the counties to develop a CIMES that will 
assist them to foster political and financial support 
for policies, programmes and projects included in 
the CIDP . The ten steps are presented in Figure 5. 
The counties are expected to demonstrate their 
preparedness and capability to understand and 
follow these ten steps in building their respective 
CIMES. A summary outlining each of these steps is 
provided below.
3.3.1 Step 1: Conduct a Readiness Assessment
72. The readiness assessment is a diagnostic aid 
that determines where a county stands in relation 
to the requirements for establishing a sustainable 
results-based M&E system. It is an analytical 
framework to assess a countyâs organisational 
capacity and political willingness to monitor and 
evaluate its development goals, and to develop a 
performance-based framework. It should include 
sensitization of the County Executive, County 
Assembly, National Government Agencies and non-
state actors at the county on the need for M&E and 
its implications. The readiness assessment is the 
foundation of the M&E system. Just as a building 
must begin with a foundation, constructing an M&E 
system must start with a readiness assessment. 
Without an understanding of the foundation, 
moving forward may be fraught with difficulties 
and ultimately, failure.
73. The Readiness Checklist of Appendix A2 
identifies challenges to carrying out M&E for a 
project, such as inadequate political will, expertise 
or experience. Use the CIDP Checklist in Appendix 
A3 and the ADP Checklist in Appendix A4 to test the 
suitability and readiness of the CIDP and the ADP for 
implementation.
74. The readiness assessment includes a 
review of a countryâs current capacity to 
monitor and evaluate along the following 
dimensions: existence of technical and managerial 
skills; existence and quality of data systems; 
available technology; available fiscal resources; 
and institutional experience; leadership, and 
management capacity to achieve the expected 
results; efficient and reliable information system to 
monitor and assess effectiveness and efficiency in 
delivering outputs to achieve desired outcomes 
and impacts for the targeted groups; sound 
budget planning, formulation and execution 
that focus on priority policies and programmes. 
Are there other organisations such as universities, 
private consultants or government agencies that 
have the capacity to provide technical assistance 
and/or training?

75. Capacity in the areas mentioned above is 
needed to develop, support, and sustain the M&E 
system. Where capacity is inadequate or lacking, 
staff needs to be trained in modern data collection, 
monitoring methods, and analysis. Technical 
assistance and training for capacity and institutional 
development may be required. The government and 
development partners are often willing to finance 
and support such activities, and share lessons from 
best practice.
76. Assess the roles and responsibilities and 
existing structures to monitor and evaluate 
development impact. In most county governments, 
different departments will be at different stages in 
their ability to monitor and evaluate. It should not 
necessarily be assumed that all departments in 
a county are moving in tandem and at the same 
pace. There will inevitably be some sequencing 
and phasing with respect to the building of M&E 
systems. The readiness assessment serves as a guide 
through the political system, and helps identify the 
ability of county government departments and 
agencies to monitor and evaluate. One should first 
focus on nurturing those elements in the county 
government that are able and willing to move faster 
in developing an effective M&E culture.
77. As already mentioned in section 1.3, some 
functions are shared between the national and 
county governments. The readiness assessment 
will identify overlaps among these concurrent 
functions, so that overall programme performance 
can be more effectively and efficiently measured 
and achieved. The readiness assessment can assist 
in brokering differences between departments and 
ministries doing the same or similar functions or 
tasks in a county.
78. County government policymakers need 
to be in communication with and work in 
partnership with agencies responsible for 
information gathering and dissemination, for 
example in areas such as the SDGs. The M&E system 
needs to be integrated into the policy arena of the 
SDGs so that it will be clear to all stakeholders why 
it is important to collect data, how the information 
will be used to inform the efforts of the county 
government and civil society to achieve the SDGs, 
and what information needs to be collected.
3.3.2 Step 2: Formulate Outcomes and Goals 
(Impacts)
79. It is important, to distinguish between 
goals (impacts) and outcomes. Goals are generally 
longer term, and from goals we move to outcomes, 
which are of an intermediate time frame (five to ten 
years). From outcomes we derive targets that are 
generally short-term, of about one to three years. 
Setting outcomes is essential in building a results-
based CIMES. Building the system is a deductive 
process in which inputs, activities and outputs are 
all derived and flow from the setting of outcomes. 
Indicators, baselines and targets (covered in 
subsequent sections below), all crucial elements 
of the performance framework, are derived from 
and based on the setting of outcomes. This activity 
must be carried out in formulating the CIDP , jointly 
with stakeholders, who work together to formulate 
goals/impacts and outcomes.
80. At the county level, certain stated county 
or sectoral goals may already exist. Also, political 
and electoral promises may well have already been 
made that specify improved county government 
performance in certain areas. In addition, there 
may be citizen polling data indicating particular 
societal concerns. County Assembly actions and 
legislation are other areas that should be examined 
in determining desired county goals. There may also 
be a set of goals for a given project or programme, or 
for a particular ward of a county. From these goals, 
specific desired outcomes can be determined.
81. It is important to keep in mind that it is a 
constitutional responsibility to involve county 
citizens and other stakeholders in developing 
outcomes. The overall process of setting the 
outcomes should begin with identifying specific 
stakeholder representatives who should be 
Building a Sustainable M&E System and Strengthening Capacity of the Counties

Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
21
consulted. Who are the key parties involved around 
an issue (health, education, energy, etc.)? How are 
they categorized? For example, CSOs, government, 
development partners, whose interests and views 
are to be given priority? Use the Engagement 
Checklist in Template 5A (presented in Appendix 
A5) and the Stakeholder Participation Assessment 
Template in Appendix A6 to identify stakeholder 
representatives to be consulted. The result of 
consultations and formulation at county level is the 
County Integrated Development Plan, defining a 
set of projects outlined in Chapter 7 of the CIDP . The 
outcomes and goals of the CIDP are presented in 
the CIDP Results Matrix Template in Appendix A8.
82. After stakeholder groups have been 
identified, the following factors are important in 
compiling the outcomes:
i. Identify major concerns of each stakeholder 
group. Use information gathering techniques 
such as brainstorming, focus groups, surveys, 
and interviews to determine the interests and 
priorities of each of the groups involved.
ii. Translate Problems into Statements of Possible 
Outcome Improvements. An outcome statement 
should be formulated positively rather than 
negatively. Stakeholders will respond and rally 
better to positive statements, for example: 
âWe want improved health for infants and 
children,â rather than âWe want fewer infants 
and children to become ill.â Positive statements 
to which stakeholders can aspire carry more 
legitimacy. It is easier to build a political 
consensus by speaking positively about the 
desired outcomes of stakeholders.
iii. Outcomes should be disaggregated sufficiently 
to capture only one improvement area in each 
outcome statement. E.g. Outcome: Increase 
the percentage of employed people. To know 
whether this outcome has been achieved, the 
goal needs to be disaggregated to answer the 
following questions: For which population or 
target group? Where? How much? By when?
 This outcome can be disaggregated by 
examining increased employment in terms 
of a target group, sector, percentage change 
and timeframe. E.g. Disaggregated outcome: 
Increase employment among youth in the 
rural sector by 20 percent over the next four 
years.â
83. It is important to develop a Monitoring and 
Evaluation Plan for each project or programme.  
This is addressed in later steps, where each project 
must be monitored and reports compiled regularly. 
Timelines for M&E are clearly defined by using the 
quarterly calendar.
84. Note that, according to these guidelines, 
there is a standard M&E plan and there are 
standard responsibilities for all county projects 
and programmes. Coordination and joint reporting 
for each county department is the responsibility of 
a designated M&E officer. The coordinated reporting 
of the whole county and upwards towards the 
County Executive, CoG, national government level 
and the Senate is the responsibility of the M&E 
Unit, providing reports for approval by the County 
Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (CoMEC). 
It is essential that clear outcomes and targets be 
defined at county and national levels. Monitoring is 
essential to determine whether development and 
service delivery is on track.
85. In these guidelines, the outcomes and 
goals (impact) of every project and programme 
included in the CIDP are recorded in the CIDP 
Results Matrix Template A8 and in more detail 
in the Project Sheet (see Appendix 10A). Check 
list A3 (see Appendix A3) should be used to assess 
the quality of the process used during the CIDP 
preparation process and for related documents. 
Checklist A4 (see Appendix A4) should be used to 
assess the quality of the process used in developing 
the ADP and the related documents.

3.3.3 Step 3: Select Outcome Indicators to 
Monitor and Evaluate
86. Indicators should be developed for all levels 
of the M&E system. This means that indicators are 
needed to monitor progress with respect to inputs, 
activities, outputs, outcomes, and goals. Progress 
needs to be monitored at all levels of the system to 
provide feedback on areas of success and in areas 
where improvement may be required.
87. Although indicators are already defined 
in the CIDP , it is recommended that they are 
revisited for every CIDP project to find out if they 
meet the performance characteristics listed in the 
above table. Where possible, it is preferable to use 
the standard indicators presented in Appendix A1.
88. Performance indicators should be Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-
bound (SMART) presented in Table 2. The more 
precise and coherent the indicators, the better 
focused and useful the measurement strategies will 
be. If any one of these five criteria is not met, formal 
performance indicators will suffer.
89. Performance indicators should be as specific, 
direct, and unambiguous as possible. Indicators 
may be qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative 
indicators should be reported in terms of a specific 
number (number, mean, or median) or percentage. 
âPercentages can also be expressed in a variety of 
ways, e.g., percent that fell into a particular outcome 
category, percent that fell above or below some 
targeted value, and percent that fell into particular 
outcome intervalsâ¦â (Hatry 1999, p. 63). Outcome 
indicators are often expressed as the number or 
percent (proportion or rate) of something. Managers 
of CIDP projects and programmes should consider 
including both  forms.
90. Qualitative indicators/targets imply 
qualitative assessments. A qualitative indicator 
might measure perception, such as the level of 
empowerment, that local government officials feel, 
so they can adequately do their jobs. Qualitative 
indicators might also include a description of 
behavior, such as the level of mastery of a newly 
learned skill. Although there is a role for qualitative 
data, it is more time consuming to collect, measure, 
and distil, especially in the early stages. Furthermore, 
qualitative indicators are harder to verify because 
they often involve subjective judgments about 
circumstances at a given time. For this reason, 
qualitative indicators should be used with caution.
91. Sometimes it is difficult to measure the 
outcome indicator directly, so proxy indicators 
are needed. Indirect, or proxy, indicators should 
be used only when data for direct indicators are 
not available, when data collection will be too 
costly, or if it is not feasible to collect data at regular 
intervals. However, caution should be exercised in 
using proxy indicators, because there has to be a 
presumption that the proxy indicator is giving at 
least approximate evidence on performance.
Table 2: SMART Criteria
Specific Precise and unambiguous
Measurable Provide a sufficiently quantified basis to assess performance; or at least a perception of 
performance, on say a 5-point  scale
Achievable The indicator should be achievable both as a result of the program/project and a as 
a measure of realism
Realistic In terms of the availability to collect data with the available resources
Time-bound Specify when the result(s) can be achieved

Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES 23
92. Constructing indicators can be complex or 
difficult work. Therefore, it is especially important 
that competent technical and policy experts 
participate in the process of indicator construction. 
All perspectives need to be taken into account 
when considering indicators. The indicators should 
be substantively feasible, technically doable, and 
policy relevant.
93. Outcome indicators are important because 
they focus the attention of officials, stakeholders, 
decision makers and policy makers on essential 
results. Setting indicators to measure progress with 
inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and goals is 
important in providing necessary feedback to the 
county management. It will help CEC members, 
senior management staff and national government 
staff at the county to identify those parts of a 
county government that are not achieving results 
as planned. Where appropriate, indicators form 
Appendix A1 should be used or other indicators 
that are already collected and for which a reliable 
baseline is available from operational systems. Use 
the CIDP Results Matrix Form A8 and the Project LFM 
Form A10 to record the indicators for the overall 
CIDP and individual projects. The following are the 
characteristics of good indicators:
Â® Each outcome needs to be translated in to one 
or more indicator;
Â® Jointly identify indicators that show an outcome 
has been achieved;
Â® An outcome indicator answers the question: âHow 
will we know success when we see it?â .
Example of Indicators:
Â® Gross primary school enrolment rates;
Â® Child mortality rate.
94. Once the indicators have been selected it 
is important to write a definition for each one.  
The definition describesÂ  exactlyÂ  how the indicator is 
calculated. If indicators are not properly defined, there 
is a serious risk that indicators might be calculated 
differently at different times, which means the results 
canât be compared.
95. Here is an example of how one indicator in the 
education program is defined:
INDICATOR
Percentage of Grades 6 primary students continuing to High School
DEFINITION
Number of students who start the ï¬rst day of Grade 7 divided by the total
number of Grade 6 students in the previous year, multiplied by 1000.
SAMPLE CALCULATION:
Building a Sustainable M&E System and Strengthening Capacity of the Counties
<<<PAGE=40>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
24
96. After writing the definition of each indicator, 
it is necessary to identify how the data will be 
collected, the frequency (monthly, quarterly, 
annually, etc.), which tool will be used, where it 
will be reported, and how quality control will be 
managed. 
Itâs a good idea to put all this information 
inÂ oneÂ table for each indicator. An example for one of 
the education program indicatorsÂ is shown in Table 3.
3.3.4 Step 4:  Gather Baseline Information on 
the Current Condition
97. A performance baseline is information that 
provides data at the beginning of, or just prior to 
the monitoring period. The baseline is used to learn 
about recent levels and patterns of performance 
of the indicator; and to gauge subsequent policy, 
programme or project  performance.
98. At the most basic level, a baseline is required 
to determine whether there is a project manager, 
a budget, mobilised funds, and if the project is 
off track, on track or delivering. As captured in 
the CIDP , is the project stalled or running? It is also 
important to understand the priority placed on the 
CIDP project that is being monitored, for example 
is it a flagship project required for Vision 2030? Is 
it included in the Performance Contract of the CEC 
Member responsible for the sector, and/or the 
manifesto of the Governor?
99. The basics mentioned above will determine 
the importance and likelihood of delivery of the 
project. These basics can be captured in the CIDP 
Results Matrix form A8. Is the project mature and on-
track or not even properly formulated? The status of 
Table 3: An example on how to define an indicator
Indicator Reading proficiency among children in Grade 6
Definition Sum of all reading proficiency test scores for all students in Grade 6 divided by the total number of 
students in Grade 6.
Purpose To assess whether reading proficiency at the schools participating in the program is improving over 
time. This would provide evidence on whether the reading component of the program is effective.
Baseline Average score: 47
Target Average score: 57
Data Collection
The class teacher will conduct a reading proficiency test for all students in the class. Each student 
will be assessed individually in a separate room. The teacher will ask them to read a list of words, 
sentences and paragraphs out loud and will mark each one that they have difficulty with. Any 
students not present on the day of the assessment will be excluded.
Tool National Reading Proficiency Assessment questionnaire.
Frequency Every 6 months
Responsible Teachers
Reporting
The individual score for each student will be reported in the six monthly progress reports submitted 
by each teacher to the Program Manager. The Program Manager will then combine the data from 
each class to create full list of students and their scores. This will be used to calculate the average 
score for all students in Grade 6 using the definition above. The average score will be included in 
the report for the donor submitted every six months.
Quality Control
All teachers will attend a one day training course on how to complete the assessment. To verify the 
accuracy of the test scores submitted by the teachers the Program Manager will randomly select 
one class every six months to audit. This audit will involve re-testing all the students in the class and 
comparing the results to the results submitted by the teacher.

each CIDP project should be recorded as a part of 
the baseline using the traffic-light maturity scale of 
the Project Implementation Maturity Model, based 
on form A7. The results from all CIDP projects can be 
simply recorded in the appropriate column of the 
CIDP Results Matrix A8, and when available in the 
online in e-CIMES. Baseline indicator values should 
be recorded at CIDP level in the CIDP Results Matrix 
Form A4, and at project level in the Project LFM 
Form A10.
100. Figure 2 contains an example of baseline 
data for a policy area â primary education. It 
builds  on the performance framework mentioned 
in section 3.3.2. The challenge is to obtain adequate 
baseline information on each of the performance 
indicators for each outcome. This can quickly become 
a complex process. It is important to be judicious 
in the number of indicators chosen, because each 
indicator will need data collection, analysis and 
reporting systems behind it. The selected outcome 
is to improve childrenâs learning. So in this case 
there must be an indicator for students. Scores on 
achievement tests could be a suitable indicator that 
meets the âSMARTâ test.
101. The next challenge is to obtain adequate 
baseline information on each of the performance 
indicators for each outcome presented in Table 
4. The following key questions should be asked in 
building baseline information for every indicator: 
What are the sources of data? What are the data 
collection methods? Who will collect the data? 
How often will the data be collected? What is the 
cost and difficulty of collecting the data? Who will 
analyse the data? Who will report the data? Who will 
use the data? These questions need to be answered 
for each of the identified indicators. Table 5 presents 
a framework that can be used to complete the 
required information for each of the indicators.

3.3.5 Step 5: Set Targets and Timelines
102. At the beginning of every financial year, 
every project manager, who is responsible 
for implementation of each CIDP project or 
programme, develops an individual work plan 
and signs a performance appraisal report with 
his/her supervisor, (i.e. the Director of the county 
Department in which the project/programme is 
located), based on agreed project/programme 
performance indicators and targets outlined in the 
CIDP Results Matrix Template A8. The individual 
work plans are derived from the departmental work 
plans and the officerâs job description. The work 
plan briefly describes the M&E performance targets 
or expected results from specific tasks and activities 
for which the project manager is responsible 
during that fiscal year. The M&E performance 
indicators and targets for each project manager 
are then collated by the M&E Officer responsible 
for each departmental work plan, which includes 
among others, departmental priority projects and 
programmes that are outlined in the CIDP .
103. Directors of Departments will thereafter 
discuss the work plan and performance targets 
with individual project managers, and ensure that 
the objectives and performance targets of the 
department are understood. The expected results 
may include tracking progress on agreed activities 
of CIDP projects/programmes during the period of 
assessment. For each activity to be assessed properly 
there must be clear and measurable indicators of 
success. A chart showing the County Governments 
Administrative Structure, based on administrative 
staff, is presented in Appendix A13.
104. The time-frame component identifies how 
much time will be needed for each activity. It 
identifies when the activity can begin and when 
it must end. Targets indicate the levels of desired 
output, outcome or impact for a defined period or at 
a defined milestone. Targets are important because 
they define a level against which success can be 
measured. Besides the CIDP and Departmental 
work plans, each CEC Member signs a Performance 
Contract (PC) with the Governor.
105. In Section D of the PC, the operational 
output objectives of the PC are defined. These 
outputs should align to the outputs of the county 
department or sector work plan and to the ADP 
projects of the county department for the current 
year. The relationship between CIDP projects and 
PC Section D can be indicated in the County Results 
Matrix Form A8. Guidance on setting targets for 
recording in the CIDP Results Matrix A8 is provided 
in Appendix A12.
106. After gathering baseline data on indicators, 
the next step is to establish results targetsâwhat 
can be achieved in a specific time toward reaching 
the identified outcome. Several important factors 
should be considered when selecting performance 
indicator targets. One factor is the importance of 
taking baselines seriously. There must be a clear 
understanding of the baseline starting point. 
Another consideration is the expected funding and 
resource levels expected to be availed throughout 
the target period. A third factor is political concerns. 
For example, what has the Governor promised to 
deliver in his or her election manifesto?
107. Note that setting realistic targets involves 
the recognition that most desired outcomes 
are not quickly achieved. Thus there is a need to 
establish targets as short-term objectives on the 
path to achieving an outcome. The tendency is to 
set interim targets over shorter periods of time when 
inputs can be better known or estimated. âBetween 
the baseline and the targeted outcome, there 
may be several milestones (interim targets) that 
correspond to expected performance at periodic 
intervalsâ11 (UNDP 2002, p. 66). In the case of CIMES, 
quarterly indicator targets should be entered into 
the Form A8 for the CIDP as a whole, and in Form 
A10 for each individual project or programme.
Building a Sustainable M&E System and Strengthening Capacity of the Counties
<<<PAGE=43>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES

108. The completed matrix of outcomes, 
indicators, baselines, and targets becomes the 
performance framework. It defines outcomes and 
plans for the design of a results-based M&E system 
that will, in turn, begin to provide information on 
whether interim targets are being achieved on the 
way to the longer-term outcome. Table 6 illustrates 
the completed performance framework for a county 
education development policy area. The formula 
for arriving at the target performance, involves 
setting baseline indicator levels and desired levels 
of improvement over a specified period of time. The 
desired improvement levels needed to realise the set 
targets should be arrived at through a participatory 
and collaborative process with relevant stakeholders 
and any development partners.
3.3.6 Step 6: Regularly Collect Data to Assess 
Whether the Targets are Met
109. Monitoring tests whether the targets set are 
achieved in reality. Since targets are set quarterly, 
indicator data should be collected quarterly or as 
designated in the CIDP Results Matrix Form A8 or 
the Project LFM Form 10. Data to monitor CIDP , 
CDF or devolved funds may be collected quarterly, 
monthly, biannually or annually as appropriate. 
There is a pre-existing responsibility and process 
in the counties which is to report the PC results of 
each CEC member and their respective ministry 
quarterly by the 14th of the month following each 
quarter. The data collection process for PC results 
is already required, and the results are already 
assessed against targets.
110. The monitoring system strategy being 
designed should include a clear data collection 
and analysis plan, detailing the following: units 
of analysis (for example, school district, community, 
hospital, village, region); sampling procedures; 
data collection instruments to be used: frequency 
of data collection; expected methods of data 
analysis and interpretation; those responsible for 
collecting the data; data collection partners, if 
any; those responsible for analysing, interpreting 
and reporting data; for whom the information is 
needed; dissemination procedures; and follow-
up on findings. The system should provide an 
integrated platform for generating and sharing M&E 
data without duplication.
111. Timeliness consists of three elements: 
frequency (how often data are collected); 
current (how recently data have been collected); 
and accessibility (data availability to support 
management decisions). If the data are not 
available to county decision makers when they

need it, the information becomes mere historical 
data. County management teams require accurate 
and timely information. Real-time, continuous data 
that decision-makers can use to lead and manage 
in their work environment is essential. It makes little 
sense to manage county governments using data 
that may be three or more years old.
112. The data are collected by the project 
managers responsible for each project of the CIDP , 
and reported in the CIDP Results Matrix Form A8.  
These data is then collated and approved by the 
Director of the department in which the project 
is located and forwards the report to the M&E 
Directorate. The directorate thereafter compiles a 
County M&E report that  is passed to the CoMEC for 
approval and onward submission to the CPMS Unit 
and the relevant M&E committees.
113. The intent of both the project manager 
reporting and evaluation, followed by the 
directorâs approval, is to verify results and record 
lessons learned, and this goes into the subsequent 
decision-making process. It is the responsibility 
of the project manager to record lessons learned; 
for the M&E Officer to collate learning per county 
department; and of the County M&E unit to 
consolidate and disseminate learnings for the 
county. An evaluation can also be undertaken to 
confirm the viability of the design before a project 
or programme is implemented.
3.3.7 Step 7: Mid-Term and End Term/ Terminal 
Evaluations
114. An evaluation is needed after full 
implementation of one phase of a project and 
before commencement of other phases. These 
guidelines, which focus on implementation of the 
ADP projects, require that quarterly and six monthly 
data is collected, analysed and reported, supported 
by evidence and related evaluation results. These 
results can be used in formulation of County Annual 
M&E Progress Report (CAMER) and County Annual 
Public Expenditure Report (CAPER), as well as in 
formulation of the quarterly County M&E Report. 
Reporting on Sub-counties, wards and villages 
is not expected at this time, although it could be 
considered in future as the countyâs capacity grows.
115. For a small number (say 3) of priority policies, 
programmes and projects per county, a full-scale 
evaluation should be undertaken midway and 
at the end of the project. These reports should 
be linked to the quarterly reporting of each 
department PC, which is already being reported 
on at county level.
116. Another stage at which it is common to 
recognise the M&E role is in mid-term evaluations. 
In this case, M&E reports compiled at the half-year of 
each ADP project using the Project Sheet (Appendix 
10) are used to produce mid-term review reports. 
In respect of county performance as a whole, the 
CAMER and CAPER are produced, based on any 
sub-county disaggregated reporting and according 
to the countyâs annual calendar, as indicated in 
Appendix A14. This timing is necessary and should 
be strictly followed to facilitate timely input to the 
national APR as per the calendar specified in the 
National M&E Framework.
3.3.8 Step 8: Analyse and Report the Results
117. In these guidelines, the standardized 
approach for analyzing and reporting Annual 
Development Plan results is a quarterly 
process, linked to implementation of projects/
programmes outlined in CIDP .  This is the 
responsibility of PDOs, and of the M&E Officer 
responsible for the relevant department. Validated 
reports are immediately availed to the County M&E 
Officer (i.e. the head of the County M&E Unit) for 
line-by-line validation, before consolidating them 
with other county reporting information systems 
and preparing the M&E report that is forwarded 
to CoMEC for formal approval and onward 
dissemination to key stakeholder groups.
Building a Sustainable M&E System and Strengthening Capacity of the Counties
<<<PAGE=45>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
29
118. Quarterly and annual reports for each 
county department and for the whole county are 
important because they:
â¢ Give information on the status of projects, 
programmes, and policies
â¢ Provide clues to problems
â¢ Create opportunities to consider 
improvements in the project, programme 
and policy implementation strategies
â¢ Provide important information over time on 
trends and directions
â¢ Help confirm or challenge the theory of 
change or project design
119. Reports are prepared in the agreed format 
of Form A8 (Appendix A8) for all CIDP projects 
and for individual projects. Further aggregated 
reports may be developed. It is recommended that 
the standardised forms presented as appendices 
to these guidelines be used by every county to 
facilitate further analysis and comparison within and 
between counties. The use of these standardised 
forms will also make it easy for each county to 
compile and submit reports that are required for 
the compilation of CAMER for the county and the 
APRs for the national government.
120. County Annual Progress Reports and Public 
Expenditure Reports (CAMER): The contents of the 
CAMER can be summar ised, based on the contents 
of appropriate Project Results Matrix Forms A8, 
and this can further be used alongside budget 
information to inform the CAPER. Later, as local 
capacity is built, these reports could be generated 
at disaggregated levels within the sub-counties, 
wards and villages. Preparation of detailed progress 
reports for the sub-counties and below is not 
included in these guidelines.
121. The Form A 11 can be used an aggregated 
result for the county (CoMER), for a sector 
(SMER), a sub-county (SCoMER), a ward (WaMER) 
and village (ViMER) sector or for the county. In 
practice, these disaggregated reports should only 
be considered when there is robust capacity and 
timely, dependable M&E and economic reporting at 
county level. The Appendix A14 will be added and 
updated from time to time to provide simple M&E 
Report (MER) Forms and Appendix A14 will similarly 
provide simple Economic Progress Report Forms 
with versions for sub-county levels as and when 
required.
3.3.9 Step 9: Using the Results Findings
122. Information gathered through M&E 
progress reports is useful to a number of 
different audiences. Results findings are used 
to manage for development results, driving 
service delivery; to disseminate lessons learnt and 
develop good practice; to inform the county inter-
governmental forum, county assemblies, CoG and 
the National and county government summit; 
to engage citizens, development partners and 
other stakeholders; and to inform constitutional 
commissions and independent offices. In this way 
the legal responsibilities of the county government 
to report and contribute to national M&E products, 
including the APRs and the national aggregation of 
M&E reports, will be fulfilled.
123. At county sector level, a quarterly review of 
results at sector department should be chaired 
by the CEC Member responsible for the sector in 
the county, with the Chief Officer as Secretary, 
to determine the level of ADP and work plan 
progress for the department, and to define 
preventive and corrective actions as required. The 
content of this report usually focuses on outputs 
and expenditure (not outcomes) and is prepared 
by the M&E Officer for the Department; however, its 
content and presentation is the responsibility of the 
Director responsible for the Department.
124. The quarterly sectoral review meetings 
mentioned above are followed by a quarterly 
review of aggregate results, broken-down by 
county departments, to determine the level of 
Building a Sustainable M&E System and Strengthening Capacity of the Counties
<<<PAGE=46>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
30
progress made in the entire county and to define 
preventive and corrective actions as required.  
This quarterly review meeting is chaired by the 
Governor, with the County Secretary as secretary. 
The preparation of reports at county level is the 
responsibility of the M&E Directorate, and the 
formal approval is the responsibility of the CoMEC. 
The CoMEC will review the findings of the county 
APR, and recommendations to be taken to address 
issues highlighted in the report.
125. Based on the review of aggregated progress 
reports at sector level, weekly or monthly 
corrective actions should be defined and 
delegated at sector level. These sector reports 
are prepared by M&E Officers for each Department 
and submitted to the county M&E Directorate for 
validation, aggregation and production of reports, 
which are forwarded to the CoMEC. Monthly or 
quarterly performance reviews are recommended at 
the county level, prepared by the M&E Directorate, 
and submitted to CoMEC. 
3.3.10 Step 10: Sustaining the M&E System
126. M&E should become a culture, a standard 
process and a habit of the county. This is 
supported by the simple quarterly rhythm of data 
collection, periodical evaluation and action-taking, 
as defined in these guidelines. Further, the sharing 
of M&E results with the County Executive, County 
Assembly, National Government agencies, non-
state actors at the county and the citizenry, helps 
to sustain demand for better development results. 
Quarterly reviews by the County Executive ensure 
that everyone in the county knows that M&E and 
accountability for results is a permanent feature of 
the county culture.
127. The PC process is now a standard feature 
of the Kenyan public service,  hence it is further 
advisable to maintain and strengthen the 
linkage of key M&E results achieved against the 
commitments made in Schedule D of the PC, in 
particular commitments that relate to the CIDP 
implementation targets and indicators of each CEC 
Member.
128. Sustained use of M&E is better ensured 
through the clear roles and responsibilities and 
institutional arrangements as set out in chapter 
4 of these Guidelines. Further process, habits, roles 
and responsibilities all combine to strengthen the 
ongoing readiness of the county for M&E.
129. A draft County Performance Management 
System Handbook (PMS Handbook) is being 
prepared to further assist in sustaining M&E as 
a part of the County Performance Management 
Cycle. The Handbook will provide further detail of 
roles, responsibilities, job descriptions and meeting 
agendas that may be used to operationalise and 
embed M&E within the county.
130. To ensure the sustainability of county M&E, 
be aware of the following critical components of 
demand:
â¢ Political Leadership â from the Governorâs 
Office and from the County Assembly.
â¢ Adequate Budgetâ budget is set aside for 
both the projects to be monitored and for the 
M&E process itself.
â¢ Clear Roles and Responsibilities â Establish 
formal and clear organisational lines of 
authority for collecting, analysing and 
reporting performance information.
â¢ Use of Trustworthy and Credible Information 
â information produced by the M&E 
system should be transparent and subject to 
independent verification.
â¢ Accountability and Transparency â the 
media, the private sector and others all have 
access to the M&E reports, and problems are 
acknowledged and addressed.
â¢ Regular Review Meetings â results and action 
focused meetings are regularly conducted to 
ensure that accountable officers are delivering 
the results expected.

31
â¢ Capacity building â sound technical skills in 
data collection and analysis are built; and also 
managerial skills in strategic goal setting and 
organizational development.
â¢ Incentivesâ success is acknowledged and 
rewarded; lessons learnt are applied to 
influence design of future projects.
â¢ Relevance â M&E reports service the needs 
of county senior management staff, including 
the Governor, CEC members and the County 
Commissioner.

4.0 Introduction
131. This chapter provides guidelines for M&E 
institutional arrangements in a county. The 
proposed institutional structures will strengthen 
coordination of the County M&E system. The 
institutions will encompass both levels of 
government, non-state actors (development 
partners working in the county, private sector 
and civil society organizations) and the citizens. 
The structure will comprise of County Assembly 
Committee responsible for Planning, CoMEC, 
Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), Sub-County 
Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (SCoMEC), 
Ward Monitoring and Evaluation Committee 
(WMEC), Sector Monitoring and Evaluation 
Committee (SMEC) and the village council. Existing 
legal structures, such as the county assembly, 
County Intergovernmental Forum and the County 
Participation Forum will form part of the CIMES 
structure. The County M&E Directorate will be 
established to coordinate CIMES.
132. The guidelines propose to establish a service 
delivery unit to be domiciled in the governorâs 
office. This unit will be responsible for monitoring 
implementation of the governorâs priority 
programmes and projects. It will also assist the 
Governorâs office with the day-to-day monitoring 
activities relating to prioritized operations in the 
county government. Its roles and responsibilities 
are highlighted in Table6. The SDU will support 
CIMES by ensuring smooth implementation of CIDP 
through uninterrupted service delivery. 
133. The institutional setting for CIMES will 
produce evidence to inform county public 
service performance management that include;  
strategic planning, work planning, target setting, 
tracking performance through the M&E system 
and reporting. The Guidelines therefore, provide a 
description of the organizational structure at the 
county level.
4.1 M&E structure at County Level
4.2.1 CIMES Committees
134. The county will establish the M&E structure, 
which will constitute the County Assembly 
Committee responsible for Planning, County M&E 
Committee, M&E Technical Oversight Committee 
and Sector M&E Committees. The M&E Directorate 
will coordinate and function as the secretariat to the 
committees. The CoMEC ensures that the County 
has quality information needed to make decisions, 
and to lead and direct county M&E initiatives. To 
do this, the CoMEC provides quality assurance by 
verifying whether the M&E information given in 
the reports and the underlying data collection and 
analysis processes are of the needed quality and 
conform to the M&E requirements outlined in these 
guidelines. The CoMEC oversees overall county 
compliance and results of projects implementation 
and service delivery within the CIDP and ADP . The 
CoMEC is charged with preventing duplication 
and wastage, and providing the evidence base for 
policymaking and management.
4.1.2 Fora to support CIMES
135. There exist legal fora created by County 
Government Act 2012 and the Intergovernmental 
Relations Act 2012 that will support CIMES. 
These include the County Citizens Participation 
Forum and the County Intergovernmental Forum. 
The County Intergovernmental Forum provides 
a link between the National Government and the 
County Government at the county level. Table 7 lists 
the main committees and Fora involved in CIMES 
implementation.

4.2 Responsibilities and Functions of 
Stakeholders in the Institutional 
Framework
136. The Responsibility and functions of the 
different stakeholders with relevance for 
M&E at county level are outlined in Table 8.  
Governance, monitoring and reporting of the CIDP 
implementation progress are prescribed in section 
54 of County Government Act (2012), including 
committee structures, roles, responsibilities and 
memberships. Performance Management joins up 
all aspects of county operations and development 
within a single, integrated strategic process. The 
performance management framework connects 
activities from the M&E Results Matrix in CIDP , MTPII 
and Vision 2030, to the Performance Contracts 
of individual senior management staff members, 
and to the operation of service delivery and the 
implementation of projects and programmes in the 
county. The M&E system should generate reports 
to be shared between the project manager and 
the director of the department, who approves the 
project M&E information, the PMS Unit, and the 
governorsâ and county commissionersâ offices, which 
uses the information. To support the Performance 
Management and M&E processes of the county, the 
CIMES organogram is presented in Figure7.

5.0 Introduction
137. This chapter describes information flow and 
knowledge sharing between different players and 
stakeholders to effectively apply M&E information 
and evidence for policy formulation and decision 
making. This is done in the context of accountability, 
transparency, performance improvement, and 
learning. The chapter also emphasizes the need 
to design in collaboration with KNBS standard 
templates that can be used by all counties to collect 
data and other information used in compiling M&E 
progress reports. Further, it presents an effective 
means of publishing and disseminating M&E results 
and highlights feedback mechanism.
138. Directors of county departments are 
accountable for establishing M&E plans for their 
individual departments, and also for the M&E 
results structure, which links all programmes/
projects of the department to the expected 
outcomes. This is the basis for performance 
monitoring and reporting, to ensure adherence to 
the CIMES guidelines and the Kenya National M&E 
Policy.
139. Accountability and responsiveness are 
improved when information flows transparently 
between an organization and its stakeholders.  
Preparation of M&E and related performance 
information should happen as close to the point of 
service delivery as possible, with project managers 
held accountable for ensuring that their projects 
are suitably monitored and evaluated. This means 
that the project sheets/forms presented in the 
Appendixes to these Guidelines must be regularly 
completed and updated, and the results submitted 
to the relevant staff in the M&E Directorate. The M&E 
Evidence Base must be made accessible and visible 
within the M&E county information system. This 
could be achieved much more readily through the 
development of an online system that meets the 
selection criteria in Appendix A9.
5.1 Progress Reporting Standards and 
Responsibilities
5.1.1 Standardised M&E Reporting Mechanism 
and Templates
140. This section emphasizes the need to design 
standard reporting templates that can be used by 
all county governments to collect data and other 
information used in compiling M&E progress 
reports. M&E reporting is essential for county and 
national governments because it is used to: (a) 
determine the extent to which the CIDP and other 
county plans are on track and to make corrections 
accordingly; (b) make informed decisions regarding 
operations, management and service delivery; 
(c) ensure the most effective and efficient use 
of resources; (d) evaluate the extent to which 
the programme/project is having or has had the 
desired impact; and (e) whether new information 
has emerged that requires a strengthening and/or 
modification to the project management plan.
141. Standardized reporting template helps 
counties aggregate progress reports from their 
sectors. It also facilitates aggregation of M&E 
reports from the 47 county governments by MED. 
A simple, standardized reporting template also 
reduces the need for capacity building required 
to do the job, and enables comparison of results 
within and between counties. For this reason, all 
counties are required to report based on standard 
reporting templates that are similar and simplified 
so as to eliminate unnecessary reporting burdens 
and fatigue. This also ensures that the data collected 
conforms to the KNBS standard definitions and 
classifications.

ENGAGEMENT
CHAPTER FIVE

142. Priority should be given to production of 
high quality quarterly and annual reports at 
county level. These consolidated county reports 
should be informed by quality and timely sector 
and sub county reports. The developed simplified 
reporting template is annexed in Appendix A15. A 
summary of the reports to be produced by every 
county government is outlined in Appendix A14.
5.1.2 County M&E Reporting and the Annual 
Progress Report
143. The CIMES reports and ADPs provide 
results information that serves a variety of needs 
and users at different levels throughout the 
county. At an operational sectoral level, CIMES 
will be expected to serve as a learning tool to 
assist in programme/project improvements and 
developing sound management practices. At the 
level of an individual county department, with 
the Director responsible for good governance and 
performance of the department, CIMES represents 
key management and accountability tools for the 
Director, and provides important inputs to strategic 
reviews that may be required to make management 
decisions regarding programme/project priorities 
and possible changes.
144. At the county level, the M&E Directorate 
takes lead in the production of M&E information. 
It is useful in informing planning, budgeting and 
funding decisions about overall implementation 
performance of various projects/programmes 
outlined in the CIDP . In a legislative context, CIMES 
reports about county programmes and operations 
are submitted directly to the County Assembly 
and the Senate on a regular basis, through CIDP 
progress reporting and reviews. The aim is to 
enhance the transparency and accountability of 
county government operations with members of 
the County Assembly and county residents.
145. Counties are expected to submit annual PFM 
reports by 30
th July as per the PFM Act 2012. M&E 
play an important role in each countyâs PFM inputs. 
County M&E progress reports, also contribute to 
the national M&E report. They should be submitted 
to MED by 30
th August, according to the NIMES 
requirements. While it is the responsibility of the 
county to plan and manage internal reporting, 
taking the electronic approach of e-CIMES means 
that data gathered at each devolved level can be 
automatically aggregated from village toward to 
sub-county to county. Villages will make quarterly 
reports in a simple and practical form as per the 
templates annexed to these guidelines.
146. In order to play its role in the national APR 
reporting timetable, a county may adopt the 
following schedule:
a) Villages, (through the Village M&E Committee 
(ViMEC)) give their reports to the Wards M&E 
Committee (WaMEC) one week before the last 
day of each quarter;
b) Wards then aggregate their VIMEC results for 
one week and present their summarized report 
(through the WaMEC) to the Sub-Counties 
(and their SCoMEC) by the first day of the next 
quarter;
c) Sub-counties, through the SCoMEC, submit 
their reports to County M&E Directorate seven 
days after the quarter ends, following the 
quarter to which the report is referring;
d) County M&E Directorates thereafter compile 
the county M&E report for onward submission 
to TOC and CoMEC 30 days after the end of the 
quarter;
e) CoMEC should release the report for sharing 
and dissemination after review.
5.1.3 Computerisation of Reporting at County 
Level
147. The increasing computerisation of public 
office functions is providing county management 
teams with new opportunities to computerise the 
collection and analysis of M&E information for the 
projects and programmes included in the CIDPs. 
Most of the existing M&E information is compiled 
Reporting, Dissemination and Citizen Engagement
<<<PAGE=61>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
45
manually. Therefore, the urgent need to explore 
the possibilities of computerising the existing 
manual systems to take advantage of the potential 
uses of microcomputers for M&E operations 
within the counties made MED to develop an 
eCIMES to facilitate computerization of M&E data. 
Computerisation of the M&E information system, 
will address issues of cooperative partnership in 
M&E information activities, systems compatibility 
and sustainability. An M&E progress report required 
for the entire CIDP will be based on the Results 
Matrix of Appendices A8 and A15. Each of these 
automated progress reports should be accessible to 
all stakeholders. Continuous improvement of these 
report formats should be the responsibility of the 
M&E Directorates, working closely with MED and 
the CoG.
148. CIMES has already been computerized 
into eCIMES and therefore each county should 
automatically populate a County M&E Report 
(CoMER) template within e-CIMES. The County 
M&E Officer will edit free sections of the COMER 
e-form to complete the quarterly and APR for 
the county. Reporting for the sub-county will be 
completed by the 15
th day of the month following 
the reference month, with reporting by the county 
of the county APR completed by 31 st July. This fits in 
with the timeline of the National M&E Framework, 
which requires that counties submit their M&E 
reports to MED by 30th August for MED to prepare 
its national APR in good time.
149. For reasons given in the above paragraph, 
these M&E Guidelines recommend electronic 
capture of results into e-CIMES, which could also 
be linked to the other county PMS tools, such as 
the Performance Contract (PC) and Performance 
Appraisal Systems (PAS). At the county level, CIMES 
provides a knowledge sharing platform that is linked 
to CoG and to MED. It is at the discretion of the 
county to have ViMER and WaMER electronic data 
entered at Sub-county level because of the limited 
rights to the system. A village M&E report may be as 
simple as monitoring the key development priorities 
and issues of the village. If these templates are 
filled at Ward level for villages, the respective ward 
administrator will engage citizens in contributing to 
and approving the information at Ward level to help 
to drive forward the priority projects/programmes 
of each village in the Ward.
5.1.4 Other Reporting at County Level
150. Progress reporting within the county 
enables the county management team and 
stakeholders to track CIDP implementation 
progress. The respective departments, the county 
Intergovernmental Forum, and CoMEC should 
review these progress reports as a basis for 
decision making and for agreeing on action plans 
for development. To facilitate a smooth decision 
making process, all agendas of relevant county 
meetings should include a review of indicators 
and sector progress reports as a standing item, 
with full reporting documents sent in advance to 
the participants. Where possible, progress reports 
should be available in an electronic format, and 
should combine data and associated narrative 
commentary and evidence.
151. In general, progress reports should be 
designed and structured in a way that minimizes 
the time required to understand the report and 
decide on the preventive or corrective measures 
to be undertaken. The county should automate the 
production of reports in a way that once data are 
entered, they can be viewed selectively by those 
who have access rights and can automatically be 
populated in all other required formats. Within a 
year, this approach will deliver significant efficiency 
savings for the county.
152. It is recommended that all progress reports, 
including interim reports, are made available 
to all government departments including 
constitutional Commissions and Independent 
offices to build trust and receive feedback from 
them early in the budget cycle. In every county, 
Reporting, Dissemination and Citizen Engagement
<<<PAGE=62>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
46
it is the county M&E directorateâs responsibility, 
working closely with existing CIMES structures 
to produce reports. As emphasized in chapter 3 
of these Guidelines, the M&E reports should be 
prepared in consultation with the key producers 
and users of the reported information. Data comes 
from aggregated data in the form of Appendix A12 
(or similar formats) produced by the respective 
Directors of departments in the devolved functions, 
or persons of equivalent rank managing devolved 
funds and other related agencies.
5.1.5 Integrating National and County 
Government Progress Reporting 
Arrangements
153. Sharing the M&E information between 
county and national governments has the 
following overarching objectives:
i) Promote accountability for the achievement 
of Kenyaâs overall economic development 
objectives, through the assessment of results, 
effectiveness processes and performance 
of the development activities of both levels 
of government. Each countyâs development 
result needs to be monitored and evaluated 
for its contribution to the whole countryâs 
development. The contribution of each county 
to the overall countryâs development will 
be visible only if each county submit their 
CIMES results/ reports to NIMES. Through this 
process, MED is able to compile and produce 
aggregated report for the performance of 
counties and  national government;
ii) Promote learning, feedback and knowledge-
sharing among counties and between county 
governments and national government, as a 
basis for decision-making on policies, strategies, 
programme management and projects, and 
ultimately to improve performance;
iii) Strengthen monitoring and coordination of 
national government projects that cut across 
multiple counties. Monitoring and evaluation 
of such projects will require close cooperation 
and coordination of M&E reports from several 
counties. These M&E reports will be gathered 
together and aggregated by MED. Thus the 
implementation of such projects reinforces the 
need for sharing M&E objectives and targets, 
so that county M&E plans are synchronized 
with the national government plan for the 
project, and also to ensure that methods for 
collecting, analyzing and reporting data in the 
participating counties are compatible.
154. Sector progress reports, (e.g. the Health 
Management Information System (HMIS) and 
National Education
 Management Information 
System (NEMIS)), from the staff performing 
national government functions within the counties, 
are routinely made to the headquarters of the 
respective national ministries and agencies, or 
into their information systems. It is recommended 
that all such flows of data on M&E indicators be 
standardised and made available to MED and the 
respective county M&E Directorates, based on the 
principle of data sharing as well as to reduce the 
data collection burden among government organs. 
The Guidelines proposes that county indicator 
values should be captured into a single database.
155. Data capture and analysis should be done 
online, and be a shared service so that the data of  
all counties can be benchmarked, compared and 
accessed subject to security rights by consumers 
of that data. This means that all data is stored in 
a compatible format and is accessible as per the 
Constitution of Kenya provisions, hence providing 
benefits of comparison and economies of scale. 
Each national data user, including Independent 
Commissions and Independent offices, should be 
able to access the subset of information relating to 
their role and function. As stated in the Selection 
Criteria of Appendix A9, this should be a requirement 
of any ICT support platform for County M&E.
Reporting, Dissemination and Citizen Engagement
<<<PAGE=63>>>
5.2 Dissemination
156. There are several important reasons for 
using and disseminating county M&E results. The 
Constitution of Kenya requires that most M&E Reports 
must be available to the public, and should be shared 
with county citizens and other stakeholders. Other 
reasons for disseminating M&E results include: (i) to 
improve programme/project interventions; (ii) to 
strengthen projects/programmes institutionally; (iii) 
to advocate for additional resources; (iv) to create 
citizen awareness and ownership, and promote 
âpeople-friendlyâ policies; (v) to ensure that county 
development activities are captured in NIMES and 
CIMES; and (vi) to contribute to the county and 
national understanding of what works. This section 
explains these reasons.
5.2.1 Justification for Disseminating Progress 
Reports
157. Dissemination goals must be clearly 
understood, and returns on investment assessed 
and assured, before spending money on expensive 
mode such as advertising to spread information. 
Dissemination should strengthen democracy and 
promote good governance and accountability in 
the county:
â¢ Building the trust of citizens in the government, 
by demonstrating that the voice of the 
stakeholder has been heard and the electoral 
promises of the Governor have been met in 
reality;
â¢ Engaging stakeholders, in informed dialogue 
on county performance and providing 
evidence of what the county can and does 
provide for them;
â¢ Strengthening participation in county 
planning, budgeting and development, as 
measured by the assessments of Appendices 
A5 and A6.
158. M&E results can help stakeholders and the 
community understands what the government 
projects/ programme are doing; how well they 
are meeting their respective objectives and goals; 
and whether there are ways that progress can be 
improved. Sharing results can help ensure social, 
financial and political support and help the county 
management to establish or strengthen the network 
of individuals and organisations with similar goals of 
working with county citizens. By publicising positive 
results, one gives public recognition to stakeholders 
and volunteers who have worked hard to make the 
programme a success.
159. Disseminating M&E results can raise 
awareness of government projects/programmes 
among the general public and help build positive 
perceptions about the counties programmes. M&E 
results often shape development partnersâ decisions 
about resources in terms of what and how much 
to allocate to county programmes. Results can also 
be used to lobby for policy or legislative changes 
that relate to county governments by pointing out 
unmet needs or barriers to programme success.
160. In the results-based development approach 
adopted by the Kenya government, dissemination 
should be evidence-based and representative 
and not selective or misleading. For this reason, 
disseminated information should be linked to the 
complete evidence from which the claimed success 
or failure is drawn.
5.2.2 Demand for Greater Accountability 
through M&E
161. With increased allocation of public resources 
to county governments, public expenditure in the 
counties is expected to grow rapidly in absolute 
terms, along with the size of the economy in each 
county. The need for ensuring effectiveness of these 
growing county expenditures is already beginning 
to be felt, by stakeholders.
162.  The Constitution of Kenya has mandated 
the county assemblies to ensure prudent use of 
public resources hence their growing interest in 
monitoring and evaluation of CIDP programmes/
Reporting, Dissemination and Citizen Engagement
<<<PAGE=64>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
48
projects, as well as in performance management. 
Thus, CoMEC reports need to be regularly submitted 
to each county assembly for debate and adoption. 
It is recommended that each county assembly 
creates a calendar that will allow county assembly 
representatives to review CoMEC reports.
5.2.3 What to Disseminate and to Which 
Recipients
163. The county M&E reports (CoMER) (APR, 
PER, PETS etc) of CIDP , are considered to be 
part of the public domainand as such should be 
disseminated through the Citizen Participation Fora 
and representatives of other groups mentioned in 
Figure 6. These reports should also be posted on 
every countyâs website.
5.2.4 Share both Successes and Challenges
164. While every programme manager wants 
to highlight positive findings, sharing results 
about what did not work is also important.  
Stakeholders need to understand what works and 
what does not work, to guide support for the most 
effective development strategies. In addition, most 
development partners and senior government 
officials appreciate programme managers who are 
willing to critically review their work; admitting what 
has not worked well will improve the credibility of 
county CIDP implementation teams; and assist 
the county to solicit funds for changes in CIDP 
implementation strategy.
5.2.5 Dissemination Platforms
165. Many possible platforms exist for presenting 
M&E results. An all-day retreat with programme 
staff may be sufficient for some audiences since 
one approach may suffice. In other cases, results 
may be disseminated via numerous platforms to 
ensure that the county key messages reach varied 
targeted audience.
166. The most commonly used formats or 
channels for disseminating M&E results are 
written reports, oral presentations, press releases, 
fact sheets and computer-based presentations:
(a) A written report combined with visual 
aids is an effective means of disseminating 
M&E results. Written reports are the most 
frequent dissemination mechanisms used to 
provide updates on progress of development 
programmes; document M&E procedures, 
findings and recommendations; maintain and 
publicise important programme information 
and experiences. Visual aids such as maps, 
tables, charts, graphs, and photographs can be 
used effectively to summarise information and 
addâlifeâ to a written report.
(b) Oral presentation provides a direct, concise 
overview of the M&E findings and allows 
for discussion. The M&E staff may give 
presentations at national meetings, in one-on-
one meetings with the management teams, 
development partners, or to county citizen 
fora.
(c) Press releases can generate media coverage 
of findings. As more people gain access to 
newspapers, radio, television and the Internet, 
media coverage of M&E findings is gaining 
importance Many programmes find that the 
most effective way to reach policymakers is to 
encourage media coverage of their M&E results.
(d) Fact sheets convey findings in a short, 
concise format. They are especially effective 
for advocacy, conveying information to 
policymakers and those who do not have the 
time to read longer reports.
167. Other channels for disseminating M&E 
Reports and information include:
â¢ Social and new media platforms
â¢ Performance Dashboards
â¢ Open Data Portals
â¢ Adhoc analyses (comparison and 
benchmarking)
â¢ e-mail, text messages and mobile notification 
messages
â¢ County websites

168. Further communication and dissemination 
tools are described in the National M&E 
Framework under section 6.2. Each county 
is encouraged to use communication and 
dissemination tools that may work best for its 
products.
5.2.6 Maximizing Utilization of M&E evidence
169. This section addresses the critical process of 
maximising the likelihood that decision-makers 
will actually use the information provided in 
the M&E reports. The reports should be easy to 
access and to use in assessing progress; well 
summarised against outputs and outcome 
targets outlined in CIDP .
170. Ownership of the M&E Process: Experience 
suggests that the likelihood of results being used 
is often directly proportionate to the sense of 
ownership that decision-makers feel in regard to 
the process. If decision-makers have a strong sense 
of ownership, they are more likely to incorporate the 
results into ongoing or future activities. Decision-
makers presented with final reports into which they 
have had little input, are less likely to accept the 
results, particularly if the results are not consistent 
with their own preconceptions or assumptions.
171. Effective Presentation of Findings and 
Recommendations: The likelihood of results being 
used increases if findings are presented effectively. 
This means that findings and recommendations are 
clear to the policymakers and are implementable. 
172. Timeliness: Results must be available at the 
time when decisions are being made. External 
events may dictate the timelines of evaluations 
(e.g., legislative debates, project review deadlines, 
budgetary decisions); an M&E team should be 
knowledgeable about the timing of such decision-
making cycles. Often valuable M&E results have 
been unusable, at least in the short run, because 
they arrived too late. For monitoring systems, 
timeliness is defined by internal needs, where the 
programme manager has more discretion over 
when results will be used. Periodic compilation of 
data should be set when creating a monitoring 
system and followed throughout the course of a 
project.
173. Feasibility potential: The usability of results 
and recommendations also depends on the extent 
to which they can be put into practice. Efforts to 
tailor the report, at least in part, to the range of 
policy choices open to the decision-makers, and 
concrete and realistic suggestions to address 
project-specific problems, increases its usefulness. 
If the recommendations suggest concrete and 
realistic steps to address project specific problems, 
its findings are more likely to be implemented rather 
than disregarded.
5.3 Public Participation: Political Value 
and Legal Responsibility
174. Public participation is a legal responsibility 
and is required before a county government 
begins spending on implementation of the 
CIDP . This legal responsibility is detailed in the 
Public Participation Bill 2018 and Public Participation 
Guidelines developed by The Ministry of Devolution 
and Planning and the CoG. 
In the spirit of the 
Constitution, citizen participation is about 
engaging, understanding and meeting the needs of 
people in the county by mobilising all the insight, 
energy and commitment of individuals and groups. 
Participation allows the county to understand what 
is needed and to gain commitment to a way forward. 
Participation includes dissemination and gathering 
feedback as part of a holistic development process. 
The County Executive can mobilise more innovation, 
opportunity, commitment and resources through 
community participation in development planning. 
Participation in development, monitoring, review 
and evaluation of the CIDP strengthens county 
citizen awareness and ownership of the CIDP 
programmes/ projects that are being implemented 
by the county government. It also provides a check 
formula to ensure value for money, accountable 
Reporting, Dissemination and Citizen Engagement
<<<PAGE=66>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
50
spending and good governance. Participation can 
be used to:
â¢ Capture the ideas, attitude, voice and 
commitment of stakeholders;
â¢ Ensure and provide evidence that the 
county executive has met the legal duty of 
participatory development;
â¢ Strengthen accountability and good 
governance.
175. Participatory Public Expenditure 
Management has recently emerged as an 
important means for involving citizens and civil 
society organisations in public expenditure 
management. Participatory Public Expenditure 
Management has already been adopted at the 
national government level in an effort to ensure 
greater transparency, better targeting and tracking 
of resources, and increased overall responsiveness. 
MED annually produces Public Expenditure 
Reviews (PERs), which are discussed widely by all 
stakeholders and made available via the responsible 
department for economic planning website. This 
has increasingly contributed not only to greater 
development effectiveness, but also increased 
accountability for the use of public resources at the 
national level.
176. To ensure greater accountability and 
support from county residents and civil society, 
county governments should invest in measures to 
increase the participation of various stakeholder 
groups in public expenditure management. The 
county PERs prepared by each county, should 
also be discussed with these stakeholders, and 
the county management team should ensure 
that the recommendations emanating from 
these consultations are considered in the budget 
preparation and execution process. Each county 
PER should also be made publicly available by being 
placed on the county governmentâs website.
177. Appendices A5 and A6 provide a framework 
for monitoring participation, enabling the county 
executive to demonstrate and provide evidence 
of a systematic and measurable approach to 
participation.

Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES

6.0 Introduction
178. Operationalising CIMES is based on the 
structure of the county (Appendix A13) that 
delivers reports as set out in Appendix A14.  
Committees (Table 6) and Responsibilities of Major 
Players (Table 7) have a responsibility to deliver 
reports according to the reporting calendar as also 
defined by the reporting obligations of the county, 
as set out in Appendix  A16. Producers, approvers 
and recipients of reports are also detailed in 
Appendix A14.
179. It is important that the county leadership â 
both the County Executive, county commissioners 
and the County Assemblyâ are active drivers and 
users of the CIMES. Refer to the Readiness Checklist 
of Appendix A2 for criteria that must be met for 
initiating county M&E for results.
180. To ensure the required emphasis, M&E 
receives full attention from all county staff 
involved in its implementation and reporting,  
M&E targets and indicators should be linked directly 
to the performance management of the county, 
including Performance Contracts Performance 
Appraisal System.
181. As recognised in the principles of Chapter 
3, M&E must be incorporated as part of the 
larger CIDP planning, performance management 
and implementation cycle. The County PMS 
Handbook addresses the detailed responsibilities 
in the county PMS implementation programme, 
which ensures that M&E is linked to PMS in every 
county. Respectively senior government officers 
should chair quarterly performance reviews by 
departments. The schedule of meetings and related 
agendas, roles and responsibilities are detailed in 
the County PMS Handbook.
182. County PMS processes incorporate evidence-
based M&E, following the ten steps presented in 
Chapter 3. Further, the M&E of individual projects 
within the CIDP Results Matrix is performed by 
project managers and approved by the respective 
Director of the Department in which each project 
is located. Results are then forwarded to the M&E 
Directorate. The Directorate thereafter compiles a 
county M&E report that is passed to the CoMEC for 
approval and onward submission to the relevant 
committees and other stakeholders as outlined 
in the institutional arrangement. Directors are 
required to work with the M&E Directorate to 
ensure that the county M&E function is given 
adequate attention within the county performance 
management process. 
183. To get started with county M&E, use the 
10 steps of Chapter 3 in the given sequence. To 
operationalise the regular process of county M&E 
and performance management, use the detailed 
recommendations and processes of the County 
PMS Handbook.
184. To assist all counties to monitor and evaluate 
the implementation of their CIDPs, MED has been 
developing these Guidelines, and will work with 
the CoG and the Kenya School of Government to 
provide other required materials, including:
â¢	 Detailed instructions to accompany each of the 
forms in Appendices from A1-A16 as required;
â¢	 A roll-out model for capacity building and on-
going support of counties;
OPERATIONALISING CIMES
CHAPTER SIX
<<<PAGE=68>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
52
â¢	 These Guidelines and detailed hands-one-
learning for the ten steps in Chapter 3;
-	 A county PMS handbook to operationalise 
the required process and meetings and to 
provide a process for engagement of the 
Governorâs Office, the County Secretary 
and Directors of County Departments;
-	 A county PMS system to work seamlessly 
with CIMES.
185. This combined toolkit addresses political 
will and success factors, and provides further detail 
on the meetings calendar, agendas and staffing.
186. In operationalising CIMES, expenses for the 
following items should be budgeted as outlined in 
the draft Kenya National M&E Policy:
â¢	 Capacity building of technical officers;
â¢	 Logistics budget;
â¢	 Sensitization of the County Assembly, and the 
County Executive;
â¢	 Commissioning and training for the CIMES 
system computerisation (e-CIMES), to manage 
data entry, aggregation and reporting 
consistent with the criteria identified in 
Appendix A9 and A15.
187. The cost, time, effort and risk of CIMES 
implementation is to be minimised by the above 
resources as a defined toolkit that has been tested 
and will be refined and improved, based on the 
experience of successive county implementations.
188. The evidence that the county is performing 
the M&E as required, comes at a time when the 
county is driving CIDP implementation through 
M&E as part of county performance management.
189. To enable all 47 counties to implement their 
CIDPs, funds must be set aside at the national level â 
for training and for the development of a nationally 
available PMS and M&E toolkit and at county level 
for capacity building, procurement of e-CIMES 
software and for maintaining and operating the 
system.
190. An appropriate budget should be allocated 
for the Performance Management of the CIDP , 
including for County M&E and other project M&E.  
A well planned and well implemented County PMS 
and M&E will deliver high returns to the county. The 
contributors to efficiency gains are derived from the 
impact achieved improvements, efficiency savings 
and effectiveness.
191. The benefits and financial returns of effective, 
results-based performance management and 
M&E significantly outweigh the costs, and can be 
estimated based on savings in administrative time 
savings and also in terms of improved effectiveness.
6.1 M&E Core Indicators
192. MTP indicators and county indicators may 
come from numerous sources. Detailed monthly 
indicators come from operational and management 
systems such as IFMIS and HMIS. Indicators are 
collected by surveys or from census data, and 
hence provide historical reality. CRA, CoB, and AOG 
each use indicators to inform their work, and KNBS 
have developed a template of indicators for county 
governments. Where possible, it is important to 
ensure that the core indicators in CIMES are aligned 
to the revised MTP indicators. Core indicators that 
are regularly collected and made available for 
official use are presented in Appendix A1. Each 
county is encouraged to develop own indicator 
handbook for reporting at the county level. These 
indicators should provide a detailed assessment 
of development initiatives undertaken by various 
actors and achievement of development results.
193. The CIDP Guidelines and the County 
Government Act (2012) outline priority indicators 
that must be collected as follows:
Operationalising CIMES
<<<PAGE=69>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
53
âEach CIDP should provide clear input, 
output and outcome performance indicators, 
including the percentage of households 
with access to basic services contemplated 
under Article 43 of the Bill of Rights of the 
Constitution; the percentage of a countyâs 
capital budget actually spent on capital 
projects identified for a particular financial 
year in terms of the countyâs ADP; the 
number of jobs created through any local 
economic development initiatives, including 
capital projects; and financial viability of the 
integrated development plan in accordance 
with nationally applicable ratios.â
194. MED will work closely with CoG to 
ensure inter-county coordination during 
the development of CIMES for each county 
government. In addition, MED will provide 
assistance to capacity building needed at county 
level. It will also maintain research and M&E 
services that cater for the needs of both county 
and national governments.
6.2 Resources for Monitoring and 
Evaluation
195. Allocation of inadequate resources to the 
county M&E activities will lead to poor quality 
monitoring and evaluation. To ensure effective 
monitoring and evaluation, it is critical to set 
aside adequate financial and human resources for 
M&E at the projects/programmes planning stage. 
The required financial and human resources for 
monitoring and evaluation should be considered 
within the overall costs of delivering the agreed 
results and not as additional costs.
196. Financial resources for monitoring and 
evaluation should be estimated realistically at 
the planning stage as outlined in the draft Kenya 
National M&E Policy. The M&E Framework document 
recommends that the management team 
responsible for project/programme preparation 
and implementation should provide for financial 
resources for M&E in their budgets. It is essential 
that each county and its development partners 
consider the resources needed for monitoring and 
evaluation and agree on a practical arrangement 
to finance the associated activities. Such 
arrangements should be documented during the 
preparation of each CIDP project and programme 
to enable a county and its development partners 
to transfer the necessary funds in accordance with 
their procedures, which could take considerable 
time and  effort. Counties should ensure that at 
least one per cent of the development budget is 
allocated for M&E functions. 
197. Although the resourcing of the county 
M&E function may be flexible, the responsible 
officer for Economic Planning should monitor 
this, and ensure that each county establishes 
the required M&E infrastructure. For individual 
county government departments and agencies, the 
heads of these institutions are required to provide 
adequate resources for building M&E capacity 
appropriate to their organisations, together with 
the mechanisms needed for follow-through on 
delivery of credible M&E reports.
198. While it is critical to plan for monitoring 
and evaluation together, resources for each 
function should be catered for separately. Each 
project should have two separate budget lines for 
its monitoring and evaluation activities agreed in 
advance with partners. This will help the county 
and its partners to be more realistic in budgeting. It 
will also reduce the risk of running out of resources 
for evaluation, which often takes place at mid-
term or towards the end of project/programme 
implementation.
199. The M&E Directorate staff should assist 
project managers and their county directors to 
identify M&E costs associated with projects and 
programmes. These costs could then be charged 
directly to the respective project/programme 
budgets with prior agreement among the relevant 
Operationalising CIMES
<<<PAGE=70>>>
Guidelines for the Development of CCIMES
54
county departments and partners, through 
inclusion in the project budget or Annual Work Plan 
(AWP) signed by various Directors of Departments.
200. Human resources are critical for effective 
monitoring and evaluation, even after securing 
adequate financial resources. Monitoring and 
evaluation requires competent professionals in 
the public service. The National M&E Framework 
describes competencies needed for M&E staff, and 
steps that are being taken by the government to 
develop curricula and advanced training in M&E 
for use by local universities and other training 
institutions. In essence a core M&E curriculum at 
university level will be defined in collaboration with 
the institutions, to serve as a basis for universitiesâ  
development of suitable M&E programmes. In-
service training courses will also be made available, 
tailored for different stakeholders and target groups, 
covering both awareness raising and in-house 
training programmes for managers and for M&E 
and other programme staff. The Kenya School of 
Government and a selected number of universities 
have already developed tailored M&E courses to 
enhance M&E skills in the country.
201. For high-quality monitoring and evaluation, 
there should be:
â¢ Dedicated staff time â Specific staff members 
should be assigned to the M&E function. The 
practices of deployment of personnel for 
monitoring may vary among counties. County 
governments could establish monitoring and 
evaluation directorates with specific terms of 
reference, skilled staff, work plans and other 
resources.
â¢ Skilled personnelâStaff entrusted with 
monitoring should have the required technical 
expertise in the area. Where necessary, skill 
levels should be augmented to meet the 
needs, taking into consideration the ongoing 
county investment portfolio.
202. These additional M&E responsibilities 
outlined in these guidelines should be 
reassigned among existing county staff, 
especially planning officers or economists 
working in the department responsible for 
county economic planning and development.  
However, in order to ensure that the county staff 
members reassigned to M&E activities fully meet 
the countyâs M&E needs and, ultimately, increase 
the quality of M&E programming at county level, 
the skills of the selected staff will be augmented 
through in-house M&E training and other courses 
to be offered by MED and other suitable M&E 
training institutions.

Project M&E Using Project Sheets
Use the template above to record a project results matrix for a project or Project Service Delivery Unit (PSDU). 
Start with the 3-5 priority projects or services per department. Record the county (and sub-county), department, 
project name, financial year as well as location or geo coordinates of the project where applicable. Define the 
person responsible (PDO) and the planned start and end date. Targets should be set for annual and quarterly 
achievements. For each target a means of verification should be defined. The project sheet results should be 
updated at least quarterly by the PDO with the assistance of the Efficiency Officer of their ministry. Key actions 
to be taken by the PDO or others should be recorded in the SMART Actions table of A10 and the status of these 
actions should be updated at least quarterly. The report, together with evidence and explanation, should be 
approved by the SPDM before passing to the M&E Unit for collation with other results for quarterly M&E reports 
and performance management reporting to CoMEC and the Governorâs office as appropriate.
This requires identifying input level indicators (money, resources, activities), output level indicators (describing 
the expected deliverables), outcome level indicators (utilisation and appreciation of deliverables), and â where 
practical â impact level indicators, i.e. benefits that are directly attributable to the utilisation of the deliverables. 
The logical levels are:
1)  Inputs: Budget Implementation and Activities. Indicators refer to the degree to which the allocated 
budget for the respective sector has a) been disbursed, and b) been utilised for the planned activities.
â¢ 
Example: % of allocated amounts for the construction of new health centres disbursed and spent to 
implement the planned health centre.
2)  Outputs: Achievement, project completion. This level of indicator describes to what extent the intended 
goods have been delivered by the respective sector agencies, or the degree to which a project has been 
completed or the services are ready for service delivery.
â¢ Example: New health centre in the county constructed, equipped, staffed, and operational.
3)  Outcomes: Utilisation / User satisfaction. This level assesses to what extent the sector services have actually 
been used, with users adopting, appreciating or expressing satisfaction with the services provided.
â¢ Example: Number of assisted deliveries in the health centre.
4) Impacts: Benefit. This level assesses the benefits received by the target population from use of the outputs. 
Direct benefits are as experienced and assessed by beneficiaries. Indirect benefits are typically measured 
as statistical changes in highly aggregated development indicators which can still be attributed to 
the improvements in the services provided, and the utilisation of these services by the people in the 
county. For this level it may only be practical to get data aggregated at county level, not by individual 
PSDU or project.
â¢ Example: Chang e in maternal mortality rate in the county.

A12: Targets in Project Sheets and Results Matrix
Setting targets
Define realistic objectives and targets in terms of quantity and time for indicators and projects and services 
listed. Start with the high priority, high impact projects.
The importance of targets
Setting targets and measuring results enables comparisons to be made between actual and planned performance.
Target setting is when the CIDP is defined, and then targets may be revised or added to during the annual 
update of the CIDP .
Realistic targets have to be defined in terms of quantity and time, (monthly, quarterly, yearly targets and/or 
deadlines), for all indicators and for all projects and services listed. These targets must be sufficiently ambitious, 
to convince all stakeholders including decision-makers and the public that this is indeed good value for money.
Stakeholder participation
Targets must be set, based on the developmental needs of communities. Remember that there may be quick-
win policy changes, tasks or projects with a low cost and high impact for stakeholders. Use the consultation 
process to identify quick-win projects and ensure they are built into the sector plans and objectives of Chief 
Officers and their Efficiency Officers. Use Appendix A5 to ensure that participation covers all stakeholder groups 
adequately. Use Appendix A6 to ensure that participation is on-going process built-into county governance. 
Political leaders must provide clear direction as to the importance of the target and how it will address the 
public need, while county government employees must advise as to what a realistic and achievable target is, 
given the available resources, capacity and challenges.
Managers, after consulting operational staff, must advise on seasonal changes and other externalities to be 
considered in the process of target setting. By finalising the Annual Development Plan, the county makes a 
commitment to achieve these targets within agreed time-frames and to notify all stakeholders of the targets and 
time-frames. Since this commitment is cascaded down to the individual level through performance agreements, 
directorate performance plans and individual performance plans, it is critical that all staff be involved  in the 
target setting process.
Guidance for Target Setting
To set meaningful targets in the Annual Development Plan and county sector plans, refer to:
(a) Vision 2030, the county vision, and values, mission, and long-term development strategy.
(b) National MTP III, the Big Four initiatives and county policies, priorities and legislation, in particular 
comparing current service standards with what is generally regarded as acceptable and expected 
standards.
(c) Inputs from stakeholders, including citizens, and for quick-wins.
(d) Information contained in the current CIDP (2018-2022).
(e) Previous performance and current baseline performance information.

(f )   Envisaged performance to be achieved in the financial year 2018/2019 and subsequent financial years on 
the basis of the expected resource envelope (resources available over time).
(g) What is working in this county and in other counties?
(h) Lessons learnt, as well as challenges, resource constraints and success stories.
On the basis of annual institutional performance targets, quarterly targets may also be agreed upon for all 
indicators where this is possible and feasible. This should be done in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, 
e.g. political leaders, sector management teams and staff. The resulting quarterly targets become agreed upon 
performance, alerting CEC members, management and staff about what is expected and to what extent they 
will be held accountable for performance (Include quarterly targets in the Results Matrix Template for CIDP 
Performance Management of Appendix A8). The Results Matrix and quarterly targets are the basis for the 
Performance Contract of the CEC members for each sector.

A16: NIMES Operational Arrangements
1) The operational arrangement for implementation, coordination and reporting of NIMES results at national 
level consists of two guiding committees and five Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs). The committees and 
the five TAGs are as given below.
A. The National Treasury and Planning
2) The TNT&P is responsible for the coordination of NIMES through MED. TNT&P leads the M&E efforts, backed 
by various policies and pieces of legislation mentioned in this chapter. It is also expected to be backed by 
adequate skilled staff as well as infrastructural capacity to undertake robust M&E of policies, projects and 
programmes that are being implemented by the two levels of government, the private sector, and CSOs.
B. Monitoring and Evaluation Department (MED)
3) MED has the mandate as a Department in the State Department of Planning of the National Treasury and 
Planning to co-ordinate NIMES with the aim to:
(a) Build and promote the M&E practice throughout Kenya, ensuring integration of Government and 
its non-state partners in the M&E reporting process;
(b) Strengthen capacities for M&E at all levels and for all components of practice;
(c) Produce policy research and key M&E reports;
(d) Track follow-up on the implementation of major monitoring reports; and
(e) Develop and institutionalise standards and guidelines for harmonised project monitoring and 
reporting at the national and sub-national levels.
C. National M&E Steering Committee (NSC)
4) The National Monitoring and Evaluation Steering NSC is the highest policy advisory body under the NIMES 
institutional arrangements. The NSC provides overall endorsement of the policy direction to NIMES. It 
endorses the work plans of TAGs. The NSC also advises and promotes the use of best international practice, 
and assists in mobilising resources for the functioning of NIMES and the TAGs. Its composition includes 
representatives of the government, civil society, and private sector and development partners.
D. M&E Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)
5) The M&E Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), is the technical / professional advisory organ in strategy 
and direction for NIMES. It approves NIMES work plans and tracks progress in their implementation. It

Research and Results Analysis; (iii) Dissemination for Advocacy and Sensitisation; (iv) Project Monitoring 
and Evaluation; and (v) Capacity Development and Policy Coordination.
