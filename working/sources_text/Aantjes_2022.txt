Capacity development in pursuit of social change:
an examination of processes and outcomes
Carolien Jeanette Aantjes , Dave Burrows, and Russell Armstrong
ABSTRACT
Understanding “what works” for capacity development support in an
international development setting remains an important area for
operational research. This mixed-methods study explored this topic
within a global programme that supports civil society organisations in
ﬁfteen countries to secure the health and human rights of marginalised
and underserved populations. Taking a complex adaptive systems
approach, and seeking to understand the phenomena from the
“receiver” perspective, the study found that the programme fostered
the development of four interconnected domains of capacity through a
reﬂexive, user-led approach. These capacity gains could be linked,
although not causally, to important programmatic achievements for the
programme’s focus populations.

Introduction
Capturing the nature and eﬀects of capacity development is a complex task, particularly if the
acquired capacity is expected to contribute to a process of social change and transformation. The
understanding of how these processes unfold, and the attempt to identify links or pathways
between capacity development interventions, acquired capacity, and social change is an evolving
science (Brinkerhoﬀ and Morgan 2010; Gruskin et al 2015). Previous approaches attempting to
describe linear relationships have, more recently, been supplanted by more dynamic and complex-
ity-oriented understandings of how capacity is acquired and embedded within the social systems
and involves multiple interplays of actors and factors as the process unfolds (McEvoy, Brady, and
Munck 2016; Vallejo and Wehn 2016). In the last decade, within the international development
context, the “complex adaptive” view of capacity development has gained traction, with more
and more development practitioners from the“Global North” adopting it as the basis for designing,
providing and reﬂecting on their support to partners in the“Global South” (McEvoy, Brady, and
Munck 2016). Diﬀerent models and frameworks have emerged that take this complexity-oriented
approach, sharing characteristics such as iteration, learning,ﬂexibility, and non-linearity, with an
explicit focus on the interactions between recipients of capacity development and their external
environments (Pascual et al. 2013; Vallejo and Wehn 2016). In many respects, this complexity-
oriented approach involves observing and interpreting links between capacity development and
acquired capacity more than measuring and explaining these phenomena in terms of generalisable
or replicable patterns. A pre-occupation remains, however, with“what works” and at least some
degree of replication, given the emphasis on results and value-for-money among the agencies

supporting North–South partnerships, and which have a genuine interest that tangible and durable
capacity gains emerge at the Southern end of these investments.
For this study, which had a similar aim of identifying“what works”, the researchers adopted a
study design that was guided by complex-adaptive systems (CAS) thinking, and incorporated
methods that allowed for an endogenous approach. This approach involved observing and inter-
preting capacity development, capacity gains, and programmatic achievements from the perspec-
tive of those leading and experiencing these changes and within the speciﬁc contexts where
these changes unfold. The study involved a global programme covering a wide variety of CSOs pur-
suing change objectives for speciﬁc focus populations in an equally diverse range of socio-political
environments. This programme, called Bridging the Gaps, has been in existence since 2011 and is led
by an Alliance of nine global NGOs and networks.
1 It is one of very few global programmes focussing
on the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of key populations, which include sex
workers of all genders; people who use or inject drugs (PWUD); lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgen-
der people (LGBT); and people living with HIV within each of these groups.2 The programme aims to
contribute to ending the AIDS epidemic in these focus populations through achieving three long-
term goals: a strengthened civil society that holds governments to account; increased fulﬁlment
of human rights for key populations; and improved SRHR, including fewer HIV transmissions and
AIDS-related deaths. Across three continents andﬁfteen countries, more than ninety CSOs work
towards achieving these results in challenging environments characterised by an interplay of power-
ful interests that limit or deny the health and rights of their constituencies.
Given the central role of civil society partners in the programme, ensuring that these entities have
suﬃcient capacity is an important priority. All Alliance members, most regional-level partners, and a
number of the more established in-country partners provide capacity development interventions,
using diﬀerent modalities (e.g. training workshops, hands-on mentoring), for diﬀ erent target
groups (staﬀ of partner organisations, staﬀ of programme subgrantees, programme stakeholders,
and beneﬁciaries) and for diﬀerent durations and levels of intensity (once-oﬀ events, longer-term,
multi-year capacity development-focussed relationships). In order to understand in greater depth
what these approaches achieved in relation to programme results, and whether they had any dis-
cernible degree of eﬀectiveness, a multi-country operational research project was undertaken. Its
aim was to identify those capacity development interventions thateﬀectively equip CSOs and net-
works led by or working with key population groups to secure their health and rights, and to advo-
cate for social change in complex legal and socio-cultural contexts. The study was carried out by a
team of international and national researchers between April 2018 and July 2019 and its results are
reported here.
Research approach
In the international development literature, the theoretical and practical approaches to capacity
development have been continually evolving with no strong consensus on deﬁnitions or approaches
(Backer 2000; OECD 2006; UNDP 2009). As a starting point, the research team chose to adopt the
terminology of the OECD which has been applied to similar research eﬀorts within a North–South
frame. The OECD deﬁnes capacity as“the ability of people, organisations and societies as a whole
to manage their aﬀairs successfully” (OECD 2006, 12). It subsequently deﬁnes capacity development
as, “the process whereby people, organisations and society as a whole unleash, strengthen, create,
adapt and maintain capacity over time”. Capacity is used in these descriptions in its holistic sense as
an aggregate of a number of sub-components that some scholars deﬁne as “an emergent combi-
nation” or “a complex interplay of attitudes, assets, resources, strategies and skills, both tangible
and intangible” with “technical, organisational and social aspects” (Baser and Morgan2008, 3, 23).
The phrases “emergent combination” and “complex interplay” are important and suggest that
what makes up capacity very much depends on the contexts where one is attempting to locate
it, either from a research or practice standpoint (McEvoy, Brady, and Munck2016). Following from
DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 537
<<<PAGE=4>>>
this, and given the breadth of CSOs, operating contexts, programmatic objectives, and focus popu-
lations that comprise the programme, the researchers adopted a similarly“emergent” stance.
In the study, capacity development was further conceptualised as a process that strengthens
existing capacities as opposed to building capacity where none existed previously (Ubels,
Acquaye-Baddoo, and Fowler 2010). In this view, capacity develops fromwithin individuals and
organisations and occurs in a dynamic environment in which new knowledge and skills are
oﬀered, received, and subsequently integrated (or not) into the procedures and routines of individ-
uals and organisations. Capacity development interventions can be characterised as learning pro-
cesses, aimed at strengthening or improving the way in which individuals and organisations think
and act, and acquired capacity as the outcome of this learning process. However, the ways in
which such learning unfolds can be complex and challenging to trace or describe (Lavergne
2006). This suggests that any analysis of capacity development must seek to understand “the
process of change from the perspective of those undergoing the change” as a priori or externally
derived concepts or frameworks will not suﬃce (Baser and Morgan 2008). The researchers also
took this endogenous view, meaning that, in relation to the research question, what was ultimately
considered to“eﬀectively equip” organisations to achieve social change was largely contingent on
the views and experiences of the individuals and organisations engaged in these processes.
The research team designed a mixed-methods approach that included a core component of com-
parative case studies involving four Bridging the Gaps supported CSOs, each operating in diﬀerent
countries, with varying organisation structures, membership bodies, and focus populations.
3 To
undertake the case studies, the research team used outcome harvesting, aﬂexible investigative tech-
nique that is gaining in recognition in capacity development research using a CAS approach (Wilson-
Grau and Britt2012; McEvoy, Brady, and Munck2016; Vallejo and Wehn2016). This participatory
technique unfolds in stages. It begins with the identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant results and then works
retrospectively to collect the“evidence” of what is said to have been achieved in order to specify,
substantiate, and validate the nature and extent of the results and the contributory factors
leading to their realisation. In each case, the process began with participatory workshops involving
staﬀ members and researchers who identiﬁed signiﬁcant programme results and then reﬂected on
the contributory factors, including the role of capacity development. These elements were further
investigated through document review, key informant interviews (including with individuals exter-
nal to the organisation), and additional group discussions. Theﬁndings were then prepared as
concise outcome statements describing the outcome itself and the contributions (on the part of
the organisation itself, other partners or stakeholders, unforeseen inﬂuences or events, and capacity
development support) that purportedly led to its achievement. In total, twenty-four detailed
outcome statements were completed, across the four organisations, each having gone through
several iterations and aﬁnal validation in a workshop setting.
Other data collection techniques in the study included a literature and document review, an elec-
tronic survey completed by sixty programme partners, and semi-structured interviews withﬁfteen
key informants from the Alliance with an aim to review the current state of the art in capacity devel-
opment within international development and human rights and health programmes, and to inven-
torise the capacity development theories, approaches, and interventions used across the Bridging
the Gaps programme. The interviews and electronic survey also sought to examine the perspectives
of both the Alliance members and their partners on the eﬀectiveness of capacity development in the
programme. The research team used the data that was collected through the survey to inform the
selection of the four case studies. Given the range and quantity of data collected, the research team
adopted diﬀerent approaches for data analysis, interpretation, and validation. These included the-
matic analysis of documents, interview notes and transcripts, workshop reports and outcome state-
ments, and descriptive analysis of survey data. For the case studies, the research team developed a
coding structure, derived from the key concepts and research questions, for the analysis of the inter-
view transcripts and as an interpretive guide for analysing documentation collected during the har-
vesting process. This approach helped to ensure the consistency of the analytic focus between the
538 C. J. AANTJES ET AL.
<<<PAGE=5>>>
diﬀerent researchers within and across the case studies. To link the results from these analytic
approaches, the research team used triangulation. Analytic rigour was achieved through a continual,
reﬂexive engagement with the data by the researchers, individually and jointly, and through the re-
engagement of the research participants at diﬀerent stages of the analysis process.
Approval to conduct the study was granted by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the
University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. Approval was also granted through the Research Advi-
sory Committee of Aidsfonds, who commissioned the research on behalf of the Alliance. Additional
ethics clearances were obtained in Tajikistan and Nepal where two of the four case studies were con-
ducted (in Uganda and Zimbabwe this was not required). Written informed consent was obtained
prior to conducting key informant interviews. Consent to conduct the case studies was also provided
by the governing body of each case study organisation.
Study ﬁndings
This section begins with some cross-cutting observations on the nature of capacity and capacity
development in the Bridging the Gaps programme and the elaboration of a framework, that was
informed by the programme’s goals and the research data, to help unpack and analyse capacity
development within the context of this programme. The section then continues along the structure
of this framework to present the studyﬁndings.
Situating capacity and capacity development within a social change agenda
The study began with an analysis of concepts and approaches to capacity and capacity development
as understood by the leaders and participants in the programme, and as described in the capacity
development materials that were collected. While these sources all demonstrated a strong commit-
ment, what constituted the programme’s approach to capacity development, from both a concep-
tual and practical perspective, was neither consistently deﬁned nor linked to an overarching strategy
(a theory of change, for example). Nevertheless, across the interviews with the nine Alliance
members a certain consistency was observed in the way capacity development was viewed as an
iterative, continuous process which needed to centre around and leverage the role of the key popu-
lation communities themselves, as described below:
The philosophy of a lot of funders is to believe now in“ready-organisations”. There is no such thing. They
[organisations] can be great and powerful today, but crumble tomorrow. Capacity is something that is con-
stant; you have to keep putting into it. For us it is really a focus on the bottom up approach. (Interview
Alliance member)
A range of interventions were undertaken, focussed on enhancing technical expertise for improved
service delivery (e.g. in harm reduction or sexual health), and on strengthening organisational
capacities (e.g. ﬁnance management, programme monitoring and evaluation, fundraising)– both
important priorities for the programme. Modalities included training workshops, provision of“how
to” technical guides, on-site mentoring and support, or regionally convened opportunities for experi-
ence sharing. Additionally, a collaboratively administered assessment tool was used on an annual basis
to deﬁne capacity development priorities and identify relevant interventions. The administration of the
tool also provided an opportunity for reﬂection on achievements in previous periods. The absence of
some minimally articulated concepts of capacity and capacity development meant that, overall, there
were few means by which to determine whether tangible capacity gains were made and what the sig-
niﬁcance of these could have entailed. This was not to say that capacity development interventions did
not produce results or valued capacity gains did not occur. What was required was for the researchers
to surface the more extensive and complex phenomena of capacity and capacity development in the
programme and arrive at a more situated conceptualisation of the two, using the endogenous
approach. As expressed in its three long-term goals, noted earlier, the Bridging the Gaps programme
DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 539
<<<PAGE=6>>>
aims towards structural change. The terms“demanding”, “strengthening”, “increasing”, “improving”,
“holding to account” appear throughout the programme documents and are used to describe the
cross-cutting actions or shifts that, through its funded partners, the programme seeks to achieve for
its focus populations (Aidsfonds,2015). “Capacity” in this context can be taken to mean that organis-
ations have suﬃcient power, agency, and legitimacy to fulﬁl their organisational missions, working
with or integrating members of the constituencies that have created them, in order to inﬂuence
their environments. As change agents, they are expected to use this power and agency to attempt
to shift a set of structural relations that are inequitable for key populations, and that unjustly infringe
their human right to health. From the data, four interlinked domains of capacity and capacity devel-
opment could be identiﬁed in this programme (Box 1).
(a) Capacity development for individuals and communities– This community development component of the Bridging
the Gaps programme aims towards empowering individuals within their personal and social spheres to articulate and
claim their identities and to form and sustain social movement structures in their communities.
(b) Strengthening organisations – As a way to instrumentalise and direct the political power of social movements,
empowered key population communities have formed organisations (or allies have formed organisations on their
behalf). Governments or other types of“duty bearers” that aﬀect the health and rights of key population groups operate
through systems, processes, or institutional mechanisms that are most eﬀectively accessed by organisations. It follows,
then, that key population communities need strong organisations to act on their behalf (be legitimate, accountable, and
inﬂuential) within the institutional and structural relationships that they are seeking to change and transform.
(c) Learning to work in partnerships and coalitions– The change imperatives of the Bridging the Gaps programme are
broad and multi-dimensional. They encompass not just institutional shifts in laws or policies, for example, but also shifts
in socio-cultural attitudes, beliefs, or practices. There is no singular change imperative but a constellation of challenges
that need to be resolved. Organisations as change agents need to combine forces to push against powerful forces in the
form of governments or other social institutions that are indiﬀerent or resistant to such shifts.
(d) Capacity development for duty bearers– An important component of the Bridging the Gaps programme involves
strengthening the capacity of duty bearers, whether as individuals (senior level politicians or decision makers),
institutions (health ministries or police forces, for example), or systems (health services, for example) to be more
responsive and accountable for the health and rights of key population groups. Through encounters with Bridging the
Gaps-supported interventions, such as training or sensitisation workshops, or through advocacy interventions to aﬀect
laws, regulations, or policies, such duty bearers acquire desired capacities for change.
The four domains were not independent of each other and surfaced as emergent combinations
that complemented each other according to local needs (Figure 1). For example, it was personal
empowerment that enabled members of the key population groups to sit in a parliamentary
forum and give persuasive testimonies about their life experiences, in environments where
aspects of their identities and behaviours are criminalised and socially condemned.
The following sections, based largely on the results of the outcome harvesting process, place in
context the four identiﬁed domains, and help deepen their meaning and illuminate their practical
application of“what works” and “how” for eﬀorts to equip CSOs to demand and sustain social change.
Capacity development for individuals in communities
In pursuing social change, partner organisations placed considerable emphasis on the empower-
ment of members from key population groups to articulate their identities and to form and
sustain social movement structures in their communities. These trajectories of community empow-
erment interventions consistently involve supporting individuals or groups to “step out of the
shadows” in their personal and social spheres and to use their acquired capacities to alter their
own life circumstances, including gaining control of their health and the factors that inﬂuence it.
Across the four case studies, a range of approaches to foster personal and collective empowerment
were observed. This included activities that reached out to socially isolated and highly vulnerable
individuals through outreach workers or volunteers; that encouraged the formation of support
groups or social networks in local communities; or that were made up of more elaborate mechan-
isms with broader scope, such as national or international meetings or conferences that brought

<<<PAGE=7>>>
constituencies together in larger numbers. Trainings, technical guides, outreach manuals, and other
inputs provided by the Alliance members, includingﬁnancial support, enabled organisations to
undertake this work.
As an example, AFEW-Tajikistan, one of the case study organisations, put in place Key Population
Councils as an intervention to empower and engage members of these constituencies. The councils
played an active role in the monitoring, oversight, and accountability of programmes and services
designed for their beneﬁt. Initially, they were established to oversee the programmes and services
of AFEW-Tajikistan. Over time, the councils’role expanded to cover the work of other governmental
and non-governmental actors, following the promotion of their work by AFEW-Tajikistan among
these key stakeholders and a continued training and mentoring of these councils. Many of the indi-
viduals that became involved in the councils underwent some personal transformation through the
skills and experiences they acquired, ranging from additional technical knowledge about the nature
of organisations and service provision, to more personal achievements such as improved skills and
conﬁdence for social interaction. From the interviews with council members, there was a sense of
these individuals moving from the margins to more central positions with an increased sense of
authority and inﬂuence over what surrounded them, with a particular focus on the quality and legiti-
macy of programmes and services. One of the study respondents, involved in the hands-on guidance
of the councils, described this change as follows:
Figure 1.Domains of capacity and capacity development for inﬂuencing change.
DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 541
<<<PAGE=8>>>
They [key populations] considered themselves to be clients and persons who could only get some services but
did not have the right to vote, or plan or evaluate… This is the uniqueness of creating the councils… which are
not funded in any way. The model that we set out and implemented has worked, although at the beginning it
was very diﬃcult since the council members were constantly changing. But those who remained on board saw
that their voice was heard and some steps were decided on. They watched, listened, wrote and sent letters [… ]
and suddenly saw the signiﬁcance of their voice. (Case study AFEW-Tajikistan: programme stakeholder interview
I)
To address some practical considerations, such as low literacy, Dictaphones were made available for
recording observations, which a literate fellow council member would write up after the monitoring
visits. One further result of the creation of the councils was the inﬂuence it had on government
(linking to the fourth domain as described above):
Empowering of key populations was very important, because the government now, for sure, 100%, they are
inviting the key populations to discussions on planning, and for some strategic activities. This never happened
10 years ago, maybeﬁve years ago, but now it is more and more common. (Case study AFEW-Tajikistan: pro-
gramme stakeholder interview II)
In all four case studies, the individual empowerment of members of key population groups was
observed to be central to the execution of the programme, albeit with distinctively diﬀerent pur-
poses in mind. For the two key-population-led organisations, Gays and Lesbians Zimbabwe
(GALZ) and Women ’s Organisational Network for Human Rights Advocacy (WONETHA) from
Uganda, having leaders and staﬀ who are constituency members themselves represented an impor-
tant feature of their organisational identity and strategic coherence. As a result, there was a clear
emphasis on having in place ﬂexible, internal staﬀ capacity development trajectories with a
strong component of mentoring and continuous learning in order to develop suﬃcient organis-
ational capacity. In the other two case study organisations, which were led by public health and
harm reduction specialists and social workers– AFEW-Tajikistan and Youth Vision from Nepal–
the involvement and empowerment of the constituency wasﬁrst and foremost used a means to
better inform programme design and implementation as well as to make constructive use of the
peer-to-peer approach for attracting key population groups to the programme and for drawing in
trained members in the provision of outreach services. Both organisations did not have the pathways
in place, as seen in GALZ and WONETHA, for key population members to develop themselves beyond
the role of a volunteer outreach worker or key population council member and become an employee
of the organisation.
Strengthening organisations
Key population communities require strong organisations to act on their behalf within the insti-
tutional and structural relationships that they are seeking to change and transform. The previous
paragraph discussed diﬀerent gradations in the involvement and leadership of these communities
within partner organisations of the Bridging the Gaps programme. The researchers observed that,
through cycles of experimentation, reﬂection, and learning, capacity was acquired, nurtured, and
sustained as organisations evolved and strengthened their legitimacy and inﬂuence on the issues
that were central to their mandates. As the programme has its most direct relationships with organ-
isations, it was expected that a signiﬁcant proportion of support would focus on organisational
strengthening. The main areas involved programme management,ﬁnancial management, resource
mobilisation, and the strengthening of the technical quality of key population services. Modalities
included online and oﬄine training courses, on-site mentoring, exchange visits, provision of guide-
lines, tools and training manuals around speciﬁc topics, advocacy, and lobbying. Alliance members
provided advice on partners’internal systems for monitoring and evaluation,ﬁnancial and human
resource management, issues of governance and how to use research to generate an evidence-
base for programming, and advocacy during monitoring visits and e-mail exchanges. A case study
participant from GALZ described how Bridging the Gaps-supported trainings and events had

<<<PAGE=9>>>
strengthened organisational procedures and routines, in this way, meeting the broader objective of
capacity development for the organisation as a whole:
I think they [Bridging the Gaps] have played a huge role, particularly supporting staﬀ of our organisation in the
capacity-building initiatives that they have [… ] MPact and COC would actually do the training and you would
see that the staﬀ were really beneﬁtting from those initiatives because then they would come back and apply
the techniques on the issues that they would have learned [to] their programming. And, in a way, it has
inﬂuenced how or changed the way we are working internally because of that internally aided capacity.
(Case study GALZ: staﬀ member interview I)
The stability and reliability of the programme’s support since 2011, when the partnership began for all
four case study organisations allowed for longer trajectories of capacity development and learning, and,
importantly, for the retention of staﬀmembers who could professionally mature and develop themselves
within the programme. In addition to longer-term funding, another aspect was the quality of the relation-
ships between the Alliance members and partner organisations which, the research found, had been
characterised by learning and (mostly informal) reﬂection, including theﬂexibility to jointly take risks
with new directions, to learn from set-backs, and to try anew with diﬀerent approaches. Where possible,
partner organisations freed up or sought after resources toﬁnance capacity development for staﬀ,s u c h
as enrolment in training courses or for completion of advanced diplomas or degrees. Utilising pro-
gramme funding, capacity development support also cascaded down to a wider group of CSOs,
either as network members, or as partners or allies. The research team observed various approaches,
ﬁnding a particular signiﬁcance for two of the case study organisations, which consciously incorporated
their own trial and error trajectory to mastering a certain expertise into the technical skills training of
others. Enhanced organisational credibility emerged as an important enabler in partnership building
and for inﬂuencing the policy environment to bring about positive change for key populations, including
those living with HIV. Speaking with authority on issues that concern these groups, using accurate and
comprehensive data, and demonstrating proﬁciency in attracting key population groups to services,
where others face serious diﬃculties, were some of the tangible outcomes that could be linked back
to the organisation-focussed support received in the programme.
Case study participants also identiﬁed risks and set-backs that could result in signiﬁcant capacity
losses. For example, WONETHA described how investments in recruitment, training, and mentoring
of members as peer educators were lost when these members moved on, often to other organisations
oﬀering higher remunerations. And while there was an understanding of why one would look for other
opportunities, there was nevertheless a frustration that the capacity investment had been lost for the
organisation and that resources were not always available to conduct training for replacements. The
study observed how the presence ofﬁnancial pressures threatened capacity gains (loss of staﬀ for
example, when programme funding ended) and opened up critical capacity gaps when, for example,
new programmes were undertaken which were more complex than any that partners had implemented
previously. Risks also rose from the fragility of an organisation’s “license”to operate in a hostile context–
particularly where key populations were criminalised– and government authorities sought to deregister
and declare such CSOs illegal. The capacity to“read”and subsequently act on speciﬁcs i t u a t i o n si sd e v e l -
oped through an extensive practice and a deep knowledge of the terrain by these health and human
rights-oriented civil society partner organisations.Furthermore, it is this uncertainty or suddenness with
which opportunities and threats for bringing about change arise that requires a certain amount ofﬂexi-
bility and trust within the funder–partner relationship and in the execution of their joint plans and goals
for capacity development, which the Bridging the Gaps programme allowed for.
Learning to work in partnerships and coalitions
The researchers observed the breadth of change imperatives of the programme and how partner
organisations worked on multiple health and rights dimensions, from institutional shifts through
laws and policies, to shifts in socio-cultural attitudes, beliefs, and practices. There was no singular
DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 543
<<<PAGE=10>>>
change imperative but a constellation of challenges that needed to be addressed and resolved. This
complexity and breadth of the change agenda required partners to enter into strategic alliances and
undertake collective action with like-minded organisations. It also required organisations to initiate
and sustain functional relationships with partners that did not always share similar (or sometimes
had opposing) goals or stances, such as governments, politicians, or police forces, but that were
necessary for change. Depending on the level of partnership formalisation, there was a need for
understanding the legal and social aspects of forming collaborative structures, and to develop com-
munication or mediation skills to deal with any tensions arising from such arrangements.
In this domain, capacity development support consisted of promoting partner organisations’con-
nectivity at national, regional, and global levels. Opportunities were created for them to participate
and interact with other organisations during conferences, in delegations and networking events.
Across three of the four case study organisations, there was clear recognition of the need to
embed themselves into local structures in order to eﬀect change. All had seats on government com-
mittees and in technical working groups, whereby the nature of their work organically deﬁned the
diﬀerent spaces they considered necessary to occupy. This was sometimes extensive; ranging from
health governance structures, CSO networks, and multi-sectoral entities created under national HIV
responses, to mechanisms for the oversight and channelling of international funding to their
countries.
Although not a speciﬁc area of focus in the capacity development support of the programme, the
ability to balance the politics and power dynamics and to foresee possible challenges emerged as an
important set of skills from the study data. This included conﬂict resolution and risk management. As
an illustration of the need for such capacity, GALZ (Zimbabwe) identiﬁed the establishment of an
LGBT Sector Forum as a main outcome or result of their participation in the programme. The
Forum unites LGBTI organisations within a self-organising platform through which to negotiate
and consolidate their collective interest for greater inﬂuence, particularly within the national HIV
response which has recently become more open to HIV-related LGBT health concerns. As GALZ
itself explained:
I think there is strength in numbers and when we look at the sector, it doesn’t help when we are working in silos
and if we are divided. We want to develop a common advocacy strategy that will apply to all organisations and
that we will use as a reference in the work that we do to come up with common objectives and work towards
that goal in our diﬀerent organisations. (Case study GALZ: Staﬀ interview II)
In co-convening the forum, GALZ needed to quickly acquire skills in mediation and conﬂict resol-
ution, particularly to manage the dynamics of inclusion across identity-based organisations that
had not so closely collaborated previously, and to mediate tensions around access to funding, par-
ticularly on the part of newer, emerging organisations demanding more equity in how limited
resources were distributed. The continued support for this venture from Bridging the Gaps was
an important example of a more indirect and reﬂexive approach to capacity development. It
allowed for GALZ to take an important step to unite smaller, less developed allies, while providing
some level of security for the organisation to‘learn by doing’, including to make, and recover from,
some initial mis-steps.
Capacity development for duty bearers
A last but equally important component of the programme involved strengthening the capacity of
duty bearers to be more responsive to and accountable for the health and rights of key populations
that fell within their institutional jurisdictions, such as a Ministry of Health or Home Aﬀairs. Equipping
partner organisations to be eﬀective in this work, either as individuals, organisations, or through
working in partnerships and coalitions, constituted the fourth domain of capacity development
for the programme. There were two-way capacity gains through interactions with duty bearers: gov-
ernment entities, for example, gained knowledge and experience about key populations and their
health and human rights challenges; meanwhile, key population representatives acquired skills for
544 C. J. AANTJES ET AL.
<<<PAGE=11>>>
speaking out and in ﬂuencing important State representatives and institutions. The following
example succinctly illustrates the cumulative nature of the capacity to have inﬂuence over important
duty-bearers:
Our government trusts this organisation… (Case study AFEW-Tajikistan: programme stakeholder interview III)
In Tajikistan, earning“trust” with government in an environment of a heavily regulated health sector
is a signiﬁcant achievement and resulted from a continuous, constructive engagement and an
organisational reputation for expertise and achieving results. What this trust earned was the
approval for this partner organisation to oﬀer HIV voluntary counselling and testing outside of
the government-controlled health sector, something that had not been permitted previously. The
case study noted how an accumulation of di ﬀerent capacities, including technical expertise,
ability to develop and test innovative approaches, and eﬀective relationship-building with govern-
ment, contributed to this position of“trust”.
A component of WONETHA’se ﬀorts to inﬂuence duty-bearers and the larger programme environ-
ment was to address harmful and discriminatory messaging about sex workers in local media, includ-
ing the participation of the police in perpetuating this practice. WONETHA’s approach was to draw
on the empowered capacity of its members and staﬀ to participate in training and sensitisation inter-
ventions with police, the media, and other local stakeholders and duty-bearers. During these events,
women shared their personal stories as sex workers and the negative impacts of public exposure on
them and their families, following the use of discriminatory and harmful media stereotypes. The
results of these capacity development interventions were noted by peer educators on the ground
as well as by other civil society organisations working on human rights issues in Uganda:
Police used to invite the media whenever they would do sex workers’raids. This has stopped ever since they
were sensitised. (Case study WONETHA: peer-educator interview)
I think media attitudes and perceptions have changed. Some of the mainstream media houses are now reporting
on the human rights violations that sex workers experience, particularly those perpetuated by police. (Case
study WONETHA: programme stakeholder interview)
The point has been made previously regarding the fragility of programme environments and how
quickly a number of inﬂuential gains could be undone, despite all of the eﬀorts to inﬂuence duty
bearers. For the case study organisation Youth Vision in Nepal, capacity development support led
to an in-house capacity to electronically track the uptake of harm reduction services, and to facilitate
the active engagement of people who inject drugs in feedback mechanisms regarding service design
and service quality. This had positioned Youth Vision for greater trust and inﬂuence in political
spaces, such as its involvement in drug law reform. However, despite sustained engagement on
these issues, the enabling environment for harm reduction was rapidly worsening at the time of
the research, largely due to political change in Nepal. This trend emerged against the backdrop of
major shifts in drug policy in the region, and other countries’ initiatives to “declare war” on
PWUD. Up until this point, Youth Vision had worked extensively with government to maintain
opioid substitution therapy services and to ensure that drug rehabilitation and treatment were evi-
dence-based and non-coercive. At the completion of the case study, these eﬀorts were entering a
state of severe uncertainty.
Drawing in duty bearers and developing their capacity with a view to making them more respon-
sive as key actors in a social system that is discriminatory, even hostile to key populations, is a chal-
lenging endeavour. The researchers observed how, in a context of repressive legal environments, the
four case study organisations carefully planned any encounter with or training for duty bearers. Stra-
tegic use was made of capacity development interventions to draw duty bearers into the pro-
gramme and oﬀer them something personal in return: new knowledge and skills. The example of
Youth Vision is used as an illustration here, while similar situations were also seen in the other
case studies, of how all these carefully crafted investments can rapidly be undone and undermine
the achievement of the programme as a whole. There is limited control over external variables,

such as these, but the existence of a reciprocal relationship with duty bearers was observed to form
an important element in the risk mitigation strategies of partners.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to assist an Alliance of global development actors in identifying eﬀective
capacity development strategies that would enable the CSOs participating in the programme to
secure the health and human rights of key populations. These were individuals and groups
largely from socially excluded populations living in complex and often hostile legal and socio-cul-
tural contexts. Capacity was initially conceived in the realm of organisations acquiring, sustaining,
and “unleashing” power, agency, and legitimacy in order to bring about structural change. As the
research unfolded, a broader, more situated conceptualisation of capacity across four main
domains became more relevant and useful for analysing the nature and extent of the change-
oriented results of the programme. This suggested the idea of a well-capacitated sector that,
through its collective power, agency, or legitimacy, can achieve structural change, inclusive of,
but moving beyond, organisations alone. Capacity development interventions involved diﬀerent
forms of empowering actions, starting from individuals in communities and reaching as far as
duty-bearers that manage or inﬂuence structural relations such that they either enable or impede
the realisation of the sexual health and rights for the programme’s focus populations.
The research ﬁndings reinforce the situated nature of capacity and capacity development and
how their meaning and what they achieve in terms of important development results can only be
securely grasped through exploring experiences in particular contexts (Vallejo and Wehn2016).
The strong appeal of the CAS approach for thisﬁeld of enquiry lies in its attention tohow these
phenomena move, inﬂuence, and are being inﬂuenced by the interactions between individuals,
organisations, and the larger social system within which they unfold (McEvoy, Brady, and Munck
2016). Through this approach, the study was able to discern four domains that encapsulate, and
to an important degree, organise what the critical capacities are in relation to the programme’s
objectives. The utility of multiple domain conceptualisations to further unpack capacity in a given
context is also reﬂected in the literature, such as through the ﬁve capabilities model (Morgan
2006) and the three-levels approach to capacity development support (UNDP2009). Apart from
using them for analytic purposes, they also oﬀer opportunities to serve as an overarching frame
or as parameters to guide and track capacity development strategies.
The study set out to identifyeﬀective capacity development strategies that lead to durable pro-
grammatic gains. This initially suggested a result-based orientation, something that is common to
externally-funded development programmes where accountability and value-for-money are predo-
minant concerns. Theﬁndings modiﬁed this approach by oﬀering an alternative, more experientially
inﬂuenced view of eﬀectiveness (leaning towards Earl et al.’s( 2001) “improved rather than proved”
eﬀectiveness). What is important from theﬁndings is not so much an objectively deﬁned set of
capacity development strategies that can produce eﬀective results but rather a set of experiential
learnings illustrating how some commonly employed capacity development strategies can contrib-
ute to organisational and social level achievements along various pathways which require retrospec-
tive analyses through techniques like outcomes harvesting.
The question of what encompasses“evidence” as
we try and link capacity gains to programmatic
results is as important for researchers involved in thisﬁeld as for development practitioners. It
requires, as programmes are being designed, some sense of direction on the anticipated capacity
needs and pathway(s) for capacity development in view of programme results, especially if the pro-
gramme brings together diﬀerent global actors in one Alliance. If this is not in place, there is a risk of
oﬀering interventions that are not underpinned by a shared programme logic, adding further
diﬃculties to locating their beneﬁts in highly dynamic programme environments. Such articulation
remains compatible with the emergent nature of learning within programmes seeking to drive social
change as long as it avoids the reductionist approach of output driven support. There will inevitably
546 C. J. AANTJES ET AL.
<<<PAGE=13>>>
be a tension for programmes like Bridging the Gaps betweenﬂexible approaches to capacity devel-
opment that allow for endogenous and emergent learning while, at the same time, being required
by funders to measure and document some form of result. The approach of working with broader
parameters or domains, and allowing partner organisations to deﬁne and track their own process
of learning and achieving signiﬁcant change may be one way to manage such tension.
Across the diﬀerent data sources, some discernible results could be observed in the health, social,
and legal environments of the focus populations, even if the connections between capacity devel-
opment support, achieved capacity, and these important programmatic results could not beﬁrmly
established. Several results were described in this paper, for example, how the stronger capacity of
key population members led them to initiate and sustain positive change for themselves as well as
collectively, and drew the attention of policy makers. With regard to practice-orientedﬁndings,
experiences of the case study organisations suggest the following approaches to capacity develop-
ment thatﬁt well within aﬂexible approach. All of them have been identiﬁed elsewhere in similar
research on capacity development support in complex contexts:
. Use of an interactive approach to capacity assessment leading to user-deﬁned and“owned” pri-
orities for capacity development support. Capacity development is most eﬀective when it builds
on what exists and when it is owned and led by those seeking to improve their capacity (see also
Pearson 2011; Ika and Donnelly2017).
. A co-learning, risk-sharing approach to capacity development, innovation, and change. Organis-
ational development trajectories that cover the full range of organisational needs and extend over
a longer period of time, with allowance for emergent needs, achieve greater gains in capacity
development. So too do relationships between organisations and their technical partners and
funders that are built on mutual support, risk-sharing and co-learning (see also Girgis2007;D e
Grauwe 2009; Datta, Shaxson, and Pellini2012).
. Use of peer-to-peer learning and exchange mechanisms. This is a widely used approach whereby
individuals and organisations are encouraged to actively support each other’s learning processes,
undertake joint problem solving, and mentor one another, all within a context of explicitly or
implicitly understood shared experience and identity (see also Pearson2011; Thol et al.2012;
Sadhu et al.2014).
As a way forward, the study suggests clarifying at the start the embedded role of capacity develop-
ment in generating sustainable, longer term programmatic results and pursuing regular reﬂections
and documentation with partner organisations on which modalities or approaches improve the pro-
gramme’s effectiveness more than others.
Limitations
The study encountered several limitations. One pertained to outcome harvesting which relies on
people’s readiness to reﬂect on both positive and negative aspects of capacity or performance
and on the outcomes substantiation by people external to the organisation who are not necessarily
privy to how acquired capacity was unleashed to accomplish programmatic results. Hence, substan-
tiation relied primarily on the evidence generated from the case study organisations and their
funding partner(s), which aﬀects study validity. We employed several strategies to mitigate for
this, such as applying mixed methods, deep probing, and creation of a non-threatening environment
(e.g. focus groups without senior management) to elicit responses.
For the substantiation diﬀerent types of data were collected and analysed, including programme
documents containing evidence relevant to the outcomes. In a number of instances, written docu-
mentation was diﬃcult to obtain and led to a potential over-reliance on verbal accounts through key
informant interviews whereby some claims proved diﬃcult to independently verify.
DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 547
<<<PAGE=14>>>
The case study and survey components spanned several global regions and numerous countries.
The research team worked in English and relied on translations of interviews and document sum-
maries from Buganda, Nepalese, and Russian. As a result, context and nuance may have been lost.
We tried to mitigate against this by building in reﬂexive cycles in the data analysis and interpretation
in each of the case study teams in which both the local researchers and implicated staﬀ members
mastered these languages and were well embedded in the research context
Lastly, the researchﬁndings described in this paper are to a large extent based on four organis-
ational case studies, which limit the generalisability of the research beyond these particular contexts.
However, across the cases some common trends and patterns emerged which could support learn-
ing in other organisational and country contexts.
Conclusion
The study has oﬀered a comprehensive analysis of capacity and capacity development in the context
of a unique global programme that supports a broad diversity of populations, organisations, and
interventions. It has also illustrated how a longer-term partnership of trust, shared learning and
risk-taking was an important enabler for organisational growth and for the achievement of the pro-
gramme’s goal of securing the health and rights of key populations within complex country contexts.
It is clear that capacity development in pursuit of social change is a complex area of research in which
diﬀerent methodologies have been tried and tested to trace change processes that are partly inim-
ical to the gaze of the researcher. The important conceptual debates around this topic will continue,
and will become richer to the extent that they can draw on experiential studies such as this one
which attempt to examine and situate the theoretical complexities within rich descriptions of
how capacity development unfolds in global programmes. The study makes a contribution to
grounding the larger research enterprise while also being of practical value to development prac-
titioners by highlighting good practices from theﬁeld.
