Abstract: Adaptive workplace outcomes, such as employee work engagement, job performance, and
satisfaction are positively associated with physical and psychological well-being, while maladaptive
workplace outcomes, including work-related disengagement, dissatisfaction, stress, boredom, fatigue,
and burnout, are negatively associated with well-being. Researchers have applied self-determination
theory to identify key motivational correlates of these adaptive work-related determinants and
outcomes. Research applying the theory has consistently indicated that autonomous forms of
motivation and basic psychological need satisfaction are related to better employee performance,
satisfaction, and engagement, while controlled forms of motivation and need frustration are associated
with increased employee burnout and turnover. Forms of motivation have also been shown to mediate
relations between need satisfaction and adaptive workplace outcomes. Despite support for these
associations, a number of limitations in research in the field have been identified, which place limits
on the inferences that can be drawn. Noted limitations encompass an over-reliance on single-occasion,
correlational data; few fit-for-purpose tests of theory mechanisms; and a lack of consideration of key
moderating variables. In the current conceptual review, we discuss these limitations in turn, with
specific reference to examples from the extant research applying the theory in workplace contexts,
and provide a series of recommendations we expect will set the agenda for future studies applying
the theory in the workplace. Based on our review, we make three key recommendations: we stress
the need for studies adopting experimental and longitudinal designs to permit better inferences
(i.e., causal and directional), highlight the need for intervention research to explicitly test mediation
effects to provide evidence for theory mechanisms, and outline some candidate moderators of theory
effects, including workplace context, job type, pay structure, and causality orientations. We expect
these recommendations to set an agenda for future research applying self-determination theory in
workplace contexts with a view to filling the current evidence gaps and improving evidential quality.

1. Introduction
Employees’ work engagement and job satisfaction are positively associated with their
workplace productivity and reduced absenteeism [ 1,2] and negatively associated with
stress, boredom, fatigue, and burnout [ 3–6]. In addition, employees reporting positive
mental and physical health are more likely to be productive and less likely to disengage
from work tasks or seek employment elsewhere [7,8]. In contrast, employees who work
long hours or regularly feel under stress at work can experience burnout, reduced work
engagement, and impaired job performance, which can impact productivity [9,10].
Employers and workplace leaders, therefore, recognize the value of developing inter-
ventions in the workplace aimed at promoting the use of key strategies and behaviors that

promote employee work engagement and satisfaction and reduce disengagement and dis-
satisfaction. This is predicated on evidence indicating that employees who are motivated to
engage in these strategies and behaviors may be more likely to stay engaged in their work,
improving their overall job performance and work satisfaction [11–13]. Innovative work
behaviors, creativity, idea-sharing, and service represent candidate workplace behaviors
that have been identified as having the potential to promote work engagement and job
satisfaction. For instance, employees who engage in team-based idea-sharing may feel a
sense of peer relatedness and inspiration from their team members, which may influence
their engagement in relevant work tasks and improve overall workplace productivity and
individual-level job satisfaction [14,15]. Ultimately, workplace success is associated with
these adaptive workplace behaviors, as well as job satisfaction, work engagement, and job
performance, and is negatively associated with turnover and burnout [12–15].
In order to develop interventions that optimally enhance the uptake of these behaviors
in the workforce, employers and leaders need to first identify the motivational determinants
of these strategies and behaviors. Theories of motivation from psychological behavior
change research may assist in identifying these determinants and may help guide the con-
tent of interventions aimed at promoting employee success and adaptive outcomes [16–21].
Prominent among these theories is self-determination theory, a pre-eminent theory of
motivation that describes how forms of motivation relate to outcomes, functioning, and
behavior [22]. In particular, the theory emphasizes the quality of motivation and the
satisfaction of basic psychological needs as key mechanisms that are likely to enhance
motivation and future persistence in behaviors. The theory has been adopted in many
contexts, including the workplace, to identify the motivational determinants of behaviors
likely to promote adaptive outcomes across contexts and the mechanisms involved [23,24].
Specifically, correlational research applying the theory in workplace contexts has
identified forms of self-endorsed or autonomous motivation—a key adaptive form of
motivation that is central to self-determination theory and reflects engaging in tasks for
self-endorsed reasons [25]—and the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, particularly
the need for autonomy, as key mechanisms that mediate the adoption of strategies and
behaviors that lead to adaptive outcomes, like job engagement and satisfaction (e.g., task
creativity or knowledge sharing) [26–29]. In order to encourage their employees to engage
in these types of behaviors that ultimately promote workplace success and productivity,
employers need to create environments that support these forms of motivation and need
satisfaction in their employees. The theory predicts that it is the creation of a social
environment or motivational climate by employers and workplace leaders that can foster
and scaffold motivation and need satisfaction in their employees with respect to these
behaviors. Specifically, it is employers’ adoption of autonomy-supportive behaviors that
is proposed to create such a climate. Autonomy-supportive behaviors include providing
employees with choice in task engagement, giving a rationale for assigned work-related
tasks, and allowing employees to voice their opinions and have a say in how tasks are
performed [30]. This proposition is supported by research indicating that interventions in
which social agents display behaviors that promote greater choice, autonomous reasons,
and responsibility and ownership in the workplace lead to greater employee engagement
and satisfaction and do so by enhancing autonomous forms of motivation [31].
In the current conceptual review, we outline and critically discuss research that has
applied self-determination theory in workplace contexts, identify key methodological and
conceptual limitations of this research, and outline a research agenda to address these
limitations. Our approach follows similar conceptual reviews of research applying self-
determination theory in specific contexts, comprising an overview of current work followed
by commentary, analysis, and recommendations regarding issues or limitations emerging
from the overview [32–34]. We begin by critically reviewing research identifying the moti-
vational determinants of key workplace behaviors and outcomes (e.g., job performance,
work engagement, and job satisfaction) and research on interventions based on the theory
to promote the adoption of key behavioral strategies aimed at promoting workplace out-

comes. The review focuses on prior primary research applying self-determination theory
in workplace contexts, particularly research referred to in leading conceptual, systematic,
and meta-analytic reviews in this context [ 26,29,35] and key primary studies that have
been published since [ 13,36]. Our focus on these contributions functions to effectively
summarize trends in research applying the theory and, importantly, to identify method-
ological and conceptual limitations present in the extant research that affect the quality of
the findings and the extent of the inferences that can be drawn from them and evaluate
whether researchers have sought to address them. Such research has demonstrated support
for associations among constructs from self-determination theory and workplace outcomes
but has called for increased sophistication in research methods in the area [37]. There have
also been observations on the over-reliance on correlational data and methods in extant
research that limit the key inferences, such as directionality and causality. Accordingly,
these reviews serve as the basis for identifying limitations and gaps in the current evidence
and provide an evidential basis for recommendations for future research aimed at resolving
these limitations and addressing these evidence gaps.
Specifically, we start by providing an overview of self-determination theory and its
evidential basis and summarize prior work applying the theory in workplace contexts, par-
ticularly the established patterns of associations between theory constructs and workplace
behaviors and outcomes. Next, we identify several key limitations and evidence gaps in the
reviewed research applying the theory in workplace contexts, including an over-reliance on
correlational data, the dearth of mechanism tests, particularly in workplace interventions
based on the theory, and a lack of tests of key moderators. In doing so, we make reference
to both initial and current primary research in this context, with a specific focus on research
identified in key prior reviews that have signaled the extent to which these issues are
prevalent in the research and studies that have since attempted to address them. Based
on the review of this research, we provide recommendations to address these limitations,
including the adoption of cross-lagged panel and experimental designs that afford means
to infer directional and causal effects, tests of intervention mechanisms of action, and
tests of moderators of theory motivational constructs on workplace outcomes to identify
the contextual factors on which theory effects are dependent. We cite studies that have
employed these proposed designs as exemplars that researchers might consider addressing
these limitations and gaps in workplace research. These proposed designs are aimed at
promoting greater precision in research, broadening knowledge on direction and causation
in theory effects and how interventions based on the theory affect behavior and outcome
change in the workplace, and identifying when the theory is likely to be most effective
in accounting or variance in workplace outcomes. We expect these recommendations to
form an agenda for future research applying the theory in this context and inform future
practice, such as the development of interventions to promote better workplace outcomes
among employees.
1.1. Self-Determination Theory
Self-determination theory makes a global distinction betweenautonomous and controlled
forms of motivation, both of which reflect qualitative differences in motivation and eschew
the sole focus on motivation intensity offered in other theories [ 38,39]. Autonomous
motivation reflects acting or performing tasks for self-determined reasons, such as the
inherent interest or enjoyment derived from the behavior or task or because it aligns with
personally valued goals [38]. In contrast, controlled motivation reflects acting or performing
tasks for externally referenced reasons or contingencies (e.g., rewards and praise) or out of
perceived obligation or pressure from external social agents (e.g., authority figures) [38]. The
type of motivation experienced by individuals engaged in behaviors or tasks is important
because it is likely to determine the extent to which they will persist with the behavior or
task over time and experience parallel salient affective (e.g., positive or negative emotion),
psychological (e.g., psychological well-being or distress), and interpersonal (e.g., harmonic

or disharmonic personal relations) outcomes arising from the performance of the behavior
or task.
A further important premise of the theory is that the forms of motivation individuals
experience when performing behaviors or tasks are determined by the extent to which
doing so satisfies their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and related-
ness. The need for autonomy is defined as individuals’ need to experience their actions
performed out of their own volition and choice and consistent with their genuine sense
of self. The need for competence represents individuals’ need to gain a sense of agency
and effectance when performing actions [ 40]. The need for relatedness represents indi-
viduals’ need to feel supported, accepted, and affiliated with those in the social context
in which actions are performed. According to the theory, the potential for a behavior or
task to satisfy individuals’ psychological needs serves to determine whether they will
experience autonomous or controlled reasons for performing the behavior or task and the
extent to which they will experience concomitant outcomes associated with that form of
motivation [41]. Further, theorists have outlined the processes by which psychological
need satisfaction relates to behavior or task performance and the experience of associated
outcomes. Specifically, psychological need satisfaction may be associated with behavioral
persistence and adaptive outcomes through their effects on the forms of motivation ex-
perienced when acting. Specifically, the extent to which individuals perceive a task or
action will satisfy their psychological needs will determine the form of motivation they will
experience when performing the task or acting and, therefore, the extent to which they are
likely to persist with the task or behavior and experience concomitant adaptive outcomes,
including well-being and life satisfaction [39,41].
The theoretically stipulated relations between the perceived need satisfaction of tasks
and behaviors, the forms of motivation experienced when performing the tasks and behav-
iors, and the outcomes experienced provide a potential avenue for interventions aimed
at increasing task and behavioral engagement. Specifically, theorists have suggested that
creating behavioral contexts or environments that support individuals’ psychological needs
is likely to promote greater behavioral persistence and adaptive outcomes and reduce
maladaptive or dysfunctional outcomes. This can be achieved through social agents who
are adept at enhancing the need-satisfying aspects of behaviors and downplaying the
controlling contingencies. For example, studies have shown that interventions that train
social agents to display sets of behaviors that support or foster the psychological needs of
subordinates ultimately lead to increased behavioral persistence and adaptive outcomes
in those subordinates in multiple contexts and for numerous behaviors [40,42]. When the
need-satisfying aspects of a behavior or task are emphasized for individuals, and they
perceive it to be satisfying their psychological needs, they are more likely to internalize the
behavior or task as one that is need-satisfying and, in turn, will tend to cite autonomous
reasons for performing it [43].
Self-determination theory has been widely applied to predict the forms of motivation
adopted and behavioral, affective, psychological, and interpersonal outcomes in multiple
behaviors, populations, and contexts, including educational, social, health, and, impor-
tantly, occupational and workplace contexts [23,24,44]. Beyond support for the associations
between autonomous forms of motivation, need satisfaction, and adaptive outcomes, there
has also been research testing the specific theory-derived mechanisms that underpin these
associations. For example, the research has indicated that need satisfaction is linked to
perceived need support from social agents, experiences of the tasks or behaviors as au-
tonomously motivated, and the expression of adaptive outcomes [45,46]. These associations
have also been proposed as reflecting the process by which support for needs relates to
outcomes. Ryan et al. [47] formally specified a generalized process model that summarizes
these key processes derived from self-determination theory, and similar models have been
proposed and tested elsewhere [23,48]. Such models propose that perceived need support
and need satisfaction with respect to a task or behavior will be related to behavioral persis-
tence and associated outcomes through the mediation of the type of motivation experienced

when performing the task of behavior [23,47,49]. For clarity, these proposed relations are
illustrated in Figure 1. Numerous primary studies and meta-analytic research have pro-
vided support for these mediation models in numerous behavioral contexts, including the
proposed indirect effects of need satisfaction and perceived need support on behavior and
associated outcomes through the mediation of the form of motivation adopted [23,47,50].
This research has provided qualified support for a process by which need support and
satisfaction relate to experienced forms of motivation and behavioral performance and the
concomitant outcomes.

models have been proposed and tested elsewhere [23,48]. Such models propose that per-
ceived need support and need satisfaction with respect to a task or behavior will be related 
to behavioral persistence and associated outc omes through the mediation of the type of 
motivation experienced when performing the task of behavior [23,47,49]. For clarity, these 
proposed relations are illustrated in Figure 1. Numerous primary studies and meta-ana-
lytic research have provided support for these mediation models in numerous behavioral 
contexts, including the proposed indirect e ﬀects of need satisfaction and perceived need 
support on behavior and associated outcomes through the mediation of the form of moti-
vation adopted [23,47,50]. This research has provided quali ﬁed support for a process by 
which need support and satisfaction relate to experienced forms of motivation and behav-
ioral performance and the concomitant outcomes.

1.2. Self-Determination Theory and Workplace Outcomes 
Correlational research applying self-determination theory in workplace contexts has 
indicated that autonomous forms of motiva tion in the workplace are associated with 
greater work engagement and job satisfaction and reduced stress and burnout [48,51,52]. 
Studies have also demonstrated that workers who cite autonomous reasons for perform-
ing work-related actions and tasks displayed more employee communication and men-
toring behaviors [53] and had higher levels of job satisfaction [54]. On the other hand, 
individuals who cite controlled reasons for performing tasks and behaviors, such as mon-
etary or verbal rewards, report lower levels of work engagement and job satisfaction 
[55,56]. Importantly, and consistent with a key premise of the theory, there is evidence 
that the satisfaction of psychological needs in the workplace is associated with autono-
mous forms of motivation with respect to work engagement, and need satisfaction is also 
associated with adaptive work outcomes, including better job performance, increased lev-
els of job satisfaction, and workplace engagement [35,57]. Similarly, there is research test-
ing Ryan et al.’s model in workplace contexts [35,47] contributing evidence on the mech-
anisms by which self-determination theory constructs relate to outcomes in the workplace 
and providing possible guidance to intervention or experimental research, which may

1.2. Self-Determination Theory and Workplace Outcomes
Correlational research applying self-determination theory in workplace contexts has
indicated that autonomous forms of motivation in the workplace are associated with
greater work engagement and job satisfaction and reduced stress and burnout [48,51,52].
Studies have also demonstrated that workers who cite autonomous reasons for performing
work-related actions and tasks displayed more employee communication and mentoring
behaviors [53] and had higher levels of job satisfaction [54]. On the other hand, individuals
who cite controlled reasons for performing tasks and behaviors, such as monetary or verbal
rewards, report lower levels of work engagement and job satisfaction [55,56]. Importantly,
and consistent with a key premise of the theory, there is evidence that the satisfaction of
psychological needs in the workplace is associated with autonomous forms of motivation
with respect to work engagement, and need satisfaction is also associated with adaptive
work outcomes, including better job performance, increased levels of job satisfaction, and
workplace engagement [ 35,57]. Similarly, there is research testing Ryan et al.’s model
in workplace contexts [ 35,47] contributing evidence on the mechanisms by which self-
determination theory constructs relate to outcomes in the workplace and providing possible
guidance to intervention or experimental research, which may further enable the inference
of temporal or causal effects within the theory, particularly in workplace contexts. There is,
however, a need for further model tests that move beyond correlational designs and permit
better inferences of causal effects.

1.3. Self-Determination Theory Interventions in the Workplace
The growing convergence of research findings supporting associations between con-
structs from self-determination theory, including need satisfaction and autonomous forms
of motivation and behavioral and other adaptive workplace outcomes, signals the potential
for the development of interventions based on the theory that promote adaptive behav-
ioral and psychological outcomes in this context. This may be through the adoption of
autonomy-supportive techniques (e.g., choice provision) by social agents in the workplace
(e.g., managers and supervisors) that may promote employees’ basic psychological needs
and autonomous motivation and, in doing so, lead to increased adoption of productive
work behaviors, including workplace creativity or task-sharing, which may promote better
workplace outcomes. These proposals have been supported by research applying the theory
in these contexts. Ryan et al.’s [47] generalized model has also been applied in workplace
settings to identify the processes by which constructs from self-determination theory, like
need support or autonomous motivation, relate to workplace behaviors and outcomes,
including job satisfaction and well-being [36,58]. Specifically, employees’ perceptions of
the extent to which their social agents in the workplace (e.g., employers, workplace leaders,
supervisors, authority figures, and mentors) support their autonomy has been shown to
be associated with adaptive workplace outcomes through increased autonomous forms of
motivation and reduced controlled forms of motivation [36,59,60]. Such mediation tests
provide preliminary evidence of the mechanism by which support for psychological needs
by employers relates to adaptive outcomes and behavioral persistence in employees. This
may signal possible constructs that could be targeted in interventions seeking to change
workplace outcomes using appropriate techniques, such as social agents in workplace
contexts offering employees need support.
In addition, studies have demonstrated that employees’ perceptions of their work envi-
ronment as being autonomy-supportive are related to their work behaviors (i.e., knowledge
sharing and creativity) and work outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction and work engagement).
Employees’ perceptions of the degree to which their work environment supports their three
basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness may be especially
important in the context of the theory [57]. For example, when employees perceive that the
office environment fostered by social agents in their workplace is supportive of their auton-
omy, they are more likely to engage in work-related behaviors autonomously, which may,
ultimately, lead to adaptive workplace outcomes [35]. Therefore, need support, particularly
autonomy support, has been identified as a key strategy that employers may adopt to
create environments in which their employees are more autonomously motivated toward
workplace actions and tasks. For instance, employers who support their employees’ relat-
edness by encouraging team members to share their perspectives may create environments
where employees collaborate more often, resulting in higher-quality task performance and
overall improved job satisfaction [61].
Based on this cumulative evidence, researchers have developed interventions in which
supervisors are trained to make their work environments more autonomy-supportive for
their employees [35], consistent with autonomy-support training programs based on the
theory developed in other contexts [62,63]. Interventions focused on supporting employees’
basic psychological needs through workplace leaders’ adoption of autonomy-supportive
strategies and behaviors (e.g., providing employees with choice, considering employee
perspectives, promoting responsibility and ownership over tasks, and limiting the use
of rewards and punishments) by workplace leaders have been effective in improving
adaptive workplace outcomes, such as improved job performance, job satisfaction, and
work engagement [35,60].
2. Limitations of Current Research Applying Self-Determination Theory in Workplace
Contexts
Despite generalized support for key predictions of self-determination theory in its
application in workplace contexts [31,36,51], inconsistencies in the effect sizes of relations
<<<PAGE=8>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 7 of 20
between the theory constructs and key outcomes in prior research and gaps in the current
research have been observed. Research expressly seeking to resolve these inconsistencies
and evidence gaps is needed to advance knowledge of the motivational bases of workplace
outcomes. Accordingly, in the next sections, we outline these key limitations based on the
extant literature, review research in the area [26,37,64], and provide recommendations for
future research in the application of self-determination theory in workplace contexts. We
focus on three key issues: (a) the excess use of correlational research designs that limit the
extent to which directional and causal effects among theory constructs can be inferred; (b)
the lack of mechanistic testing in interventions based on the theory; and (c) the potential
contextual and theoretical moderators that may impact the magnitude of the effects of
theory constructs on workplace outcomes.
With respect to the over-reliance on correlational data, while such designs have value
in that they provide indications that theory constructs and outcomes are related, they do not
permit inference of directional effects nor do they provide indications of how the constructs
themselves, or the relations among them, change over time. So, the use of correlational
data to support temporal or causal claims based on the theory ultimately falls short and
misrepresents study findings. In the current review, we suggest the adoption of forms of
longitudinal ‘panel’ research designs, including new implementations of these designs, such
as random intercept panel designs, which control for covariance and temporal stability, as a
potential solution to account for change in theory constructs and better enable researchers
to make inferences with respect to the direction in the effects or their reciprocity [65].
In terms of the need to test the mechanisms by which interventions based on the theory
impact change in behavior and outcomes in the workplace, we propose that researchers
need to augment their research designs to enable tests of their intervention mechanisms
of action. This entails including measures and design elements to intervention studies to
demonstrate that changes in targeted workplace outcomes as a result of the intervention
occur through the change or activation of the theory-based constructs involved [66–68]. The
value of identifying such research is that it provides verification that the putative theoretical
mechanism is responsible for the intervention effect. Although there is expanding literature
testing such mechanisms in the context of self-determination theory-based interventions in
other contexts [69], researchers have not routinely tested these mechanisms in workplace
contexts [70]. We outline the importance of testing these mechanisms of action of self-
determination theory-based interventions in the workplace and outline examples of study
designs that will address this research gap and elucidate how interventions ‘work’ in
changing behavior and outcomes.
Finally, inconsistencies in the observed size and pattern of effects of research applying
self-determination theory in workplace contexts may be attributable to methodological
artifacts, such as the sample size, study design, and lack of statistical power. These ar-
tifacts aside, the inconsistencies may also be attributable to conceptual- (e.g., the type
of organizational structure—authoritative or hierarchical as opposed to democratic and
‘flat’—and individual differences in self-determined orientations or ‘causality orientations’),
contextual- (e.g., worker level—blue-collar and white-collar workers), methodological (e.g.,
study design and quality and types of measure used), and sampling- (e.g., sample charac-
teristics, like gender and age, and type of worker) moderating variables. We propose that
researchers need to pay more consideration to these candidate moderators when conducting
workplace research based on theory. In doing so, we outline some key research directions
that may assist in resolving these inconsistencies, provide greater precision in the effects of
self-determination theory constructs on adaptive workplace behaviors (e.g., creativity and
knowledge sharing) and outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction and task performance), and identify
the conditions (e.g., organizational structure, job type, advancement opportunities, and
remote work options) and extraneous factors on which these relations are contingent with
a view of elucidating the boundary conditions of theory predictions [71,72]. Further, the
identification of moderators of the effect of self-determination theory-based interventions
<<<PAGE=9>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 8 of 20
on workplace behaviors and outcomes may also assist in outlining the conditions in which
interventions are more or less likely to be efficacious [73].
3. Moving on from a Focus on Correlational Study Designs
A substantive proportion of studies applying self-determination theory in workplace
contexts adopt correlational, single-occasion research designs. Many studies seek to test
hypotheses from the theory by measuring constructs, such as employee need satisfaction
and autonomous motivation, and examining their unique associations with concurrent
measures of behavior-related outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction, job performance, employee
turnover, and creativity) [35,57,59]. Studies employing such designs are useful in identify-
ing the size and variability of relations among constructs from self-determination theory
and workplace behaviors and outcomes and add to an evidence base of research supporting
theory-based relations in this context. However, such studies are also limited insofar as they
prohibit the inference of directionality (i.e., the order of variables in a proposed nomological
network) and causality (i.e., whether change in one variable affects change in another) in
effects. For example, correlations among theory constructs and outcomes do not provide in-
formation on the direction of the effect, i.e., does the theory construct precede the outcome,
or vice versa, or is the relation reciprocal? Nor do correlations inform whether a change
in the construct through, for example, an intervention or manipulation affects a change
in the outcome. Although other reviews have noted the reliance on correlational designs,
they have typically not provided direct suggestions on alternative research methods that
could be applied in research in workplace contexts to address the shortcomings of these
designs. Further, while there has been a greater adoption of alternative designs, there
is little evidence of a substantive shift, and the field still relies heavily on correlational
designs.
In addition, single-occasion correlational designs do not account for a change in vari-
ables over time, known as covariance stability, or whether an intraindividual change in
independent variables in a model over time is related to an intraindividual change in
other dependent variables in the model [74]. For instance, assessing relations between con-
structs from self-determination theory in the workplace (e.g., relations between employees’
perceived autonomy support from their supervisors and their need satisfaction and au-
tonomous motivation toward their work activities) only suggests that these variables share
variance. The theory may specify the direction of these effects (e.g., supervisor autonomy
support may precede need satisfaction and autonomous motivation), but correlational data
do not provide verification. Further, the nature of the relations between these constructs
may be more complex. For example, new information may come to light that alters one
or both of these constructs, which could affect their stability over time. Such variations
are not captured in studies testing these relations using single-occasion designs or even
in prospective designs in which antecedent and consequent or dependent constructs are
measured at different timepoints. Similarly, relations between the constructs may not be
solely unidirectional. For example, it is possible that the effects of perceived autonomy
support may not only influence psychological need satisfaction, but psychological need
satisfaction may also influence need support, known as a reciprocal pattern of effects and
indicative of a more dynamic process. Again, such effects cannot be inferred by studies
adopting single-occasion correlational designs, and an application of more sophisticated
longitudinal designs is needed to provide insight into these potential patterns of effect.
3.1. Longitudinal Tests and Panel Designs
One means to potentially test these directional effects over time while also accounting
for temporal stability and within-individual or intraindividual changes in theory constructs
over time is through the adoption of forms of cross-lagged panel research designs. Research
adopting these designs typically measures the variables of constructs of interest at multiple
timepoints and theory-determined associations among the variables within and across

effects by assisting in elucidating theory-specified directional or reciprocal effects while
simultaneously controlling for temporal stability. Although few studies have adopted such
designs to test predictions of self-determination theory applied to workplace contexts, there
is a precedence. For example, Galletta and colleagues [13] applied this design to investigate
relations between proactive work behavior, organizational commitment, and autonomous
and controlled forms of motivation at two timepoints. They found that the constructs
exhibited substantive temporal stability and identified directional but not reciprocal effects
of commitment on autonomous motivation and autonomous motivation on proactive work
behavior [13].
Studies such as this provide preliminary evidence for the constancy and directionality
of effects while controlling for stability over time, but there is a clear need for additional
studies utilizing this design to develop a cumulative evidence base in support of these
effects. It is important to note that panel designs have increased in complexity and sophisti-
cation in recent years to better allow the inference of directional effects while controlling
for multiple stability components [65]. For example, the adoption of random-intercepts
cross-lagged panel designs enables adequate control for both temporal stability and intra-
individual change, that is, change within individuals over time, which is a deficit of the
‘classic’ panel design. The application of these designs is, therefore, advocated to provide fit-
for-purpose tests of directional relations in applications of self-determination theory in the
workplace and may also elucidate more complex effects, such as reciprocal effects [75,76].
In addition, researchers should consider employing alternative longitudinal designs
to assist with other shortcomings associated with the existing research applying the theory
in the workplace. Studies do not typically examine the efficacy of the theory in predicting
workplace outcomes over extended time periods, that is, beyond a few months. The efficacy
of self-determination theory for a long-range explanation of workplace outcomes is an open
question. To address this, researchers may consider introducing longer periods between
initial and subsequent measures of constructs and salient workplace outcomes and examine
the moderators of these long-range effects. In addition, most longitudinal designs adopt a
relatively modest number of sampling occasions, which may not sufficiently capture how
theory constructs and outcomes vary between and within individuals over time. Resolution
may lie in the adoption of methods in which measures of constructs and outcomes are
taken with high frequency. For example, researchers have used ecological momentary
assessment or experience sampling in which data are collected on multiple occasions
across time (e.g., daily or even multiple times per day). Such research is more effective in
capturing intrapersonal variability in theory constructs in the workplace over time and its
association with predicting outcomes. While such approaches are rare, there are illustrative
examples that may represent good practice for future research. To illustrate, Hogenelst and
colleagues [77] conducted an ecological momentary assessment study examining the within-
and between-person effects of constructs from self-determination theory and workplace
outcomes. The results indicate that autonomous motivation was associated with daily job
performance but not satisfaction; however, these associations did not hold at the group
level [77]. More widespread adoption of designs that examine long-range prediction and
sample-theory constructs and outcomes with high frequency has substantive potential to
advance knowledge of the motivational antecedents of workplace outcomes, particularly
with respect to their reliability and the contribution of within- and between-individual
variability over time.
3.2. Experiments and Interventions
It is important to note that although studies adopting types of panel design permit
inferences of directional effects over time while controlling for change, they do not resolve
other key issues relating to theoretical inference, particularly the issue of causality, as the
data are still correlational. Researchers need to adopt other study designs to yield definitive
tests of causal relations among self-determination theory constructs and workplace behav-
iors and outcomes. Such designs include experimental and intervention designs in which
<<<PAGE=11>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 10 of 20
manipulations or intervention techniques are introduced to the workplace population of
interest (e.g., training leaders to provide autonomy support, providing workplace instruc-
tional messages that avoid controlling language) targeting change in self-determination
theory constructs (e.g., autonomous motivation and perceived need support) and the effects
of the intervention on subsequent dependent variables, such as workplace behaviors and
salient outcomes (e.g., job engagement, job satisfaction, and burnout) assessed relative
to a control or comparison group that does not receive the manipulation or intervention
content.
In the context of self-determination theory, it is generally elements of the environment,
such as the motivational climate engendered by leaders and salient others in authority,
which are the primary means to change behavior and subsequent outcomes by affecting
change in the mediating theory constructs (e.g., need satisfaction and the form of motivation
experienced). In recent years, researchers have begun to systematically identify the kinds
of techniques or strategies that leaders and other salient others in social contexts may adopt
to change behavior, and these techniques, as well as the training programs designed to
foster them in social agents, have generally been the focus of experimental or intervention
research aimed at changing behavior and outcomes using the theory [63,78–80]. Studies
adopting these types of design allow researchers to more effectively and definitively test
the causal effects of self-determination theory constructs on salient behavioral and other
work-related outcomes.
A growing evidence base exists testing the efficacy of interventions based on self-
determination theory on behaviors and outcomes in the workplace [ 64]. For example, a
study conducted in the context of a large Fortune 500 company demonstrated that training
managers to foster an autonomy-supportive workplace environment has significant effects
on the managers’ perceived autonomy support and, importantly, the need satisfaction,
autonomous motivation, and work engagement of their employees [31]. Managers trained
to display specific autonomy-supportive behaviors reported greater post-intervention
perceived autonomy support, while employees reported greater need satisfaction and were
more autonomously motivated and engaged in their work compared to employees whose
supervisors were not trained to adopt autonomy-supportive behaviors [31]. These types
of studies provide evidence of the effects of techniques designed to target key constructs
from self-determination theory (e.g., need satisfaction and autonomous motivation) on
key workplace behaviors and outcomes. Despite this growing body of experimental and
intervention research, the prevalence of these study designs pales next to non-experimental
research, and there is a need for further research to provide broader evidence examining
theory-based workplace interventions, particularly those that focus on different populations
and work contexts.
4. Testing Mechanisms of Action of Self-Determination Theory Predictions in the
Workplace
The aforementioned experimental and intervention research based on self-determination
theory lends support to the efficacy of the intervention techniques used on workplace be-
haviors and outcomes as well as on constructs representing the theory-based mechanisms
by which the intervention is purported to ‘work’ in changing behavior [ 66]. However,
they do not directly test the mechanisms of action of the intervention as specified by the
theory. Experimental and intervention designs have the potential for researchers to formally
confirm these mechanisms and provide important data on whether the manipulation or
intervention content affects changes in outcomes due to concomitant changes in the pro-
posed theory-based constructs through mediation analysis [67,68]. The value of specifying
and testing the mechanisms of action of theory-based behavior change interventions is
important as it allows researchers to determine exactly how interventions work in enacting
behavior change according to theory specification. Importantly, data on the proposed
mechanism of action accumulates for interventions adopting the same techniques and
mechanism across contexts, behaviors, and populations, and researchers will gain insight
<<<PAGE=12>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 11 of 20
into the conditions that determine whether or not these theory-based interventions are
likely to be efficacious [81].
Given that interventions based on the theory do not routinely test these mechanisms of
action, researchers should consider adopting appropriate study designs to do so. Designing
such studies is an elaborate process necessitating identification, operationalization, and
implementation of the means or methods to change behavior through changes in the
theory-based constructs purported to be responsible for the change [ 66–68,82]. Studies
need to show that interventions designed to target change in behavior based on a theory
should not only lead to changes in the behavioral outcomes of interest but also exact
concomitant changes in the measures of the psychological constructs implicated in the
mechanism [67]. This necessitates identifying and explicitly specifying the mechanism, that
is, the constructs that, according to the theory, need to change in order to exact a change
in behavior and the behavior change methods or techniques likely to lead to change in
those constructs [83,84]. It also requires the selection of appropriate methods to deliver the
methods to the population of interest, develop measures of the behavioral outcome [85]
and the constructs implicated in the specified mechanism [83,84], and adopt an appropriate
design (e.g., experimental or randomized controlled intervention design) with appropriate
measures and analytic strategies to test the mechanism [66–68].
While there is an emerging trend to test intervention mechanisms of action in research
adopting other theories of behavior change, there is still an acknowledgment that such
tests are not yet the norm [ 70]. Testing these mechanisms of action in studies applying
self-determination theory is also rare, particularly in the workplace context. However, the
number of tests of intervention mechanisms of action based on the theory is increasing,
particularly in the health domain. For example, Sheeran et al. [ 86] conducted a meta-
analytic synthesis of research adopting randomized controlled designs testing the efficacy
of theory-based techniques on behavioral outcomes in the health domain with concomitant
changes in constructs representing the mechanisms of action to establish the appropriate
mediating effects. The research demonstrated that interventions adopting intervention
techniques targeting changes in autonomous motivation and perceived competence led
to adaptive changes in health behavior and, critically, that the effects of these interven-
tions were mediated by changes in the requisite constructs stipulated in the theory. This
research represents an important step forward in evaluating the mechanisms of action
and provides robust evidence to support two key mechanisms. That said, the research
still has its limitations, as there were insufficient data to provide comprehensive evidence
on the potential moderators of these mechanisms. However, as the research in the field
accumulates, such moderating effects can be elucidated through similar syntheses that
evaluate the mechanisms at different levels of the key moderator variables.
Research testing the mechanisms of action of the kind conducted in the health domain
is needed in applied self-determination theory research in workplace contexts. Importantly,
there is a need for studies to examine the effects of self-determination theory techniques
(e.g., training workplace leaders to display need supportive behaviors) on subsequent
changes in the adoption and maintenance of key behaviors in employees (e.g., creativity,
collaboration, and knowledge sharing) and relevant adaptive outcomes (e.g., work engage-
ment, job satisfaction, and job performance) and, critically, concomitant changes in the
theory constructs implicated in the mechanisms of action (e.g., perceived need support and
autonomous motivation). As the research evidence accumulates, researchers will be able to
build a database of efficacious self-determination theory-based intervention in this context
as well as begin to elucidate the potential conditions in which these intervention effects and
mechanisms are likely to operate, such as population characteristics and types of behavior
and outcome.
5. Candidate Moderators of Self-Determination Theory Predictions
Although research applying self-determination theory in workplace contexts has of-
fered insight into the motivational correlates of workplace behaviors and outcomes[31,36,51]
<<<PAGE=13>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 12 of 20
and has provided possible indicators of intervention techniques and methods that work-
place leaders can adopt to change behavior and outcomes in these contexts, the size or
‘strength’ of these effects varies considerably across studies. Such variability may be at-
tributable to the different behaviors, contexts, and populations targeted in these studies or
the presence or absence of other conceptual or theoretical constructs that moderate study
effects. Although some studies have examined the effect of various moderators (e.g., flow
and autonomy-supportive environments) on the relations between constructs from self-
determination theory and workplace outcomes [35], the formal testing of how theory effects
vary according to these candidate moderators may provide further elucidation of the extent
to which theory effects are generalizable or assist in identifying the auxiliary assumptions
or boundary conditions on which they depend [87,88]. Researchers have also suggested
the need to consider moderators when testing and evaluating the mechanisms of action
of theory-based interventions to identify the extent to which mechanisms apply across
contexts and other conditions that may affect when theoretical mechanisms operate [67].
In order to elucidate these potential moderating effects, researchers should seek to
adopt appropriate study designs in which theory effects are tested at different levels of the
identified moderator variables. For example, researchers may adopt experimental or quasi-
experimental designs in which specific study or sample moderators are manipulated or
varied and their effects on relations between theory constructs and behavior and outcomes
investigated. Researchers could alternatively adopt designs that provide comparator
groups defined by levels of key moderators. An additional means to test moderator effects
is through research synthesis, such as a meta-analysis, where the effect sizes among study
constructs or model constructs can be compared between groups of studies classified
according to levels of a moderator.
Numerous variables may serve to moderate the effects of self-determination theory
constructs on outcomes in the workplace. Prime candidates may be environmental factors,
such as workplace context, employee hierarchy, or workplace opportunities for advance-
ment. For instance, opportunities for advancement or promotion may moderate the effects
of need support on workplace outcomes. The impact of autonomy support on work en-
gagement may be diminished in employees who see no room for professional advancement
or promotion in their workplace compared to individuals with ample opportunities for
growth. Individual-level constructs may also be key moderators, including personal in-
terests, passion for work or the job, and goal orientations. For example, an employee’s
perception that their job is aligned with their personally endorsed goals may act as a mod-
erator of these relationships. The effect of perceived need support on job satisfaction may
be increased in employees whose jobs are aligned with their personal interests compared
to those for whom there is a misalignment. Moderator tests may, therefore, assist further
in elucidating the processes by which constructs from self-determination theory relate to
workplace outcomes, and researchers should identify and test moderators that are likely
relevant to the workplace and employment context of interest.
Next, we discuss some candidate environmental (i.e., work context, job type, and
pay structure) and conceptual (i.e., causality orientation) variables expected to moderate
self-determination theory effects in workplace contexts. We provide the conceptual basis of
the moderator effects and their theoretical importance and suggestions on how researchers
might go about testing them. We also provide some examples of research testing these
moderators that serve as examples that future researchers may follow when testing these
and other moderators of the theory when applied in this context. It is important to note that
the variables identified here represent only a selection of potential moderators. Theorists
and researchers should be encouraged to identify and test further candidate moderators
using similar research designs to the examples reviewed here in order to build a database
of conditions likely to affect theory effects in their workplace contexts.
<<<PAGE=14>>>

5.1. Work Context: Flexible Work Practices
The work environment is likely to be a candidate moderator of self-determination
theory effects. A prominent example is the advent of flexible work practices adopted by
some organizations as an alternative to traditional office work. Recent trends in workforce
practices have meant that workers have been provided with greater flexibility over where
and when they work, such as flexible work hours, the opportunity to work at home, or
split time between an office or other workplace context and home. Beyond the general shift
toward these flexible work patterns to reduce commuting time and promote better quality
of life and work-life balance, events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic led to these practices
being adopted more broadly due to mandated quarantine and stay-at-home orders [89].
These kinds of workplace practices may be important in the context of the application
of self-determination theory for a number of reasons. For example, employees who work
from home may experience greater autonomy and need satisfaction than those who work
in traditional office settings. While this flexibility may afford a greater degree of taking
ownership and responsibility to facilitate autonomous motivation, work flexibility may
also interact or work in tandem with other practices, including workplace training. For
instance, workers offered flexibility but without training to provide them with competence
in managing their work according to their own schedule may experience need frustration
instead of satisfaction. Conversely, employees who work in an office setting may experience
higher levels of relatedness than those who work remotely, as employees working remotely
are less likely to feel a sense of belonging or being a part of a team, which has been shown
to decrease job performance [90]. Therefore, the workplace environment may impact the
extent to which individuals perceive their psychological needs have been satisfied, which,
consistent with theory predictions, would be expected to impact their motivation to engage
in productive workplace behaviors and ultimately achieve successful work outcomes. Thus,
the workplace context may be an important moderator of theory effects in the workplace,
and designing studies to test these predictions may provide important information for
employers considering the effects of flexible work practices or work-from-home options on
employee motivation and outcomes.
5.2. Job Type: Blue-Collar vs. White-Collar Jobs
Another potential moderating variable is job type. Specifically, the strength of the
relationships between constructs from self-determination theory, such as the association
between psychological need satisfaction and workplace behaviors and outcomes, may vary
according to whether the target population is employed in blue-collar or white-collar jobs.
Blue-collar jobs typically refer to jobs in trade industries that require physical skill, expertise,
or labor, while white-collar jobs typically refer to jobs in professional or semi-professional
corporate settings [ 91]. Due to the pervasive differences in job trajectory, managerial
structures, levels of responsibility demanded, and corporate oversights inherent in these
types of jobs, this contextual difference may affect the effects of self-determination theory
constructs on outcomes in the workplace.
More specifically, an individual’s job type may interact with their work environment
to support or thwart basic psychological need satisfaction, which may impact work en-
gagement and outcomes. In some cases, job type may not alter theory effects. For example,
workers in both blue- and white-collar jobs could have their competence enhanced when
given the opportunity to master new skills in the workplace. In contrast, differences in
theory effects across job types may be observed. Take, for example, the extent to which
these different job types likely offer opportunities for workers to take ownership of work
tasks. Blue-collar workers may have less flexibility, say, and control over their tasks and
may, therefore, not have the opportunities to have a say to provide input into the tasks they
perform, and their tasks may be largely determined by their manager or another agent in
the workplace. Such experiences may undermine employees’ psychological needs, which
may lead to reduced adaptive workplace outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction and performance)
and increased maladaptive outcomes (e.g., stress and burnout) [92]. Alternatively, employ-
<<<PAGE=15>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 14 of 20
ees in positions that offer greater responsibility may have greater control, flexibility, and say
in their job, which provides them with more opportunities for need satisfaction that may
lead to better work-related outcomes. Job type may, therefore, moderate the effects of need
satisfaction on workplace outcomes. This may signal to employers that interventions aimed
at supporting basic psychological needs in the workplace, such as providing opportunities
to take ownership and have a say in tasks and workplace practices, may be especially
pertinent among workers employed in blue-collar jobs.
5.3. Pay Structure: Performance-Based Pay vs. Regular Salary
Pay structure is another notable variable that may moderate relations between self-
determination theory constructs and workplace behaviors and outcomes. Specifically,
employees who work for a commission or on other performance-related pay structures
may be motivated differently than employees who receive an hourly wage or those who
receive a salary. Understanding how motivation may differ across workers under these
types of pay structures may affect the extent of individuals’ need satisfaction and their
subsequent motivation, behavior, and work-related outcomes.
Specifically, the way that pay structure interacts with the work environment or leader-
ship style may impact how employees perceive need support in the workplace. Although
pay inherently incentivizes work performance, autonomous motivation can be enhanced or
undermined in either pay structure. For example, the type of feedback offered to accompany
a paycheck may act as the determining factor in how pay either supports or undermines
autonomous motivation. If pay is presented as contingent on performance alone, it is likely
to undermine autonomous motivation [ 93,94]. However, if pay is presented as merely
indicative of workplace success in conjunction with progress toward more autonomous
or self-endorsed goals (e.g., a supervisor indicating that the commission is because the
worker is improving their skills in marketing the product or is achieving a personally set
target) then receiving pay is likely to enhance autonomous motivation. In addition, some
pay structures may more readily lend themselves to providing informational feedback (e.g.,
bonuses or commission-based positions), which may give employers a greater opportunity
to intervene with a message about improvement than a regular wage.
Acknowledging how different environments present varied opportunities for au-
tonomy support via the differentiation in pay structures may provide researchers with
information about key targets for interventions aimed at bolstering autonomous moti-
vation in the workplace. Furthermore, pay structure may impact how variables from
self-determination theory work in the context of the proposed model. For example, for
individuals whose environment or pay structure influences their perception of their psy-
chological needs being met, their motivation and consequent engagement in workplace
behaviors may be impacted. However, pay structure may not be the only incentive-related
moderator of these relationships. For instance, employee prestige, opportunities for promo-
tion and advancement, and consistency with one’s interests may all represent work context
characteristics that have the potential to act as moderators. Researchers should consider
how worker or employer characteristics, including pay structure or other employee moti-
vators, moderate the effects of constructs (e.g., perceived autonomy support and feedback
from employers) on workplace behaviors and outcomes.
5.4. Causality Orientations
Intrapersonal variables (i.e., personality traits and individual differences) may also
serve to moderate the effects of self-determination theory constructs on behavior and
outcomes in the workplace. Causality orientations, the degree to which individuals per-
ceive events around them to emanate from themselves or external events [16,95], may be a
prime candidate moderator. Individuals who score highly on scales measuring autonomy
causality orientation are more likely to interpret the actions or behaviors of others in their
environment or external contingencies as need supportive and autonomously motivating,
while those who score highly on control causality orientation are more likely to interpret
<<<PAGE=16>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 15 of 20
the actions of others or environmental contingencies or unsupportive of their needs and
extrinsically motivating. These orientations, therefore, have been identified as key modera-
tors of certain predictions of self-determination theory, such as the effect of environmental
contingencies on experienced forms of motivation. For example, research has indicated
that autonomy-oriented individuals are less likely to experience the undermining effect of
external contingencies, like rewards, on their intrinsic motivation [96].
Applying causality orientations as moderators in self-determination theory research
in the workplace, employees who endorse an autonomy causality orientation may have
a greater propensity to interpret workplace contingencies and situations as supportive of
their needs, even those that do not ostensibly offer a high degree of autonomy support. So,
autonomy-oriented workers may have greater resilience when it comes to the undermining
effects of controlling contingencies on their autonomous motivation. They may, therefore, be
more likely to experience their work as need supportive and autonomous, even in ostensibly
controlling contexts. In contrast, those endorsing controlled orientations may be more
vulnerable to having their needs undermined, particularly in contexts where support is not
provided or ambiguous. Acknowledging this moderating effect of causality orientations
identifies a key avenue for research and intervention in the workplace. Individuals who
likely endorse a controlled orientation may be those who benefit most from autonomy-
supportive interventions, and researchers would do well to screen employees for their
causality orientations and target interventions accordingly.
6. Conclusions
Self-determination theory is a leading theory of motivation that has been applied
in multiple contexts and demonstrated efficacy in accounting for behavioral persistence
and adaptive outcomes [23,47,49], including workplace behaviors and outcomes [35,90].
Specifically, the research has indicated that interventions aimed at enhancing workplace
leaders’ autonomy support can subsequently impact employees’ basic psychological need
satisfaction, motivational orientation, and, ultimately, their persistence in adaptive work-
place behaviors, resulting in more favorable workplace outcomes [90]. However, despite
these findings, evidence gaps remain in the literature. In this article, we set out to review the
extant research applying the theory in this context with the goal of identifying these gaps
and, in doing so, making specific recommendations for researchers on how to address them,
which we expect to serve as an agenda for future research. Specifically, our review spanned
both initial and recent applications of self-determination theory in the workplace [35–37]
but focused on the research reviewed and identified trends and shortcomings in prior
conceptual, systematic, and meta-analytic reviews, and the subsequent primary research
studies conducted since.
Foremost among the gaps identified in the research applying self-determination theory
in the workplace is the lack of evidence enabling the drawing of definitive directional and
causal inferences in tests of relations among theory constructs and outcomes. Restric-
tions on these inferences are primarily due to an over-reliance of studies in the field on
single-occasion correlational designs. To address this concern, researchers should consider
employing alternative designs, including variants of cross-lagged panel designs and exper-
imental or randomized controlled intervention designs. These designs can help overcome
these limitations by allowing better inference of directional and causal effects among theory
constructs and workplace outcomes, both of which may increase the value of the evidence
in support of theory predictions and for informing intervention development. For example,
better causal inferences mean that interventionists can be more confident that adopting
a theory-based technique purposed to change a particular construct can lead to changes
in workplace behaviors or outcomes. We reviewed research adopting these designs and
how they address concerns over inferences but also noted a marked dearth of studies in
the workplace context and advocate accordingly for more research adopting these designs
in this context.
<<<PAGE=17>>>
Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 428 16 of 20
An additional limitation of the extant research applying self-determination theory in
the workplace is the lack of formal tests of the mechanisms by which interventions based
on the theory operate in changing behavioral and subsequent outcomes. Researchers need
to explicitly specify and test these mechanisms by adopting designs that allow them to
test whether the expected intervention effects occur through change in the putative theory-
based mediators. Such tests will provide essential information on the extent to which
the underlying theory accounts for intervention effects as specified. This has important
ramifications in assessing whether interventions based on the theory are not only efficacious,
but sufficiently translated into effects on the desired constructs representing the theory-
stipulated process. This approach can provide insight into how and why interventions
work and guide the development of more effective and efficient workplace interventions
based on the theory.
It is also important to consider key contextual and intrapersonal variables that may
act as moderating variables of relations between constructs from self-determination theory
and behavior and outcomes in the workplace. Specifically, workplace environment (e.g.,
job type: blue- vs. white-collar workers and pay structure) and worker-intrapersonal
characteristics (e.g., causality orientations) may impact the degree to which constructs, like
need support and autonomous motivation, impact workplace engagement and subsequent
outcomes. Researchers should measure these and other moderators likely to influence the
relationship between self-determination theory variables and workplace outcomes when
conducting research in this area. Understanding specific job- and environment-level factors
that may impact intervention effects can help tailor interventions to specific workplace
contexts and maximize their effectiveness.
Overall, the current evidence indicates the appropriateness of self-determination
theory to identify the motivational antecedents of adaptive workplace behaviors, like
knowledge sharing and creativity, and successful workplace outcomes, including job
satisfaction, work engagement, and job performance. The evidence on the viability and
application of the theory, however, may be limited by an over-reliance on data derived from
single-occasion correlational designs, a lack of testing of the intervention mechanisms of
action, and the often unacknowledged impact of moderating variables. Researchers should
consider developing studies and adopting appropriate research designs that address these
concerns in order to provide new data that seek to resolve these concerns.
