Abstract: The purpose of this study was to measure the influence of individual soft skills as individual factor on 
lecturer innovation capability through organizational learning as a organizational factor and mediating variable. 
Data were collected by using simple random sampling to the lecturer population of a private higher education in 
Indonesia. The number of returned and valid questionnaires was 103 samples. Data were processed by using 
SEM with SmartPLS 3.0. The results of the study concluded that individual soft skills  had positive and 
significant influence on lecturer innovation capability, both directly and indirectly through a mediating effect of 
organizational learning. This study proposed a model for improving lecturer innovation capability of lecturers in 
Indonesia through individual soft skills  (as individual f actor) and  organizational learning (as organizational 
factor). This study can open the way to improve lecturer readiness in facing education 4.0 era. 
 
Keywords: Education 4.0, individual soft skills, innovation capability, organizational learning. 
 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The industrial revolution 4.0  become a new challenge for the world of education. The industrial revolution 
requires quality human resources that are qualified, agile, adaptive and responsive to rapid change. The world 
of education is facing rapid economic, social, political and technological change s. Therefore, a higher 
education must be flexible in adapting to changing situations and contexts. A higher education  and other 
educational institutions need a positive and  conducive environment to global human resource competition. 
Therefore, it cannot be denied that a higher education  needs synergy between lecturers and the work 
environment that is able to make continuous improvements in innovation and performance. In the knowledge-
based economy era, the knowledge society needs innovation and flexibility as energy to compete. Therefore, 
the strategic development of educational institutions in the future is to increase knowledge resources, 
especially lecturers, which open space for innovation and growth.  To ensure an educational institution, 
especially a higher education , is competitive an d adaptive, lecturers need to be directed and involved in 
improving higher education performance. Lecturers must be empowered and able to empower. As a result,  a 
higher education must become organizational learning that empowers lecturers as one of the main elements of 
higher education  transformation and makes lecturers an instrument of civilization. A higher education  as 
organizational learning is very important in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment. So that the 
response to change becomes an absolute requirement to form competitive human resources and win global HR 
competition. 
 
The knowledge of lecturers is intellectual capital which quickly becomes a new icon of the economic value of 
a higher education . This is the new paradigm adapted from industrial revolution 4.0. Dependence on 
traditional productive assets such as buildings, land and other tangible assets is no longer a major investment 
in the future. Productive and sustainable assets in the future are intangible assets in the form of lecturer 
knowledge. The purpose of this study was to understand and explain the influence of  individual soft skills of 
lecturers on lecturer innovation capability and the influence of organizational learning mediation on the 
relationship between hard skills, individual soft skills and lecturer innovation in Indonesia.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPHOTESES DEVELOPMENT 
 
A. Individual Soft Skills 
 
Knowledge is classified into two types, individual soft skills  and hard skills (Polanyi, 1966). Individual soft 
skills are knowledge in the human mind and very personal (Chen et al, 2018; Holford, 2018; Khoshorour & 
Gilaninia, 2018; Zebal, Ferdous & Chambe rs, 2019; Agyemang & Boateng, 2019; Perez -Fuillerat, 2018; et al, 
2018), are difficult to formulate and share naturally (Deranek, McLeod & Schmidt, 2017; Wang & Liu, 2019; 
Asher & Popper, 2019) so that the transformation requires personal interaction (Lee,  2019; Asbari et al, 2020). 
These individual soft skills  are rooted in actions and experiences, including idealism, values, and emotions 
(Boske & Osanloo, 2015; Kawamura, 2016; Hartley, 2018; Asbari, Nurhayati & Purwanto, 2019). 
 
Based on the definition, individual soft skills  are categorized as personal knowledge or in other words 
knowledge obtained from individuals or individuals (Nonaka & Toyama, 2015; Munoz et al, 2015; Stewart et al, 
2017; Razmerita et al, 2016; Jaleel & Verghis, 2015; Wang et al., 20 16; Serna et al., 2017; Jou et al., 2016; 
Rothberg & Erickson, 2017). The experience gained by each lecturer certainly varies based on situations and 
conditions that cannot be predicted. Individual soft skills are not easily articulated and converted to ha rd skills 
(Mohajan, 2016; Prasarnphanich et al, 2016; Addis, 2016; Cairo Battistutti, 2017; Zang et al, 2015; Spraggon & 
Bodolica, 2017). However, individual soft skills can be empowered by the process of knowledge spiral or SECI 
Model (Li, Liu & Zhou, 201 8; Nonaka & Hirose, 2018; Chatterjee et al, 2018; Sasaki, 2017; Lievre & Tang, 
2015; Stanica & Peydro, 2016; Norwich et al., 2016; Hodgins & Dadich, 2017; Balde et al., 2018; Okuyama, 
2017; Huang et al., 2016). 
Every higher education  or education al institutions must utilize the individual soft skills  of lecturers to share 
knowledge and keep learning. Higher education  or educational institutions will become more creative, 
innovative and lead in the era of education 4.0. A higher education can facilitate the management and use of 
tacit knowledge that is in the subconscious mind of each lecturer with an embedding and sharing approach (Ma 
et al, 2018; Ferreira et al, 2018; Borges et al, 2019; Ferraris et al, 2018; Guo et al, 2018; Tsai & Hsu, 2019; 
Swierczek, 2019; Cantwell & Zaman, 2018). 
 
B. Organizational Learning 
 
Good organizational learning will be more resilient to crises (Starbuck, 2017). Dimensions such as desire, 
discipline, decision making, and alignment are presented as important elements of organizational learning 
(Wetzel & Tint, 2019; Urban & Gaffurini, 20 18; Asbari, Santoso & Purwanto, 2019). Organizational learning is 
an important performance indicator to evaluate overall organizational performance (Qi & Chau, 2018; Hyun eta 
al, 2020; Asbari et al, 2020) that can build the necessary knowledge resources an d maintain higher education 
growth and continuity. The ability to access knowledge is a distinguishing factor between one higher education 
and another. The success of the higher education strategy is very significant related to the solid knowledge base 
that is owned by every individual in a higher education. 
 
C. Innovation Capability 
 
The industrial era 4.0 requires lecturer innovation capability as a competitive advantage in a higher education 
(Malik, 2019; Muscio & Ciffolili, 2019; Durana et al, 2019; Lund &  Karlsen, 2019; Haseeb et al, 2019; Jakhar 
et al, 2018; Hamada, 2019), a competitive strategy (Culot, Orzes & Sartor, 2019), a key to facing industry era 
4.0 (Stachova et al, 2019) a part of 21st-century quality management (Gunasekaran, Sabramanian & Ngai, 2019), 
has many advantages towards business (Zambon et al, 2019; Parida, Sjodin & Reim, 2019). Innovative 
capability is recognized as one of the most important internal resources that can produce superior higher 
education performance (Zouaghi et al, 2018;  Santoro et al, 2017; Castela et al, 2018; Ruiz -Torres et al, 2018; 
Huesig & Endres, 2019). Innovation is an important aspect of quality education (Klaeijsen, Vermeulen, & 
Martens, 2017). 
 
D. The Influence of Individual Soft Skills on Organizational Learning 
 
Organizational learning is one strategy for an organization to study the dynamics of its business environment 
(Senge, 1990; Zhu et al, 2018; Kasim et al, 2018; Darwish et al, 2018). A higher education with a managed 
learning routine will produce a collection of knowledgeable individuals, both  individual soft skills (Hussain et 
al, 2018). Some researchers concluded that organizational learning was influenced by collaborative culture and

knowledge shari ng (Nugroho, 2018). The soft skill was a very significant predictor for the development of 
organizational learning (Muthuveloo, Shanmugam & Teoh, 2017). Based on the explanation above, there are 
hypotheses as follows: 
 
H1: Soft skill has a direct effect on organizational learning 
 
E. The Influence of Individual Soft Skills on Innovation Capability 
 
In the industry 4.0 era with increasingly fierce competition, sustainability remains an important concern and 
issue. Lecturer innovation capability becomes a driver of business sustainability. This performance depends on 
the culture of knowledge in an organization, which consists of tacit knowledge and hard skills. Many 
researchers discussed lecturer innovation capability and th ey concluded that innovation was influenced by 
leadership (Samsir, 2018; Schuckert et al, 2018; Villaluz & Hechanova, 2019), employee involvement climate 
(Naqshbandi, Tabche & Choudhary, 2019) knowledge sharing (Kim & Shim, 2018) knowledge search (Wang, 
Chen & Chang, 2019) collaborative culture (Yang, Nguyen & Le, 2018) and knowledge process (Imran et al, 
2018). The purpose of this study was to test the influence of  individual soft skills  on lecturer innovation 
capability in a higher education  to face indu strial revolution 4.0. Previous studies proved the positive and 
significant influence of  individual soft skills  on lecturer innovation capability (Ganguly et al, 2019; Aulawi, 
2018; Rumanti et al, 2018 & 2019; Torres & Liang, 2016; Li et al, 2019). More s pecifically, many researchers 
concluded that individual soft skills  had a significant and positive influence on lecturer innovation capability 
(Perez-Luno et al, 2018) within the scope of business organizations. However, several researchers stated that 
formal & informal learning had an influence on lecturer innovation capability in a higher education  (Lecat, 
Beausaert, & Raemdonck, 2018). Based on the explanation above, there are hypotheses as follows: 
 
H2: Soft skill has a direct effect on lecturer innovation capability 
 
F. The Influence of Organizational Learning on Innovation Capability 
 
Knowledge creation conditioned by organizational learning will improve lecturer innovation capability and 
organizational performance (Asbari, Purwanto & Santoso, 2019; Vijande & Sanchez, 2017; Lin & Lee, 2017). 
Higher education innovation will be sustainable if it is based on a learning culture that has added value. This 
learning culture makes all lecturers interact with each other so that their current knowledge and new  knowledge 
acquired can be effectively transferred, exchanged and combined into higher education  intelligence and 
knowledge (Lin & Lee, 2017; Lee et al, 2016; Chang & Lin, 2015). An organizational environment that 
provides excitement at work is an importan t factor of lecturer innovation capability (Bani-Melhem, Zeffane & 
Albaity, 2018). Based on the explanation above, there is a hypothesis as follows: 
 
H3: Organizational learning has a direct effect on lecturer innovation capability 
 
G. A mediating effect of Organizational Learning on the Relationship of Individual Soft Skills and 
Innovation Capability 
 
Honeycutt (2000) explained that knowledge management is a discipline that manages intellectual capital from 
managed assets. Basically, the concept of knowledge management develops from the fact that in the present and 
future, the main assets of an organization to be able to compete are intellectual assets rather than physical assets. 
In general, knowledge management carried out by organizational learning is a way to manage knowledge in 
organizations to create value and increase competitive advantage. Organi zational learning as a mediating 
variable plays a role between hard skills, individual soft skills , and organizational innovation. In addition, this 
process has been considered a system where knowledge and skills are input, organizational learning is the m ain 
process, and organizational innovation is an important output (Nouri & Ghorbani, 2017; Chang, Liao & Wu , 
2017). Based on the explanation above, there are hypotheses as follows: 
 
H4: Individual soft skills  has an indirect effect on  lecturer innovation capability through a mediating effect of  
organizational learning

III. METHODS 
 
A. Operational Definitions of Variables and Indicators. 
This study used quantitative methods. Data were collected by distributing questionnaires to all lecturers in higher 
educations. This study used 4 items to measure individual soft skills by Hendarman & Cantner (2017). Organizational 
learning by Jimenez-Jimenez and Sanz-Valle (2011) was measured by using 5 items. Lecturer innovation capability 
by Lee & Choi (2003) was measured by using 5 items. This study uses close -ended questionnaires except for 
questions/statements about the identity of respondents in the form of semi -open questionnaires. Each closed 
question/statement item has five answer options, namely: strongly agree (SA) with a score of 5, agree (A) with a score 
of 4, Neutral (N) with a score of 3, disagree (DA) with a score of 2, and strongly disagree (SDA) with a score of 1. 
Data were processed by using the PLS method with SmartPLS version 3.0 software.  
 
B. Population and Sample 
The population in this study were 171 lecturers of a private higher education in Indonesia. The questionnaire 
was distributed electronically with a simple random sampling technique. The number of returned and valid 
questionnaires was 103. So, 60.2% questionnaires were valid from the number of lecturer population.

1. Convergent Validity Test 
Convergent validity test is performed by looking at the loading factor value of each indicator to the construct. 
For most references, a loading factor of 0.5 or more is considered to have validation that is strong enough to 
explain latent constructs (Chin, 1 998; Hair et al, 2010; Ghozali, 2014). In this study, the minimum acceptable 
loading factor is 0.5, with the condition that the AVE value for each construct is> 0.5 (Ghozali, 2014).  
 
 
Figure 2. Valid model estimation 
 
 
Based on the PLS model estimation results in the figure above, all indicators had a loading factor value above 
0.5 so that the model met the convergent validity requirements. Apart from looking at the loading factor value of 
each indicator, convergent validity was also assessed from the AVE value of each construct. The AVE value for 
each construct was already above 0.5. So the convergent validity of this study met the requirements. The value 
of items loadings, Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability and AVE of each construct can be seen in Table 2:

A discriminant validity test is carried out to ensure that each concept of each latent variable is different from the 
other latent v ariables. The model has good discriminant validity if the AVE squared value of each exogenous 
construct (the value on the diagonal) exceeds the correlation between the construct and other constructs (values 
below the diagonal) (Ghozali, 2014). The result s of the discriminant validity test by using AVE squared values 
or by looking at the Fornell-Larcker Criterion Value can be seen in Table 3: 
 
Table 3. Discriminant Validity 
 
Variables X Y Z 
    
X 0.839   
Y 0.788 0.847  
Z 0.666 0.813 0.856 
Source: The Table is derived from the output of the SmartPLS 3.0 (authors, 2021) 
 
The results of the discriminant validity test in Table 3 showed that all constructs had the AVE square root value 
above the correlation value with other latent constructs (through the Fornell -Larcker criteria) so that it can be 
concluded that the model met the discriminant validity. 
 
3. Construct reliability test 
Construct reliability can be assessed from the value of Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability of each 
construct. The recommended composite reliability and Cronbach's  alpha values are more than 0.7. (Ghozali, 
2014). The reliability test results in table 2 above showed that all constructs had composite reliability and 
Cronbach's alpha values of greater than 0.7 (> 0.7). So it can be concluded that all constructs met  the required 
reliability.  
 
C. Hypothesis Testing 
 
Hypothesis testing in PLS is also called the inner model test. This test includes a test of the significance of direct 
and indirect effects and measurement of the influence of exogenous variables on endogenous variables. To 
know the influence of individual soft skills on organizational learning and lecturer innovation capability, a direct 
influence test is needed. The direct effect test was performed by using the t-statistic test in a partial least squared 
(PLS) analysis model with SmartPLS 3.0 software. By  using the bootstrapping technique, R Square values and 
significance test values were obtained as follows:

Based on Table 4 above, the value of R Square of Z was 0.750 which means that organizational learning (Z) was 
explained by individual soft skills (X) variables by 75.0%, while the remaining 25.0% was explained by other 
variables not discussed in this study. Meanwhile, the value of R Square of lecturer innovation capability (Y) was 
0.689 which means that the lecturer innovation capability variable was explained by individual soft skills  and 
organizational learning by 68.9%, while the remaining 31.1 % was explained by other variables not discussed in 
this study. Table 5 shows T Statistics and P-Values which show the influence between variables.  
 
D. Discussion 
Based on the results of the study, Individual soft skills  had a significant and positive influence on lecturer 
innovation capability, both direct effects and the mediating effect of organizational learning. This shows that the 
better individual soft skills  possessed by lecturers, the lecturer innovation capability will also increase. In 
addition, it can be conclud ed that organizational learning was a mediator between lecturer individual soft skills 
and lecturer innovation capability. This study concluded that individual soft skills had a positive and significant 
influence on organizational learning. This shows that  the better the individual soft skills possessed by lecturers, 
the more positive the formation and development of organizational learning in a higher education. This is in line 
with a study by Qi & Chau (2018) on business organizations. It also showed that  the rarest and most valuable 
resources in the digital age are not ordinary and mediocre lecturers, but lecturers who can create new ideas and 
innovations (Xu, David & Kim, 2018). Lecturers play a key role in producing and reusing knowledge and 
intellectual property through education and teaching (Al -Kurdi, El-Haddadeh & Eldabi, 2018). For this reason, 
the scarcity of lecturers who have adequate  individual soft skills  can inhibit the power of innovation, 
competitiveness, growth, and flexibility of a higher education. In the future, the talent and response of lecturers 
in improving  individual soft skills will be an important factor in the future of the nation's education. Lecturers 
with skills and innovation will be the capital and instrument of civilization. 
Several studies concluded that individual soft skills  had a greater influence on innovation (Ibrahim, 
Boerhannoeddin & Bakare, 2017; Albandea & Giret, 2018; Viviers, Fouche & Reitsma, 2016; Escrig-Tena et al, 
2018). Based on the results of the study, or ganizational learning had positive and significant influence on 
lecturer innovation capability. Organizational learning was mediating the influence of individual soft skills  on 
lecturer innovation capability. This is in line with a study by Martinez -Costa (2018). This study also concluded 
that a higher education can manage past experiences to be combined with the current individual soft skills  of 
lecturers. In essence, organizational learning could provide positive conditions in the process of knowledge 
creation in the 4.0 era. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS 
  
A. Conclusions 
 
To add the role of individual soft skills as a predictor of lecturer innovation capability, a higher education needs 
to provide autonomy and concession to share knowledge with lecturers. Therefore, a higher education needs to 
create organizational learning as a positive environment that stimulates lecturer competence and engagement. 
Knowledge management will be effective if the individual performance of each lecturer is in good conditio n 
(Manaf et al, 2017).  Researchers continue to learn about knowledge as an important higher education resource. 
It can be said that individual soft skills, can significantly improve higher education performance. Organizational 
learning transforms individua l knowledge into higher education  knowledge. This study concluded that 
organizational learning could be a catalyst for knowledge creation in lecturers in higher educations. In fact, the 
lecturer has an obligation to prepare students to study and work in a knowledge society. 
 
B. Suggestions 
 
Based on the conclusion, higher education management needs to build maximum involvement of all lecturers to 
continuously improve individual soft skills . Lecturer training in each section of the higher education  is a 
necessity with a level of intensity and context that is adjusted to the key performance indicators of each lecturer. 
In essence, team learning behavior created in the higher education  environment will be a driving force for 
lecturer innovation. The p rocess of improving skills to improve lecturer innovation capability should not be 
limited to the internal processes of higher educations. However, higher education management needs to expand 
the process of innovation development through efforts to absorb,  articulate, utilize and manage knowledge 
sourced from external higher education partners such as parents, government, community, and other educational 
institutions. Higher education management can activate learning from others when assigning their lecturers to 
attend training, seminars, workshops, to visit other higher educations, meet with higher education committees

and other strategic partners. Because external knowledge, such as those from trainers, coaches, parents, 
government, communities, and other educational institutions, supports lecturer innovation capability. In addition, 
commitment to learning and seriousness to be involved in managing the learning environment are things that 
need attention. Because higher education education institutions can b ecome organizational learning when all 
members of the higher education educational institutions feel that they enjoy the learning process. The learning 
process becomes a higher education culture that encourages innovation (Asbari, Santoso & Purwanto, 2019) . 
Key factors of organizational learning are trust, open communication, high involvement, the presence of 
industry challenges, and a creative work atmosphere. The task of higher education management is to facilitate 
the fulfillment of these key factors.  
 
 
C. Limitation 
 
This study had several limitations. First, this study analyzed the influence of individual soft skills  on lecturer 
innovation capability of lecturers, both direct and indirect through organizational learning variables. Because 
there will be several other variables that influence lecturer innovation capability, the researchers strongly 
recommend to find, explore and analyze them. Secondly, this study w as conducted in a higher education  
environment and may not be generalized to other industries. Therefore it is highly recommended that further 
studies can be performed on this topic in other industries.
