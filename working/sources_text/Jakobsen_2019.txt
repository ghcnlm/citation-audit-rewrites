research use in public health policy-
making: a scoping review

Abstract
Background: Although important syntheses and theoretical works exist in relation to understanding the
organisational factors that facilitate research use, these contributions differ in their scope and object of study as
well as their theoretical underpinnings. Therefore, from an exploratory angle, it may be useful to map out the
current literature on organisational factors of research use in public health policy-making when revisiting existing
theories and frameworks to gain further theoretical insights.
Methods: Herein, a scoping review technique and thematic content analysis were used to bring together findings
from both synthesised and empirical studies of different types to map out the organisational factors that facilitate
research use in public health policy-making.
Results: A total of 14 reviews and 40 empirical studies were included in the analysis. These were thematically
coded and the intra-organisational factors reported as enabling research use were examined. Five main categories
of organisational factors that advance research use in policy organisations – (1) individual factors, (2) the
management of research integration, (3) organisational systems and infrastructures of research use, (4) institutional
structures and rules for policy-making, and (5) organisational characteristics – were derived as well as 18
subcategories and a total of 64 specific factors, where 27 factors were well supported by research.
Conclusions: Using a scoping review methodology, the intra-organisational factors influencing research use in
policy-making (including individual factors) were systematically mapped and the theories applied in this area of
research were assessed. The review findings confirm the importance of an intra-organisational perspective when
exploring research use, showing that many organisational factors are critical facilitators of research use but also that
many factors and mechanisms are understudied. The synthesis shows a lack of studies on politicians and the need
for more theoretically founded research. Despite increased efforts to update the existing evidential and theoretical
basis of research use, we still need frameworks that combine different approaches and theories to help us grasp
the complex organisational mechanisms that facilitate research use in policy settings.

Background
The systematic use of research as an integrated part of
health policy-making remains a challenge [ 1, 2]. An
evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) approach has
been promoted to ensure better integration of research
into public health policy-making, where policy-makers
rely on sources of evidence other than research [ 3– 6].
Systematic reviews of the factors that influence research
use in health policy-making ha ve paid increasing attention
to the organisational factors that affect research use [ 7– 14].
The SPIRIT Action Framework, developed by Redman
et al. [ 15], characterises organisational research capacity as
a key component in bridging t he gap between research and
policy as practise. Redman et al. stated that internal cap-
acity includes ‘the value placed on research by the organisa-
tion (as demonstrated through its support and requirements
for research use) and by individual staff; the tools and sys-
tems the organisation has to support research engagement;
and the skills and knowledge of staff ’ [15].
Although significant syntheses and theoretical works
exist in relation to understanding the organisational fac-
tors that enable research use [ 12, 15– 19], these contribu-
tions differ in their scope and object of study as well as
in their theoretical approach. By taking an exploratory
angle when reviewing existing studies on organisational
factors of research use in policy organisations and by
using a conceptual map of these factors, researchers will
be able to revisit existing theories and frameworks to
test their applicability to policy-making in comparison to
the exploratory map and gain further insights into paths
for future investigations. Therefore, we brought together
findings from both synthesised and empirical studies to
map out the organisational factors that facilitate research
use in health policy-making.
Policy organisations and research use
Building on Anderson [ 20], we define public health pol-
icies as actions performed by governmental bodies, in-
cluding civil servants and elected or non-elected board
members, that deal with healthcare commissioning, dis-
ease prevention and health promotion. In doing so, we
need to conceptualise policy organisations as they ‘pro-
vide meaning by which actors transact their work, formu-
late policy, and allocate resources ’ [21].
We define a policy organisation as a coordinated group
of people with a shared, authorised purpose of developing
public policies. Policy organisations are not only organised
systems of policy officials (managers, professionals, tech-
nical and administrative staff, whose primary role is to
support political boards) and board members (who have
the ultimate decision-making authority), they are also
comprised of their members, who are part of a broader
political institutional framework composed of a “collection
of rules and organized practises, embedded in structures of
meaning and resources that are relatively invariant in the
face of turnover of individuals and relatively resilient to
the idiosyncratic preferences and expectations of individ-
uals and changing external circumstances ” [22]. In this
way, individuals employed by a policy organisation are ac-
tive members of a social network of people with shared
goals and practises; they are also subjects of institutional
policy rules that govern their work and which are inte-
grated into their organisational culture [ 23].
Aims
In our review of knowledge on organisational factors that
facilitate research use in public health policy-making, we
examined a range of different studies across disciplines,
study designs (including literature reviews) and policy
areas. Outcomes of interest are the organisational factors
that the authors of the included papers have reported as
facilitating research use in public health policy-making.
The purpose of this review is to create add-on knowledge
to existing frameworks for understanding research use in
policy organisations and to identify possible research gaps.
Method
We applied a scoping review method, as described by Ark-
sey and O ’Malley [24], to map out the research. This tech-
nique allows for a rigorous synthesis and mapping of an
extensive, complex body of knowledge, providing the abil-
ity to extract findings exclusively related to organisational
factors that enable research use. This approach is also use-
ful for summarising findings from different study designs
and theoretical backgrounds, permitting us to review the
extent and range of the literature.
In line with the recommendations from Arksey and
O’Malley, we excluded a quality assessment of the in-
cluded studies [ 24]. Due to the scope and purpose of the
review, we left out a consultation of preliminary results,
which Arksey and O ’Malley declared an optional stage.
The scope of the review
This review focuses on the facilitating factors that sup-
port positive change mechanisms for integrating re-
search within policy organisations to ensure EIDM. Our
search strategy was not guided by a strict definition of
research. Instead, we developed a comprehensive list of
inclusion and exclusion criteria to capture all relevant
studies on organisational factors that facilitate research
use in policy organisations. Therefore, we did not distin-
guish between investigations conducted internally by
policy officials or studies conducted by external aca-
demic institutions, nor did we distinguish between re-
search evidence reported in peer-reviewed publications
or evidence-based guidelines or verbally disseminated
knowledge coming from such publications (e.g. by con-
sulting with researchers).

There are many methods to appraise research use and
only limited agreement exist among scholars on what
characterises successful use of research. In our scoping
review, we were not strict in our characterisation of re-
search use; instead, we reported on the utilisation mea-
sure(s) applied in each study.
Identifying relevant studies
Between April and July 2017, we performed a combined
search for relevant empirical studies published from 1970
to 2017 (July) in electronic databases, including PubMed,
Academic Search Premier (cross-disciplinary) and Scopus
(the social sciences). We also conducted a manual screen-
ing of document repositories on institutional websites
known to have contributed to the knowledge base for en-
hancing evidence-informed/evidence-based public health
policy-making, and we searched for important references
already cited in the included studies. Figure 1 depicts our
search strategy as well as the selection process.
Electronic databases
We initially performed a broad search on PubMed, spe-
cifically using the thesaurus Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH), keywords and text words to include the most
recent and pertinent publications. This database primar-
ily includes publications in English. The aim of this
search was to capture sources studying various types of
organisations, which might be relevant in relation to re-
search use and policy-making.
Thereafter, we performed four block searches using a
wide range of search terms (Additional file 1), which we
combined using the Boolean operators ‘AND’ or ‘OR’.W e
divided the block into the following focus areas: (1) popula-
tion/setting, (2) intervention, (3) policy area and (4) theory
development. The third focus area included health policies
and public policies related to health. Where possible, we
limited all searches to titles and abstracts. We did not look
for keywords. Instead, we included many text words in each
block search. The PubMed search revealed studies of
practise-based organisations (such as hospital departments
and mental healthcare facilities) that did not meet the in-
clusion criteria. We complemented our search using the
Scopus and Academic Search Premiere databases, which
are primarily social sciences oriented, but also cover many
other disciplines such as humanistic research, economics,
public health and the techni cal sciences. These two data-
bases also contain publications other than those that are
peer-reviewed. We modified the search strategy to exclude
subject headings. We included studies of health services or-
ganisations if the abstract explicitly mentioned the word
‘policy’.W ei n c l u d e d‘factors’ in the fourth block search to
expand the focus on organisational factors of research use.
We combined and merged the hits from these two data-
bases into the PubMed publication repository in Endnote.
The complete literature searc h strategy for all databases is
available in Additional file 1.
Manual searches
Relevant websites and their publication repositories (both
peer-reviewed and other publications) were screened
based on the title of the publication and, if in doubt, the
abstract. We included studies from the following two web-
sites: (1) the Research Unit for Research Utilisation [ 25]
and (2) Health Evidence ™ [26] (funded by the National
Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools in Canada).
We screened reference lists of studies identified as per-
tinent from the database and website searches for key
contributions to the review question. We identified 10
sources as being primary resources for other studies and
highly relevant [ 8, 9, 27– 34].

Selection of studies
The primary researcher (MJ) screened all 4612 titles and
abstracts through ongoing dis cussion with the second au-
thor (LEK) regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria as
well as the uncertainties related to some of the studies. Oc-
casionally, a full text review was performed to refine the in-
clusion and exclusion criteria. By October 2017, 191 studies
were found to be eligible for a full-text reading.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Table 1 presents the inclusion criteria. We developed
and refined the exclusion criteria during the selection
process. The eligibility of the grey literature and the
manually searched literature were assessed using the
same criteria used to determine the literature derived
from the database search. The manually selected litera-
ture, comprising the guiding documents while develop-
ing the search strategy, was re-assessed to check their
eligibility for inclusion.
We included one design paper as it was based on four
preliminary studies, including two reviews [ 36]. The
findings of the first (scoping) review are only available to
us in this design paper, and the outcomes of the system-
atic review are also available in the form of a PhD thesis,
but we were unable to retrieve this publication online.
Charting and data extraction
We developed a data chart, which allowed us to extract
information key to understanding the identified organ-
isational factors. We recorded data on study characteris-
tics (e.g. type and method, objectives and population as
well as the outcome measures related to research use
and theoretical foundation) and on the organisational
context (e.g. organisational setting, policy area, level of
policy-making and the country of study).
In order to pinpoint and thematically map out the or-
ganisational factors that facilitate research use, we ap-
plied thematic content analysis [ 37] to open codes of
organisational factors identified in the study outcomes.
Instead of using an existing coding frame, we developed
our own, starting from the included reviews. Afterwards,
we tested the coding frame while coding and thematic-
ally categorising a number of empirical studies ( n = 17)
[8– 10, 27, 30, 33, 36, 38– 47], which, through a text-
search query in NVivo 11, were found to use the search
term ‘organisational’ 10 or more times. We then open
coded the remaining empirical studies and assigned
these open codes the appropriate category from the
existing coding frame. We used this step as a final valid-
ation of the categories and their definitions. The data ex-
traction process enabled us to provide a frequency count
of the identified organisational factors as well as their
thematical and categorical attributes.
Results
After the initial search, removing of duplicates and apply-
ing exclusion criteria, 54 publications remained eligible
for inclusion. We classified the papers into 12 systematic
or rigorous reviews, three field or quasi-experimental
studies, 12 surveys, six mixed-method studies (where two
of the studies included a systematic or rigorous literature
review) and 21 case or naturalistic observation studies.
We did not find any meta-analyses, randomised control
trials or case-control trials. Figure 2 displays the targeted
policy area of each included study type.
Characteristics of the included studies
Reviews
We included 12 systematic or other types of literature
reviews [ 11– 14, 17, 29, 32, 48– 52] and two mixed-
method studies in our examination of reviews [ 16, 53].
These two mixed-method studies use empirical data to
validate the findings of their own systematic review;
thus, we have chosen to only consider these as reviews
in our synthesis. A detailed summary of the included

use relevant for public policy-making.
 We included studies focusing on organisational factors positively
related to evidence-based or evidence-informed decision-making in
public policy.

 We excluded papers on research use if they did not focus on public
policy-making within the policy organisation, for instance, implemen-
tation of screening programmes in community clinics, unless we
found the word ‘policy’ in the title or abstract, and if we were able to
extract the factors of interest.

reviews, ordered by the number of organisational factors
identified in each one, is presented in Additional file 2.
Organisational factors, in line with our definition, were
seldom the primary object of investigation. The major con-
tribution to this study stems f rom healthcare and popula-
tion health (Fig. 2) .T h r e er e v i e w sc e n t r eo nm u l t i p l ep o l i c y
areas but report a large contrib ution from health policy and
the level of policy-making in focus is quite equal across na-
tional/federal, state/regional and district/local levels.
Empirical studies
The empirical studies mainly consist of case studies and
surveys from healthcare, preventive healthcare and popula-
tion health policy. Most build on data from Australia,
Canada and the USA. We only identified a few multi-
country studies [39, 54– 57], including two from African na-
tions. In relation to policy, there is a very equal emphasis
across levels, with the least focus on the state/regional level
(national/federal (n = 22), state/regional ( n = 17), district/
local (n = 23)) (Additional file 3).
Civil servants are by far the most researched population
group (Additional file 3). Politicians were only included in
a few studies. However, many did not explicitly distinguish
between elected and non-elected policy-makers.
The most commonly used measure of research use is
policy-makers’ perceptions of barriers to, and facilitators
of, research utilisation (Additional file 2). Only a few
studies measured actual use [ 55, 58– 61].
Main approaches and theoretical foundations of the
included studies
In our examination of reviews, most of the publications
were explorative, rather than guided by theory. The main
techniques of the included reviews stem from a rational
action approach to policy-making, such as evidence-
based/evidence-informed policy and knowledge transla-
tion (Additional file 2).
The included reviews are generally marked by the know-
ledge and research use approach, which revolves around
the political components related to organisational research
use [ 16, 29, 49]. Within this approach, Contandriopoulos
et al. [ 12] provided a comprehensive understanding of the
theoretical and empirical aspects of research use as know-
ledge in policy arenas (thus not only focusing on health).
Contandriopoulos et al. reviewed both theory papers and
empirical studies, which are combined in their synthesis,
making facilitators with purely empirical bases unclear.
The largest theoretical contribution to the understanding
of organisational factors, that enable research use in policy
organisations, is the diffusion of innovation (DoI) theory by
Rogers [35]. Several of the included reviews found this the-
ory useful to grasp the individual and organisational mecha-
nisms underlying the process, from the introduction of
research evidence products (e.g. reports, systematic reviews,
evidence-based guidelines) t o the adoption of knowledge
into organisational practises [ 14, 17, 48]. The concept of
‘absorptive capacity’ for new knowledge emerged from DOI
literature; it is an organisation ’s ability to be ‘systematically
a b l et oi d e n t i f y ,c a p t u r e ,i n t e r p r e t ,s h a r e ,r e f r a m e ,a n dr e -
codify new knowledge; to link it with its own knowledge base;
a n dt op u ti tt oa p p r o p r i a t eu s e’ [14].
Regarding the understanding of organisational factors
that enable research use, a couple of reviews applied the
concept of organisational capacity or capabilities to use re-
search [16, 53]. The SPIRIT Action Framework by Redman
et al. [ 15] is the most recent theoret ical contribution to the
comprehension of organisational capacity to use research.
This framework was based on an updated literature review
by Moore et al. [ 17] and supplemented with interviews of
policy-makers [ 16]. The framework builds on previous
work from various disciplines [ 13, 14, 51, 62], with the aim
of supporting increased efforts to develop evidence-
informed health policy in Australia. Organisational capacity
within the SPIRIT Action Framework is characterised as
the extent to which an agency has the internal ability to re-
spond to a catalyst or prompt for using research [ 15– 17].
The organisational capacity of research use is influenced by
the value the organisation places on research as well as
through support and requireme nts for research use within
t h ee n t i t y( e . g .s u p p o r tt o o l sand systems for research en-
gagement, skills development, and knowledge exchange
and acquisition activities).
The theoretical backgrounds of the empirical studies
were diverse and depended on the selected approach
and interest(s) of the authors. For example, DoI, behav-
ioural, and research impact and utilisation theories, in
addition to a broad range of frameworks, have been used
(Additional file 2). Below we present the theories that
seem to have contributed the most to the field.

Fig. 2 Study design characteristics and targeted policy area of

areas for study design characteristic. Most noticeably is the large
representation of studies conducted in the population health area,
especially case studies, and the scares contribution of studies
coming from the built environment and mental health areas

likely circumstances for research use (i.e. knowledge trans-
lation) in policy-making by the ministries of health (MoH)
in developing countries; the same team refined the theory
in 2014 [ 59], stating the following: “High-quality and con-
textualized evidence will be taken up in policies so as to
lead to evidence-informed policies in instances where the
MoH leads the KT [knowledge translation] process, the
WHO and regional professional bodies play a role, [there
are] partnerships for KT, and tools and required inputs are
available to implement the evidence ” [59].
To support the development of knowledge exchange in-
terventions, Contandriopoulos et al. [ 12] provide a frame-
work for “collective-level knowledge use ” that includes
three dimensions of collective knowledge exchange sys-
tems: (1) “level of polarization ” (from politics), where
“knowledge is influenced by its relevance, legitimacy, and
accessibility” (ibid, p. 460 – 461); (2) “cost-sharing equilib-
rium” (from economics), where the value for money of
investing in knowledge exchange processes is constantly
being assessed by knowledge producers, intermediaries
and users; and (3) “institutionalized channels of communi-
cation” (from social structuring), where the “social struc-
tures in a communication network influence the knowledge
exchanged” (ibid).
The included studies reveal that much of the evidence
on research use does not contain an intra-organisational
perspective. This was also recognised by Lomas and
Brown, who proposed a new functional view of the role of
research and the relationship between research use and
health policy as well as a perspective from inside policy or-
ganisations whereby civil servants use research depending
on the different functions that research plays in the
policy-making process. They distinguished between the
functional role of agenda-setting, policy development, and
monitoring and modifying existing policies [ 64]. Here, the
value of research by individuals and organisations is a key
component to applying research for different purposes
(i.e. functional roles). They stated that research is only
taken into account for the following when it is valued: sig-
nalling what emerging or neglected areas may need to be
on the agenda; verifying the issues claimed by interest
groups to be worthy of inclusion on the policy agenda; as
a source of validation for developing new policies; or as a
learning process when using evaluations to monitor and
modify existing policies. Lomas and Brown stressed the
importance of valuing research within a learning culture
[14]. This is in line with the cost-sharing equilibrium,
which Contandriopoulos et al. [ 12] presented in their syn-
thesis. When a cost-sharing equilibrium exists, research is
more likely to be used.
The functional view of the role of research helps to
provide an understanding of organisational culture and
the kinds of ‘business problems ’ that policy organisations
face throughout the different phases of policy-making
and how to best resolve them. Lomas and Brown [ 64]
described a case of a state MoH with a learning culture
that needed organisational and information tools to
make better use of the advantages that research evidence
could give civil servants, specifically when managing
competing interests during policy agenda-setting, valid-
ating new policy recommendations and increasing the
effectiveness of existing policies.
The DoI theory has also been used as the basis for em-
pirical studies, and in this way contributed helpful un-
derstanding of the organisational factors that enable
research use. This is especially the case for healthcare
practise, where evidence-based guidelines and new tech-
nologies are usually the ‘innovations’ that can easily be
defined as individual research products. In this review,
two studies deployed the DoI theory to analyse the up-
take of specific research products: clinical practice guide-
lines [ 42] and systematic reviews [ 27]. Dobbins et al.
[27] argued that “systematic reviews are an innovation
because they represent a new approach for program
planning and decision-making in public health ”. A third
study used the DoI theory to develop the logic model of
the knowledge translation intervention [ 36].
Organisational factors that facilitate research use
We identified five broad domains of organisational factors,
18 subcategories and 64 specific organisational factors that
enable research use (Table 2). The overall categories, sub-
categories and specific factors constitute the output of the
thematic content analysis of the included reviews and em-
pirical studies. This table provides, for each factor, the
number of studies and their references reporting the fac-
tor so as to facilitate research use.
Figure 3 displays the concept map of the organisa-
tional factors. The factors highlighted with a thick
border are supported by seven or more studies, includ-
ing at least one review. Additional file 3 summarises the
organisational factors identified in each study (as pre-
sented in Table 2) as well as the policy level and study
population of each included investigation.
Individual factors
This general category of factors has the largest support
from research (44 investigations). Studies from all levels
of policy-making feed into this category, where civil ser-
vants comprise the largest population group examined.
The facilitating factor primarily supported by research is
‘motivation, intention and expectations towards using
research, including its perceived usefulness ’ (20 studies);
it falls under the subcategory of ‘individual values, inter-
ests and beliefs ’. The synthesis of findings encompassed
by this factor show that the motivation to seek out and
use research is driven by an individual ’s opinions, prefer-
ences and interests as well as to what extent research is

valued. This factor includes the perceived usefulness and
impact of research as a means of improving policies and
achieving policy goals.
Another closely related and empirically supported facilitat-
ing factor is the ‘level of association and perceived relevance,
credibility and objectivity of external research providers ’ (8
studies); it is also part of the ‘individual values, interests and
beliefs’ subcategory. This factor clearly shows the importance
of policy-makers to be able to employ research in order to
realise policies [80]. In order to make use of research for pol-
itical purposes, the research evidence has to meet the same
criteria of judgement as other kinds of evidence, meaning
that policy-makers should have confidence in review authors
[32], placing importance on the reputation, professional
credibility and legitimacy of the research providers (both in-
dividuals and their affiliated institutions) [49, 60]. Moreover,
policy-makers judge the interests of the research providers
when weighing the evidence [29].
Our review synthesis demonstrates that all factors ex-
cept one – within the subcategory of ‘research awareness
and integration skills ’– are well supported by studies
(Fig. 3). The following two factors had the highest sup-
port of research: ‘skills in seeking, appraising and inter-
preting systematic reviews and adapting to contextual
needs’ (14 studies) and ‘research experience and skills ’
(11 studies). This means that skills and competences in
both the generation and integration of research facilitate
its use. Having a high educational level is supported by
six empirical studies and one review (Table 2). One em-
pirical study illustrates inconsistent results regarding the
cause– effect relationship between high educational back-
ground and high research use, reporting on civil servants

as squares, subcategories as squares with soft edges, and the detailed factors are displayed as circles. The sizes of the circles are without
importance. The circles with bold text and thick boundaries present the factors, which are supported by seven or more studies including at least
one review. The figure shows that 27 out of 64 identified factors are highly supported by research, primarily within the overall categories of
individual factors, management of research integration and organisational systems and infrastructure for research use

with low educational backgrounds as high users of re-
search [ 75] (Factor #19, Table 2). Here, it might be rele-
vant to assess the quality of contradictory studies and
remain open to potentially underlying mechanisms con-
nected to research use, which may be hidden under the
education factor.
We identified having the ‘competences and being able to
champion research use in a political setting ’ as a pertinent
facilitating factor of research use (7 studies); it entails the
ability to champion research among those who are likely to
be influential in getting resear ch into policy, both internally
and externally [17, 74]. It is vital to research integration that
policy-makers be able to make decisions based on the best
available research in a policy a rea filled with contingency
and surrounding influence [ 74], financial constraints [ 45],
time pressure [73] and using politically palatable arguments
to gain political support for policy actions that are informed
by research evidence [16, 49].
In the subcategory of external knowledge exchange link-
ages, the most supported factor is ‘informal, personal and
trusting relationships with researchers’ (Fig. 3). This factor
is related to the theoretical concept of social structuring,
which both Contandriopoulos et al. [ 12]a n dW a l t e r ,N u t l e y
and Davies [51] reported on. Interpersonal trust encourages
communication and repeated communication raises trust.
This means that communication must be initiated among
research users and producers i n order to build trust; these
relationships are enhanced by ongoing communication. A
supporting factor is the ‘time spent on networking activities
and acquiring external research knowledge’.
Several findings are related to the subcategory of ‘pos-
ition, status and role in the organisation ’, which are
understudied. Furthering the comprehension of personal
characteristics that facilitate research use might be useful
for strategic performance management that supports
EIDM. It is also critical to grasp the personal implica-
tions of being a member of an organisation that advo-
cates for EIDM (e.g. an individual ’s perceived pressure
whereby they feel the need to be an expert on many is-
sues to make evidence-based/evidence-informed deci-
sions) [ 40].
Two studies showed being female as a facilitating fac-
tor, since findings indicate that females use research
more often than males [ 41, 66]. However, the same stud-
ies argue that this factor might not be feasible or it that
it is not ethical to place too much emphasis on this. An-
other factor that might not be ethical to highlight is the
potential association between having a left-leaning polit-
ical orientation and research use; we identified this fac-
tor in a review [ 29].
Conflicting results have been found in relation to age
and seniority, where seniority [ 2, 27, 48] and being youn-
ger or a recent graduate [ 29, 32] have both been identi-
fied as enabling research use. In the survey by Newman
[66], age and level of work experience were not signifi-
cantly associated with research use. Newman suggested
that age does not heavily influence research use, but
there is a far more complex explanation.
We found that the positive relationship between a
decision-making authority and research use was more vis-
ible in the factor of ‘having decision-making authority ’
under the subcategory of ‘position, status and role in the or-
ganisation’. Here, we identified research users as members
in an organisation that hold a managerial or senior position
whereby one is allowed to inter vene in the practises, rules
and functioning of organisational, political or social systems
[12]. Furthermore, having a high professional role in an or-
ganisation favours the use of research [ 41].
We identified ‘being an influential member of the organ-
isation in promoting research’ as a facilitating factor that is
highly supported by research (Table 2). Having visionary
staff in pivotal positions is r elevant for a strong receptive
capacity for research [ 14]. Having influential members of
the organisation (both professi onally, such as policy entre-
preneurs, and socially, such as opinion leaders) is key to en-
abling research use. Another fa ctor closely interconnected
with the factor above is ‘being a knowledge broker, cham-
pion or gatekeeper of research ’; this covers the availability
of ordinary members who support influential members,
w h oi nt u r na r et h em a i nd r i v e r so fr e s e a r c hu s e .B e i n gt h e

viduals validate the research qu ality and political applicabil-
i t yb e f o r eu s i n gi to rt r a n s f e r r i n gk n o w l e d g et ot h er e s to f
the organisation. This factor is directly linked to ‘competen-
cies and the ability to champion research ’.W h e na n a l y s i n g
the differences of individual characteristics between re-
search users and non-users a mong Australian government
officials, Newman concluded that government academic re-
search users tend to have much in common with academics
that have previous experience in the university or non-
profit sectors [ 66]. He stressed the importance of identify-
ing individuals within policy o rganisations who can act as
knowledge brokers [66].
Management of research integration
We mapped the management of research integration
(such as performance management and strategic com-
mitment toward research use) as the second most em-
pirically supported overall category of factors. Forty-one
studies have contributed to this general category, where
most of the factors have emerged by studying civil ser-
vants at all policy-making levels.
As part of the ‘performance management ’ subcategory,
nine studies (Table 2) highlight the ‘availability and or-
ganisation of internal staff, which coordinate and re-
spond to specific demands for research to inform a
policy’. This factor includes the availability of internal
staff/specialists who conduct literature reviews that are
Jakobsen et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:90 Page 13 of 22
<<<PAGE=14>>>
used to inform decision-making [ 30], and who have the
analytical skills needed to evaluate unpublished sources
of information such as agency administrative data [ 76].
For commissioning organisations, Wye et al. [ 61]r e -
vealed the importance of conducting one ’s own evaluation
studies; Lomas and Brown [ 64] support this. In the case of
the selection and updating of Mali ’sN a t i o n a lE s s e n t i a l
Medicines List, Albert et al. [ 67]s t a t e dt h a t“having a spe-
cific person or group of persons delegated to search and
compile relevant research findings for the policy question
at hand was perceived to be extremely helpful ”.
Having internal research units was reported as facili-
tating research use [ 27, 64, 74, 77]. For instance, Elliott
and Popay reported that having a research resource
centre enables cross-sector communication in relation to
needs assessments and health services contracting [ 74].
Mwendera et al. [ 77] underscored the usefulness of a
policy development unit to coordinate and implement
evidence-informed policies.
Nine out of 14 reviews and 15 out of 40 empirical studies
(Table 2)r e p o r t e d‘internal capacity-building’ as a facilitat-
ing factor, making this the most studied factor of those
identified in this review. In their survey of public health
decision-makers in public health units in Ontario, Dobbins
et al. [ 27] found that ongoing training in critical appraisal
was the second strongest predictor of the use of systematic
reviews for programme justifi cation. Training sessions,
which target both policy/project officers and senior man-
agers, have been stressed as key to improving the confi-
dence and expertise of policy-makers in all positions
regarding research use in policy-making [ 36, 53]. Further-
more, better access to staff tr aining has been demonstrated
as a feature among local health departments, which have a
high capacity to effectively implement and maintain
evidence-based public health [ 45]. The reported content of
the training and capacity-building mostly included litera-
ture search techniques, critical appraisal, local application,
and monitoring and evaluation. Additionally, we identified
shadowing sessions by librarians, mentoring and supervi-
sion as useful for capacity-building [ 42, 51, 71]. Formal
methods for accessing research [ 16] as well as the availabil-
ity of tools for searching, collati ng, synthesising, reporting
and applying research [ 36, 46, 53, 59] were found to be im-
portant for supporting policy-makers during their capacity-
building efforts.
Another facilitating factor included in this subcategory,
that is highly supported by research, is ‘research integra-
tion skills, which form an essential part of recruitment
policy and the performance management system ’. This
factor includes the incorporation of research use capacity
and research skills into position descriptions [ 42, 53]a s
well as performance management systems for senior
policy-makers [ 53]. Having people in the organisation
who are paid to do research [ 33], and strategies in place to
provide staff with training [ 16], influence individual skills
and capabilities to integrate research. Developing perform-
ance objectives related to research in annual employment
reviews was mentioned by Peirson et al. [ 30]a sa “means
of providing regular and mutually accountable opportun-
ities for staff and supervisors to identify EIDM learning
needs, develop training plans, monitor progress, and assess
performance”. Giving staff opportunities for growth and
involving them at all levels of decision-making was
highlighted by Tabak et al. [ 45] and having incentive sys-
tems (like professional rewards for using and conducting
research) was reported by Oh [ 72] as impacting the search
for external research by civil servants.
All factors within the subcategory of ‘strategic com-
mitment toward research use ’ are highly supported by
research (Fig. 3). The factor ‘provision of sufficient time
and resources to acquire research, make decisions and
engage with research activities ’ was stated by 17 studies.
Here, a wide range of resources have been reported on
such as the availability of funding for research activities
(e.g. flexibility of funding) [ 45] and the availability of
slack resources [ 14]. Furthermore, emphasis was placed
on the investment of significant time, efforts and funds
to build internal library infrastructure and expertise [ 30]
as well as investment in systems and processes that aid
research use [ 17]. Resources for staff and personnel [ 29]
as well as knowledge translation efforts [ 41] and technol-
ogy [ 13, 14], were also mentioned.
Studies on research use in low-resource countries show
a high influence by global institutions and international
donor agencies, which greatly impact the perceived im-
portance of research use in health policy-making [ 55, 77].
Government resources allocated for research have been
identified as a critical organisational factor. However, such
funding efforts may not be realistic in low-resource coun-
tries. In one study, even if there was no government fund-
ing available (e.g. in the case of malaria policy in Malawi),
it was still possible for external research funding to sup-
port policy-makers ’ needs by developing the National
Health Research Agenda [ 77].
The importance of having a ‘clear strategic vision for,
and the systematic incorporation of, research use within
existing systems and practises ’ was reported by 10 studies.
This factor includes a clear, long-term strategy to increase
research use [ 14, 30], whereby Peirson et al. [ 30]s u g g e s t e d
a 10-year period. Other findings highlight the significance
of systematically integrating evidence-based decision-
making (EBDM) into strategic plans [ 45]a sw e l la st r a n s -
parent roles and responsibilities for EIDM [ 13, 44, 46].
The development of research priorities for organisations
was also mentioned such as having established commit-
tees, identifying research priorities for the organisation
[77] and annually eliciting upcoming evidence priorities
from staff [ 64]. The creation of a managerial position for
Jakobsen et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:90 Page 14 of 22
<<<PAGE=15>>>
workforce development and the priority of libraries in local
public health units in Ontario were reported as facilitating
research use [ 30]. Finally, systematising research use proce-
dures across departments and within existing organisational
systems is vital for enabling research use [ 10, 46, 51].
‘Support by senior managers ’ was identified as an im-
portant factor by 11 studies. Walter, Nutley and Davies
[51]s t a t e dt h a t “strong and visible leadership, at both
[the] management and project levels, can help provide mo-
tivation, authority and organisational integration ”. Several
studies mentioned leadership and managerial will and
support as catalysing research, but without further clarifi-
cation. Lomas and Brown [ 64] revealed the central im-
portance of having champions at a senior level able to
sustain the journey. Hardy et al. [ 38] reported that encour-
aging EBDM by leaders through positive feedback and
follow-up on staff suggestions to improve practise and
support enabled the implementation of EBDM at a local
health department in Colorado. The development of a Se-
nior Officers Group, with responsibility for overseeing
strategies for carrying out research, was also mentioned as
ensuring a positive outcome of research use [ 58].
The final factor included in this subcategory is ‘efforts to
create an organisational culture favouring research use ’.
Nine studies contributed to this factor, which is complex,
as efforts to change organisat ional culture are already em-
bedded in other identified factors. However, during coding,
there were codes referring exp licitly to the significance of
transforming an organisation’s culture to become one that
promotes research use [ 11, 17, 33] (e.g. through institu-
tional incentive schemes) [12]. By creating an organisational
learning culture, the absorpt ive capacity of research and
innovation is enabled [ 13, 14, 73]. Mitton et al. [ 13]r e -
ported on readiness for change as an organisational facilita-
tor, without further clarification. Many of these cultural
concepts are multi-factorial, and hence difficult to decom-
pose into a more exploratory summary of factors, especially
the codes included in this final one. Thus, we have
refrained from doing so.
Organisational systems and infrastructures for research use
Thirty-two studies contributed to the overall category of
‘organisational systems and infrastructure of research
use’, which includes factors related to the organisational
systems and infrastructure in place for accessing and
managing knowledge as well as for exchanging and dis-
cussing research knowledge within the organisation and
with research producers. Factors under this overall cat-
egory come from studying a wide range of policy levels
and a broad swath of population groups, both inside and
outside policy organisations (e.g. researchers, clinicians
and employees of non-governmental organisations). This
is very much due to the external linkages identified
within this overall category.
Within the subcategory ‘access to research ’, all factors
except for one are highly supported by research (Fig. 3).
Several of the factors in this subcategory are heavily
dependent on external influences (e.g. dissemination ac-
tivities from research providers, or external knowledge
brokers and the provision of external library services).
The most empirically supported factor in the ‘access
to research ’ subcategory is ‘access to online or in-house
databases and repositories of research ’ (20 studies); this
includes the permission to use, and the availability of, re-
search via full-text access to online databases, mostly ex-
ternal findings (including to online database searches)
[27, 32, 36, 53], or via internal repositories of research
with both internal and external results. Subscription to
all or the most relevant research journals [ 53] and the
availability of systematic reviews [ 32] are contained in
this factor.
Another factor is the ‘provision of library services or
support by an information specialist ’ (7 studies). Having
access to library services, either internal or external, or
an information specialist was reported by three reviews
[29, 32, 53] and four empirical studies [ 10, 30, 71, 73]
for the efficient retrieval of pertinent sources of informa-
tion. However, the research does not adequately clarify
which strategy is most effective. Twose et al. [ 71] found
that access to highly skilled external library services and
personal assistance by a librarian were useful for county
officials working in two public health departments in the
United States. However, this access was supported by
ongoing training and shadowing sessions by the librar-
ians, where peaks of use coincided with training and
shadowing events. To accommodate the high needs of
research by low research users, Twose et al. [ 71] pro-
posed establishing “power users ”– who might be already
existing high users – in departments to assist with re-
search integration, despite time restrictions faced by offi-
cials and the complex questions guiding literature
searches. They also stress the need for a more seamless
and broad-based model for accessing information versus
the patchwork of services currently available [ 71].
The ‘availability of tailored, disseminated research find-
ings to policy-makers ’ was identified as one of the highly
research-supported factors within the ‘access to research ’
subcategory (8 studies). This f actor encompasses active dis-
semination to policy-makers (e.g. by organisational leaders)
[53] through the circulation of policy-relevant research
findings and reports [ 53, 64] or through tailored, policy-
friendly summaries [ 12, 17, 43, 53]. Regarding the fre-
quency of dissemination, More et al. [ 17] mentioned the
positive effect of an intervention that combined access to
an online research repository with tailored weekly target
messages for 7 weeks. Alternatively, Lomas and Brown [ 64]
examined a quarterly newsletter combining government-
funded and peer-reviewed research to support the

functional demands of civil servants during their ‘pull’ of
sources during short periods of new policy development.
In light of the findings by Oh [ 72], increased access to
external sources of research indicates that civil servants
are even more prone to looking for external sources if
this information is given to them, if the research helps
them to solve their daily tasks and if organisational in-
centives for external research exist. An increased use of
external sources is mediated through greater efforts to
spread information, or by influencing the needs of the
research via decision-makers and increased collaboration
efforts [ 27, 60, 72].
The final, most highly research-supported factor in the
‘access to research ’ subcategory is ‘personal access to a re-
searcher, research consultant or internal expert ’.T h i sf a c -
tor might be closely linked to social structuring theory,
according to which trust in the research provider affects
the individual ’s perceptions of, and relevance to, the re-
search. Personal access to research providers – either from
colleagues in a brokering position or from external re-
searchers or a research consultant – supports an intuitive
approach by policy-makers to acquire information. One
review reported on the storing of tacit, un-codifiable
knowledge within the organisation as a facilitating factor
[14]. This factor is associated with DoI theory in health-
care practise, leaving its pertinence to policy-making un-
clear. However, personal access to people with specialised
knowledge of research in a particular area [ 9, 73]o ri na c -
quiring research [ 53] could be connected to the organisa-
tion’s existing knowledge and skills base; hence, the
storing of tacit knowledge is performed by selected mem-
bers/power users in the organisation [ 14].
Studies on the effect of knowledge brokers as a know-
ledge translation strategy have mainly focused on exter-
nal knowledge brokers (e.g. from research institutions)
[13, 17, 49, 81]. These studies do not sufficiently de-
scribe who the internal knowledge brokers are.
Only the factor ‘external partnerships and communication
channels’ was identified as being highly supported by re-
search under the subcategory‘inter-organisational communi-
cation and collaboration’ (14 studies). This factor includes
participation in fora and conferences where research findings
are presented [44, 53, 77]a sw e l la sf o r aa n dp l a t f o r m sw h e r e
evidence is discussed and decisions are made in relation to
research use for specific policy problems [ 39, 58, 59, 77].
Organised networking and partnership activities foster the
development of interpersonal trust between policy-makers
and researchers. Based on individual-level theories of human
behaviour, Contandriopoulos et al. [12] argued that “interper-
sonal trust facilitates and encourages communication ” and
that “repeated communications create trust”. The importance
of long-term, trust-based relationships for research was also
highlighted by two studies [ 56, 59]. Van der Arend [ 60]e x -
amined reports from policy officials on how their
participation in many different types of linkage relationships
supported them in accessing, translating, commissioning and
co-producing research. Nabyonga-Orem et al. [59]e x p l o r e d

Uganda’s MoH regarding knowledge synthesis and the appli-
cation process during a changein malaria treatment policy.
Under the subcategory ‘intra-organisational communica-
tion, learning networks and collaboration teams ’, only one
factor ( ‘intra-organisational communication and learning
networks’) was highly supported by research. In this factor,
peer-to-peer networking [52] – also referred to as horizon-
tal networks [ 14] – h a sb e e nv i e w e da su s e f u li nc r e a t i n g
shared meanings and value s related to research use,
whereby sharing research becomes part of the organisa-
tion’s social knowledge [ 14]. Nutley, Walter and Bland [ 70]
revealed that developing mechanisms to bring analytical
government staff together wit h their policy counterparts in
a case of drug misuse facilitated research use. They
highlighted policy fora as a use ful way of bringing analysts
and officials together on a regu lar basis and also suggested
co-locating analysts and officials as a potential option. Peir-
son et al. [ 30] described the creatio n of tighter internal
webs through established learning networks centred around
capacity-building activities such as clubs for critical ap-
praisal, reference managing or method application [30].
Having semi-autonomous ‘multi-disciplinary and multi-
agency teams’ was reported by three reviews [14, 50, 52]a n d
one empirical study [70] as enabling research use by balancing
input from specialists and generalists, respectively. This factor
is derived from two reviews based on DoI theory [14, 50]. We
did not find any support for this factor instead of innovation
adoption in the empirical studies, perhaps because it is still an
understudied area in policy-making.
None of the factors under the subcategory ‘knowledge
management systems, and systems and methods for in-
ternal research generation ’ were highly supported by re-
search. The ‘availability of a comprehensive knowledge
management system for research use ’ has been sug-
gested, albeit with insufficient evidence, as an effective
way of aiding EIDM [ 53]. Such a system should contain
easy, accessible internal and external data, previous re-
view search strategies and results (mentioned earlier by
repositories of research findings), research integration
tools and available systems for searching, collating and
applying research, templates and manuals as well as all
materials for documentation and auditing [ 30].
Institutional structures and rules for policy-making
Thirty-three studies on all policy-making levels have
contributed to the general category of ‘institutional
structures and rules for policy-making ’. This category
contains the explicit and implicit institutional rules and
procedures that enable research to be integrated into
policy-making and used in a rational, democratic
Jakobsen et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:90 Page 16 of 22
<<<PAGE=17>>>
manner. The factors in this overall category stem from
studies on civil servants and external policy actors.
Under the subcategory ‘political environment’,t h eo n l y
factor highly supported by research is ‘funding and commis-
sioning of research ’. This includes the statutory commit-
ment to fund, commission and use commissioned studies
and activities that support th e pull strategy of research use
by policy-makers. The funding of research centres or the
commissioning of particular re search projects are included
in this factor, together wit h standard procedures for
commissioning research. The division between‘funding and
commissioning of research’ under this subcategory, and the
factor ‘government and academia collaborative research ’
under the ‘inter-organisational communication and collab-
oration’ subcategory, is a distinction between the pull strat-
egy of research by policy organisations and an interactive
approach to research generation.
Many studies mentioned political will and support of re-
search as facilitating research use, but often without further
clarification. When clarified, the legislative support of the
implementation of evidence-informed policies and for the de-
velopment of internal capacities for evidence-informed
policy-making were mentioned as supporting factors [16, 77].
Additionally, Tabak et al. [ 45] found that political support
was considered important for local governmental officials
when developing sustainable policies and programmes. They
also found that political support was existing in local health
departments that had high capacity in developing sustainable
policies and programmes, and the support was lacking in de-
partments with low capacity.
The factor ‘establishing platforms for engaging all stake-
holders across sectors in policy discussions ’ was identified
in two reviews and two empirical studies, where research
evidence is discussed with all stakeholders to find a con-
sensus about the available research evidence. One review
and four empirical studies provided support for the im-
portance of an ‘open and transparent policy-making
process that creates opportunities for public input and
transparent policy procedures’.
The scoping review findings show that external research is
mostly used during agenda-setting, when it is openly a sub-
ject of discussion by all stakeholders. The outcomes also in-
dicate that research integration would benefit if this process
is led by policy organisations . Strong leadership guiding the
research integration (or know ledge translation) process is
paramount to effective research use in policy organisations.
This means that policy organisations should have internal re-
search capacity, research on policy know-how, and coordin-
ation capacity to involve external stakeholders in each
policy-making phase.
The subcategory of ‘implicit rules and preferences on
how to make policy ’ encompasses factors that are linked
to the implicit rules of conduct and the preferred traits
of organisational members; it is embedded in the
organisation’s culture. We used the term ‘value’ to cover
both rules of conduct and preferred traits. Two factors
have been identified as highly supported by research
under this subcategory. The factor ‘high value placed on
rationality, professionalism, speciality, measurement,
evaluation and quality improvement ’ is closely associated
with a rational action approach and new public manage-
ment. This factor contains the view on professionalism
and the integration of a rational approach in a not-so-
rational policy process, which is believed to be the ability
to balance “gold standard systematic reviews with prag-
matic, rapid reviews that gain in timeliness and accessi-
bility what they lose in depth and detail ” [76].
The second most highly research-supported factor in
this subcategory is the ‘shared importance and high
value of research in policy-making as part of the organi-
sation’s culture ’. This factor includes a direct focus on
the significance and value of research use as a funda-
mental part of policy-making. This entails shared agree-
ments and commitment among the organisation ’s
members about the importance and value of research
findings; this is supported by peers ’ endorsement of re-
search and operationalising commitment. This factor is
directly linked to ‘efforts to create an organisational cul-
ture favouring research use ’, which falls under the ‘stra-
tegic commitment toward research use ’ subcategory.
Organisational characteristics
The general category of ‘organisational characteristics ’
covers factors associated with the characteristics of the
organisation (such as its size and functioning, policy-
making level and geographic location). Only nine studies
have contributed to this category, and none of the fac-
tors are highly supported by research (Fig. 3). The pri-
mary contributing study examined policy-makers at
different levels in diverse sectors, without providing a
clear definition other than people identified as making
policy-related decisions. The rest of the studies investi-
gated civil servants at different policy levels, with a
slightly increased focus on multi-level policy-making.
Despite the lack of research in this overall category,
several factors seem worth investigating further (e.g. the
location of policy organisations as well as the complexity
and size of organisations). However, for several factors
in this overall category, further debate is needed on the
usefulness of conducting research in this area.
Discussion
This scoping review identified 14 reviews and 40 empir-
ical studies that included organisational factors used in
facilitating research use in policy organisations. These
studies allowed us to identify some overarching themes
concerning organisational factors that positively affect
research use. Furthermore, we were able to identify 64
Jakobsen et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:90 Page 17 of 22
<<<PAGE=18>>>
organisational factors that facilitate research use. Out of
these 64 factors, 27 were reported by seven or more
studies, including at least one review. We developed a
conceptual map of the organisational factors that pro-
vides a comprehensive overview of the organisational
factors. This map clearly demonstrates a close link be-
tween individual factors and organisational factors in re-
lation to research use.
Our synthesis confirms the importance of an intra-
organisational perspective when exploring research use.
This shows that many organisational factors are critical
facilitators of research use. It also shows that many fac-
tors and mechanisms are understudied [ 18].
Few studies provided comprehensive theoretical applica-
tion for hypothesis testing, making better study designs
with theory application and testing in this area pertinent.
Additionally, the studies seldom included politicians as
the study population, which we believe are important
members of the policy organisation. Therefore, we would
like to encourage a discussion about who are members of
policy organisations in order to fully grasp the organisa-
tional factors of research use for policy-making.
Empirical reflections
The review findings indicate that policy organisations are
very sensitive towards extern al factors such as the institu-
tional arrangements in the country, external policy actors
(including funding agencies), collaboration with other institu-
tions and public opinion. Therefore, research use within pol-
icy organisations should not be examined in a vacuum, but
rather, the organisational factors should be framed in such a
w a yt h a tt h i ss e n s i t i v i t yt oe x t e r n a lf a c t o r si sd e p i c t e d .
Policies are informed by both internal and external re-
search. Internal research activities are integrated into
policy more easily than external research (e.g. systematic
reviews). Future research could benefit from distinguish-
ing between internal and external investigations and the
different types of studies used for policy-making.
Factors related to the creation of systems and a good
infrastructure for research use have shown much prom-
ise. Focus has primarily been on access to repositories of
external research whereby other facilitating factors seem
necessary to explore further (e.g. tailored dissemination,
personal access to an internal expert and comprehensive
knowledge management systems). Additionally, the re-
sults related to the management of research integration
indicate that an internal management of capacity-
building, functional research integrating procedures, per-
formances and organisational structures are some of the
key ingredients in successful research integration
strategies.
The creation of a political environment that aids research
use is often an area outside organisational management;
however, it seems there may be several intra-organisational
factors that can influence perceptions of research among
politicians. Therefore, this is not a top-down stream of in-
fluence (e.g. cross-sector collaboration and influential mem-
bers of an organisation). For instance, when reflecting on
the ‘political environment’ subcategory from the angle of
organisational culture, despite the lack of sufficient evi-
dence, it seems that the political environment is a precursor
to the formation of implicit rules and preferences favouring
research use. However, evidence is still needed on the role
of politicians in developing evidence-informed policies and
how to increase preferences for research among politicians.
Many of the empirical studies depicted the complexity of
research use when it enters the political arena and competes
with other kinds of evidence. However, some studies showed
promise through applying open and transparent processes
when introducing and integrating research [ 52, 53, 59, 60].
Our scoping review findings related to low-resource countries
demonstrated that international donors and partners (such as
the WHO) are more active stakeholders in getting research
e v i d e n c eo nt h ep o l i c ya g e n d at h a ni nh i g h - r e s o u r c ec o u n -
tries. This fact highlights the significance of partnerships
in places where research evidence can be discussed, re-
search priorities identified and consensus about the evi-
dence built. However, further examination is needed to
advance our understanding of the role of the members of
political organisations in coordinating structured and
trusted partnerships as well as more open and transparent
discussions about research in different policy contexts.
Based on the importance of individuals ’‘competences and
being able to champion research use in a political setting ’,
one might further argue that there is a need for more evi-
dence to facilitate understanding of which strategies are
most effective in integrating research into policy decision-
making that go beyond just improving research capacity.
In relation to the individual f actors, our findings support
the need to look into age-related factors to find better reasons
for research use. One example of such a factor would be the
association between a high decision-making authority and re-
search use on the one hand and incentives for younger or re-
cently graduated policy-makers to use research on the other.
For the development of strategies to increase research
use, we would like to underscore the seriousness of
assessing the policy environment and organisational cul-
ture before implementing strategies for research use.
Moreover, keeping the focus on actual policy processes
and the need for research to support policy-makers in
fulfilling their tasks shows much promise.
Theoretical reflections
Even though many of the factors enabling research use
are linked to a traditional rational action approach (e.g.
evidence-based policy), other facilitating factors are
linked to a more flexible approach toward research inte-
gration (e.g. EIDM), where studies from different sources
Jakobsen et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:90 Page 18 of 22
<<<PAGE=19>>>
and types are mixed together to fit particular policy
needs and the political environment.
This review reveals that, in the field of policy-making
and organisational research use, DoI theory has been
harnessed to examine the use of external research prod-
ucts (e.g. systematic reviews) and to design knowledge
translation interventions. However, with so few studies
identified and their different applications of the DoI the-
ory, it is important to make further theoretical contribu-
tions to this theory, for instance, to test its applicability
for internal research generation and knowledge ex-
change as well as its ability to capture the political as-
pects of research use in diffusion processes.
The SPIRIT Action Framework stems from a multi-
component intervention trial, which has allowed exten-
sive time and effort to go into developing and testing
both the framework and several intervention tools and
measures of effectiveness [ 15]. This framework therefore
seems to be the most comprehensive and applicable
framework for interventions within the field of evidence-
informed policy-making, which includes organisational
factors. However, the framework and tools developed
within it are still being tested for further validation [ 82].
Our synthesis of the literature reveals a lack of polit-
ical theories in studies on research use and evidence-
based/informed policy-making. This was also recently
stressed by Cairney [ 83], who suggested several theories
to comprehend research use in policy-making. Best and
Holmes [ 84] provided another interesting perspective in
understanding research in policy organisations through
complex actors and systems thinking.
The framework provided by Contandriopoulos et al.
[12]o n “collective-level knowledge use ” provides a good
basis for further research into policy organisations. How-
ever, Contandriopoulos et al. refrained from elaborating
on the cultural components intertwined with the institu-
tional rules, norms and procedures influencing research
use in policy areas. Nonetheless, they have synthesised a
wide range of empirical knowledge and theories that
deepen understanding of the complex relationship(s) be-
tween policy and research, including theories useful for
grasping the intra-organisational perspective on research
use.
We found the functional roles of research by Lomas
and Brown to be very useful in terms of practically un-
derstanding the different functions and roles research
has when supporting various kinds of policy decisions.
Furthering our understanding in this area can support
researchers in becoming more helpful to policy organisa-
tions. Political uses of external research are most appar-
ent during agenda-setting. In this regard, it is critical to
explore the effectiveness of lobby strategies by re-
searchers in increasing the influence of their research on
policy. It is also important to deepen understanding of
politicians’ judgement criteria of research evidence, and
to what extent research evidence should abide by the
same principles as other kinds of proof when being con-
sidered in a public policy-making process.
Despite increased efforts to update the existing evi-
dence and theory basis of research utilisation, we still
need frameworks that combine different approaches and
theories to help us grasp the complex organisational
mechanisms that facilitate research use in policy settings.
This can aid us in developing causal models for inter-
ventions, aiming to expand research use in policy-
making [ 17, 52].
We see great potential in more research applying the-
oretical lenses based on political and organisational cul-
ture theories. Such research might add useful contextual
comprehension of research use and helpful intervention
strategies for employing research in policy organisations.
Study strengths and limitations
Using a scoping review methodology, we were able to
extensively map the intra-organisational factors of re-
search use in policy-making (including individual fac-
tors) and empirically validate theories in this area.
For our exploratory mapping exercise, we narrowed our
search down to three databases. However, we are
confident that the large number of included reviews pro-
vided a good basis for our mapping and that our explora-
tory approach resulted in a generic concept map that can
be used to guide further investigations from different re-
search disciplines (such as political and implementation
science and organisational studies), thereby adding nu-
ances to our understanding of the causal mechanisms of
research use in policy organisations.
A challenging but worthwhile choice was to only focus
on the factors facilitating research use. This allowed us to
centre on the positive factors and change mechanisms,
which are vital to developing causal models for interven-
tions. However, we would like to stress the importance of
also identifying barriers related to research use in policy-
making processes for intervention purposes.
By applying the thematic content analysis to published
material, we embarked on challenging terrain; we ac-
knowledge that the factors reported in the material have
already been subject to theoretical reflections, which we
were only able to incorporate into our exploratory ana-
lysis to a limited degree.
In our study, we encountered several multi-level and
multi-faceted constructs such as ‘research receptive cul-
ture’, ‘learning organisation ’ and ‘readiness for change ’.
These constructs were difficult to decompose in our pur-
suit of identifying factors instead of constructs, especially
if the authors did not provide sufficient details of the con-
struct and the underlying factors.

Conclusions
By applying a scoping review methodology and a the-
matic content analysis to extract data on organisational
factors that facilitate research use, we were able to
present an extensive number of organisational factors di-
vided into five main categories (i.e. individual factors,
the management of research integration, organisational
systems and infrastructures of research use, institutional
structures and rules for policy-making and organisa-
tional characteristics), 18 subcategories and a total of 64
specific factors. In addition to the summary of reported
factors, we provided an overview of the characteristics of
the included studies, showing that the main contribution
of research is from healthcare and population health and
that all levels (national/federal, state/regional and dis-
trict/local) of policy-making have been explored. Very
few studies have used politicians as the study population
or have not distinguished between elected and non-
elected policy-makers. We provided a theoretical outline
of the research and demonstrated a wide range of differ-
ently applied theories; however, there is a need for more
theoretically founded research.
The goal of this synthesis was to create an overview of
intra-organisational factors that can be used for further re-
search and to guide the development of theories and causal
models for research use in poli cy organisations. Despite in-
creased efforts to update the existing evidence and theory
basis of research utilisation, we still need frameworks that
combine different approaches and theories to help us grasp
the complex organisational mechanisms that enable re-
search use in policy settings. Among other things, this can
help us build causal models for interventions, aiming to in-
crease research use in public health policy-making.
