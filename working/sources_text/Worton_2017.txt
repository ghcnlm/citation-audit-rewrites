Evidence to Impact
A community knowledge mobilisation 
evaluation f ramework
Within community-based prevention initiatives, there is often 
a disconnection between research and practice (Waddell 
2001). Although extensive effort and substantial resources are 
invested in the development of community-based interventions, 
the uptake of these interventions in practice has often been 
minimal and short-lived (Leadbeater 2010). This disconnect 
between research and practice could be the result of a lack of 
effective knowledge-sharing activities, narrow definitions of what 
constitutes uptake and use of research knowledge (Henry & Mark 
2003), or a combination of the two.
The process through which evidence-based practices are 
shared with practitioners who implement them has evolved and 
has been refined over a number of decades. A growing body 
of recent literature in this area includes the development of 
models illustrating the process of moving knowledge into action 
(Graham et al. 2006), as well as new interactive strategies for 
sharing knowledge (Wandersman et al. 2008) that address many 
limitations of passive knowledge-sharing strategies (e.g. reports, 
lectures). Despite many advances in connecting research and 
practice, the gap between research and practice persists (Neal 
et al. 2015). It is becoming increasingly evident that the process 
of sharing knowledge is complex and idiosyncratic. Effectively 
sharing knowledge requires different strategies depending on 
who is sharing the knowledge, what knowledge is being shared, 
how it is shared, and the purpose for which it is shared (Ward 
2016). Certain strategies for sharing knowledge, such as passive 
information dissemination and the use of audits and feedback, 
have been deemed inappropriate for community settings (Kothari 
& Armstrong 2011; Miller & Shinn 2005). This highlights the 
importance of carefully tailoring knowledge-sharing strategies to 
the learning needs and goals of those who are interested in using 
the information to create positive change. This article focuses on 
the process of knowledge mobilisation in community settings and 
has three aims:

2 To present a framework to evaluate knowledge mobilisation 
that captures knowledge use for community stakeholders’ goals 
3 To refine the framework by applying it.
Before proceeding, it is necessary to briefly explain our 
choice of terminology. A variety of terms are used in the literature 
to describe activities that connect ‘knowledge-to-action’ (Graham 
et al. 2006). Terms such as mobilisation, translation, transfer, 
dissemination and exchange have different disciplinary origins 
and can be used to distinguish different approaches (Ottoson 
2009). However, as practice in knowledge sharing advances, 
distinctions between these terms are becoming blurred, with 
many terms being used interchangeably. In this article, we use 
knowledge-to-action to refer to the general process of connecting 
research and practice. In the framework we propose, we have 
opted to use the term ‘knowledge mobilisation’ to convey a 
specific process of sharing knowledge that has been co-created by 
researchers and community stakeholders in one jurisdiction with 
community stakeholders in other jurisdictions who may benefit 
from applying this knowledge locally. Knowledge mobilisation 
has been formally defined as ‘the reciprocal and complementary 
flow and uptake of research knowledge between researchers, 
knowledge brokers and knowledge users—both within and beyond 
academia—in such a way that may benefit users and create 
positive impacts within Canada and/or internationally’ (Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council 2016).
KNOWLEDGE MOBILISATION IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS
Much existing knowledge-to-action theory and practice has 
been developed for clinical or policy settings rather than 
community contexts. Community settings can be conceptualised 
as organisations that provide services to the public or to specific 
populations at a local level, are often guided by a board of 
directors, and engage community members in forming the 
organisation’s strategic direction (Wilson et al. 2010). Examples 
include community-based organisations, public and non-profit 
organisations, and some direct service providers (Wilson et al. 
2010). In community contexts, there are many stakeholder groups 
involved in knowledge mobilisation, including organisational 
staff, board members, policy-makers or funders, and community 
members who benefit from the organisation’s services or are 
engaged as volunteers. Knowledge-to-action theory and practice 
literature contains a wide variety of strategies, including highly 
passive strategies and strategies that require extensive stakeholder 
engagement. There is therefore a need for more extensive research 
to determine which approaches work best in particular contexts 
(Walter, Nutley & Davies 2005). 
Many knowledge-to-action strategies commonly used in 
clinical settings (e.g. passive information-sharing, audits and 
feedback, the voice of opinion leaders, cost analysis) have been 
applied to community settings despite a lack of evidence regarding

their effectiveness in the community context (Kothari & Armstrong 
2011; Miller & Shinn 2005). This is likely because of power 
imbalance between researchers and community/stakeholders 
(Isenberg et al. 2004) which results in researchers selecting 
knowledge-to-action strategies based on assumptions that do not 
necessarily hold true in community settings (Miller & Shinn 2005). 
Two assumptions appear to be particularly problematic for sharing 
research evidence with community stakeholders: 1) the assumption 
that knowledge producers and knowledge users have similar 
values and approach innovation in the same ways, and 2) the 
assumption that implementation of an evidence-based program or 
practice is the end goal for community stakeholders. 
The assumption of similar values and approaches to 
innovation is challenged by evidence suggesting that community 
stakeholders are often interested in holistic programs and 
ecological outcomes while researchers are more focused on 
targeted interventions and individual outcomes (particularly in 
clinical settings) (Kothari & Armstrong 2011; Weiss, Lillefjell & 
Magnus 2016). Researchers also tend to hold a ‘pro-innovation 
bias’ (Miller & Shinn 2005), prioritising newly developed 
evidence-based programs over existing practices that may appear 
beneficial but lack evidence. Community stakeholders often prefer 
to innovate through the evolution of existing programs using 
local knowledge rather than through implementing external 
initiatives (Kothari & Armstrong 2011). Differences in approaches 
to innovation likely stem from differences in what is considered to 
be evidence. Researchers often define evidence narrowly in terms 
of empirical research and emphasise rigour, while community 
stakeholders often define evidence more broadly in ways that 
include experiential knowledge and practical wisdom, and 
emphasise practical utility (Bowen & Martens 2005; Kothari & 
Armstrong 2011; Miller & Shinn 2005). Regarding the second 
assumption of similar approaches to implementation, researchers 
often view implementation of evidence-based practice as the 
ultimate goal of knowledge-to-action efforts, while community 
stakeholders may prioritise new ideas or changes in thinking 
(Bowen & Martens 2005). Implementing an innovation in practice 
is often a considerably more complex task than it appears to be 
in knowledge-to-action models (Greenhalgh & Wieringa 2011). 
This is especially true in community settings, where organisations 
often work collaboratively and are unlikely to move independently 
to implement a new evidence-based approach without consulting 
others in their network (Bowen & Martens 2005; Kothari & 
Armstrong 2011; Weiss, Lillefjell & Magnus 2016). Many evidence-
based practices are expensive, and communities may lack the 
resources to implement a program in its entirety (Miller & Shinn 
2005) and instead opt to use the information to shape their 
thinking or to enhance existing programs. 
Sharing knowledge via strategies that are inappropriate for 
community contexts may perpetuate impressions that research

and practice are separate ‘worlds’ and impede meaningful 
connection and collaboration between researchers and community 
stakeholders. Effective evaluation of knowledge-sharing activities is 
essential to better understand how community stakeholders apply 
information and to continuously improve knowledge-sharing 
strategies tailored for community settings. 
Knowledge-to-action strategies considered to be most 
appropriate for community settings often involve collaborative 
efforts to generate and share knowledge. Engaging community 
stakeholders in community-based participatory research 
approaches where they are actively involved in the production 
of knowledge alongside researchers is a means of promoting 
knowledge sharing (Wilson et al. 2010). Another recommended 
strategy is to conduct evaluative research on strong grassroots 
community initiatives. This provides an opportunity to 
strengthen existing local practices by developing an evidence 
base and identifying core components of these programs and 
initiatives that can be adopted by other communities (Miller & 
Shinn 2005). There is a need for effective knowledge-to-action 
strategies that can be used to convey these core components across 
communities to maximise the benefit of existing community-
based research and assist communities in learning from one 
another. Identifying the processes through which information 
can be shared most effectively among community stakeholders 
requires the development of knowledge mobilisation strategies 
tailored to community audiences. In order to understand how to 
tailor strategies to community audiences, it is necessary to evaluate 
knowledge mobilisation and refine the strategies employed based 
on what works and what could be improved. 
EVALUATING KNOWLEDGE MOBILISATION
Despite the existence of numerous knowledge-to-action strategies, 
minimal attention has been directed towards evaluating knowledge 
mobilisation. Much of the existing research evaluating knowledge-
to-action initiatives is focused on implementation and the 
examination of more advanced phases of implementation to assess 
fidelity of the program to the original model (Durlak & DuPre 
2008). In knowledge mobilisation of evidence-based community 
initiatives, an overemphasis on implementation can result in a 
narrow lens through which to examine community uptake and 
use of the knowledge shared (Henry & Mark 2003) for three main 
reasons. First, there are many different forms of knowledge use. 
Knowledge can be used conceptually to change perspectives or ways 
of thinking, persuasively to influence the thinking and decisions of 
others (such as funders or local decision-makers), or instrumentally 
to make tangible changes to practices (Leviton & Hughes 1981). 
Second, evaluators focused on implementation may be unable to 
foresee the ways in which community stakeholders may adapt the 
knowledge to apply it in practice. This tension between adaptation 
and fidelity is important to recognise, as there is the risk that

knowledge shared could be applied in ways that don’t produce 
the outcomes promised by the program, or worse be misused to 
the detriment of organisations or citizens (Cousins 2004). One 
way of addressing the tension around fidelity vs adaptation is to 
emphasise the importance of fidelity to core components (i.e. ‘key 
ingredients’) of the evidence-based practice that are considered to 
be necessary for the success of the innovation (Hawe, Shiell & Riley 
2004; Miller & Shinn 2005). However, this approach is not perfect 
as it raises questions regarding the extent to which it is realistically 
feasible to identify and validate core components of every program 
(Miller & Shinn 2005). Third, knowledge utilisation is often a 
long-term process in which adaptation is considered ‘inevitable’ 
(Ashley 2009). Adapted knowledge becomes harder to track during 
evaluation, and the use of knowledge is more difficult to attribute 
to a specific knowledge mobilisation initiative when it has been 
adapted (Blake & Ottoson 2009).
To address some of these challenges, we present, in the next 
section, a new framework designed to facilitate the evaluation 
of short-term knowledge use in community settings. We have 
developed this framework to fit a specific niche: the evaluation of 
short-term knowledge use across communities. This niche exists 
between the immediate evaluation of mobilisation activities using 
ratings of satisfaction, perceived relevance and usefulness (Loiselle, 
Semenic & Côté 2005) and long-term implementation evaluation 
assessing the planning, implementation and sustainability of 
new programs or innovations in a single community (e.g. Stetler 
et al. 2011; Wandersman et al. 2016). Our proposed framework is 
intended for evaluating the effectiveness of knowledge mobilisation 
and capturing different forms of knowledge use in the pre-
implementation phase. Pre-implementation activities involve early 
engagement of community members (by researchers engaged in 
knowledge mobilisation), opportunities to discuss feasibility of the 
program or initiative in the community setting, and consideration 
of community readiness in terms of resource reviewing and cost 
planning (Chamberlain, Brown & Saldana 2011).
COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE MOBILIZATION EVALUATION 
FRAMEWORK 
Foundation of the Framework
We propose the Community Knowledge Mobilization Evaluation 
(CKME) Framework as an approach to evaluating knowledge 
mobilisation that is designed to capture various forms of 
knowledge use within community settings. Rather than focusing 
on implementation of a specific program, this framework is 
intended for knowledge mobilisation efforts undertaken to convey 
the key components of a community-based initiative in a way that 
promotes adaptation and uptake by community stakeholders and 
allows them to use the information in ways that meet their needs. 
Our approach to evaluating knowledge use positions social impact 
as the ultimate goal. Social impact is ‘a consequence of a process

in which knowledge and expertise circulates to achieve certain 
goals that are deemed relevant for the development of society’ 
(Spaapen & van Drooge 2011, p. 212).
As mentioned previously, the various terms used to 
describe the process of sharing knowledge emerged from different 
disciplines. These terms represent knowledge-to-action theories that 
differ based on what information is shared (e.g. policies, programs, 
research findings) and how it is shared (e.g. communication, 
marketing, implementation) (Ottoson 2009). The CKME Framework 
draws upon knowledge-to-action theories from a number of 
disciplines to inform key evaluation questions. We incorporate 
questions on the effectiveness of different formats used to convey 
the information to community stakeholders (e.g. resources, 
workshops, discussion forums) developed by drawing on knowledge 
translation theory in medicine and public health (Ottoson 2009). 
The process of understanding how information is transferred and 
shared among community stakeholders is based upon knowledge 
diffusion theory in communication studies (Rogers 1995). We have 
informed considerations of knowledge non-use and the matter of 
context in understanding justifications for non-use by drawing 
upon knowledge utilisation theory in program evaluation (Cousins 
2004). The overarching concept of ‘pathways of influence’, in 
which evidence informs actions intended to facilitate positive 
social change (Henry & Mark 2003), is also based in knowledge 
utilisation literature. 
Description of the Framework 
The pre-application version of the CKME Framework is presented in 
Figure 1. The purpose of the framework is to help identify questions 
to guide examination of varying forms of use that link the social 
impact goals of the original innovation (from which knowledge is 
being mobilised) with the social impact goals guiding knowledge 
use by community stakeholders. Rather than focusing on observable 
outcomes, this framework guides evaluators to examine the process 
of knowledge sharing and knowledge use. The components of the 
framework are linked to specific questions that draw information 
from community stakeholders and are of sufficient breadth to 
capture varying forms of knowledge use. By framing the evaluation 
process in terms of alignment between the knowledge mobilisation 
activities and the social impact goals of information use, the 
evaluation process remains flexible by capturing varying forms of 
use (conceptual, persuasive, instrumental). 
Although it is possible (and likely beneficial) to take a 
mixed-methods approach to evaluating knowledge mobilisation, 
our framework is primarily intended to guide the qualitative 
component of evaluation designs. Much of the information the 
framework is designed to gather can be best gained through 
interviews with stakeholders who have participated in knowledge 
mobilisation activities. Additionally, the CKME Framework is 
designed to be used in a one-time follow-up evaluation of the 
knowledge mobilisation activities three to five months after

stakeholders have received the information to allow sufficient time 
for them to begin incorporating the information into their roles 
and networks. The three to five month timeframe also provides the 
flexibility necessary to accommodate the yearly schedule cycles 
of community organisations to avoid periods when participants 
may be unavailable (e.g. end of fiscal year, school summer/
winter breaks) or to capture periods of program planning or the 
development of new initiatives (e.g. funding application cycles).
APPLYING THE COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE 
MOBILIZATION EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 
To demonstrate the use of the CKME Framework and refine the 
framework further, we applied it to a transnational knowledge 
mobilisation initiative for an evidence-based early childhood 
development project called ‘Better Beginnings, Better Futures’ 
(Better Beginnings), which is an early childhood initiative with the 
primary goal of promoting the healthy development of children 
and families in economically disadvantaged communities (Peters 
1994); it is designed to (a) prevent developmental problems, and 
(b) build capacity of parents, families and neighbourhoods to 
support healthy child development. Since the late 1980s, this 
government-funded multi-site project in eight communities in 
Ontario, Canada (Grant & Russell 1990) has taken an innovative 
approach to mental health promotion, engaging community 
residents in developing programs for children. Programs must be 
ecological and holistic, community-driven, integrated with existing 
community services and universally available to children and 
families (Grant & Russell 1990; Peters & Russell 1994; Worton et 
al. 2014). Longitudinal research followed children (aged 4 to 8) 
and families in 3 of the 8 project sites and found positive effects 
of participation of children at several points in the life span, 
including the most recent assessments when they reached Grade 12 
(Peters, Bradshaw, et al. 2010; Peters, Nelson et al. 2010). 
To share the lessons learned with other communities, 
researchers engaged in a one-year pan-Canadian knowledge 
mobilisation plan. The team developed interactive workshops 
and delivered them in 7 Canadian provinces and 1 of 3 territories 
(Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, 
Québec, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon) as well as a set of resource

materials in English and French covering the following topics 
(available at bbbf.ca) (Hayward et al. 2011): history, program 
model, research and evaluation, community resident participation, 
engaging community partners, project organisation and 
management, and working with government and other funders. 
Workshops were scheduled at the request of host community 
organisations and based on the availability of the presenters. 
In applying the CKME Framework, we describe the short-term 
evaluation of the Better Beginnings knowledge mobilisation 
activities designed to examine how communities are utilising the 
information shared (if at all) and to understand the motivations 
and contextual factors influencing use. Two primary research 
questions guided our application of the CKME Framework: 
1 To what extent do knowledge mobilisation activities meet the 
information needs and learning goals of participants? How 
could the activities be changed to better meet these needs and 
goals?
2 To what extent is the information presented in the knowledge 
mobilisation activities being used by participants in their 
communities 3 to 5 months following the workshop? 
a. What contextual factors influence this use/non-use?
b.  What goals or expected outcomes do participants using the 
information hope to achieve?
Method
We used a stratified random sampling strategy to select a sub-
sample of 5–6 participants from each province/territory to 
participate. Participants’ primary perspective in attending the 
workshop (community member/parent, volunteer, employee with 
an organisation serving children, government policy) was used 
for stratification. In a rare case where all participants from a city 
indicated the same primary perspective, we used an intensity 
sampling method in which workshop hosts (i.e. community 
leaders/local workshop organisers) were asked to identify specific 
workshop participants who could provide in-depth information 
on the topics of interest. In cases where fewer than 5 individuals 
from a region agreed to participate in interviews, we included 
each of these participants in the sub-sample. This was the case 
in 2 provinces. Interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of 
participants engaged in a larger mixed methods evaluation that 
included ratings of satisfaction and readiness for implementation. 
Although French language knowledge mobilisation activities 
took place in the provinces of Québec and New Brunswick, the 
present study includes only stakeholders participating in the 
English language activities due to limited resources available for 
translation of the interview materials and limited capacity to 
conduct interviews in French.
Thirty-one individuals participated in this study. Eight 
participants attended a workshop in Ontario, 5 in Alberta, 3 in 
Manitoba, 4 in Nova Scotia, 6 in Saskatchewan, and 5 in the

Yukon. Of these participants, 19 identified their primary perspective 
as employees of an organisation serving children, 6 as government/
policy, 1 as a volunteer with an organisation serving children, 1 as 
having multiple primary perspectives (employees and government/
policy) and 4 opted not to specify. Although community members/
parents were invited to knowledge mobilisation workshops, no 
participants in this study identified their primary perspective as a 
community member/parent. Two participants identified themselves 
as male, and 29 identified as female. 
Qualitative phone interviews (approximately 30 minutes) 
were conducted with workshop participants using a semi-structured 
guide with questions about learning goals, information gained 
and information used. Interviews were digitally recorded and 
transcribed for coding. Data analysis was guided by the CKME 
Framework and consisted of five steps: 1) reviewing transcripts 
to identify key concepts, 2) forming an initial coding scheme, 3) 
developing thematic codes that encompassed multiple concepts, 4) 
reviewing themes by conceptual linkages and hierarchies, 5) creating 
definitions for each theme (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Hsieh & Shannon 
2005). Rigour and trustworthiness of findings were enhanced 
through an audit trail of the primary researcher’s observational, 
methodological and theoretical memos (Amis & Silk 2008). 
FINDINGS
The findings of the evaluation are presented in the CKME 
Framework’s four main sections: learning goals, knowledge use, 
process of knowledge use, and outcomes of knowledge use. The first 
findings section addresses the first research question regarding the 
effectiveness of knowledge mobilisation in meeting participants’ 
learning goals. The next three sections address the second research 
questions regarding knowledge use, contextual factors influencing 
use (or non-use), and participants’ intended outcomes for use. 
Assessing Learning Goals and Information Needs 
Overall, the knowledge mobilisation activities offered met 
the knowledge goals of participants. Most participants 
approached the workshop and resources to gain knowledge 
of the initiative, the core principles and unique aspects of its 
approach, and the best practice findings. Interacting with other 
attendees to discuss relevance and to build connections also 
was important. Participants who were building or enhancing 
existing local initiatives prior to attending the workshop sought 
tangible strategies for building engagement/partnerships and 
procedural information. Participants generally indicated that the 
workshop and resources met their learning needs by providing 
a comprehensive overview of the program and incorporating 
sufficient detail, commenting that the information shared was high 
quality and well presented. 
I think the presentation was really quite good. It was in very clear 
language, very easy to understand, very easy to follow, and gave

great examples of how this has been such a success story. The videos 
that had interviews [with staff] who were actually running a Better 
Beginnings program were really quite good.
Some participants stated that the workshop provided a 
valuable starting point in sparking discussion regarding how 
Better Beginnings might fit with their local communities. Many 
participants indicated that more practical information on applying 
the information would be a valuable addition and desired more 
time for discussion and interaction with other attendees. 
The one-day training was good in providing that really good 
snapshot … It gave us a big overview, but didn’t allow enough time 
for us to really dig into each section and figure out what exactly 
worked, what didn’t, and what were the strategies that were really 
successful. 
Assessing Knowledge Use and Non-use 
Most participants interviewed indicated that they had used 
the information from the workshop and/or the resources; some 
participants noted not having had opportunities for use prior to 
the interview. Key reasons for non-use appeared to be a perceived 
lack of organisational readiness, or limits of one’s role, or reticence 
of organisational hierarchies to engage in discussions about new 
initiatives and system changes. 
The workshop gave me very good grounding … and should we get 
to the position where [we] were actually working towards achieving 
something similar I think it would be very helpful at that point, but 
we aren’t at that position at the moment.
The principles … fit really well with two major large scale research 
projects that are going on in our province … but who moves ahead 
with that really gets determined by the superintendent. 
Many participants had used and shared the information 
to reinforce some of the values and approaches already present 
in their work. Participants’ experiences in using knowledge 
gained from the knowledge mobilisation activities illustrated a 
combination of many forms of use. One form of use was to inform 
new perspectives. Many participants indicated that the initiative’s 
principles reflected what they were already doing in some of 
their existing programs (e.g. 50 per cent resident participation in 
program committees). 
I think some of the information in here has helped frame that 
conversation about why it’s important to have community residents 
share equal partnership or have equal roles within a coalition. 
There is that tendency to think that service providers are the experts 
and community residents are kind of there to learn from the service 
providers when in actuality I think that it’s the opposite. So getting 
that 50/50 partnership … that is an ongoing conversation.

Resident participation had previously been a missing 
component for some participants. 
We already have a whole array of programs and services in [our 
province], and a lot of them are aligned and centralized in one area. 
What we wanted to take away from this was, how do we connect 
what we already have to community members and parents and 
give them a voice, and so we really used the information that was 
developed through Better Beginnings to integrate into our programs, 
what we were already doing with communities.
The core components of Better Beginnings were also 
used for comparing existing practices and identifying new 
strategic d irections.
We used it to evaluate our own practice and then to say, ‘what are 
we already doing?’ and ‘where are our gaps?’ to evaluate where we 
could make improvement.
For some, the resources provided a starting point 
for discussion to reflect on the fit between Better Beginnings 
and community needs and the possibility of developing a 
similar i nitiative.
[The Toolkit] was a discussion starter for those who were coming to 
the workshop. They were able to then decide whether it’s a good fit 
for the neighborhoods and that gave us a population of people to 
speak with or to connect with or to follow up with. It gave us the tools 
to understand what resources we would need, what kind of support 
we would need – political support, financial support — and  
what the role would be of the community organization if we  
were to move ahead. 
Another form of use was acquiring new resources 
and implementing new practices. A number of participants 
described using the knowledge to find resources needed to 
implement new programs. 
I used [the resources] to help with a number of grant proposals ... 
to be able to have additional empirical … and theoretical support. 
Now we have more fire power, more tools in our tool kit more backup 
when we’re saying ‘we need this’ because we actually have really 
good reasons and we have really good documentation. The grant 
review that I’m sitting for next week is a $20,000 neighborhood 
grant and it’s my opinion that the research that I was using from 
Better Beginnings is part of the reason why.
Another participant was involved in efforts to implement 
the initiative, but the community was still in the process of seeking 
resources to support it.
We are planning on implementing Better Beginnings, Better Futures. 
Chats with politicians and forming a steering committee made up 
of 50% community members are the next steps. [A challenge is] 
funding – stabilized funding. Whenever we talk to anybody about

implementation of any program, it’s ‘oh that sounds great, where 
are we going to get the money for it?’ Well there is no money so the 
discussion ends pretty quickly … I’ve had a chance to touch base 
with MPPs, Councilors and school board super-intendants. They 
listened and said, ‘oh that sounds like a good idea, good luck!’
In another community, the availability of resources and 
support of political stakeholders facilitated faster implementation 
of the program model in a community resource centre initiative. 
We basically used Better Beginnings as our model as we pushed 
forward. After we attended the workshop we were really excited 
and fired up that this … was the model that we’ve been looking 
for. Everything just fell right into place perfectly for us…We worked 
really hard and we managed to get individuals with[in] the city to 
really buy-in … The two tools that we used were the … summary  
and the video. The video is a wonderful tool. We’ve used that in 
numerous presentations and every time we send out funding  
requests we send that link along so that people have an idea of where 
it is we want to go. 
These findings demonstrate that participants use the 
information in various ways, including sharing information 
and starting discussions within their organisations or networks, 
enhancing existing programs, or starting a new initiative using 
Better Beginnings as a model. 
Early Outcomes and Social Impact Goals Guiding Use
Most participants indicated it was too early to identify tangible 
outcomes from their use of the Better Beginnings information. It 
was clear that participants using the information had been able 
to accomplish outputs such as establishing new relationships with 
stakeholders (e.g. local politicians), acquiring resources or taking 
steps towards acquiring resources for new community initiatives, 
and generating meaningful discussion and new strategies for 
engaging parents in developing community programs for children. 
We had good partnerships with professionals and with schools, but 
we did not have partnerships with parents as well-developed as we 
do now.
Parents are now attending parent-child programs whereas before 
they were always cancelled.
Participants who had used the information applied it for one 
or more of the following long-term goals: increased resident/parent 
engagement in programs for children and families, improvement 
of early childhood intervention services/supports, promotion of 
children’s health and wellbeing, and increasing the capacity of 
families to support healthy child development. Many of these 
goals were central to participants’ work and were being advanced 
through multiple community initiatives, including community 
coalitions, participatory research, new programs for parents 
and families, prevention promotion, and the development of

community resource centres for children and families. Participants’ 
information use supported initiatives with evidence, acting as an 
established example of core components necessary for achieving 
program goals. Communities used the information on core 
components to identify gaps, and strategies to fill those gaps, as 
well as to draw upon the evidence base and established long-term 
impact of Better Beginnings to advance new programs or initiatives 
that used similar approaches. 
The whole thing is a community development process, it’s all slow, 
and it all means you have to take the lead from those who do it not 
just those of us who have our hands on the pulse of what is new and 
exciting and the best practices.
I’m looking to build family capacity in addition to engaging the 
community so that families are less insular and reliant on poor 
practices and they adopt healthier practices. Ultimately it would 
be to make sure we’re building engagement with other communities 
and agencies. We are very inter-dependent and we have to 
acknowledge that.
Two communities were implementing the Better Beginnings 
model. One community indicated they were working to implement 
the full Better Beginnings initiative. The other was actively 
using the model to guide efforts to develop a ‘hub’ for children 
and family services after identifying gaps in their existing 
services. Participants in other communities were actively using 
the information shared to make changes in local services and 
programming to advance the Better Beginnings’ goal of promoting 
the healthy development of children and families in economically 
disadvantaged communities through: 1) the prevention of 
developmental problems, and 2) by enhancing the capacity of 
parents, families and neighbourhoods to support the healthy 
development of children (Peters 1994). Notably, many of these 
goals were central to the overarching work of the participants 
and extended beyond the utilisation of knowledge generated from 
Better Beginnings. However, each of the participants who used the 
information used it to enhance the overall goal of early childhood 
development through resident engagement, partnerships among 
stakeholders, connections between communities and schools, with 
a focus on prevention of mental health issues, and development of 
new programs for children and parents. 
In summary, the application of the CKME Framework 
to Better Beginnings knowledge mobilisation activities led to 
participants’ learning needs being met, with the exception of 
the need for adequate discussion and interaction time amongst 
participants. This knowledge changed perspectives on existing 
community services, increased understanding of the key 
components of the Better Beginnings initiative, helped participants 
identify gaps in community programs and services, informed steps 
towards adopting missing components, and facilitated acquisition 
of (or advocacy for) resources and support for new initiatives

or practices (e.g. grants and/or generating political support). 
Instances of non-use among participants were minimal, occurring 
for those who did not have decision-making authority or those 
in communities lacking capacity. Overall, the Better Beginnings 
knowledge mobilisation activities were valuable for community 
stakeholders, and many used the information gained to inform 
and advance existing community initiatives aimed at improving 
services for, and promoting the wellbeing of, children and families. 
FRAMEWORK REVISIONS
Although the original CKME Framework worked well for the 
evaluation presented above, our application informed the need for 
further development of the framework to better capture knowledge 
use (Figure 2). The overarching linear pathway between knowledge 
mobilisation activities and social impact outlined in the early 
framework was not completely conducive to the flexible process of 
knowledge use, in which stakeholders use information as a tool to 
advance existing community initiatives rather than as a catalyst 
for the development of brand new initiatives. For this reason, we 
have changed the model to highlight the importance of the link 
between the social change goals of the original innovation or 
evidence-based practice (and subsequent knowledge mobilisation 
activities) and the broad social impact goals of the community 
stakeholders. This change shifts the emphasis from brand 
new community initiatives and the assumption of knowledge 
mobilisation as a catalyst to focus on the alignment of goals 
between the evidence-based practice and the overarching goals 
of the stakeholders using the information. We also modified the 
presentation of the forms of knowledge use by replacing technical 
(i.e. conceptual) terms with a multi-dimensional component 
depicting specific knowledge use activities. The cyclical nature 
of the new knowledge use component is intended to capture the 
finding that stakeholders are often engaged in multiple forms of 
use simultaneously, often for the purpose of achieving a single 
outcome. To encourage greater depth in participants’ responses, 
we have revised and clarified the wording of some of the questions 
included in the CKME Framework. 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CKME FRAMEWORK
The CKME Framework is a useful tool to assist researchers in 
identifying pathways between knowledge mobilisation activities 
and participants’ application of the knowledge to create positive 
social change for the populations they serve. Researchers engaged 
in collaborative work with communities require strategies for 
evaluating knowledge mobilisation to inform what works in what 
context (Walter, Nutley & Davies 2005). It is important that these 
evaluation strategies be functional and useful in situations where 
resources for evaluating knowledge mobilisation are limited. Some 
existing approaches to evaluating knowledge-to-action strategies 
focus on the effectiveness of the strategies in producing a specific 
behaviour change among knowledge users. These approaches

to evaluation are more common in clinical settings than in 
community settings (Kothari & Armstrong 2011) and make use of 
resource intensive research designs, such as randomised control 
trials and comparison groups (Bhattacharyya, Estey & Zwarenstein 
2011) to identify best practice. This approach to evaluation, 
although appropriate in some settings, is a poor fit for knowledge 
mobilisation involving community stakeholders, who may use the 
information in unpredictable or less obvious ways. In this article, 
we have focused the development of our framework on evaluation 
of the short-term impact of knowledge mobilisation activities on 
advancing community-driven social change initiatives that align 
with the goals of the evidence-based practice being shared. Our 
main objective in designing the framework was to create a tool for 
researchers that would be useful in identifying the early outcomes 
of knowledge mobilisation activities and capture how community 
stakeholders choose to apply knowledge given their local context 
and goals. 
This approach to evaluating knowledge mobilisation has 
some limitations. Asking individual stakeholders about their 
use of knowledge often fails to capture knowledge applied at the 
organisational or community level; nonetheless, the approach 
provides insights into organisational actions. The use of self-
reporting methods introduces potential bias, e.g. offering socially 
desirable responses (Bhattacharyya, Estey & Zwarenstein 2011). 
Despite its limitations, the approach we propose has important 
benefits as a tool for short-term evaluations of knowledge 
mobilisation activities aimed at sharing evidence-based practices 
generated through community-engaged research and action.

The main advantages of the CKME include its simplicity and 
utility, and its flexibility to capture multiple forms of knowledge 
use in context.
Simplicity and Utility 
The CKME Framework is designed to be short term and pragmatic, 
and to require minimal resources. The simplicity of the format 
makes it effective for evaluating broad knowledge mobilisation 
efforts that aim to share information with a wide range of 
community stakeholders. This approach to evaluation works well 
for a knowledge mobilisation initiative like Better Beginnings, 
where knowledge mobilisation is conducted for the purposes 
of ‘scaling out’ (sharing knowledge widely across community 
stakeholders) (Moore & Westley 2011) and introducing new 
concepts to settings where professional relationships or connections 
between the researchers and communities are not yet established. 
The utility of the framework was an important consideration 
in its design as researchers engaged in community knowledge 
mobilisation efforts may require an evaluation strategy that 
captures early outcomes and allows them to meet short-term 
evaluation requirements of the funders supporting the knowledge 
mobilisation activities. Although the framework has been designed 
to be used in the short term, it can provide a basis on which to 
further engage in additional knowledge mobilisation activities or 
identify alternative audiences. In the case of the Better Beginnings 
evaluation, researchers could follow up and build relationships 
with the communities engaged in implementing the program 
to help them maintain core components of the program and 
alignment with program theory as they adapt the program locally 
(Lee, Altschul & Mowbray 2008). Researchers could also follow 
up on barriers to knowledge use by ‘scaling up’ and intentionally 
engaging stakeholders who hold decision-making roles and have 
the capacity and political influence to create change (Moore & 
Westley 2011).
Flexibility to Capture Multiple Forms of Knowledge Use 
in C ontext
Capturing varying forms of knowledge use is central to the 
applicability of the framework in community settings. Participants 
working in communities are likely to use the information gained in 
varying ways, some of which impact community services directly 
and others that influence services indirectly. The application 
of the CKME Framework to the Better Beginnings knowledge 
mobilisation activities demonstrated the importance of taking a 
broad approach to evaluating and assessing use. If the evaluation 
had focused only on implementation of Better Beginnings, results 
would have shown minimal evidence of uptake during the time 
period. The approach outlined in the framework has advantages 
over evaluation strategies that involve assessing only participant 
satisfaction or perceived usefulness (Chambers et al. 2011). 
Assessing both the extent to which the activities met participants’ 
learning goals and the ways in which participants used the

information provides insight into individual-level outcomes (e.g. 
participant satisfaction and changes to attitudes or knowledge) 
and into some organisational outcomes (e.g. using the information 
to acquire resources for new programs) or community outcomes 
(e.g. enhanced relationships and networks among stakeholders). 
Examining contextual factors underlying instances of non-use (e.g. 
competing priorities, organisational structure) can inform decisions 
regarding additional knowledge mobilisation efforts in these 
communities and inform future knowledge mobilisation strategies. 
Long-term Implications
Use of the CKME Framework has long-term implications for 
academics and community stakeholders as it facilitates the 
improvement of knowledge mobilisation and supports the 
transition to full implementation and sustainability of evidence-
based practice in community settings.
Continuing evaluation informs ongoing improvement 
of knowledge mobilisation strategies and the fit of particular 
strategies with the community context. Careful examination 
of fit is valuable in ensuring knowledge mobilisation activities 
are an effective use of time and resources for both community 
stakeholders and academic researchers. Numerous new strategies 
for knowledge mobilisation have emerged with advancements 
in digital communication and social networking (e.g. online 
workspaces or portals, web conferencing, podcasts) and ongoing 
evaluation is needed to examine the value of different strategies 
in different contexts. Findings regarding the effectiveness of 
knowledge mobilisation strategies in community settings (gained 
from application of the CKME Framework) can be used to inform 
the training of researchers as well as the hiring, education and 
professional development of knowledge mobilisation officers and 
scholarly communications officers at academic institutions. 
As seen in the case study presented, communities engaged 
in knowledge mobilisation activities can draw upon the evidence 
base for innovative programs/practices to advocate for support 
and resources to implement programs/practices or to adapt 
existing community programs by incorporating evidence-informed 
components. The CKME Framework is helpful in capturing 
varying forms of use including (but not limited to) instrumental 
use leading to full implementation. Use of the CKME Framework 
can help researchers identify communities intending to progress 
from the pre-implementation phase to more advanced stages of 
implementation of an evidence-based practice. Researchers can 
then draw upon frameworks in the implementation evaluation 
literature to support communities in undertaking longer term 
consideration of program outcomes, fidelity and sustainability. 
Future Research
Further application of the CKME Framework to the mobilisation 
of other community-based initiatives is necessary to inform and 
refine future iterations of the approach. Although the application

of the framework to Better Beginnings is informative, application 
to other knowledge mobilisation initiatives for community-based 
practices may produce different findings. Better Beginnings is 
an initiative that was developed and evaluated over a 20-year 
timeframe. Knowledge about Better Beginnings has been published 
and shared at various stages of the project through traditional 
academic avenues (e.g. monographs, journals, conferences) 
and Better Beginnings programs developed as a part of the 
demonstration project still run in a number of communities and 
receive provincial funding. Existing awareness of the principles 
of Better Beginnings may have set the stage for faster and more 
extensive knowledge uptake and use. 
The Better Beginnings knowledge mobilisation activities 
aimed to provide many different communities and community 
organisations across Canada with an introduction to the Better 
Beginnings approach. This pan-Canadian knowledge mobilisation 
strategy prioritised breadth in engaging many communities for 
a short period of time. Future research on the application of the 
framework to a knowledge mobilisation initiative that is locally 
focused and prioritises depth of information and long-term 
engagement would allow for further exploration of the utility of 
the framework. This application would provide the opportunity 
for deeper exploration of instances of use and non-use in the pre-
implementation phases of evidence-based practice implementation, 
and could allow for the triangulation of responses across different 
stakeholder groups and for deeper exploration of social impact 
over time. Another valuable direction for future research is the 
adaptation of the framework to examine knowledge mobilisation 
at baseline. Adapting the framework to gather information on 
context, learning goals and initial learning outcomes prior to or 
immediately following knowledge mobilisation activities could 
enhance existing baseline evaluation approaches that focus on 
participant satisfaction. 
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we developed the Community Knowledge 
Mobilization Evaluation Framework and applied it to establish 
how the framework could help illustrate the effectiveness and 
impact of knowledge mobilisation activities. In conducting the 
evaluation, we were able to document the numerous forms of use 
of the information shared and better understand the strengths 
of knowledge mobilisation activities and identify ways to 
improve these activities in the future. These positive results are 
encouraging for researchers and can help to enhance awareness 
of the importance of evaluating knowledge mobilisation activities, 
as well as further improve ways that evidence developed through 
community-based research activities can be shared for maximum 
social impact. The framework is a step towards addressing the gap 
in literature examining the fit between knowledge mobilisation 
strategies and the information needs of community stakeholders.
