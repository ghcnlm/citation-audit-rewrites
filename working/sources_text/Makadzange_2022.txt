Introduction
Literature suggests that development of national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems in 
advanced economies started around the eighties followed by Latin America around the nineties. 
In Africa, such developments came in much later in the new millennium (Goldman et al. 2018). 
Public sector reforms adopted by many African countries accelerated the development of their 
national M&E systems. The pressure to do so came from the ever-rising expectations from its 
ordinary citizens to see delivery of government services with higher standards of quality (Chirau, 
Waller & Mapisa 2018). Other pressures came from the civil society demanding governments to 
publicly report on performances as well as from international donors’ pressure on governments 
to measure the outcomes and demonstrate the impact of the donor funded social and economic 
programmes (Cakici 2016).
Tanzania, South Africa, Uganda, Rwanda, Bennin, Zimbabwe and Botswana are top seven African 
countries that adopted such public sector reforms (Porter & Goldman 2013). For instance, in 2001 
Uganda endeavoured in a reform to improve government performance, accountability and 
transparency of which the implementation resulted in a rapid growth of the country’s national 
M&E system. On the other hand, Tanzania built its national M&E system through the 
implementation of a reform called Mkukuta (Edmunds & Marchant 2008).
Background: Literature demonstrates that when it comes to institutionalising national 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems, some African countries such as South Africa, 
Benin and Uganda are quite advanced. In the new millennium, more countries such as 
Zimbabwe and Botswana engaged in similar processes. However, there is still little 
documentation on such processes. This article thus attempts to bridge the documentation gap. 
Objectives: To explore the current standing of Zimbabwe and Botswana against the gold 
standards of institutionalisation of national M&E systems.
Method: An exploratory study design was used to estimate the level of institutionalisation of 
the two national M&E systems. An International Atlas of Evaluation framework originally 
developed in year 2002, by three scholars namely Furubo, Rist and Sandahl was adopted as a 
guiding framework for the research. An online survey method was employed to gather the 
required quantitative data. Data analysis was carried out through the International Atlas of 
Evaluation assessment tool and the scores to determine the level of institutionalisation were 
generated. The output was displayed through graphs and tables.
Results: Overall, while Botswana received a score of 48 % on the International Atlas of 
Evaluation scale, Zimbabwe got 53%. These scores indicate that the two countries have attained 
a rather average level of institutionalisation and are still lacking in terms of meeting the 
expected gold standards. 
Conclusion: There is significant progress in both countries towards fully institutionalising 
their national M&E systems. However, more is yet to be realised before attaining the 
expected gold standards. It is recommended that both countries emulate and leverage on those 
African countries with much more advanced national M&E systems such as South Africa.

According to Sibanda and Makwata (2017), efforts in 
Zimbabwe to build a national M&E system came in through 
the implementation of the Zimbabwe Agenda for 
Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim Asset) 
reform. Efforts in Botswana to develop a national M&E 
system were made through the implementation of public 
sector reforms under the Vision 2016 and Vision 2036 
transformational agenda (Lahey 2013). Rwanda adopted an 
array of public sector management reforms aimed at 
increasing accountability, transparency, and the level of 
participation in government by its citizens. These reforms 
also stimulated institutionalisation of the national M&E 
system (Murindahabi 2016). South Africa developed its 
national M&E system around reforms such as the new 
public management reform which resulted in the setting-up 
of the department of planning, M&E in the presidency and 
also in the adoption of national evaluation policy framework 
(Goldman et al. 2019).
The above-mentioned examples demonstrate that to date, 
many developments have happened on the African continent, 
although they are not yet extensively documented. This article 
thus bridges the gap by documenting the institutionalisation 
of national M&E system that happened so far in Zimbabwe 
and Botswana.
Research aim and questions
This research established the extent to which Zimbabwe and 
Botswana have institutionalised their national M&E systems. 
This aim was reached through answering the following 
question: What is the current situation for Botswana and 
Zimbabwe as compared to the gold standards for a fully 
institutionalised national M&E system?
Background and the conceptual 
framework
In this section, a conceptual framework used to estimate the 
level of institutionalisation of the national M&E system for 
Zimbabwe and Botswana is presented. A background of 
what is meant by a national M&E system is presented first to 
provide the context.
Defining a national Monitoring and Evaluation 
system
In literature, the term national M&E system is used 
interchangeably with other terms such as government-wide 
M&E system and a M&E system for government. Generally, 
like any other national systems, a national M&E system is 
comprised of people and structures that manage and 
implement the M&E processes and it is linked to the 
existing government structures and mechanisms. However, 
as Mackay (2007) long noted, as with many things in 
international development, the precise definition of a national 
M&E system varies and there is no best model of what a 
national M&E system should look like. In most cases, a 
national M&E system refers to all the structures, indicators, 
tools and processes used to measure if government policies 
and development programmes are being implemented 
according to the plan and if they have produced the desired 
result (Leeuw & Furubo 2008).
A national M&E system is defined in the South Africa policy 
framework for the government-wide M&E systems as a 
set of organisational structures, management processes, 
standards, strategies, plans, indicators, information systems, 
reporting lines and accountability relationships which 
enable the government to discharge M&E functions (Mackay 
2007). Leeuw and Furubo (2008) identified the presence of 
stakeholders who share a common understanding of the 
objectives of the M&E system; existence of an organisational 
structure that typically oversees planning, tendering, 
implementing, quality-checking and following-up on the 
evaluations; existence of certain permanence or history in 
the M&E practice as the critical elements that can denote a 
national M&E system. Other elements featured in the 
UNAIDS (2008) framework that can possibly define the 
structure of a national M&E system include a well-defined 
organisational structure with written mandates for 
planning, coordinating, and managing the M&E system. It 
also includes a network of departments responsible for 
M&E at the national and sub-national levels, human 
capacity and adequate skilled human resources at all levels 
of the M&E system. Other requirements include policies 
and regulations that govern M&E practices, as well as 
presence of a platform for data dissemination and utilisation 
(UNAIDS 2008).
Institutionalisation of a national Monitoring and 
Evaluation system: Its meaning
Lázaro (2015) understood the institutionalisation of a national 
M&E system as a process of turning M&E practice into a 
regular phenomenon in a governmental setting. Similarly, 
Gaarder and Briceño (2010) understood the institutionalisation 
of a national M&E system as a process of channelling isolated 
and spontaneous M&E efforts into formal and systematic 
approaches, on the presumption that the latter provide a 
better framework for fully realising the potential of the M&E 
practice in the government. 
The ability to engage with diverse stakeholders and secure 
their trust, while maintaining the integrity of the M&E process is 
the acid test for the institutionalisation process (Lázaro 2015). 
Earlier on, Varone, Jacob and Winter (2005) noted that the 
process of institutionalising a national M&E system is 
understood as a ‘systematization’ of the expected, if not 
compulsory, recourse to M&E, which can also be measured by 
its level of implementation within public administrations, 
political bodies and policy networks. This means, to determine 
the institutionalisation of an M&E system the most obvious 
approach would be to measure the existence of formal 
organisations and the constitution of an epistemic community 
(Varone et al. 2005). Therefore, as it stands, such various 
opinions stated by scholars which were cited demonstrate 
that there is no one clear path of understanding the meaning 
of institutionalising a national M&E system.

Conceptual framework
Some attempts have been made to try to understand the 
institutionalisation of national M&E systems through the 
use of conceptual frameworks. One existing framework in 
the literature is the Furubo et al. (2002) framework called the 
International Atlas of Evaluation framework. This framework 
was first developed in 2001 when three scholars (Furubo, 
Rist & Sandahl) made a claim that for a national M&E 
system to be said to have fully institutionalised, there must 
be an arrangement of indicators that demonstrate so. Based 
on this claim, they came up with a domains-based framework 
which they used to present what they called an atlas of the 
present global situation regarding evaluation systems. 
To build this framework, the scholars conducted a study 
covering 21 countries across five continents. Based on the 
results of the study, they presented the atlas in the form of a 
book that comprises 21 country-specific chapters in which 
evaluation systems were described. In 2011, Furubo et al. 
conducted a replicated study using the same framework, 
although with some minor modifications. This time around 
the framework was modified to have indicators measuring 
nine domains of which all must be fulfilled as a gold standard. 
Thus, if a nation positions high on a domain, it was given a 
score of 2, with 1 speaking to a medium worth, and 0 to a low 
or non-existent level of action. This background demonstrates 
the merits of a framework that was built over a period of a 
decade and endured validation test through two major 
studies, one in 2001 and the other in 2011.
Therefore, leveraging on Furubo et al. (2002) framework, the 
framework as depicted in Figure 1 was adapted to assess 
the national M&E system for Zimbabwe and Botswana. 
The adapted framework consists of 12 domains that need 
to be fulfilled to meet the gold standards of a fully 
institutionalised national M&E system. Although presented 
in a circular manner, these domains are interlinked and can 
be developed at the same time. The modifications were 
introduced to make the framework more applicable to the 
context of developing African countries (Botswana and 
Zimbabwe) because the earlier framework was predominantly 
used for developed countries. The 12 domains of the adapted 
framework are detailed as follows:
• Domain 1: Pervasiveness of M&E: M&E activities are clearly 
frequent in most of the public sector and are regarded as 
an integrated part of the whole public sector. Thus, when 
M&E becomes a regular phenomenon in the country, it 
takes place in many sectors such as health, education, and 
agriculture.
• Domain 2: Diffusion and pluralism of M&E praxis:  There is 
a supply of M&E practitioners from different academic 
disciplines who have mastered different evaluation 
methods attracted to work in the field of M&E and who 
conduct and provide advice regarding M&E.
• Domain 3: National discourses/dialogue on M&E:  There is a 
national discourse concerning evaluation in which more 
general discussions are adjusted to the specific national 
environment. The country has M&E and performance 
management issues on its political agenda. The country 
holds regular national seminars and conferences on M&E.
• Domain 4: Existence of M&E professional organisations/
bodies: M&E stand out as an independent profession in 
the country with M&E practitioners having their own 
societies, networks, or frequent attendance at meetings of 
international societies and at least some discussion 
concerning evaluation standards or ethics. 
• Domain 5: Existence of national institutional arrangements to 
support and promote M&E:  The country has a permanent 
oversight body with well-developed structures and 
processes for conducting and disseminating M&E work 
at national level. The country has a national development 
planning system that takes M&E as a regular and 
integrated feature of the planning process.
• Domain 6: Existence of institutional arrangements in parliament 
to support and promote M&E: Members of parliament often 
adopt provisions, laws and constitutional amendments 
based on M&E information and that the parliament 
assesses and debates national development programmes 
performance using M&E information.
• Domain 7: Pluralism of M&E institutions and existence of 
M&E capacity building efforts:  This criterion is obviously 
intended to capture the degree of pluralism. The country 
has many government institutions and private 
consultancy firms that provide M&E services and there 
are efforts by the government, the private sector and non-
governmental organisations (NGOs) to strengthen the 
capacities of M&E personnel.
• Domain 8: Level of utilisation of M&E information in the 
country: The country has a culture of using M&E 
information to guide national planning. Monitoring and 
Evaluation information from both government and 
private sector and NGOs is widely disseminated and 
readily available in the public domain.
• Domain 9: Existence of policies and regulations that govern 
M&E practices: The country has a separate law or act or 
regulation that explicitly reflects or stipulates the 
requirement to monitor and evaluate public programmes 
and there is a national M&E policy that promotes the 
involvement and participation of stakeholders in M&E.
• Domain 10: Existence of powerful stakeholders in critical 
institutions supporting M&E efforts: There are clear 
stakeholders championing the development of a national 
M&E system in the country. And there are efforts to 
include oversight agencies and civil societies in the 
overall capacity building programmes for strengthening 
M&E practices.
• Domain 11: Existence of a democratic system that promotes 
M&E: In the country, there is a regular demand from civil 
society and the general public for transparency and 
accountability of decision-makers and M&E practitioners 
perform their M&E work free from political influence.
• Domain 12: Promotion of impact and outcome evaluations:  In 
the country, the use of outcome indicators has been 
popularised by national laws and that impact evaluations 
have been added to existing M&E practices in the country.
The 12 domains described above thus denotes the gold 
standards for an institutionalised national M&E system which 
countries should strive to attain. Therefore, this study was 
designed to explore the current situation in the two countries 
against the outlined gold standards as described next.

Research design and methodology
An exploratory study design was chosen for this study 
because there were limited earlier studies focusing on the 
institutionalisation of national M&E systems that could be 
referred to or relied upon to guide this study. A survey method 
was used to collect the quantitative data. The process involved 
collecting responses from M&E practitioners through a 
SurveyMonkey based questionnaire. A purposive sampling 
method that embraces a non-randomised or non-probability 
sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the 
survey. A non-probability sampling method was deemed 
most appropriate for this study because it allowed selection of 
members of the target population, in this case M&E 
practitioners with the likelihood to provide the most valuable 
data addressing the research objectives. The rationale for 
using this strategy emanate from the fact that the intention of 
this study was not of making generalisations (i.e. statistical 
inferences) from that sample to the population of interest, 
hence there was no need to randomly select units from the 
population to create a representative sample.
A total sample of 346 M&E practitioners was purposively 
selected for Zimbabwe and 368 for Botswana. The 
questionnaire had a demographic section that also 
included background information question such as how the

respondents describe themselves in terms of their professional 
identity. The questionnaire also had a Likert scale section 
asking the respondents to express their opinion by indicating 
the extent to which they agree or disagree with each 
dimension statements under the 12 atlas domains.
The data was downloaded from the SurveyMonkey system 
as an excel data set and then uploaded into the International 
Atlas of Evaluation Assessment tool. A code was then run in 
the tool to combine the respondents’ scores into an aggregate 
rating. The tool contained 12 domains with two to three 
dimensions under each domain. For each dimension, a range 
of possible scenarios was provided allowing for objective 
and quantitative rating. The highest score given for a fully 
institutionalised scenario considered ‘highly adequate’ was 
4. The lowest score depicting an un-institutionalised scenario 
was 0 thus when the situation is regarded as ‘not adequate’ at 
all in terms of meeting the institutionalisation gold standard. 
Therefore, for each dimension a sum score was calculated by 
adding up scores from each respondent, and then dividing 
the total by the count to generate an average score. This 
average score was then compared against the maximum 
possible score to yield a percentage rating score. Table 1 
presents the percentage rating scores and the corresponding 
legend for the colour code and description.
As presented in Table 1, for example, the interpretation is that if 
a country gets a score more than 80%, which is green, it means 
the country has met the gold standard in that domain. Therefore, 
the two countries were rated based on this criterion in Table 1.
Ethical considerations
Because the survey involved collecting information from 
human subjects, I conducted it in accordance with three basic 
ethical principles, namely, respect for human beings, 
beneficence, and justice. To be ethical and to comply, 
submissions to relevant research ethics committees for review 
and granting of approval or exemption was done. Ethical 
clearance to conduct this study was obtained from the 
Stellenbosch University Ethics Review Committee (reference 
number: CREST-2017-1754). The research protocol also 
obtained ethical clearance from the Review Board in Botswana 
and Zimbabwe. Identities of those who participated in 
completing the SurveyMonkey survey were properly 
protected. All participants were informed about their rights of 
informed consent and refusal. Before the respondents 
completed the survey, due care was taken to ensure that 
informed consent is obtained by sending an email letter 
inviting the respondent to take part in the survey, including 
explanations about the purpose and objectives of the survey, 
the procedure to be used, the benefits and risks accruing, the 
rights of respondents, and reassurance on confidentiality. In 
the database, the respondents were recognised through unique 
identification numbers instead of names. All data records were 
securely kept for safety and confidentiality during the whole 
study period. The language and words used in this study were 
neutral, without bias to any person regardless of gender, 
sexual orientation, racial or ethnic group, disability, or age. The 
study is thus regarded as a low-risk study and had no explicit 
risks to the study subjects, but its findings informed processes 
for further developing national M&E systems in the region.
Results
The focus of the analysis was to measure the level of 
institutionalisation of the national M&E system for the two 
countries as defined by the scores given to each domain in 
comparison to the gold standard. As presented in Figure 2, 
Zimbabwe has institutionalised its national M&E system up 
to 53% while Botswana is at 48%.
The two overall scores presented above suggest that both 
countries are gradually approaching halfway in their journey 
to fully institutionalise their national M&E systems. For us to 
have an in-depth understanding of the countries’ overall scores 
described above, Figure 3 is presented to demonstrate the levels 
at which each country is at for each of the domains assessed.
As presented in Figure 3, the centre score in the diagram 
demonstrates that both countries have done around 50 % of 
the efforts to fully institutionalise their national M&E system. 
The domain specific scores circling around highlight existing 
areas of weaknesses and strengths. For example, Zimbabwe 
has a total of one domain that is still in the red zone, while 
Botswana has two. In eight domain areas both countries are 
doing relatively well. It is only three areas for Zimbabwe and 
two areas for Botswana that are showing signs of full maturity. 
Thus, Zimbabwe scored above 60 % in three of its domains 
and 40% – 60% for the majority (9) of the domains, and below 
40% for two of the domains. Comparatively, Botswana 
demonstrated higher levels in two of the domains where it 
scored above 60%, in eight of the domains the scores ranged 
from 40% to 60%, and less that 40% in two of the domains.

Discussion
This section presents a qualitative comparative discussion of 
the gold standards against the current situation as depicted 
by the quantitative results in Figure 3. This comparison in 
turn provided a qualitative explanation on why each country 
was given that rating and ultimately articulates the factors 
necessary for institutionalising national M&E systems. These 
factors are vital for African M&E Voluntary Organisations for 
Professional Evaluation (VOPEs) which are seeking to help 
build and further strengthen their national M&E systems. 
As literature suggest, the process of institutionalising national 
M&E system is not a one-off exercise, but a journey that 
progresses over a span of time. Until all the domains outlined 
in the Atlas framework are fully developed, a national M&E 
system may not be deemed to have institutionalised. Based 
on this notion, the fact that Zimbabwe was given a rating of 
53% and Botswana a rating of 48% strongly suggest that both 
countries have not yet fully institutionalised their M&E 
system. However, such scores can also suggest that both 
countries are progressing steadily towards that goal.
Current situation in comparison to 
the gold standards
The observations on the current situation are discussed in the 
following sub-sections.
Pervasiveness of Monitoring and 
Evaluation practice
Zimbabwe was given a rating of 73 % and Botswana 63 % on 
this domain. The reasons for getting such high scoring is 
the observation that M&E practice pervade across various 
sectors in both countries. These sectors include: economic 
development, social welfare, agriculture, public policy, 
public health, education, and environment. This is a gold 
standard when it comes to the institutionalisation of 
national M&E systems. However, there is an observation 
that the practice is more intense in education, health, and 
agriculture. The reason being that such areas have been 
receiving donor support for quite some time. This finding 
concurs with that of the study conducted by Jacob, Speer 
and Furubo (2015), where evaluation practices also came 
out to be unevenly distributed. They found evaluation 
activities in the fields of education, health, social policy, 
education, development aid, to be the most intensively 
evaluated (Jacob et al. 2015).
Diffusion and pluralism of Monitoring and 
Evaluation praxis
Zimbabwe was given a rating score of 60 % while Botswana 
got a very low rating score of 34 %. An explanation to this 
disparity is that in Zimbabwe there is a higher supply of 
M&E practitioners from different disciplinary backgrounds 
specialising in different methods attracted to work in the 
field of M&E. However, for Botswana the situation on the 
ground is that there are still limited number of institutions 
conducting M&E with rather monolithic perspectives. 
The gold standard is that a national M&E system can fully 
institutionalise once the country has built a large pool of 
trained experts in the field of M&E with diverse backgrounds. 
National dialogue in Monitoring and Evaluation
Under this domain, Zimbabwe was given a rating score of 
50% and Botswana 48 %. The reason being that in both 
countries national dialogue on M&E is indeed happening, 
although not at the gold standard levels. The gold standard is 
that countries should hold regular dialogue on M&E at 
national level. Countries such as South Africa do make such 
attempts mainly through The South African Monitoring 
and Evaluation Association (SAMEA) biannual conferences. 
A similar trend was noted in other counties with advanced 
national M&E systems. For example, Jacobs et al. (2015) 
noted a widespread proliferation of discourses in countries 
such as Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, United States and 
Japan. It is recommended that Zimbabwe and Botswana 
promote more dialogue through their M&E associations.
Existence of Monitoring and Evaluation 
professional organisations
Zimbabwe was given a rating score of 50 %. However, 
Botswana got a much lower score of 30 %. The main reason 
being that Zimbabwe do have an active Evaluation Society 
while Botswana do not have one. The gold standard is that 
countries should have vibrant M&E Associations fully 
supported by the government. Examples include South 
Africa whose SAMEA has a closer link with the government. 
Norway has an evaluation network operated by the 
Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Management, 
Switzerland has an Evaluation Network of the Federal 
Administration which exists alongside the Swiss Evaluation 
Society, and the United States has a National Legislative 
Program Evaluation Society (NLPES) which was created 
within the National Conference of State Legislatures 
(Jacob et al. 2015). It is recommended that Botswana 
should reactivate its dormant association.
National institutional arrangements that 
support Monitoring and Evaluation
Zimbabwe got a score of 48% and Botswana 50%. The reason 
being that both countries did a good job in setting up an 
oversight M&E coordinating unit within the president’s 
office. Thus, in 1994, Zimbabwe established a National 
Economic Planning Commission (NEPC) under the Office 
of the President and Cabinet (OPC) with specific 
responsibilities for M&E. Botswana in 2007 formed the 
Government Implementation Coordination Office (GICO) 
within the OPC to coordinate the M&E processes for all 
major government projects. This has been the gold standard 
practice for most countries with fully institutionalised 
national M&E systems. For instance, as noted by Jacob et al. 
(2015), Korea did the same to place the M&E coordinating 
office in the Prime Minister’s office. South Africa has a 
similar arrangement. In Sweden, several autonomous
<<<PAGE=8>>>

agencies are wholly or partially dedicated to evaluation. In 
Canada and Israel, all government departments have an 
evaluation unit and have had so for decades. In Spain, there 
is the National Evaluation Agency. Within Japan’s Ministry 
of Internal Affairs and Communication, the central unit has 
more than 100 employees dedicated to evaluation. It is 
therefore recommended that both countries provide further 
leadership and technical expertise and secure legal and 
constitutional powers to drive M&E in government 
ministries.
Institutional arrangements in parliament to 
support Monitoring and Evaluation
Zimbabwe scored 38 % and Botswana 44 % on this domain. 
The reason for getting low scores being that there are no 
adequate institutional arrangements present within the 
parliaments for supporting M&E. In both countries, 
members of parliament often do not adopt provisions, laws 
and constitutional amendments based on M&E findings. 
The gold standard is that parliamentarians should have 
access to M&E data and their debates should be data driven. 
In the Netherlands, the use of evaluation results in 
parliamentary discussions has risen significantly, especially 
concerning development aid. In Norway, it is a common 
practice to present evaluation results in White Papers, 
which are then discussed in parliament. Evaluation findings 
are often scrutinised by the various parliamentary 
committees in the United Kingdom (Jacob et al. 2015). It is 
therefore recommended that Parliamentarians in Zimbabwe 
and Botswana join and become more active in platforms 
such as the African Parliamentarians’ network on M&E 
development.
Pluralism of Monitoring and Evaluation 
institutions and Monitoring and Evaluation 
capacity building efforts
Zimbabwe scored 62 % and Botswana 49 % on this domain. 
The explanation is that in Zimbabwe there are more 
government institutions and private consultancy firms that 
provide M&E services than in Botswana. Also, Zimbabwe 
has more universities and training institutions offering 
M&E related degree and post graduate programmes. 
Botswana has limited pool of individual M&E practitioners 
from different disciplines and limited number of institutions 
offering training except for Institute of Development and 
Management. The gold standard is that countries should 
have more universities offering M&E related undergraduate 
and post graduate degree programmes as well as creating 
enabling environments for M&E. For example, South Africa 
do have two initiatives, both located in universities as 
host institutions of evaluation: the CLEAR initiative at the 
University of the Witwatersrand and Crest at the University 
of Stellenbosch. The Crest Centre more specifically focuses 
on high level specialist course in evaluation leading to both 
post-graduate diplomas and to degrees up to and including 
a PhD (Basson 2012).
Utilisation of Monitoring and Evaluation 
information
Zimbabwe scored 45% and Botswana 43% implying that the 
utilisation of information in both countries is not extensive. 
The gold standard is that governments should promote the 
utilisation of M&E information for planning and decision 
making. That way a culture for information use grows which 
is the core element for the institutionalisation of the national 
M&E system.
Policies and regulations to govern Monitoring 
and Evaluation practice
Zimbabwe scored 47 % and Botswana 42 %. The reason 
being that in Zimbabwe, an evaluation policy do exist, 
although there is no separate law or act that explicitly 
reflects the requirement to monitor and evaluate public 
programmes and projects on regular basis. Botswana do 
not yet have a stand-alone policy that promotes the 
involvement and participation of stakeholders in M&E. 
The gold standard is that countries with fully 
institutionalised national M&E systems should have 
policies and regulations that govern M&E practices. They 
should also have M&E norms, standards, regulations and 
plans that guide M&E practitioners to conduct M&Es 
systematically and independently, while maintaining 
acceptable standards.
Multi-Stakeholders support on Monitoring and 
Evaluation efforts
The two countries scored almost at the same level on this 
domain (Zimbabwe 58 % and Botswana 59 %). The reason 
for scoring slightly above average is the fact that both 
countries indeed received support from the NGOs’ 
community including American agencies, UN agencies and 
other independent donors such as Gates Foundation. 
However, although support from the NGO sector is 
beneficial, in the long run placing heavy reliance on donor 
support to build the national M&E systems can lead to 
sustainability problems upon the exit of these donors. The 
gold standard in this regard is the availability of 
government-based funding for M&E leveraging on both 
NGOs and the private sector financial and technical 
support. Therefore, to reach the gold standard, it is 
recommended that other stakeholders such as civil society, 
academia and other related government institutions such 
as the auditor general, public service, and national treasury 
be actively involved. 
Democratic system that promotes Monitoring 
and Evaluation efforts
Zimbabwe scored 58% and Botswana 62%. In both countries, 
there is a regular demand from civil society and the general 
public for transparency and accountability from decision-
makers on the value for money. However, it is not clear if 
evaluators perform M&E function free from the political 
influence in both countries.
<<<PAGE=9>>>

Impact and outcome evaluation practice
Zimbabwe scored 48 % and Botswana 49 % on this domain. 
The reason being that in both countries impact evaluations 
have not been fully added to existing evaluation practices. 
However, the gold standard is that internationally, there 
is certainly a trend towards more impact and outcome 
evaluations with countries such as Switzerland, Canada, 
Finland and the United States taking a lead (Jacob et al. 2015).
Factors necessary for 
institutionalising national 
Monitoring and Evaluation systems
The following five factors are derived from this discussion as 
the key factors necessary for the institutionalisation of 
national M&E systems.
Supply of Monitoring and Evaluation 
practitioners
The growth and development of national M&E systems is 
generally marked by an increase in the demand for M&E 
practitioners. Thus, as governments demand more evaluative 
evidence, the number and quality of human resources 
required to meet this will grow (Twende Mbele 2019). 
Therefore, having a good supply of M&E practitioners in a 
country is a good start for attaining full institutionalisation of 
national M&E system. In Zimbabwe, the supply of M&E 
practitioners from different academic disciplines was 
presented as good. This finding resonates with the findings 
from the Twende Mbele diagnostic study on the supply and 
demand of evaluators in Uganda, Benin and South Africa 
showing that in all three countries the supply of evaluation 
consultants has generally been adequate to meet demand 
(Twende Mbele 2018). Therefore, it is recommended that 
Zimbabwe continues to sustain this strength. However, for 
Botswana where capacity seems to be lacking, there is an 
imperative need to invest in M&E training to promote 
growth of the local supply market. In turn, this investment 
will promote the growth of the national M&E system.
Presence of a democratic system in the country
The availability of a democratic system in a country is vital 
for full institutionalisation of a national M&E system. The 
reason being that a democratic environment promotes the 
much-needed interaction between the government and civil 
society. In such an environment, civil society represents a 
wealth of knowledge and acts as a source of evidence 
generation. Therefore, its full participation thrives effectively 
in a democratic environment and thus a healthy interaction 
with government promotes full growth of the national M&E 
system (Goldman 2019). Botswana is well known for having 
such a strong democratic system that promotes dialogue and 
advocacy within the government. However, from the study, 
Zimbabwe came lacking. It is therefore critical that Zimbabwe 
creates such an environment if it is to progress further in its 
institutionalisation journey. 
Dedicated national Monitoring and Evaluation 
department in the higher office
Literature shows that the presence of high level political and 
technical champions for M&E in a country promotes full 
institutionalisation of a national M&E system. Most often, 
these champions function well in situations where a dedicated 
national department with the capacity to drive M&E exists 
(Twende Mbele 2018). This has been observed in some 
wealthy countries with well-developed national M&E 
systems such as Korea (Jacob et al. 2015). Similar arrangement 
can be seen in African countries with established national 
M&E systems such as Benin, Uganda, and South Africa 
(Goldman et al. 2018). Therefore, as observed in this study, 
both Zimbabwe and Botswana do have M&E coordinating 
units within the president’s office. It is therefore recommended 
that these structures be maintained as they are driving the 
two countries in the right direction towards realising the 
full institutionalisation of their national M&E systems.
Active participation of parliamentarians in Monitoring 
and Evaluation activities
One critical area noted to be lagging for both countries 
is the active participation of parliamentarians in M&E. 
Active participation of the parliament is needed in the 
institutionalisation process of a national M&E system in the 
sense that parliamentarians can serve as strategic allies in 
advancing the use of evidence to deepen democracy through 
their legislative, oversight and representative roles. These roles 
have the potential to significantly increase the demand for and 
use of M&E evidence among government and civil society, 
and to champion and adopt relevant policies to entrench M&E 
practice (Twende Mbele 2021). Therefore, the two countries 
need to benchmark with other African countries such as 
Uganda and South Africa where parliamentarians are more 
active in M&E matters (Goldman et al. 2018).
A national Monitoring and Evaluation policy 
framework
Another dimension that is critical in the institutionalisation 
process of a national M&E system is the national M&E policy 
framework. A national M&E policy framework provides an 
important framework to structure, systematise and guide 
M&E at country level. It also places an obligation on ministries 
and sectors to increase demand and use of M&E information. 
Besides that, it also defines what M&E is, determines what 
needs to be monitored and evaluated, what methodologies 
are to be used and how data and evaluation findings should 
be used and will be communicated. In a way, a national 
M&E policy framework creates a common approach and 
guiding principles across the public sector and integrates 
M&E into policy and budgeting cycles, which is a 
gateway to the institutionalisation of a national M&E system 
(Chirau et al. 2018). This study showed that Zimbabwe is in 
the right direction as its national M&E policy is in place. 
However, Botswana is still lagging. It is therefore 
recommended that Botswana like other African countries 
with national M&E systems should expedite the process of 
developing its national M&E policy.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the study showed that both countries are 
nearing a halfway mark towards institutionalising their 
national M&E systems. This implies that both countries still 
need to work extensively to improve in this aspect. In this 
regard, the implication is that more effort is needed to 
improve on those domains and dimensions that scored 
poorly. Lastly, the implication for the future is that the 
lessons identified can be used to support other countries 
which are seeking to institutionalise national M&E systems. 
Future researches can be carried out as more work is still 
needed to contribute to the current understanding of the 
African M&E landscape.
