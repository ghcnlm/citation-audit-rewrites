Evolution of the National  
Evaluation System in India
Yatin R S Diwakar 1 and Bakul Rao 2
Abstract
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is now a mandatory activity in development sector for 
effective implementation of a program or a policy. India has had a central level evaluation 
office since 1952, and a countrywide spread of regional and state level evaluation 
organisations since the sixties. Over the last seven decades, initiatives for establishing 
national and state-level M & E systems have been taken several times and efforts are still on 
for building capacities and developing institutions for effective monitoring and evaluation. 
However, the instability due to changing leadership, changes in government, economic 
crisis, external pressures, etc. and policy flip-flops, have rendered these efforts ineffective 
in the long run, reversing previous accomplishments, at times. This paper addresses a gap 
in the literature on historic evolution of M&E in India by tracing the evolution of National 
Evaluation System (NES) in India in the past seven decades. The methodology used for 
this is content analysis of accessible literature (Planning Commission annual reports) to 
draw a timeline and highlight emerging similarities and the repetitive nature of events 
and activities. This helps to learn from the past, contributes to context-based literature 
on history of NES in Asia Pacific region, and offers insights to build resilient systems in 
future. To institutionalise evaluations, parliamentary mandate via policy action and deeper 
integration of evaluations into budget cycles and program approval processes is important.

Introduction: Learning from the 
Past
The United Nations (UN) declared 2020-
2030 as the ‘Decade for Action’ towards 
achieving Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) which were launched in 
2015, following up on the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). In support, the 
‘Decade of Evaluation for Action’ campaign 
was launched globally calling to improve 
national evaluation systems for effective 
achievement of SDGs (Eval4Action, 2020). 
The field of development evaluation is as 
old as development-aid, and has expanded 
since the 1960s (Furubo, 2019). However, 
evaluation as a profession is yet to mature 
despite efforts for over 50 years to build 
evaluation capacities and systems; which

is potentially attributable to inadequate 
learning from history. Understanding the 
history of programme evaluation can 
provide insights into how and why the field 
evolved as it did (Madaus & Stufflebeam, 
2000).
This paper juxtaposes the changes in 
the national evaluation system in India 
with global trends and national events 
to capture the peculiar journey of India. 
The Program Evaluation Office (PEO) in 
erstwhile Planning Commission (PC) was 
set up in October 1952 as the national 
evaluation office (PEO, 1978) and in the 
next two decades focused on building 
capacities at national and sub-national 
level. These efforts were regularly repeated, 
but India’s monitoring and evaluation 
system is considered a work in progress 
(Mehrotra, 2013). The documentation of 
changes leading to the present situation, 
through reports, news articles, research 
articles, etc., are rare in India. A timeline 
comparison illustrates India’s journey from 
a global leader in development evaluation 
to a non-formalised, evolving/ work in 
progress country in context of national 
evaluation policy, practices, systems, and 
capacities (Mehrotra, 2013; Rosenstein, 
2015). This study describes the M & 
E journey of India and highlights the 
patterns in it, but stops short of identifying 
causes behind it, which needs its separate 
analysis and paper.
Documentation of History of 
Evaluation
An authoritative source for the international 
history of programme evaluation is a book 
chapter by Madaus and Stufflebeam (2000, 
p. 3-8) that divides past 170 years into 
six ages of evaluation with a west-centric 
perspective evident in other sources as well 
(Hogan, 2007; Vedung, 2010; Toscano, 
2013; Furubo, 2019; Mouton, 2010). These 
histories focus on evaluation as a sector, 
its research methodologies, evaluation 
use, and formalisation of evaluation as a 
profession. Vedung (2010) proposes four 
waves corresponding to the seven ages, 
based on the nature of evaluations and 
public sector governance doctrines in 
each period. This literature-based global 
understanding is the foundation for 
subsequent historic documentation in this 
study, which focuses on India as opposed 
to the West.
Brief documentation of history of evaluation 
in India is available in Mehrotra (2013), 
Chandrasekar (2015) and Gayithri (2019, 
p. 175-185). The third academic on the list 
built on the previous two, comparing flaws 
in India’s M&E system to those in Canada. 
Apart from these, there is no published 
documentation of history of evaluation in 
India that depends on existing historical 
artifacts. This paper uses annual reports 
(ARs) of the PC and National Institute for 
Transforming India (NITI Aayog), which 
contain details on the central evaluation 
office attached to these institutes, to trace 
the evolution of evaluation system at the 
central level. These documents have been 
unutilised in prior researches, especially 
from an M&E systems perspective.
Method of Analysis
Two timelines are prepared by reviewing 
literature on history of evaluation at global-
level (Figure 1) and in India (Figure 2), 
including important related events. The 
Indian timeline contains information from 
available ARs of the PC (and NITI Aayog). 
No ARs from year 1950 to 1970 were

accessible, information from this period 
is added from a conference report (PEO, 
1978). The Emergency period (1974-77) 
ARs are also not available, and only summary 
reports from 1995-1999 were provided, 
with no information about PEO. From 
1970 to 2022, 46 ARs with information 
about PEO (and Development Monitoring 
and Evaluation Office or DMEO) were 
tabulated3 on various parameters including 
the prominence in the report, content 
patterns, activities, trainings, evaluation 
studies conducted, officials, number of 
evaluation reports published, etc. Other 
documents by PEO, conference reports, 
and news articles are used to complete 
the analysis. The emerging patterns are 
reported parameter wise.
Documentation of Past 
Global History of Evaluation
The six ages by Madaus and Stufflebeam 
(2000) are shown in Figure 1 along with 
other important events. Vedung (2010), 
while describing his four waves, raised 
concerns about the field retreating into 
post-positivistic practices under the 
influence of funding agencies, creating 
little value. This has ushered in the fifth 
wave of decolonising evaluations;  global 
conversations around it are picking up, 
where the focus is on context specificity 
and relevance of evaluation standards, 
methods, and measurements (JMDE, 
2022).
In the 21st century, there is a collaborative 
effort to engage all stakeholders in the 
evaluation field to build capacities, 
strengthen national systems, advocate 
evaluations for attaining SDGs, etc.

This is being termed as the seventh 
Age of Consolidation and Engagement  
(2000-current) in this paper. In the 
timeline in Figure 1, major global events 
that affected program evaluation as a 
discipline, major evaluation related events, 
and formation of evaluation agencies are 
depicted. It shows that activities globally 
picked up during the 1970s, institutions 
were created in the 1980s-1990s, and 
global engagements increased after 2000.
The UN resolved in 2014 to “build 
capacity for the evaluation of development 
activities at the country level” in order to 
promote M&E usage in fulfilling the SDGs. 
2015 was declared the International Year 
of Evaluation and the Global Evaluation 
Agenda 2016-2020 was endorsed by 
governments, parliaments, civil society, 
and academia (EvalPartners, 2016). This 
was the first long-term global vision for 
evaluation developed collaboratively 
and to strengthen the evaluation systems 
(EvalPartners, 2016).
Important multilateral agencies established 
their evaluation offices in the 1970s-80s 
and consolidated their functions in 
1990s-2000s. The United Nations 
Evaluation Group was formed in January 
1984 as ‘Inter-Agency Working Group on 
Evaluation’ connecting evaluation units 
of all UN agencies, and renamed UNEG 
in 2003 (UNEG Secretariat, 2008). The 
World Bank project evaluations began in 
1970 through the Operations Evaluation 
Unit, renamed Operations Evaluation 
Department in 1973 after the US General 
Accounting Officer started to pressure the 
Bank for evaluations (Willoughby, 2003). 
In 2006, evaluation units in all the World 
Bank institutions integrated into the 
Independent Evaluation Group which 
reports to the Executive Board (IEG, 2006).

The International Organisation for 
Cooperation in Evaluation was founded 
in 2003, as a collective representing 
international, regional, national, and 
sub-national voluntary organisations of 
professional evaluators (VOPEs) (IOCE, 
2018). The year 2002 saw the formation 
of the International Development 
Evaluation Association, a global association 
for development evaluators (IDEAS, 
2018). EvalPartners was established by 
UNICEF and IOCE (EvalPartners, 2017), 
which created EvalYouth, EvalGender, 
EvalIndegenous, etc. to focus on specific 
communities.
The American Evaluation Association and 
the European Evaluation Society were 
established in 1986 and 1992 respectively. 
More VOPEs formed in different regions 
(AFrEA - 1999, APEA - 2012, etc.) and 
countries (AES - 2001, ECOI - 2015, 
etc.) to bring together leading evaluation 
practitioners and academicians and 
collaborate on formalising the field.

History of Evaluation in India
Following an overview of the history 
of evaluation on a global scale, the 
following section of this study examines 
the evolution of evaluation in India. As a 
parallel to the global ages and waves, this 
paper proposes four phases in the history 
of development evaluation in India that 
differ in how the Indian evaluation system 
was viewed by the bureaucracy, drawing 
on Mehrotra (2013) and Chandrasekhar 
(2015). The beginning and ending years 
of each phase correspond to defining PEO 
events. These and other events form the 
base of the timeline in Figure 2.
Planned growth phase 1952-1972
The PC was established in March 1950 and 
the PEO in 1952 (Planning Commission, 
1987), during the first five-year plan (FYP) 
to evaluate development programs and 
bring out their successes and failures. This 
was the Age of Innocence in the West, 
when evaluation and accountability were 
not prioritised. PEO activities expanded 
till the fourth FYP; by the late 1960s, 
over twenty state evaluation organisations 
(SEOs) were set up under the State 
Planning Departments (PEO, 1978). The 
SEOs were established as either evaluation 
division in the Directorate of Economics 
and Statistics (or similar directorates), or 
as a separate evaluation directorate, but 
generally under the Planning Department 
of the States (PEO, 1978). These state-level 
entities under State Planning Departments 
are designated SEOs in PEO literature. 
PEO rendered technical advice and 
recommended financial assistance to 
strengthen evaluation machineries in the 
States (Planning Commission, 1972). The 
scope of PEO extended to schemes and 
programmes in health, agriculture and 
cooperation, rural industries, fisheries, 
family welfare, rural development, rural 
electrification, public distribution system, 
tribal development, social forestry, and 
Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) (PEO, 
1978). In the 1950s, evaluation was a 
regular item in the annual conference of 
community development (PEO, 1978).
PEO had a three-tiered organisational 
structure, with its headquarters in New 
Delhi, three Regional Evaluation Offices 
(REOs) and 20 Project Evaluation Offices. 
The lowest tiers were considered as 
field offices to conduct field work and 
coordinate with the SEOs (Chandrasekar, 
2015). Over time, the total number 
of evaluation offices (in the three tiers 
and SEOs) swelled to over 40, with a 
combined workforce of over 700 (PEO, 
1978). PEO had relative autonomy as its 
lower offices and the officers of the SEOs 
reported to the Director, PEO. Discussions 
on Evaluation reports were an important 
part of the annual conference of State 
Development Commissioners, enabling 
follow up actions (Mehrotra, 2013).
Contraction phase 1973 -1995
Following a period of strong, centralised, 
and planned growth, India saw the 
turbulence of Emergency (Agrawal,2018), 
which was followed by the first non-
Congress central administration in the 
1970s. Simultaneously, development aid 
and lending organisations advocated for 
the Washington reforms (Naim, 1999). 
The central planning machinery and the 
economy deteriorated, culminating in the 
1991 economic reforms (Srivastava V . K., 
2021).

Asia Pacific Journal of Evaluation, Vol. 01, Issue 01, January : 2023
Once the First Administrative Reforms 
Commission advocated narrowing the 
scope of PC in the 1970s, PEO entered 
a phase of decline and neglect. While its 
work expanded to include urban areas, 
its evaluations were limited to operational, 
financial, and administrative, rather than 
the design and impact of programs 
(Mehrotra, 2013). Quick studies were 
recommended to be timely and useful. PEO 
was headed by generalists compared to 
earlier specialist academicians (Mehrotra, 
2013). Also, the tabulation of ARs shows 
that many a times the adviser position 
was given as an additional charge to other 
officials, reducing focus on evaluation 
related activities.
In April 1973, PEO functions merged 
with PC and it reduced to a division 
(Chandrasekar, 2015). Field offices dropped 
to 27 by 1980 following recommendations 
of the Staff Inspection Unit of the Ministry 
of Finance (Mehrotra, 2013). PEO received 
inadequate financing in subsequent FYPs, 
and fleeting mentions. This hampered the 
quality and timeliness of its evaluations, 
which received less importance by the 
concerned ministry/ department (M/D). 
This reduced their use, which further 
reduced the number of studies and 
funding at PEO (Chandrasekar, 2015). In 
1994, the overall sanctioned personnel 
strength of central and state evaluation 
offices was about 1,048 (PEO, 1995).
Despite attempts to revitalise the evaluation 
machinery (Planning Commission, 1973), 
conferences of heads of SEOs (PEO, 1978; 
PEO, 1987; Planning Commission, 1988), 
committees (Planning Commission, 1978), 
and other initiatives, no significant changes 
occurred, and PEO received insufficient 
recognition for its work (Chandrasekar, 
2015).
Resurgence phase (1995-2013)
During this period, coalition governments 
became common and the country 
opened up to the world post economic 
liberalisation in 1991. Privatisation, hiring 
of consultants, outsourcing of activities, 
etc. became acceptable in line with the 
NPM paradigm, reflected in PEO as well.
In 1995, a professional economist was 
appointed as the head of PEO, serving 
till 2005 (Mehrotra, 2013; DESI, 2021). 
Evaluation demand resurged in the late 
1990s, when PC was involved in design 
and implementation of social safety net 
programs to counter the adverse effects 
of economic reforms (PEO, 2001). 
Unfortunately, the Fiscal Responsibility 
and Budget Management Act 2003 kept 
the evaluation offices understaffed. The 
number of field offices reduced to 15 
and the total strength was below 120 
(Mehrotra, 2013). With the General 
Financial Rules (GFR) 2005 laying out 
guidelines for outsourcing of services 
(Department of Expenditure, 2005), more 
studies were being outsourced to social 
science research institutes (Chandrasekar, 
2015). From the ninth FYP onwards, PEO 
involved M/Ds and subject matter experts 
to ensure actions were taken based on its 
reports (Planning Commission, 2006).
The 11th FYP 2007-2012, emphasised the 
development of online MISs for flagship 
schemes (Mehrotra, 2012). The Second 
Administrative Reforms Commission and 
the Sixth Pay Commission emphasised 
both the importance of performance 
management systems (Trivedi, 2017) and 
M&E in the context of e-governance and 
citizen centric administration, including 
robust MIS systems and external impact

evaluations (Second Administrative 
Reforms Commission, 2009). The 
Performance Management Division 
implemented outcome budgeting in 
2007-08, followed by Results Framework 
Documents (RFDs) in 2009, and the 
Performance Monitoring and Evaluation 
System (PMES) at the cabinet secretariat 
(Trivedi, 2017). The Prime Minister’s 
Office established a Delivery Monitoring 
Unit (PMO, 2014). The Strengthening 
Evaluation Capacity scheme was introduced 
in 2006-07 to finance PEO, but it did 
not address administrative and personnel 
issues (Chandrasekar, 2015), leaving only 
7 regional and 8 project offices functional 
in 2012 (PEO, 2012).
This period saw the formation of MIS for 
flagship government programs to monitor 
the relations between inputs, outputs 
and outcomes as these accounted for 
substantial component of public budget 
expenditure (Mehrotra, 2012). During 
this phase of resurgence in demand for 
evaluation activities, M&E functions were 
mixed up with MIS data while evaluations 
were employed for verification rather than 
for learning. At the same time, the PEO’s 
plight remained unresolved, studies were 
underutilised, and outsourcing to private 
institutions was implemented without a 
defined policy, all of which contributed to 
PEO’s stagnation. (Chandrasekar, 2015). 
In 2012, the SEOs were either cells/ 
divisions under some Directorate or 
separate Directorates in the State Planning 
Departments, mostly retaining their format 
since they were first established almost 50 
years ago and operating in collaboration 
with the PEO (Institute for Human 
Development, 2012).
New institutions and frameworks phase 
(2013-current)
Around 2012, the second United 
Progressive Alliance government proposed 
greater accountability measures in 
response to corruption charges (Ganguly, 
2014), poor governance, failure to 
meet Millennium Development Goals 
(Pillalamarri, 2014), and other issues. 
In 2013-14, in addition to the 80 M/
Ds, their 800 autonomous organisations/ 
subordinate offices/ attached offices and 
16 of the 35 States and Union Territories 
also prepared RFDs. (Kamensky, 2013).
During the 12th FYP , the Independent 
Evaluation Office (IEO) was founded, 
proposing evaluations by institutions 
and researchers selected via competitive 
bidding (Chandrasekar, 2015). While 
the IEO was announced, alongside the 
PMES initiative in 2009 and founded 
in November 2010, its notification 
was released in July 2011. It was 
formally launched in August 2013 and 
commenced operations in February 2014 
(NITI Aayog, 2015). Originally intended 
to be a Director General-led, PC-funded 
independent governance unit, the IEO 
became an attached office under PC like 
the PEO (Planning Commission, 2011). 
The matters related to IEO were defined 
under allocation of business rules under 
PC (Planning Commission, 2013).
With regime shift and dissolution of the 
PC in 2014, PEO and IEO merged into 
DMEO in September 2015 (Loksabha, 
2017). In 2017, field offices were closed 
and all personnel were attached to 
DMEO in New Delhi (Indian Express, 
2017). Since the PMO replaced the PMES 
with the Pragati dashboard for improved 
execution (The Economic Times, 2015),
<<<PAGE=9>>>

opportunities for evaluations based on the 
RFDs prepared by the ministries were lost. 
In 2019, a full time DG was appointed 
at DMEO; it expanded its activities, 
partnerships, and efforts to strengthen the 
national evaluation system (DMEO, 2021).
When examining the websites of SEOs in 
2019, the authors found that their practices 
had remained mostly unaltered from the 
previous years. DMEO launched a study 
of SEOs in 2021 (DMEO, 2021), however 
the findings have not yet been made 
available to the public. This report on the 
assessment of evaluation infrastructure in 
states will provide information regarding 
the status of these offices as of 2022.
Patterns in Evolution of PEO
Selective memory biases do not impact PC 
and NITI Aayog ARs, which report year-to-
year activities, changes, accomplishments, 
and so on. ARs were tabulated with the 
help of pertinent information from a 
particular year to complement the existing 
literature. This section presents trends 
in the development of the Indian M&E 
system based on the table (https://bit.
ly/40VL1e0). Here, patterns are established 
by referencing different time periods; the 
common thread and its implications are 
then delineated.

Asia Pacific Journal of Evaluation, Vol. 01, Issue 01, January : 2023
Content on PEO in AR
PEO was bundled with other PC efforts 
in the ARs until 1978, but had its own 
chapter in AR 79-80, with a detailed 
background note, when Dr. SM Shah 
was Chief, PEO. After NITI Aayog was 
founded, DMEO was assigned to the ARs’ 
activities’ chapter, similar to PEO’s status 
before 1978. This can be inferred as to 
reflect its reduced independence, and 
placement as an attached office under NITI 
Aayog (DMEO, 2021). Again, the number 
of pages devoted to M&E increased, 
documenting the flurry of activity since 
2019 (NITI Aayog, 2021). ARs from 1988 
to 1995 mention PEO functions; ARs from 
2000 to 2009 feature a 10-page PEO 
chapter, compared to 4-5 pages earlier. 
The structure of chapter/ section on PEO 
(DMEO), its content, and pages devoted 
to it have changed regularly, which can 
be correlated to change in the advisers. 
A question arises whether the change in 
structure reflects the efforts of full-time 
advisers to strengthen the system, which 
may not have continued after their exit.
Strengthening evaluation systems
During the third and fourth FYP period 
(1961-74), support to schemes for 
setting up & strengthening of evaluation 
machinery in States was provided by 
PEO. A working group on evaluation was 
set up in 1960 (PEO, 1978), a taskforce 
on Evaluation to reorganise & strengthen 
evaluation machinery in States/ UTs 
& CPEO was set up in 1972-73. The 
efforts were halted during the Emergency 
period, after which the Janata alliance 
government showed interest in reviewing 
the evaluation machinery and improving 
it, and three committees were formed 
in 1977 for reviewing existing evaluation 
mechanisms, for strengthening them, 
and for training for evaluation (Planning 
Commission, 1980). In 1978, a total of 
700 people worked across the evaluation 
organisations (EOs) but leaders at PC, 
considered PEO to be unsuccessful and 
lacking in expertise, especially in the social 
sciences (PEO, 1978).
The first two committees submitted a 
combined report in April 1980; the third had 
submitted in October 1979, but according 
to ARs till 1983-84, the recommendations 
were under consideration, while the 
following ARs do not mention the reports 
or any action on them. The regime change 
in 1981 side-lined the recommendations. 
PEO undertook three types of evaluations 
during this phase: quick evaluation of 
ongoing programs for feedback, joint 
evaluation studies by CPEO and SEOs, 
and evaluation of externally aided projects 
(Planning Commission, 1982).
In 1994, a status report on status of 
evaluation in states was prepared (PEO, 
1995). During the Ninth Five-year Plan, 
it was noted that evaluation needs to 
be strengthened; a working group on 
“Strengthening M&E System for Social 
Sector Development schemes” submitted 
its report in 2004-05. In 2006, central 
plan scheme “Strengthening evaluation 
capacity in government” was introduced 
with a budget of Rs. 8.55 crores to 
develop evaluation capacity, databases, 
and SEOs, and to make evaluation reports 
meaningful, timely, and informative by 
using statistical software and upgrading 
computer hardware (Planning Commission, 
2006).
From 2009 to 2015, several initiatives 
including RFD, PMES, and IEO culminated
<<<PAGE=11>>>

Asia Pacific Journal of Evaluation, Vol. 01, Issue 01, January : 2023
in the creation of DMEO. As indicated in 
AR 2020-21, DMEO has institutionalised 
and promoted evaluations, developed 
partnerships, and focused on capacity 
development beginning in 2019. (NITI 
Aayog, 2021). Thus, it is evident that India 
has endeavoured to develop its national 
evaluation system every few years but 
without consistency.
Use of computers
From 1965 till 1985-86, PEO 
administratively contained the computer 
centre or computer services division of 
PC, PEO chapters in ARs had a separate 
section on computer services for the PC. 
In the 1986-87 AR, computer services 
division was omitted from PEO chapter, 
and made a comeback in 1987-88 report 
as a separate activity under the Adviser, 
Monitoring and Information. In the next 
report, it is mentioned that this centre 
was merged with the National Informatics 
Centre, when NIC was transferred to PC 
in 1988 (Planning Commission, 1988). 
In the times when use of computers was 
not common in governance, and was 
limited to statistical data analysis, PEO 
was using computers regularly for its work 
and supporting other M/Ds, as noted in 
multiple ARs. In the early 2000s, PEO 
conducted computer training for all SEOs 
(Planning Commission, 2001).
Uploading of evaluation reports to 
websites
In the mid-2000s, PEO assisted SEOs 
to set up websites, through the central 
plan scheme started in 2006. All reports 
of PEO were digitised and uploaded to 
the PC website. As the REOs and project 
evaluation offices worked as field offices 
of PEO, they did not have own websites 
or publications. Following the PEO’s 
example, the SEOs began publishing their 
reports on the websites of their respective 
state planning departments. PEO was a 
forerunner in the use of computers and 
uploading all evaluation study reports 
online, and DMEO’s M&E studies 
guidelines mention that studies will be 
uploaded on its website (DMEO, 2021). 
As is evident from their websites, though, 
not all SEOs have recent studies uploaded 
on or updated websites. Since the authors 
conducted this research in 2020–2021, 
certain SEO sites’ current states may have 
changed.
Evaluation conferences
On July7-8, 1987, the second meeting 
of the heads of central and state 
EOs convened to address the role of 
special research institutes, the nature of 
cooperation between EOs, the Central 
Statistical Office, and State Directorates 
of Economics & Statistics in creating 
evaluation studies, as well as shortcomings 
in functioning and corrective actions for 
CPEO and SEO (PEO, 1987).
PEO hosted large conferences, which 
included representatives from CPEO, 
REO, and SEO, in addition to their 
regular seminars/workshops on specialised 
evaluation reports centred on their 
techniques and training sessions regarding 
data collection. These brought together all 
SEOs and other stakeholders to deliberate 
on status of PEO and SEO, strengthening 
of evaluation machinery, training for 
evaluation, follow up of findings of 
studies, coordination between the Centre 
and states, among other things. The first 
conference of the heads of SEOs was 
organised by PEO on 14-15 November

1977 in New Delhi (PEO, 1978). On 
7-8 July 1987, the second conference of 
heads of central and state EOs convened 
to address the role of special research 
institutions, the nature of collaboration 
between EOs, the Central Statistical Office, 
and the State Directorates of Economics & 
Statistics in designing evaluation studies, 
as well as deficiencies in functioning and 
remedial measures for CPEO and SEO 
(PEO, 1987). On July 28, 1999, a third 
conference was organised (PEO, 2000). A 
workshop was held on 25-26 July 2007 
focusing on improving evaluation quality 
(Planning Commission, 2008). Recently, 
DMEO held conferences in 2021 and 
2022 (DMEO, 2022) involving all SEOs 
and other stakeholders. Every decade has 
seen a national evaluation conference, but 
without follow-ups or updates on action 
items.
Evaluation training
PEO regularly engaged with SEOs and 
trained senior officers and junior staff at 
SEOs, CPEO and REOs; these training 
sessions were held at different locations 
across the country, including New Delhi, 
Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Lucknow. A 
primary duty of PEO was to train Indian 
Economics Services officials in evaluation 
methods and tools and there were 
instances of foreign officers being trained 
by PEO during 80s (Planning Commission, 
1984; Planning Commission, 1988). In 
response to renewed interest, DMEO is 
training state level senior officials, staff of 
SEOs and young professionals (DMEO, 
2022).
Evaluation reports output
A graph of year-wise evaluation studies 
published by PEO is given in Figure 
3. From 1954 to 2001, the number of 
studies is based on a list available on the 
archived website (Planning Commission, 
2019). For 2001 onwards, the number 
was created from information in the ARs. 
Evaluation studies averaged five per year 
during the planned expansion phase. This 
dropped to an average of three during the 
contraction period, before rebounding to 
four or five during the resurgence phase. 
The trend reversed at the commencement 
of the current phase, followed by a rise 
to between six and seven over the last 
four years. Evaluation study output has 
remained stable despite delays and issues 
regarding evaluation usage.
Evaluation advisory committees
In 1978, several states reported that their 
evaluation committees were dysfunctional 
or meeting sporadically, as detailed in 
the first conference report (PEO, 1978). 
The 1984-85 report specifies a technical 
advisory committee for each PEO 
evaluation. The AR 1994-95 mentions 
that the evaluation advisory committee 
for PEO evaluation studies was constituted 
for the ‘first time’ in March 1994. 
However, given that SEOs already had 
advisory committees, it is safe to assume 
that PEO had an evaluation advisory 
committee before this, especially in its 
growth phase. In 2000, the evaluation 
advisory committee included experts 
from PC, non-government organisations, 
and academic institutions. In the 2010-
11 AR, a consultancy evaluation cum 
monitoring committee was mentioned 
along with a list of meetings and studies 
presented to it. NITI Aayog’s 2015-
16 Annual Report mentions evaluation 
monitoring committees for each DMEO 
study. In June 2021, DMEO established
<<<PAGE=13>>>
Evolution of the National Evaluation System in India

Asia Pacific Journal of Evaluation, Vol. 01, Issue 01, January : 2023
the development evaluation advisory 
committee (NITI Aayog, 2021). The PEO 
(or DMEO) had institutional mechanisms 
to prepare plans for evaluation studies 
and follow up on their use through the 
evaluation advisory committees headed 
by senior secretaries, and it enforced 
a parallel system on the SEOs as well. 
Separate technical committees specific for 
each study involving subject experts and 
representatives from respective M/Ds were 
also common. The committees have been 
regularly reconstituted after becoming 
defunct, showing some limitations in the 
way they have been institutionalised every 
time.
Outsourcing evaluations
The 1982-83 AR lists grants-in-aid provided 
to institutions for research and evaluation. 
Although similar lists are absent in earlier 
reports, they are available in later reports 
showing that agencies other than EOs are 
involved in evaluations for PC. Such third-
party evaluations over the years are not 
listed as PEO publications. During 1983-
86, support was planned and provided 
to M/Ds to set up their M & E systems 
for programs under Integrated Rural 
Development Program. This started the 
shift away from PEO towards M/D level 
M&E. While this reduced the load on PEO, 
it also compromised the independence 
of evaluation findings. Mid-90s saw the 
start of outsourcing of evaluation studies 
to consulting firms, as part of the global 
neo-liberal wave pushing for privatization 
and contracting out (Vedung, 2010). This 
further increased with the GFR 2005 
laying out guidelines for new areas of 
governance previously not included in GFR 
1963, including externally aided projects, 
government guarantees, engagement of 
consultants, outsourcing of services, etc. 
(Department of Expenditure, 2004).
Conclusions
Comparing the international timeline 
of evaluation with the Indian timeline, 
one notes that India was a forerunner in 
institutionalising evaluation before most
<<<PAGE=14>>>

western countries. This is in contrast to 
many countries institutionalising evaluation 
in the Age of expansion and integration, 
with a push from multilateral aid agencies 
and the NPM paradigm. Not only did 
India establish a strong central setup, but 
also decentralised evaluation by taking 
it to every State and Union Territory 
and regularly engaged with them in the 
1970s, when globally evaluation functions 
were just being institutionalised even by 
multilateral agencies. Unfortunately, India 
lost two decades till the 90s, when the 
neo-liberal wave of institutionalisation led 
to resurgence in evaluation demand and 
its institutionalisation.
As described in the previous section, 
the country saw repeated attempts 
at strengthening evaluation systems, 
organisation of conferences every decade 
to connect with States, reformation of 
evaluation advisory committees for better 
planning and use of evaluations, etc. 
But despite all these activities, due to 
changing leadership, reduced funding, 
embargo on staff hiring, limiting scale of 
activities, commissioning of studies by 
individual M/Ds, outsourcing of studies, 
etc. evaluation systems in India didn’t 
mature and institutionalise.
Institutionalisation has not been achieved 
in India despite the ongoing emphasis 
on strengthening evaluation. This is 
because neither a national evaluation 
policy with Parliament’s mandate nor 
an independent evaluation agency with 
authority comparable to that of India’s 
Comptroller and Auditor General have 
been established. It is hypothesised that 
despite the best efforts of evaluation 
champions at PC (or NITI Aayog), attempts 
to build the evaluation machinery didn’t 
continue at the same pace following 
their departure, as seen by the cyclic 
spates of activity and inactivity (Gayithri, 
2019). From the experience of other 
countries in the region, we know that 
the sustained work by champions within 
the Government (parliamentarians and 
bureaucrats) is important for strengthening 
evaluation systems. The countries where a 
Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation was 
set up and kept active in the last decade 
saw formalisation of their evaluation systems 
(Diwakar, De Mel, & Samarsinghe, 2021). 
However, this is not the case in India. The 
lack of legal backing is compounded by 
the positioning of the PEO (or DMEO) as 
an attached office of PC (or NITI Aayog) 
(DMEO, 2021). Evaluation is linked to 
performance-based management and 
outcome-based expenditure globally; 
hence many countries establish evaluation 
offices under the Ministry of Finance. In 
India, the MoF mandates evaluations 
through a government order (Dept of 
Expenditure, 2016). It had initiated an 
outcome-based budgeting via RFD, which 
is now the Output- Outcome Monitoring 
Framework (OOMF), but the MoF still 
hasn’t anchored the evaluation system. 
This shift from RFD to OOMF is another 
example of repeated efforts. RFD was first 
discontinued (Trivedi, 2017); then two 
years on OOMF was introduced without 
any reference to the previous efforts in 
the preface to the first OOMF document 
published in 2019 (Dept of Expenditure, 
2019).
As seen by the emerging patterns 
presented in the preceding section, the 
Indian evaluation system lacks institutional 
memory and continuity. The PEO to DMEO 
transition could have been a process of 
moulting to shed encumbrances of a 
legacy organisation, formed in a different 
era. Instead, it disowned its legacy and
<<<PAGE=15>>>
Evolution of the National Evaluation System in India

disregarded its accomplishments. The 
crumbling PEO may have had to be 
dismantled, but lessons learned from its 
demise may have helped build a more 
stable organisation in its place. It is 
customary in India, according to Gayithri 
(2019), to altogether abandon an existing 
institution and framework and replace 
it with new ones. Trivedi (2017) also 
discusses how the prevailing PMES and 
RFD system atrophied after a regime and 
systems shift. Over the last seven decades, 
we have failed to use past experiences to 
strengthen the system; regular activities 
were ignored before being revived. This 
issue affects the evaluation advisory 
committees, training sessions, evaluation 
report output, and conferences listed in 
the preceding section.
Other Asia Pacific countries, have 
institutionalised evaluations by adopting 
a National Evaluation Policy (NEP) (Sri 
Lanka, Philippines, and Australia) or 
legalising it through constitution (Nepal) 
or a parliamentary act (Japan) (Diwakar, 
De Mel, Samarsinghe, Liyanagamage, 
Mahmodi, & Kalugampitiya, 2022). 
According to Trivedi, enshrining a system 
in law protects its longevity across 
government changes and permits efforts 
to continue. The central role and need of 
NEP in India to standardising evaluations, 
especially to achieve the SDGs, has been 
stressed elsewhere (Srivastava, 2018).
DMEO is currently leading the efforts to 
strengthen the Indian evaluation system 
using a multi-pronged approach that 
includes networking, capacity building, 
standardisation, stakeholder involvement, 
evaluation plans, etc. This paper identifies 
patterns from the past to point out that 
the unending project of institutionalisation 
of evaluation in India has some missing 
ingredients, such as, a strong national 
evaluation policy and ownership by other 
stakeholders, which can help India regain 
its prominent place at the global level in 
evaluation. The primary contribution of this 
research is the detailed documenting and 
division of the history of M&E in India into 
distinct phases. This paper prepared the 
ground work for future research capturing 
insights from previous and present officials 
and other stakeholders associated with the 
M&E system in India, which has not yet 
been attempted due to dearth of prior 
research in this field in the country.
