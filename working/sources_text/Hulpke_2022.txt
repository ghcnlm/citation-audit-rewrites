Abstract
Purpose – A topic currently receiving signiﬁcant academic and practitioner attention is called evidence-
based management. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that this approach is sometimes over-sold and
may be a fad. Additionally, evidence-based management fails to fully recognize the importance of tacit
knowledge, what Kahneman calls system 1. Evidence-based management does provide tools to better use
what Kahneman calls system 2, rationality. Decision-makers need to take advantage of both rational and
beyond rational processes.
Design/methodology/approach – This is an essay, it is not a report of a study. At this point in time, this
paper needs thinking, reﬂection, pondering, more than a data-based study.
Findings – Advocates promote evidence-based management in part to help avoid fads, yet evidence-based
management itself has many of the characteristics of a fad. Evidence-based management is based on an
objective rational view of the world and suggests highly rational methods of decision-making. However, a
rational fact-based might not give sufﬁcient credit to instinct and feelings. Decision-makers should take into
account facts, evidence, when making decisions, but not ignore intuition, hunches and feelings. This study is
learning that decisions use a galaxy of approaches, with both cognitive and affectiveﬂexibility.
Research limitations/implications– As with any opinion-based paper, this lacks empirical support.
Proponents ask us to believe in evidence-based management. Neither we, the authors of this paper, nor the
proponents of evidence-based management can empirically support the ideas offered. An additional limitation
is that the paper is written in one language, English. Translation into another language might yield different
meanings.
Practical implications– There are advantages for scholars and practitioners to look at the best available
evidence. There can be disadvantages in overlooking non-quantiﬁable factors.
Social implications– Those who use evidence-based management should also take into account feelings,
ethics, aesthetics, creativity, for the betterment of society. To solve wicked problems one needs more than
facts and rational analysis.
Originality/value – The overwhelming majority of those writing about evidence-based management are
supporters. This study offers a different view. This paper brings new ideas and new thinking to both the

extensive fad literature and the huge evidence-based management literature. Evidence-based management is
discussed widely. Google Scholar lists more than two million papers in 2019, 2020 and 2021 on evidence-based
management. Readers of this journal should critically evaluate this popular set of ideas.

Paper typeViewpoint
Professor Julius Johnson was touring our university in Hong Kong. We stood on a causeway
between buildings, taking in the spectacular view of Clearwater Bay. His faculty tour guide
commented, “I really like this place.” Julius paused, stared back and said,“what’s not to
like?” The phrase stuck and may apply in considering“evidence-based management.”
What’s not to like? Prof Johnson’s tone suggested there could be nothing wrong with what
he saw. At ﬁrst glance, one might reach a similar conclusion about evidence-based
management. Making decisions after obtaining and then considering the best available
information, taking all aspects and elements into account, must be a good thing. Proponents
describe evidence-based management as “the conscientious use of multiple sources of
evidence in organizational decisions” (Rousseau, 2020). That approach sounds better than
what Stanford Professor Jeff Pfeffer sees today: too often managers“don’t use the best or,
perhaps, any, evidence” in making decisions (Pfeffer quote fromBarends and Rousseau,
2018, p. xvi). Many academics in the 2020s agree: more evidence can help facilitate better
managerial, and thus better organizational, decisions.
While acknowledging the positive potential we suggest keeping an open mind. We are
not convinced that evidence-based management can live up to its many positive appraisals.
In this essay, we raise two main unsettled issues, unanswered questions. First, is evidence-
based management a fad, similar to others that have gained the attention of management
practitioners and academics of the past? We conclude that evidence-based management is in
danger of being oversold, given more prominence than is appropriate. It cannot yet be
declared a fad but it may gain that status in the future. Second, by stressing evidence, facts,
data, might evidence-based management be overlooking or underutilizing the signiﬁcance
of effect, emotions, intuition, the feelings managers rightfully take into account when
leading organizations? Stated in academic terms, would or could attention to evidence-based
management discourage decision-makers from harnessing the power of what Nobel-prize
winner Daniel
Kahneman (2011)calls System 1 thinking? After discussing these two issues
we offer some thoughts on an emerging third way, reducing the use of the name evidence-
based management but not de-emphasizing the importance of facts.
The essay in the following pages is structured in more-or-less this sequence. We begin by
brieﬂy describing evidence-based management in a section called anintroduction. Then we
ask, like Professor Johnson, what’s not to like. We discuss the fad idea and askis evidence-
based management a fad?We show that evidence-based management meets many but not
all of the criteria of a fad. Then the following major section asksdoes evidence-based
management underutilize System 1?System 1 is a term often used to describe the automatic
holistic approach humans use as opposed to System 2, organized rationality. Our analysis
says yes, evidence-based management underplays the importance of System 1. In aﬁnal
section, we suggest a third way,moving beyond a single focus or even a dual-processing
perspective. We note that many scholars answer the question about the use of Systems 1 or 2
by endorsing a dual processing approach. These experts typically suggest a modiﬁed name
such as fact-assisted sense-making instead of evidence-based management.
We appreciate this trend away from a single-focused approach but suggest even the
“dual” processing is unnecessarily limiting. Acknowledging that while neither System 1 nor

System 2 are sufﬁcient alone, we hold that even recognizing the value of both cognitive and
automatic, dual processing explanations are still not enough. The growing area of
scholarship on cognitiveﬂexibility sheds light on how thinking really works. Cognitive
ﬂexibility is as yet relatively underexplored but already shows that even a dual systems
view is as unnecessarily limiting as a single focus such as that in evidence-based
management. We suggest that humans also exhibit emotional and affectiveﬂexibility. In the
future, we will learn more about the myriad of ways different emotions, from fear to fury,
relate to decision-making. We will learn that the decisions of humans use a galaxy of
approaches, with both cognitive and affectiveﬂexibility. The facts on this are not all known
yet and are changing. The facts on this are not all known yet and are changing.
1. Introduction: what is evidence-based management?
The idea of making decisions after looking at the evidenceﬁrst took hold in medicine a
decade or so earlier and still survives as evidence-based medicine, sometimes abbreviated as
evidence-based medicine (EBM) (
Sackett et al., 1997). Evidence-based management has been
part of standard management vocabulary since around 2003 (Tranﬁeld et al.,2 0 0 3) with
some relevant papers published as early as 1948 (Reay et al.,2 0 0 9). As medicine had already
claimed the EBM abbreviation evidence-based management is sometimes called evidence-
based management (EBMgt).
Evidence-based management started as a set of suggestions for practitioners (Rousseau,
2006). As Professors Jeff Pfeffer and Robert Sutton explained decision-makers should“use
sound logic and analysis” when confronted with management advice (2006a, 83). Leaders
should “instead of being interested in what is new... ought to be interested in what is true”
(2006a, 77) and “be suspicious of breakthrough ideas” (2006a, 90). To reach the best
decisions one should systematically analyze the best available evidence.
Evidence-based management suggests speciﬁc procedures and tools. To begin decision-
making one should consider the population, the intervention, the comparison, the outcome
and the context, which then becomes a new acronym, PICOC. After searching for relevant
evidence, using the terms population, intervention, comparison, outcome and context to help
focus the search, then evidence-based management suggests the following six steps, ask,
acquire, appraise, aggregate, apply and assess. These steps from the website of the center
for evidence-based management make sense and provide structure for decision-making. One
should search for relevant evidence broadly, not overlooking any sources of evidence,
insuring that the ideas of practitioners, scientiﬁc literature, organizations and stakeholders
are examined. In an approach this complicated it is not possible to brieﬂy describe evidence-
based management, but this graphic helps simplify a very complex area: (Figure 1
).
What started out as a fairly clear good idea, evidence-based management, changed over the
next decade into an evidence-based management movement. As one journal article stated,
“Change the World: Teach Evidence-Based Practice!” (
Ryneset al.,2 0 1 4). Pfeffer and Sutton had
warned against adopting“the next big thing,” but, perhaps, this happened: scholars embraced
the evidence-based management idea and it became a movement to change the world.
2. Is evidence-based management a fad?
Evidence-based management has been described in many ways and is complex enough to
defy one simple deﬁnition. Sara Rynes and Bartunek (2017,p .2 4 0 )l i s t“the [7] main
deﬁnitions that have been offered by various authors over theﬁrst years.” One expert in the
Rynes and Bartunek list is then Academy of Management president Denise Rousseau. Rousseau
said the idea is to“make organizational decisions informed by social science and organizational
research [... ] based on the best available scientiﬁc evidence [... ]” (Rousseau, 2006,p .2 5 6 ) .
Evidence-
based
management

<<<PAGE=4>>>
Although there are many more than seven deﬁnitions at this point one additional deﬁnition will
sufﬁce. In their analysis, Roshanghalb and colleagues say evidence-based management
“concerns how to translate the best available scientiﬁc evidence into organizational practices
avoiding(italics added) decisions based on individual experience and preference” (Roshanghalb
et al.,2 0 1 8). The“avoid” aspect of evidence-based management has been observed by others as
well. For example, Pfeffer and Sutton, who helped launch evidence-based management, warned
about fads: they advised organizational decision-makers to“be suspicious of breakthrough
ideas” (Pfeffer and Sutton, 2006b, p. 8). One should approach with caution“new” ideas presented
as ways to improve organizational management (Pfeffer and Sutton, 2006a,p .7 7 ) ,e s p e c i a l l yi f
promoted astheanswer.
Many of the followers of evidence-based management are believers as if following this
new breakthrough that Pfeffer and Sutton warned about. It is not necessary to “be
suspicious of ” evidence-based management, but this new idea should be carefully
considered. Sometimes managers become so enamored of new methods of operation that
the idea becomes a fad. As Pamela Matthews puts it, some“quick-ﬁxes, which appear to
provide answers, but more often than not, do not address the underlying problems facing
organizations ” (2015, p. 302).
Serious researchers might ask if evidence-based management materially different than
the fads that“have been greeted with great enthusiasm [... ] then a few years later only to be
quietly ushered out the back door” (
Mintzberg, 1976, p. 53). In organizations, we see trends
or in less neutral terms, fads and fashions. Although some make a distinction between fad
and fashions, some using the term management fashion theory (Abrahamson, 1991), for our
purposes no distinction is needed. A book by Barends and Rousseau explaining and
supporting evidence-based management mentions and names (2018, p. 72) some earlier fads.

It is to their credit that they raise the possibility of decision-makers following a popular but
inappropriate movement. The analysis in this paper asks if evidence-based management
might be added to the list of fads and fashions.
W h e t h e ro rn o tt h e“fad” label ﬁts evidence-based management is important. Proponents of
evidence-based management have at times offered this approach as an alternate to fads. The
volume by Barends and Rousseau mentioned above, which is seen as an authoritative source
on evidence-based management, raises the issue directly. That book says managers need to
make better use of evidence as opposed to following ideas or trends such as“management by
objectives, business process reengineering, total quality management, learning organizations,
knowledge management, lean management, six sigma, talent management, employee
engagement and agile” (
Barends and Rousseau, 2018, p. 72). To this list, many scholars add
others. An abbreviated list of some of these ideas, most of which might be labeled fads, follows.
The list of fads from the Barends and Rousseau book is impressive. However, that list is
far from exhaustive as shown by the longer but still changing list above (Table 1). Many of
the ideas within these fads on this list of fads will continue as useful tools, become part of the
manager’s normal routine (Sharma, 2021), but will be seen less and less as the fad popularity
declines over time. The fad or components from the fad, become tools in the toolbox. There
were no computers in faculty ofﬁces when we started our teaching careers. Then, following
a pattern seen so often, the idea of and term PC, personal computer, arrived. Our lives
changed. Until the twenty-ﬁrst century when we no longer need a PC, everything couldﬁto n
a laptop. Then the smartphone changed lives again.
Trends come and go. Relatively recently CSR stopped meaning customer service relations
(Froehle, 2006; Little et al., 2013) and become a corporate social responsibility, CSR (Van
Marrewijk, 2003). White asked in 2005 whether this newer idea is also called CSR. Would be
seen as“ap a s s i n gf a d” (p. 1). On many corporate agendas, the term and sometimes the Ofﬁce
of, CSR is being replaced by a newer emphasis on sustainability. Meanwhile, social audits came
and went (Carroll and Beiler, 1975). The balanced scorecard, for a few years, reminded all to
keep track of not only proﬁt but people as well. The triple bottom line (TBL) said one should
track results inﬁnancial areas plus social and environmental (people, planet and proﬁts)
(Elkington, 1997; Henriques and Richardson, 2004). One may remember the enthusiastic
embrace of PPBS or zero-based budgeting or value engineering or JIT or theory Z or sensitivity
training or OB Mod or second life. Sometimes business fads originate in the academic world.
Then professors spread the new idea via consulting or business students take the idea to work
with them when they graduate. Other fads start with practitioners, managers or consultants
and then move into academia (Spell, 2001) .T h ef e we x p e r t sw h oe n du pw a t c h i n gi nb o t h
academia and organizations may earn the not-altogether complimentary label“guru” (Collins,
2003; Micklethwait and Wooldridge, 1996).
A 2013 article promotes performance-based management, a potential new big thing
(Melaniphy, 2013). Simultaneously and similarly one could track managerial and analytical
tools, from Porter’s ﬁve forces (Pfeffer, 1995) to the resource-based view (Priem and Butler,
2001) to blue ocean strategy (Mauborgne and Kim, 2005). These may be taught to business
students today, but, perhaps, not tomorrow. The list is continually inﬂux, expanding and
contracting. SWOT analysis has faded, even though many students and some managers
still ﬁnd it useful (Helms and Nixon, 2010).
Today the advice seems to be, embrace evidence-based management or, perhaps, design
thinking. Both evidence-based management and design thinking or DT or simply design,
appear to be on the upward curve portion of what
Spee and Basaiawmoit (2016)label the
hype cycle. However, in a cycle, what goes up may eventually come down. DT reminds one
of but is not the same as, the systems approach, which for part of the twentieth century was

the latest thing. The systems approach seemed broad enough to include a way of thinking
for everyone related in any way to organizations (Bryer, 1979). However, systems thinking
“lost favor because the very complexity of systems meant that systems theories were
difﬁcult to apply” (Grewatsch, 2019, 1). The complexity of evidence-based management, due
to the comprehensiveness of its approach, may make it also“difﬁcult to apply.”
Job enrichment was for a time very popular. The excessive attention paid to job
enrichment worried even the person credited with inventing job enrichment. The originator
of the idea then wrote an article called “the coming demise of job enrichment ”
(Hackman, 1975). Another big wave was the“excellence movement.” Peters and Waterman
(1982), who triggered this excellence movement, had found that management of human
resources was a key to“excellence.” However, studies after the fact show that a randomly
selected list ofﬁrms performed about, as well as the Peters and Waterman exemplars (Hitt
and Ireland, 1987). New terms and new ideas will keep appearing. Big data will be used to
extract information from the internet of things (IoT) or the internet of everything (IoE) if we
are to achieve a high-performance workplace. Practitioners are advised to explore the micro-
foundations ofﬁntech or blockchain. The AI of today means artiﬁcial intelligence and is not
related to the AI of an earlier day, appreciative inquiry. Then, even artiﬁcial intelligence has
some of the characteristics of a fad.Winston and Brown (1984)“fear that thisﬁeld has been
hyped beyond all belief and there is a serious danger that it might be oversold” (quote from
Google Scholar, no page number).
Some fads or fashions come and go so quickly that one is reminded of bubbles (Rogmans,
2019). Value engineering saw meteoric growth, but then did not burst like a classic bubble, but
faded nonetheless. Tides rise and fall, fads come and go, sometimes following a certain path
because others are following the same path (Scarbrough and Swan, 2001; Spell, 2001; Van de
Ven and Schomaker, 2002). At least, as le Bon wrote in“The Crowd: A Study of the Popular
Mind” scholars know that there is a lot of“follow what others do” in human behavior (le Bon,
1960 [1895]). A number of management writers describe business fad adoption using the
colloquial term“bandwagon effect” (Aksom, 2021). The term mania is also used sometimes,
roughly synonymous but often carrying a slightly negative connotation.
Since 1968 scientists have tried to make sense out of“things that change suddenly” using
catastrophe theory (Zeeman, 1976). Maybe one day scholars will explain some of the ideas
that failed to save the world by comparing them to catastrophes. However, it would be a
mistake to write off performance-based management or AI or evidence-based management
as catastrophes. Decision-makers should see what lessons can be learned from each. Even if
evidence-based management loses popularity, as criticisms such as ours become more
frequent, the ideas within should still be applied as appropriate.
Many managerial discoveries, including evidence-based management, seem to have roots in
the USA. However, fads may originate anywhere. The Japanese are credited with launching the
“quality” movement, but the Japaneseﬁrms who best demonstrate“Continuous Improvement”
receive“the Deming Prize.” That award was named after W. Edwards Deming, the American
consultant who taught key points of total quality management (TQM) in Japan before it
became popular in the USA. Quality circles seemed to work in Japan and believers in the US
tried to make TQM work in the States (
Waddock and Bodwell, 2004).
Sometimes movements take on an almost religious feel. Consider this quote from an
American geologist: “While I was working at an engineeringﬁrm back in the 1990s the
owners became true believers in TQM. I recall going to conferences or seminars and
thinking that it seemed vaguely religious. Like going to Sunday School. I don’t recall
anything about TQM.” The geologist compares sessions on TQM with the Sunday School at
Evidence-
based

the family’s church. Evidence-based management and TQM and Sunday school are thought
to be good for a person, however, it is not always clear why or how.
This discussion illustrates that even good ideas often fade away over time. On TQM, one
article was titled, “quality is dead in Europe– long live excellence: true or false.” The
authors noted that“TQM is regarded as a fallen star” which they see as a pity. TQM had
many useful ideas but was not easily implemented. What was rising toward the end of the
twentieth century was excellence, which those writers consider a passing fad. Quality and
TQM should endure. Excellence should be on the way out:“the term‘excellence’has already
started to become subject to ridicule” (
Dale et al., 2000, p. 9). The hopes of those authors were
not realized. Both the excellence fad and the TQM fad have faded.
One of theﬁrst ideas which might in retrospect has met the criteria to be labeled a fad
was scientiﬁc management. When Frederick Winslow started measuring all parts of the
steel production process he saw the potential for dramatic increases in productivity. People
became nothing more than elements of the production machine. Midvale Steel beneﬁted and
Taylor became famous. Today, scientiﬁc management is gone, except, perhaps, as Busse,
Warner and Zhao note, in China“some ﬁrms are still stuck in operating the concept of
scientiﬁc management but labeling it as human resource management” (2016, p. 538).
Perhaps, Taylor was ahead of his time (
Taylor, 1911). Measure everything, make decisions
based on facts, was the essence of scientiﬁc management in 1911 and, perhaps, the core of
evidence-based management today.
Evidence-based management reminds one of the fashions now faded or fading (Alvesson
and Spicer, 2012). A typical fad or fashion or movement has its own jargon, to help
distinguish between believers and unbelievers. Evidence-based management has terms
exclusive to that persuasion. PICOC is not a large bird like a turkey with a gorgeous
expandable tail. PICOC means Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Context.
Is this acronym necessary? It helps a movement can gain momentum to have unique
terminology. A movement must also believe it has the answer, the right solution. Talk to or
more likely listen to, a six sigma black belt and one realizes you are either in it or not in it.
Only a few can be six sigma black belts. With the wisdom of these select enlightened few,
better organizational operations can be achieved.
There would be beneﬁts if the idea of using evidence (information) to make better
decisions persists, whether or not the movement, the evidence-based management
persuasion, gets quietly ushered out the back door. However, there are worrisome signs. As
with many or, perhaps, most fads, Evidence-based management has lofty goals. Evidence-
based management is not merely about better management. The goal for some adherents is
to save the world.
One hopes the enthusiastic believers in evidence-based management will not turn good
ideas into us versus them. Only if we use evidence-based management can we make better
organizational decisions? Stated that way would be unfortunate. Using evidence is one way,
but not the only way, for decision-makers to make better organizational decisions.
This background mentions and lists numerous ideas that we include on our list of fads
(
Table 1). Although this list may seem long, it could easily be doubled. Furthermore, the list
is long for a reason. Shown a shorter list of fads, a colleague commented,“but evidence-
based management is not like these on your list.” The evidence we see suggests that it is
very much like the other fads in many ways. Readers of this article will have never heard of
many fads on our list. However, each of these was at one time for one period of time as
widely praised as today’s evidence-based management. In the future, evidence-based
management may also lose popularity or may be equally forgotten. Only time will tell.

As a starting point to determine whether evidence-based management deserves to be on
the fad list one could look at the list of commonly accepted characteristics of fads as
complied by
Matthews (2015), who, in turn, credits other scholars (Miller and Hartwick,
2002; Shapiro, 1995; Best, 2006; Naslund, 2008; Carson et al.,1 9 9 9; Collins, 2008)( “Agreed
characteristics of fads include” (Matthews, 2015):
“Agreed characteristics of fads include” (Matthews, 2015):
/C15Perceived simplicity and ease of implementation.
/C15Prescriptive answers to complex issues and problems.
/C15The promise of short-term gains and big promises.
/C15Equal applicability to all organizations and all situations.
/C15Are resources (bothﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial) hungry.
/C15Targeting speciﬁc contemporary issues.
/C15Seemingly novel– but not overly radical answers.
/C15Have the support of recognized individuals who actively promote ideas (Miller and
Hartwick, 2002; Shapiro, 1995; Best, 2006; Naslund, 2008; Carson et al., 1999; Collins,
2008) [of these six listed by Matthews we have not seenCollins, 2008]
This list complied by Matthews is the best we have seen. Any list will be modiﬁed as
research continues. Matthews’ list seems to give insufﬁcient attention to the time element. If
a fad of fashion endures, lasts a long time, then it should not be labeled a fad. Furthermore,
item 1 does not apply to many or most fads in business. Six sigma nor TQM nor evidence-
based management would be described as having “perceived simplicity and ease of
implementation.” These and some of the other fads contain very detailed steps, procedures,
requirements. In addition, and probably more important, the Matthews list omits a
mandatory feature, the transitory nature of a fad. This we would propose a revised list of fad
characteristics. A fad is likely to (revised list of fad characteristics below).
Revised list of fad characteristics:
/C15have a simple to remember the name, often abbreviated into initials (e.g. MBO);
/C15prescribe answers to complex issues and problems;
/C15promise short-term gains, high long term achievement;
/C15claim applicability to various types of organizations and situations;
/C15require resources-bothﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial;
/C15target speciﬁc contemporary issues;
/C15claim to be new;
/C15have the support of key individuals, active promoters;
/C15often be described in very positive or very negative terms; and
/C15come and go, typically following a cycle of incubation, take-off, rising popularity,
decline.
The list shown here in the revised list of fad characteristics, modiﬁed slightly from the
Matthews list, will, without doubt, be further revised in the future. However, one key
difference in our A B C list as compared to Matthews’ 1 2 3 list is our increased attention to
the temporal element. The idea “fad” almost always contains a time element. These
managerial and organizational innovations with“limited life spans” (Matthews, 2015,p .3 0 3 )
Evidence-

often follow a“characteristic trajectory from sudden prominence to obscurity” (Miller and
Hartwick, 2002, p. 26). As Lilienthal and colleagues state,“Traditionally, fads are deﬁned as
short-lived fashions that disappear about as abruptly as they emerged... ” (Lilienfeld et al.,
2014, p. 62). Strang and Macy note a pattern:“a stylized picture of a faddish cycle” might
include the following elements:
/C15A potentially extensive incubation period where fewﬁrms use the innovation.
/C15A take-off period where popularity rises explosively.
/C15A short period of ascendancy marked by very high levels of innovation usage.
A period of rapid decline leading to a low equilibrium level of usage (Strang and Macy, 2001,
p. 151). Thus, a new idea or set of ideas cannot be conﬁdently labeled a fad until and unless it
fades, becomes less prominent. Indeed, there are those who believe the core ideas of
evidence-based management will forever change managerial thinking, thus should not be
placed in a category with fads.
Although the English language term fad does not typically convey positive implications,
neither does the word always convey negative connotations. Some fads simply come and go,
are noticed and, perhaps, commented on, in more or less neutral, possibly historical, terms.
Perhaps, one way to view this would be to look at two extreme examples on the spectrum
between a fad and game-changing paradigm shift in thinking. An extreme example of a fad
might be the phenomenon called streaking, where a young person or young people ran in
front of a crowd with absolutely no clothes on. Once this event received publicity others did
the same. By the early 1970s, at least 1,000 incidents of streaking were identiﬁed on US
college campuses (
Kirkpatrick, 2010). After 1973, the fad stopped.
At the other end of an imaginary fad, the longevity continuum might be“hand washing”
which changed the culture of the clinic. The old paradigm held that a surgeon with a dirty
blood-smeared smock must be busily changed to the surgeon with unclean outer garments is
spreading disease. This change took more than a century to become the new norm, but
unmistakably, forever, habits changed. The old ideas were strongly entrenched and since
Thomas Kuhn, we know that many important discoveries and developments in scientiﬁc
knowledge do not occur smoothly. Paradigm shifts involving major revisions to conventional
thinking are core to what Kuhn called scientiﬁc revolutions (
Kuhn, 1962). Foucault also looked
at medical thinking in France in the eighteen century and observed that an“unprejudiced gaze”
was needed to make the invisible visible.“It is as if for theﬁrst time for thousands of years,
doctors, free at last of theories and chimeras, agreed to approach the object of their experience
with the purity of an unprejudiced gaze” (Foucault, 1963/1973, p. 195). If hand washing had
disappeared over time we might classify it as a fad. However, it endured a paradigm shift.
Neither streaking nor hand washing in clinics wouldﬁt neatly into a category of managerial
fads, but they do illustrate the fad concept (Carsonet al.,2 0 0 0).
Is evidence-based management a fad or a paradigm shift, part of a scientiﬁc revolution?
(Bosman, 2015). Or if surviving, but less than a paradigm shift, might the idea become
institutionalized, integrated into managerial thinking? (Aksom, 2021). Evidence-based
management calls for a new way to see management. The old ways were insufﬁcient: As
cited above, Pfeffer says many managers“don’t use the best or, perhaps, any, evidence”
when managing (Pfeffer quote inBarends and Rousseau, 2018, p. xvi).
The solution according to proponents is to adopt this new evidence-based management
paradigm, see things with an unprejudiced gaze. Certainly, there are many who see this as a
revolutionary step in the direction of improved management. As one journal stated not very
modestly, “change the world: teach evidence-based practice!” (
Rynes et al., 2014). In a 2020

publication, Daouk-Oyry and colleagues say“EBMgt which refers to using the best-quality
evidence from different sources in decision-making, is becoming an imperative for managers
in both proﬁt and non-proﬁt sectors” (Daouk-Oyry et al.,2 0 2 0, p. 1). The website of the
Academy of Management in May 2021 announces a new subpage called Academy of
Management Insights, “bringing the best management research to business and society
worldwide. Our summaries transform evidence-based (italics added) research [... ] into
actionable insights” (Academy of Management, 2021). Many “... scholars have seen EBM
becoming an important area of research and practice” (Yang, 2020, p. 706). It is very
common to see this sort of positive evaluation:“Evidence-based management is on the rise”
and “widely embraced around the globe” (Hall and Van Rizen, 2018, p. 321). GeorgeGraen
(2009, p. 257) says evidence-based management is not just another“ﬂavor of the month” and
educators should“teach our management students that evidence-based management is the
way to solve management problems in organizations.” Lisa Burke-Smalley agrees:“put
simply, [... ] publishers, authors and management faculty should pursue evidence-based
teaching and education” (2014, p. 264). Jean Bartunek and Wayne Cascio agree and describe
how to teach this (Bartunek, 2014; Cascio, 2007). More than a decade ago Trish Reay and her
colleagues surveyed the literature on evidence-based management. Their study listed 144
papers. Of these 140 articles were supportive, 4 papers did not favor evidence-based
management (Reay et al., 2009). That ratio might be categorized as overwhelming support.
However, not everyone is supportive.Martelli and Hayirli (2018)discuss pro and con camps.
Some say the idea, even the words“evidence-based,” should be avoided (Hall and Battaglio,
2018). Some scholars oppose evidence-based management. Morrell and Learnmouth say
directly that they are“against evidence-based management” (2015, p. 520). However, even
today, by far most comments are positive, endorsing evidence-based management.
One readable and informative 2016 article supports evidence-based decision-making:
Hospital physician-manager “Dr Clancy ” followed the principles of evidence-based
management. After methodically analyzing the problems in the Fast Track department the
physical layout of the hospital was changed and how patients were selected for Fast Track
was revised. The results meant shorter waiting times and better satisfaction among both
staff and patients (
Wright et al., 2016). A real organization beneﬁtted. This hospital example
illustrates the potential. There are positive aspects of evidence-based management. Potential
beneﬁts are widely discussed and well covered in the literature.
One can see it so often in so many places that the question arises, is this a fad. Ironically,
the Matthews paper cited above used evidence-based management to help her understand
and describe fads: evidence-based management is “deemed to be essential for the
underpinning of any new management practice or process and, therefore, must be a core
element of any model for explaining‘fad’ adoption” (
Matthews, 2015, p. 306). Thus, if our
original question number 1, is evidence-based management a fad, is answered in the
afﬁrmative, one might be in the unusual situation of using a fad, evidence-based
management, to determine why when and how managerial fads are adopted.
Matthews’ commonly agreed list of fad characteristics (above) as modiﬁed in this essay
provides a starting point. By reviewing these characteristics one sees that there is a
possibility, even a likelihood, that evidence-based management can be added to the fad list.
Only time can answer this question.
The cycle of popularity could be traced using many methods, including a number of
journal articles on the topic and/or a number of times these papers have been cited (citation
counts).
Strang and Macy (2001, p. 151) use a different method to illustrate the cyclical
nature of one fad, TQM. They show changes in the numbers of TQM consultants who focus
on one aspect or tool of TQM, quality circles (Table 2).

Popularity in academic journals is certainly not the only or even the best way to determine if
a management idea is a fad but can be instructive. Citation counts are also widely used and
widely debated. The number of articles on a given topic published in journals can be an
indicator. One could use simple frequency counts to show the life cycles of each and every fad
or tool on a revised list of fad characteristics above. We provide journal article frequency counts
for two topics, quality circles and evidence-based management.
We searched each term in Google Scholar for different time periods,ﬁve-year intervals.
Although Google Scholar sometimes misses things and sometimes double counts it can give
a researcher a general picture. We looked for the termquality circleswhich is seen as an
important component of TQM and is the term used by Strang and Macy. We searched in the
titles only, not text or abstract, of each article. We followed a similar protocol forevidence-
based management with or without a hyphen and forEBMgt. We looked at each paper
found and eliminated those relating to evidence-basedmedicine.
Table 3shows the results for the citation search for quality circles, following a similar
cycle to that in the Strang and Macy paper.
Table 4 shows the results from the journal publication search for evidence-based
management. Although we see incubation, takeoff and a period of rising popularity, we do

not see a decline. Thus, as of 2021, it is not appropriate to include evidence-based
management of any list of fads. This analysis could be redone in 2025 and after.
As stated above, the term fad often, probably usually, carries negative connotations in
managerial and academic circles. However, even if it is concluded that evidence-based
management is a fad, destined to fade away, the tools introduced have the potential to
remain in the decision-maker’s toolbox. One of the authors of this essay was once an active,
even passionate, member, of the Military Affairs subcommittee of the Western
Massachusetts chapter of the Society of American Value Engineers, SAVE. The chapter is
no longer active, but the SAVE has adapted and morphed into SAVE International. The
value engineering tools and checklists, still usable, remind one of those found in the
literature on evidence-based management publications (
Mousakhani et al.,2 0 1 7). Value
engineering tools survive, even as popularity waned. Only time can tell what will happen to
evidence-based management. The SAVE changed with the times and now is SAVE
International. Will one day the Center for Evidence-based Management be modiﬁed,
stressing checklists less, thinking more? A goal of a name change might be to show that
there needs to be a broader approach to decision-making than the hyperrationality many see
as a feature of evidence-based management. The term hyperrationality has at times taken on
ad eﬁnition used by sociologists, which Ritzer traces back to Max Weber. We use the term in
a non-technical sense ( Dandaneau and Dodworth, 2006 ). We see evidence-based
management as hyperrational, extremely rational. A Center might possibly be renamed, to a
Center for Dual Process Based Management or Center for Third Way Management? Those
of us asking for something other than hyperrationality, which the dictionary deﬁnes as
extreme rationality, are not promoting irrationality. Then, as of the year 2021, there are
many saying one needs more than rational analysis in decision-making. Although this
“more-than-rational” approach has been studied for many decades, it gained additional
attention when Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel Prize in 2002.
3. Does evidence-based management underutilize System 1?
In this essay, we ask two main questions. First, is evidence-based management a fad. We
now turn to our second question, does evidence-based management underutilize System 1
described by Kahneman? Overemphasis on facts, best available evidence, raises questions.
Prizewinning economist Kahneman wrote a scholarly yet readable book thinking, fast and
slow (2011). That book explained hisﬁndings from years of work with much of it along with
Amos Tversky. Kahnemann put together ideas that are central today to behavioral
economics. Kahnemann looks at how humans decide and sees two basic approaches. System
1 operates automatically and quickly, using impressions, intuition, feelings. System 2
constructs thoughts in an orderly series of steps,“thinks.” The evidence-based management
idea is for System 2, the rational fact-based approach andless supportive of System 1,
instinct, feelings, emotions, hunches. The evidence-based management movement maintains
that System 1 is used too often. The tone of evidence-based management may lead managers
to neglect System 1. This can lead to decisions based on insufﬁcient thinking, inadequate
analysis (
Liu et al.,2 0 1 7).
Overemphasis on the best available evidence, the facts, may be ill-advised. The world
is changing and“facts” change. What we know as“facts” today may be replaced by new
facts in the future. Also, facts look backward. Some say they are using“facts” that observers
describe as “alternate truths” and “alternate facts” (Bilos, 2019). Supporters said US
President Donald Trump made decisions after reviewing of evidence, after looking at facts.
However, supporters labeled as facts things some others saw as untruths.
Evidence-
based
management

<<<PAGE=14>>>
There is an additional point. The question“what are the facts” may get harder to answer.
As time passes, things change. Scientiﬁc advances enable the world to learn new things.
Many things are more complex than previously thought. For example, how many stars are
there? On a clear night, humans can see approximately 4,500 to 5,000 stars. Radio-telescopes
and sky-mapping space probes are expanding the previously-known universe. Every star
one can see with the naked eye is within our galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy. One
constellation in that Milky Way galaxy is in the Northern Hemisphere known as the Big
Dipper. Within the dipper part of the Big Dipper, astronomers have mapped as many
galaxies as there are visible stars in the night sky. How many stars are there? The changing
number of stars shows that what is known as fact may be wrong. Evidence-based decision-
making should search for and use facts but decision-makers should approach“facts”
cautiously. Today’s facts may change. Looking upwards helps us see that yesterday’s facts
do notﬁt today or tomorrow.
A look at the sky reminds us that facts change. In decision-making, there may be similar
frame-shattering discoveries. As more is being learned about the universe above, more is
also being learned about the magic within, the human decision-making machinery. One can
start by looking at the brain. It is afact that in most people speech is handled mostly by the
left hemisphere. The left hemisphereseems best at verbal, sequential, logical tasks. For
creativity, the right hemisphereseems best. For multidimensional tasks where unrelated
activities are done simultaneously, the right hemisphereseems best. In the opinion of many,
the right hemisphere has powers still being discovered. In a burst of enthusiasm in the
twentieth-century “experts” showed how the discovery of the“Right Brain” should change
education and management. It became a fad, claiming to use the best available evidence.
However, that evidence was incomplete (
Lindell and Kidd, 2011). As in the case of“how
many stars,” more and more is being discovered about the brain. Not only which hemisphere
but what combination of tissue and enzymes and synapses and hormones and neurons
make creativity happen are being studied now (Gabora and Ranjan, 2013). There are
numerous avenues currently being explored. For example, professor Carel Le Roux won an
award for studies related to hypothalamic signaling or“how the gut talks to the brain”
(Miras and Le Roux, 2013. See alsoSoosalu et al.,2 0 1 9). Scientists are learning more and
more, ﬁnding new facts, about the brain. If science has now identiﬁed as many galaxies in
the dipper part of the Big Dipper as previously“known” stars, what will be learned about
the brain? We mayﬁnd patterns and possibilities and better ways to improve the decision-
making and creative capabilities of managers, beyond simply adding up facts (Hodgkinson
et al.,2 0 0 9).
As Rowan (1979 p. 110) put it, those“hunches are more than blind faith.” That same
article quotes Herman Kahn:“my research is a combination of intuition and judgment. I
don’t know where it comes from. The mind simply puts things together” (111). The quote
sometimes attributed to Einstein deserves attention:“The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and
the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and
has forgotten the gift” (Kuhlmey, 2017). Einstein is also credited with saying“not everything
that is counted counts. Not everything that counts can be counted” (Pfeffer and Sutton,
2006a p. 86). Neglecting gut feelings, overreliance on“scalable measurements” (Landfester
and Metelmann, 2020p. 3) might be as detrimental as ignoring facts and data. In the 1960s
America tried unsuccessfully to stop an idea with overwhelming ﬁrepower and kept
ﬁghting a war in Vietnam that was globally unpopular. Continued involvement was in part
due to a tendency to statistically analyze things that should have been considered
holistically. The USA led by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara looked at numbers and
IJOA

<<<PAGE=15>>>
fought on. This earned the Secretary the distinction of being named in a decision-making
approach, “the McNamara Fallacy:”
The ﬁrst step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is OK as far as it goes. The
second step is to disregard that which can’t be easily measured or to give it an arbitrary
quantitative value. This is artiﬁcial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can’t
be measured easily really isn’t important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what
can’t be easily measured really doesn’t exist. This is suicide (Yankelovich, 1972).
For many years the USﬁrm General Motors (GM) topped the annual Fortune 500 list of
ﬁrms, led by GM executive Alfred Sloan. Management consultant Peter Drucker explains,
when Sloan saw no arguments against an idea and when even he himself could articulate no
opposing argument if it did not feel right, he postponed the decision (Drucker, 1967).
Managing this way, observing and considering facts but also listening to gut feelings,
helped GM stay on top. Professor Henry Mintzberg also sees the value in considering facts
and data, as well as intuitive feelings. Mintzberg tied his ideas to the partially correct notion
that rational sequential approaches generally start in the brain’s left hemisphere, while
creative, intuitive, more likely originate in the brain’s right hemisphere:“Planning on the left
side, managing on the right” (1976). Herbert Simon received a Nobel Prize for telling the
world that the rational model of decision-making is not followed by most cases and is in fact
wrong (Cristofaro, 2017a; Kim et al., 2006; Leahey, 2003). Will someone later receive a Nobel
Prize for showing that evidence-based management does not guide decision-makers in
actual organizations?
For better decisions, one should carefully look at the evidence. Ideally, attention paid to
evidence-based management will help bring improved use of the rational mind, while not
forgetting the sacred gift, the intuitive mind. Whether it is called right-brain or System 1 or
non-rational or nonlinear or intuitive, effective leaders take advantage of instinct, intuition,
creativity, feelings and have a sense for when to stop looking for additional data and start
reﬂecting (
Hodgkinson and Sadler-Smith, 2018). They assess then reﬂect. They use both
heart and mind, using both affective and cognitive analysis (Kim et al., 2006; Luo and Yu,
2015). The evidence-based management movement overstates its case for System 2 and
unwisely minimizes System 1.
Many observers have made similar observations and criticisms, both as pertains to
evidence-based management and to evidence-based medicine (Edwards, 2018; Morrell and
Learmonth, 2015; Morrell et al.,2 0 1 5). There is value in looking at quantiﬁable supportable
data-based evidence (Banasiewicz, 2019). There is also a danger that one may become so
enamored with facts that one may forget that not all quantiﬁable information is important
and that not everything that is quantiﬁable is important. For making decisions in large
organizations, most of the steps suggested by proponents of evidence-based management
make sense. However, managers we observe do not consult checklist after checklist. The
impetus for evidence-based management was correct, some managers use too few facts,
however, overreliance on facts, a hyperrational approach, would come at a cost. If the house
is onﬁre, sometimes intuition says when to move out (Gladwell, 2005p 122). If the ship is
sinking, even before careful analysis, plug the leaks.
The checklists recommended on the evidence-based management web page (www.
cebma.org) tell practitioners to consider the population, the intervention, the comparison,
the outcome and the context (PICOC). Then, an effective evidence-based manager should
follow “the six steps” ask, acquire, appraise, aggregate, apply and assess. One should
consider “the four sources of evidence,” practitioners, scientiﬁc literature, organizations and
stakeholders. Implementing evidence-based management is not as easy as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
followed by 1, 2, 3 and 4. Our analysis agrees to suggest that decision-makers take into
Evidence-
based
management
109
<<<PAGE=16>>>
account facts, evidence when making decisions. However, one should use the rational
approach but not ignore feelings, misgivings, hunches (Rousseau, 2020). Kahneman is right:
both Systems 1 and 2 have value.
Reﬂecting back on the terminology used in the 1980s, the brain has two hemispheres. We
should use both. This oversimpliﬁcation is a starting point. We are continually learning
more and more about the brain. Each hemisphere includes a huge number of
subcomponents. Just as the number of stars in the sky increased from 5,000, technology is
facilitating the exploration of the brain. Today we might say that the brain has a universe of
possible combinations usable in decision-making.
One area addressed in numerous publications has to do with the role of emotion in
decision-making (
Aroesty-Cohen, 2013; Bartel and Garud, 2009; Betsch and Glöckner, 2010;
Cristofaro, 2020a; Evans, 2008; Evans and Stanovich, 2013; Kim et al.,2 0 0 6; Lerner et al.,
2015; Luo and Yu, 2015; Soosalu et al., 2019). Emotion involves more than System 1 thinking
but is closer to System 1 than to System 2.
There are questions as to what extent evidence-based management actually helps
managers facing decisions (Hamilton, 2012; Reay et al.,2 0 0 9). Many decisions have“soft
skills” or “ethical” dimensions (Hulpke and Fronmueller, 2020; Parlamis and Monnot, 2019).
As Gill warns“decision-making may fail by being too narrow [... ] [ignoring such questions
as] what are my values?” (Gill, 2004, p. 136).Fatien Diochon and Nizet (2019)observe that it
is difﬁcult to use a formula to resolve questions of ethics. Rather than follow checklists,
managers see “Ethics as a fabric: an emotional reﬂexive sensemaking process.” Careful
analysis might show that decision-makers in organizations make decisions through the
knitting of emotions and reﬂexivity, interwoven as in afabric. Wicked problems such as
climate change require more than evidence-based analysis (Bartel and Garud, 2009; Cadez
and Czerny, 2016). “Thick evaluation” involves “a union of fact and value” (van der Linden
and Freeman, 2017). Chaos theory and also complexity theory as mentioned above, provide
additional lenses by which to study decisions. Although most often applied in the hard
sciences, these ways of seeing may also be useful in helping understand how people make
decisions.
One might guess that evidence-based management would receive a warmer reception in
more quantitative areas, say accounting orﬁnance. However, that may not be the case. A
relatively new idea inﬁnance is the realization that numbers, facts, are not enough (Powell
et al., 2011), Rational economics is basically wrong. In reality,“investors and ﬁnancial
markets behave more like biology than physics [... ] the principles of evolution are more
useful for understanding theﬁnancial industry than the physics-like principles of rational
economic analysis” (Lo, 2017p. 2). Careful collection and analysis of voluminous pieces of
data, evidence, are not enough to prevent a meltdown of the price of any speciﬁc stock or for
that matter, of Wall Street.
If notﬁnance, where might evidence-based management be best put to use? The team
which concluded that Dr Clancy solving the Fast Track delays shows beneﬁts of evidence-
based management gave a few caveats. For example,“EBM decision processes may be
particularly suited to operations management problems, as this sub-ﬁeld in organization
and management studies has shown itself to be well suited to formal scientiﬁc approaches,
and thus has a well-developed literature [... ]” (Wright et al.,2 0 1 6, p. 173). However, even in
operations management, the evidence-based approach does not appear to always be the
answer. It is true there is well-developed literature. Even on a small sub-topic such as
inventory control,“thousands of pages have been printed in scholarly books and operations
research journals [... ]” (Wagner, 1974 p. 278). Unfortunately for supporters of evidence-
based management that is not the end of the story. In the article containing that quote,
IJOA
30,7
110
<<<PAGE=17>>>
published in 1974, Yale Professor Harvey Wagner noted that“It is paradoxical then, that so
few of these techniques have been implemented in real manufacturing companies” (p, 278).
Our ability to obtain data and to perform more sophisticated statistical analyzes has
improved. However, implementation sometimes remains elusive. If implementation
could not be achieved in the area of production management, which was“well suited to
formal scientiﬁc approaches,” one might expect organizational managers to encounter
even more difﬁculties today if they attempt to implement evidence-based management.
As Jen Howard-Grenville says, “for a lot of the topics we study, it’s unclear that there
could be a deﬁnitive empirical contribution [... ]W ed o n’t study things that are subject
to universal laws. We’re studying humans; we’re studying how they make sense of
things; we’re studying the decisions that they take under uncertainty ” (
Hahn et al.,
2021,p .4 ) .
Data should be obtained and considered as appropriate, the best available evidence
should assist in decision-making. Evidence-based management can add tools to the decision-
maker’s toolbox. However, there are times when decision-makers should think out of the
toolbox. Managers and those analyzing organizations should not ignore the brain’s “System
1” (automatic, holistic) way of thinking. This does not mean that the evidence should be
ignored. Both Systems 1 and 2 are useful. A look at a list of 10“environmental, social and
governance” indicators suggests areas where data, evidence, should be obtained and
considered. However, this list also suggests that each should also be evaluated qualitatively
and searching for the best available scientiﬁc evidence. The list illustrates climate change,
natural resources, pollution and waste, environmental opportunities, human capital, product
liability, shareholder opposition, social opportunities, corporate governance, corporate
behavior. The article which contains this list criticizes that“the metrics used” here and by
implication, most such lists,“almost completely ignore” key qualitative aspects (
Lyon et al.,
2018). Numbers can deﬁnitely help decipher climate change, for example, but the human
evaluation is also needed. AsRaadschelders (2011, p. 920) states“big questions cannot be
answered by means of measurement and quantiﬁcation alone. After all, we can measure and
quantify only that which allows measurement.” It is important to think about impact and
impact is often hard to measure. When making a decision involving ethics, one needs more
than the best available evidence. One needs to consider right and wrong (Hulpke and
Fronmueller, 2020).
In one sense the discussion of evidence-based management mirrors a bigger discussion
or debate that lies behind many or the points in this essay. A brief review of two overlapping
and imprecisely de ﬁned world-views may be appropriate. Positivists-objectivists-
reductionists see the value of scientiﬁc methods and typically quantify where possible, while
relativist-interpretivism leans toward humanistic qualitative approaches. Those seeing the
world from a positivist-objectivist perspective might well endorse evidence-based
management. Adinolfo describes the two sides as“objective/subjective; rational/intuitive;
ordered/disordered” (2021, p. 18). Those who stand on the interpretive-relativist-subjective-
postpositivist side may see issues with evidence-based management. These relativist
humanists might ask, is evidence-based management really different than the many fads
and fashions listed above?
Evidence-based management is being recommended by many as a way or even the way,
toward better decisions. We fear an overreliance on this popular framework would miss
something, leading to a one-dimensional approach. We do not agree with
Rynes and
Bartunek (2017, p, 252), who ask for a“moratorium on opinion pieces” about evidence-based
management. They want to see empirical studies. It is almost as if they are already
convinced of the value of evidence-based management but cannotﬁnd evidence to prove

their support is justiﬁed. From our perspective, more empirical studies are a good idea, but
researchers should keep in mind points made by Bartunek in a different paper. Bartunek
sees “challenges” in material based on.
Positivist epistemology centered on the scientiﬁc method [where]ﬁndings presented is results of
quantitative studies, something Iﬁnd a bit narrow in scope. Many scholars conduct qualitative
studies and there is increasing awareness of the importance of multiple epistemologies in
conducting research [... ] with the consequence that some particular statisticalﬁndings may not
seem particularly meaningful (regardless of whether they are statistically or practically
signiﬁcant (2014, p. 102).
Where does this leave us on the question, evidence-based management: what’sn o tt ol i k e ?
Evidence, facts, may help some managers sometimes. A rational approach has
advantages. However, decision-makers should be cautious not to overdo this. There are
disadvantages to extreme rationality, hyper-rationality. Management is as much an art
as it is a science. Baniewicz believes we can beneﬁt from the ideas of evidence-based
management but prefers not using the term. Instead,“fact-based sensemaking should be
framed as an educator of decision-maker intuition” (2019 p. i).
Tourish (2013)suggests the
term evidence-based management might be replaced with the term evidence-oriented
organizing. Instead of the term evidence-based, Tranﬁeld and colleagues use evidence-
informed (Tranﬁeld et al., 2003). Manning and colleagues suggest substituting a new
term management-based evidence instead of evidence-based management ( Manning
et al., 2020).
Evidence-based management is being recommended by many as a way or even the
way, toward better decisions. We fear an overreliance on this popular framework
would miss something, leading to a one-dimensional approach. The best available
evidence is necessary but not suf ﬁcient. Even a dual-processing perspective may
oversimplify the complexity of human decision-making. In Kahneman ’sa p p r o a c h
System 1 is automatic “thinking without thinking ” and System 2 is the rational
approach. However, some scholars suggest there may be more. One 2019 paper is
titled “head, heart and gut in decision-making ” (
Soosalu et al., 2019). We observe
extensive and growing attention to emotions in decision-making ( Cristofaro, 2019 ;
Cristofaro, 2020a ; Lerner et al., 2015). Emotions deﬁnitely impact decisions. However,
neither System 1 nor System 2 fully take into account gut feelings. When a decision-
maker says “Ik n e wi nm yg u tt h a tw a sw h a tIh a dt od o” this may reﬂect more than
head or heart. Even the popular culture suggests decision-making is complex. The
series of Star Wars movies which began in the 1970s had aﬁctional character named
Obi-Wan Kenobi. In oneﬁlm Kenobi warned“Your eyes can deceive you. Do not trust
them” and “let go of your conscious self and act on instinct” (Feichtinger, 2014 p. 39).
In an exhibit about Star Wars in the Singapore Art Science Museum in 2021, this Obi-
Wan Kenobi quote is posted on a wall, modiﬁed as follows: “Your eyes can deceive
you. So can your feelings.”
How things are called, named, sometimes helps add to our understanding. It is
interesting that when dual processing decision-making is discussed, most papers now use
the system or System 2, not terms used earlier Type 1 and Type 2. The term type might
have somehow seemed more restrictive than the word system. Even that newer improved
term has been seen as overly restrictive. Evans, an expert in dual-process theories wrote a
paper, which included the word“Type 2” in the title. Then inside that paper Evans used
slightly different terms and stated whey he found neither term sufﬁciently robust to convey
the ideas:

Multiple type 2 systems(bold font title case in original)
I stated earlier that the main reason I have stopped using the terms systems 1 and 2 is that there
is clearly a multiplicity of systems underlying autonomous type 1 processes. [... ] If type 1 is a
category of processes then why should type 2 not be as well? [... ] each type 2 system can be
thought of as an ad hoc committee [... ] [here Evans citedMercier and Sperber, 2017]( Evans, 2019
pp. 396– 397).
It may be generally agreed that facts, the best available evidence, are useful, even necessary.
However, after reading this essay, after hearing multiple opinions, many will agree that
evidence, facts, are not sufﬁcient. What may be a bit harder to adopt or agree upon is the
idea that emotions and opinions are also a necessary part of the process and that even dual
processing ideas oversimplify human decision-making.
Fortunately, humans have deﬁnite cognitive ﬂexibility, which brain scientists are
learning more and more about (
Hodgkinson, 2002; Laureiro-Martínez and Brusoni, 2018).
Both neurologists and psychologists now have technology enabling us to better understand
how affect works (Miras and le Roux, 2013). As time passes we will learn more about the
myriad of ways different feelings, including anger and resolve, relate to decision-making. It
appears that in addition to cognitiveﬂexibility humans also possess emotional and affective
ﬂexibility. We are learning that decisions use a galaxy of approaches, with both cognitive
and affectiveﬂexibility. The dual processing metaphor is better than a no-facts approach or
even a (potentially hyper-rational) evidence-based approach.Varga and Hamburger (2014)
use the term“third way.” Cognitive ﬂexibility plus affectiveﬂexibility suggests humans
have a multimodal decision-making capability.
Consider again the case mentioned above where evidence-based management was a
success. The successful changes to the Fast Track system in XYZ Hospital would not have
happened without the guidance, the belief, the leadership skills, of Dr Clancy. Dr Clancy
gathered and did a systematic analysis of the best available evidence. And then, according to
Dr Clancy,“there’s still a little bit of intuitiveﬁlling-in of the blanks” (
Wrightet al., 2016,p .1 7 0 ) .
Supporters say “evidence-based management isorganizational (italics in original) not
managerialism” (Rousseau, 2020,p .4 1 5 ) .H o w e v e r ,i nt h eﬁnal analysis, decisions are made by
individuals. If the goal is better organizational decision-making, one must still look to individual
decision-makers. However, individuals are not the focal point of evidence-based management,
with its six steps and four sources of evidence, etc. Effective decision-makers see in all directions
and sense more than the eye sees, much like a chameleon (Remenyiet al., 2005). Evidence-based
management begins with a fundamentally incomplete and we believe the incorrect notion that
management should follow principles of rationality, should see the world from a positivist-
objectivist-rational perspective. It is correct that decision-makers should gather and use
evidence. However, it would be a mistake to give more credit to evidence-based management
than is due. It would be a mistake to use only System 2 when making decisions. As quoted
above,“The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant.” Evidence-
based management might lead decision-makers to honor the servant and forget the gift.
4. Limitations and recommendations
This essay is written in English. One author’s ﬁrst language was not English but uses
English in daily and academic life. This paper, if translated into another language such as
Chinese and later back-translated into English might yield different meanings. To put it into
affective terms, the feel might be different. Even a simple starting dichotomy, rational
versus emotional and presents issues. The opposite of rational is in English sometimes
thought of as irrational. The goal of dual-processing theories or of our essay is not to
Evidence-
based
management

encourage decision-makers to be irrational. How Systems 1 and 2 or heart and mind, mayﬁt
together is worth contemplating, feeling. If“chi” is a strength inherent in the world, if one
needs to adopt yoga-like approaches to understand anything, might this also apply to
decision-making? Some might see contradictions between, for example, evidence-based
management and intuition-aided decision-making, perhaps, it is worth relooking at the yin-
yang idea embraced in many Eastern cultures. Two sides may be different, even appear
contradictory, yet when considered together simultaneously may provide solutions where
the sum is greater than the combination of the parts. These points are not merely about
semantics. It may be that a yin-yang approach might lead to a qualitatively different way of
looking at decision-making. This essay is in English, based totally on English language
sources. This is a limitation of the essay.
5. Concluding thoughts
We return again to the questions posed in the introduction to this essay. Regarding
evidence-based management, what’s not to like? We say that evidence-based management is
sometimes over-sold and may be a fad. Additionally, evidence-based management fails to
fully recognize the importance of tacit knowledge, factors, which cannot easily be translated
into evidence and what Kahneman calls System 1.
When organizations make decisions these depend onindividuals making decisions. Many
now study the human brain. There are numerous respected journals such asbrain research,
cognitive brain research and frontiers in behavioral neuroscience. Each issue contains
signiﬁcant information. In the same sense that the number of stars visible with the human
eye exploded exponentially because of technology, new techniques are enabling scientists to
learn more and more about connections between and characteristics of components of the
brain. For example, emotions and what may have traditionally been labeled intuition are not
exclusively right brain. These processing and handling systems of the brain can now be
studied and sometimes even seen.
The scientiﬁc community should continue to investigate how Dr Clancy happened to
have “a little bit of intuition.” There is really no need to know exact neurological processes
any more than we need to know exactly how any stars there are. It was a step in the right
direction to learn that there were many more than 5,000 stars. Evidence-based management
suggests obtaining the best available scientiﬁc evidence and using the tools in the evidence-
based management toolbox. Having the best available evidence can be useful but this is
absolutely not enough. It will be a step in the right direction to acknowledge that effective
decision-makers both assessand reﬂect. As more and more people realize this, the attention
to evidence-based management is likely to lessen. Evidence-based management may fade
away, like the fads in the list above.

Dr Michael P. Fronmueller received his PhD in Strategy from Washington State University and
has had a distinguished career as a faculty member and administrator at several universities, most
recently at University of Wisconsin, River Falls. Fronmueller’s questions about evidence-based
management stem from his consulting work and participation in dozens of AACSB accreditation
visits. As Fronmueller says,“The really good leaders don’t lead this way, checklist after checklist.
Management is as much an art as it is a science. We should acknowledge that as we teach.”
