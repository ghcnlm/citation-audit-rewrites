Abstract 
Mentoring is a valuable resource for learning and coping with major organizational changes. It brings 
value to everyone involved in this relationship, that is, mentees, mentors and the organization. The 
present study examines impact of mentoring functions on career development. Further, it also investi-
gates the role of mentoring culture and mentoring structure as moderator. Employees working in call 
centres in India have been selected for data collection. Reliability and validity has been proved with 
the help of confirmatory factor analysis. Structural equation modelling has been used for hypotheses 
testing. Results revealed that mentoring functions significantly affect career development of call centre 
employees. Further, mentoring culture and mentoring structure moderate the relationship between 
mentoring functions and career development.

Introduction 
In an era of global competition, restructuring, rapid technological changes and constrained resources, 
organizations are searching for ways to do more with less, especially in the area of human resources 
(HR) (Dominguez and Hager, 2013). In response, many organizations have started mentoring programmes 
to serve their business purpose as well as help to meet the developmental needs of employees. Mentoring 
is a valuable resource for learning and coping with major organizational changes (Kram and Hall, 1996). 
Mentoring is a process in which more a senior person acts as a mentor to provide a variety of functions 
that support, guide, protect, expose and counsel the young adults to get the work done efficiently (Akarak 
and Ussahawanitchakit, 2008; Pembridge and Paretti, 2011; Rhay et al., 2010). Kram (1985) identified 
different types of mentoring functions, namely, career and psychosocial functions, which have been 
confirmed by various researchers (Davis, 2005; Erdem and Ozen, 2008; Jacobi, 1991; Johnson and

Cervero, 2004; Luna and Cullen, 1998; Mullen, 2007; Ragins and Cotton, 1999; Young and Perrewe, 
2000). Mentoring leverages strategic knowledge and skill throughout the organization by sharing and 
spreading acquired learning and know-how. It allows the learner to acquire new skills, abilities and 
knowledge that enhance his competences and help in career development. Career development is the 
opportunities for promotion and development within the organization or field of work (Conway and 
Briner, 2002). It is a lifelong process of managing progression in learning, work, leisure and transitions 
in order to move towards a determined future (Career Industry Council of Australia, 2007). 
Mentoring yields better results when coupled with mentoring structure and culture. Mentoring culture is 
a learning environment in which a person learns by watching others’ behaviours. Mentoring culture con-
sists of an environment which implements mentoring in a sound, complete and careful way (MacArthur 
and Pilato, 1995). It empowers mentor with communicating network, training and administrating facilities 
to promote mentoring relationships. Zachary (2007) highlighted four traits to successfully implement 
mentoring culture in an organization, namely, flexibility, ownership, clarity and feedback. 
Mentoring structure is a well-planned technique of designing all organizational activities from top to 
bottom and bottom to top in a flexible environment. It supports mentoring and provides records for 
evaluation and benchmarking. It also provides means for feedback and clarifies roles, goals and 
responsibilities, as well as expectations and accountability (Bally, 2007; Koberg et al., 1998; Lyons and 
Oppler, 2004; Doolittle et al., 2013). Mentoring structure helps to link personal, career and reward-
related HR processes (Swart and Kinnie, 2003; Viator, 1999). 
Akarak and Ussahawanitchakit (2008), Emmerik (2008), Murphy and Ensher (2001) and Young and 
Perrewe (2000) have explored the outcomes of mentoring, but there has been very little research regard-
ing the variables which strengthen this relationship. Therefore, the present study focuses on evaluating 
variables which strengthen the relationship between the processes that help in career progression and 
other related outcomes. 
The article is arranged as follows. Literature has been reviewed next, followed by the objectives and 
a section related to hypotheses development. The section after that describes methodology, followed by 
analyses and discussion of the present study. Then, managerial and theoretical implications are given, 
followed by the limitations and scope for future research. 
Review of Literature 
As per Saman Suttam 27, an important Jaina philosophy, mentoring is an age-old practice that could offer 
valuable benefits to organizations (Jain, 2011). Academically, Kram (1985) pioneered research in mento-
ring and identified two forms of support provided by mentors, that is, career and psychosocial support. 
Organizations benefit through improved employee retention, enhanced organizational commitment, redu-
ced turnover (Chew and Wong, 2008; Payne and Huffman, 2005; Raabe and Beehr, 2003), enhanced job 
commitment, job efficiency and job performance (Akarak and Ussahawanitchakit, 2008; Emmerik, 2008). 
Mentors get benefited through enhanced in-role job performance, personal learning, social status, team 
cohesiveness, promotion rate and compensation (Dawley et al., 2010; Liu, Liu, Kwan and Mao, 2009; 
Ragins and Cotton, 1999; Rekha and Ganesh, 2012). Mentoring gives positive results for protégés in the 
form of increased employees satisfaction, role clarity, self-efficacy, personal learning, professional deve-
lopment and career satisfaction (Eastman and Williams, 1993; Murphy and Ensher, 2001; Young and 
Perrewe, 2000). Further, it can also help in repatriation of female managers (Tahir and Azhar, 2013). 
Jung and Tak (2008), Lentz (2004) and Lentz and Allen (2009) have explored the moderating role of 
mentoring. Shrivastava (2011) revealed that mentoring moderated the relationship between job burnout and 
career development, whereas Dawley et al. (2010) found that mentoring moderated the relationships

between perceived organizational support, supervisor support and job fit on turnover intentions. As against 
the above-mentioned studies, Hegstad and Wentling (2005) identified three variables, that is, feedback, 
reward systems and selection/matching processes, which act as a moderator between mentoring and its 
outcomes. Further, previous research has also explored mediating variables between mentoring and its out-
comes: for example, Eisenberger, Armeli, Rexwinkel, Lynch and Rhoades (2001) and Rhoades, Eisenberger 
and Armeli (2001) found that the effects of perceived organizational support (as a mentoring function) on 
turnover are fully mediated through affective commitment. Similarly, normative commitment mediates the 
relationship between perceived organizational support and turnover intention (Maertz et al., 2007). 
Review of literature has revealed that number of researches have been conducted on the mentoring 
functions and its outcomes (Allen et al., 2004; Ettington, 1998; Hezlett and Gibson, 2005; Scandura, 
Manuel, Werther and Lankau, 1996). Noe, Greenberger and Wang (2002) indicated that only a small 
number of studies have examined the moderating variables, that is, gender, race, age, etc., and stressed 
the need to explore the variables which strengthen the relationship between career raised ground and 
outcomes variables. Therefore, the proposed study bridges this research gap by examining the role of 
mentoring culture and mentoring structure as moderating variables between mentoring functions and 
career development (see Figure 1). 
Objectives 
1. To examine the impact of mentoring functions on career development. 
2. To explore the impact of mentoring culture and structure between mentoring function and career 
development. 
Framework of Analysis 
Impact of Mentoring Functions on Career Development 
Ragins and Scandura (1999) found that mentoring benefits protégés through increased prospects of 
career development. Positive outcomes which have been linked to mentoring include: protégé’s career 
attachment (Allen and Lentz, 2006; Bahniuk et al., 1983; Janine, 2012; Noe, 1988a; Ricker, 2006; 
Scandura, 1992; Scandura and Viator, 1994; Turban and Dougherty, 1994); early career success (Whitely

et al., 1991); career satisfaction; career enhancement; professional development; and the numbers of 
promotions received (Whitely and Coestsier, 1993). The experience, knowledge and coaching rendered 
by the mentor can be significant for the career development of the protégé. The protégé learns from the 
mentor and advances in his or her career by having protection, coaching, sponsorship, exposure, etc. The 
mentor protects the protégés from undesirable assignments and internal politics, which helps the mentee 
to concentrate upon his career development or advancement. Mentor coaches by providing advice, 
analysis and feedback, with the intention of improving decision making, organizational fit and skills of 
the protégé, so as to enhance the competence level which, in turn, will help in career development. 
Mentor also exposes protégés to senior decision makers and aids them in the creation of their own 
internal and external networks that result in career development. The mentor, as a counsellor, listens to 
the protégé’s work as well as life-related issues and helps him to take correct decisions which improve 
mentee’s career. Mentor also acts as a friend and a role model for protégé, which encourages him/her to 
achieve higher career. It has also been found that employees who have mentors get promotions faster 
than those without the mentor (Dreher and Ash, 1990). Study by Arifeen (2010) revealed that there is an 
association between slow career advancement and lack of mentor. So, the first part of the theoretical 
framework aims at evaluating impact of mentoring functions on career development. 
Moderating Role of Mentoring Structure and Mentoring Culture between  
Mentoring Functions and Career Development 
Mentoring structure has a significant impact on organizations and individuals. Structured mentorship 
requires the mentor and protégé to set goals and objectives together, and meet regularly to discuss issues 
and provide feedback. A well-planned mentoring structure programme improves productivity and 
performance ratings, develops mentee’s as well as mentor’s career and improves diversity. Developing a 
valuable mentoring structure programme requires adequate budget, time, facilities and a true commitment 
from business leaders. Factors like structure and culture enhance mentoring relationship (Ragins and 
Cotton, 1991). A mentor is assigned by virtue of structural position, power and status, which keeps things 
on track and ensures the efficient use of time. This structural process is very important to achieve 
employee’s career development (Purcell, 2004). Further, mentoring culture cultivates, disseminates and 
maintains learning as a core part of the organizational culture. A mentoring culture facilitates 
organizational learning (Kent et al., 2009). It promotes growth, enhances learning, utilizes time effectively 
and emphasizes career advancement. Allen et al. (2004) examined the moderating role of culture between 
mentors and protégé relationship. The second part of the theoretical framework evaluates the role of 
mentoring structure and culture between mentoring functions and career development. 
Methodology 
This research is evaluative in nature. Following steps have been undertaken to make this research 
objective more accurate: 
Sample 
Call centre is a growing service sector. Most of the young people start (especially graduates and those 
who studied till school level without any professional qualification) their initial career in these call 
centres. Centerserve published a report in 2008, titled How to be Great Call Center Manager Report ,

which highlights five attributes of the supervisors, namely, leader as role model, coach, motivator, 
communicator and problem solver. Further, the leaders/supervisors are also evaluated on the basis of 
their mentoring skills (Centreserve, 2008, p. 6). This report gives us the clue that mentoring is being 
practised in call centres. So, to evaluate the outcomes of mentoring, the call centres employees were 
selected as the respondents for the present study. 
Employees working in two call centres of telecommunication firms in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), 
India, were selected as respondents for the study. The call centre employees were selected as the sample 
for the study due to formal superior–subordinate relationship prevalent in these organizations. The pilot 
survey revealed that the team leader performs maximum of the mentoring functions. The research 
population comprised 1,157 employees. All employees who had been working in the call centre for one 
year or above were contacted to generate research information, which further reduced the population to 
907. Only 215 employees responded back (response rate 23.7 per cent). Questionnaire technique with 
five-point Likert scale was used for data collection. 
Measures 
The questionnaire was divided into two parts. The first part provided information regarding age, 
qualification and gender of the employees, which was used as control variables as these can affect the 
outcome variable, that is, career development (Quinn, 1992; Rodriguez & Scurry, 2014; Super, 1983; 
Watson, 1984). The second part consisted of four constructs, namely, mentoring functions, career 
development, mentoring culture and mentoring structure. All constructs were measured on five-point 
Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). The items for these constructs were borrowed 
from the original literature discussed next. 
Mentoring Functions 
It consisted of 29 items developed by Noe (1988b), which are divided into career function (protection, 
coaching, exposure, sponsorship, challenging assignment) and psychosocial function (role modelling, 
friendship, counselling and acceptance). For example, mentor reduces unnecessary risks that could 
threaten the possibility of advancing in the field or of receiving a promotion; mentor helps to finish 
assignments/tasks or meet deadlines that otherwise would have been difficult to complete; mentor gave 
assignments or tasks in work that prepare mentees for an administrative position; mentor gave assignments 
that increased written and personal contact; I try to imitate the work behaviour of my mentor; my mentor 
has shared personal experiences as an alternative perspective to problems; my mentor has demonstrated 
good listening skills in conservations; my mentor has encouraged me to talk openly about anxiety and 
fears that detract from my work; my mentor conveys feelings of respect and empathy to me. 
Career Development 
It comprised 16 items developed by Brusoni (2012), like ‘the organization imparts training for career 
development’, ‘the organization informs you about future career plans’ and ‘mentor promotes your career’. 
Mentoring Culture 
Mentoring culture scale consisted of six items, which were adopted from Zachary (2007), like ‘the 
culture of our organization supports mentoring’ and ‘it provides means for benchmarking’. 
Mentoring Structure 
A seven-item scale, developed by Viator (1999), was used for measuring mentoring structure, for 
example, ‘periodic communication by mentor is done with regular meeting with mentee’ and ‘periodic 
follow up by mentor is done to check the progress of mentee on his task’.

Result and Analysis 
Demographic Profile 
73 per cent respondents are male. Most of the respondents (64.6 per cent) are between 21–25 years of 
age. Thirty-five per cent respondents are those who studied till school level, 61 per cent are graduates 
having bachelor degree and 4 per cent are postgraduates having masters’ degree. The detailed results are 
shown in Table 1. 
Common Method Variance 
The data was self-reporting in nature, which can cause the problem of common method variance. In 
order to remove this problem, Harman’s one-factor test (1967) was applied, where all dependent and 
independent variables were added together and principal component factor analysis was conducted with 
varimax rotation. The results revealed that no single factor was explaining majority of the variance, 
which provided evidence that no threat of common method bias exists (Liu et al., 2011). Further, 
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) also helps to remove this problem. 
Reliability and Validity of Measurement Models 
Though the mentoring function constructs are well established in Western countries’ context, these have 
not been validated in Indian context. So, instead of directly conducting CFA, we first ran exploratory 
factor analysis (EFA) in order to reconfirm the dimensions of mentoring functions. The multivariate data 
reduction technique of factor analysis has been used to examine the interrelationships (correlations) 
among variables and reduction of variables into few manageable and meaningful sets. It was carried with 
principal component analysis, along with orthogonal rotation procedure of varimax, for summarizing the 
original information with minimum factors and optimal coverage (Hair et al., 2006, p. 133) All the five 
major methodological issues that a researcher should consider when conducting a factor analysis 
(Fabrigar et al., 1999) were taken care of while pursuing factor analysis, as these decisions have an 
important bearing on the results obtained. These are: (i) what variables to include (Cattell and Gorsuch, 
1963); (ii) appropriateness of factor analysis; (iii) selection of appropriate procedure; (iv) number of 
factors to be included; and (v) selection of appropriate rotational method. Initial 29 items of mentoring

functions were reduced to 22, which converged under six factors, namely, protection, coaching, exposure, 
role modelling, counselling and friendship. Factor analysis of three other scales used in study resulted in 
one factor solution for each. Summary of factor analysis, mean and standard deviation of the factors that 
emerged after factor analysis are presented in Table 2. 
The CFA has been used to provide a confirmatory test to the measurement theory. It is a way of testing 
how well-measured variables represent a latent construct (Demirbag, Koh, Tatoglu and Zaim, 2006). In 
the present study, CFA was performed to assess reliability and validity of latent constructs. All the 
measurement models (mentoring functions, career development, mentoring structure and mentoring 
culture) yielded appropriate goodness of fit (see Table 4). Anderson and Gerbing (1988) suggested that 
convergent validity is demonstrated by statistically significant path coefficients. Results of the 
measurement models for latent constructs revealed that all standardized loadings are above 0.50  
(p < 0.01), which provided support for convergent validity (see Table 3). Further average variance 
extracted values (> 0.50) also proved convergent validity (see Table 3). Discriminant validity can be 
achieved when the squared correlations between the variables are less than the average variance explained 
by the respective construct (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) and our results satisfy this condition (Table 5). 
For evaluation of internal consistency among the items, Cronbach’s alpha is used and all the values are 
above 0.70 (see Table 3). Scale reliability has been also assessed using composite reliability measure 
(Fornell and Larcker, 1981) and the result revealed that composite reliability for all the constructs is 
above conventional cut-off limit of 0.70 (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994) (see Table 3). 
Impact of Mentoring Functions on Career Development: Role of Mentoring Culture  
and Mentoring Structure 
Structural modelling was used to assess the hypothesized relationships. In order to test the moderating 
effect, we divided mentoring functions into two categories, that is, career function (protection, coaching 
and exposure) and psychosocial functions (counselling, role modelling and friendship), and all the

conditions described by Baron and Kenny (1986) were satisfied. These are: (i) the moderator should not 
directly relate with dependent variable; (ii) the moderator hypothesis is supported if the interaction is 
significant; and (iii) another property of the moderator variable is that, unlike the mediator–predictor 
relation (where the predictor is causally antecedent to the mediator), moderators and predictors are at the 
same level in regard to their role as causal variables to criterion variable. We used a three-step procedure 
through structural equation modelling in which we first assessed the impact of predictor variables, 
namely, mentoring functions on career development, which revealed significant effect (career function

standardized regression weights [SRW] = 0.230, p <0.001; psychosocial functions SRW = 0.440,  
p < 0.001). So, hypothesis 1 stands accepted (see Figure 2). 
In the second step, we added the moderating variables, that is, mentoring culture and mentoring 
structure, and the result revealed that mentoring culture and mentoring structure have insignificant 
impact (p > 0.05) on career development, which satisfies the first condition to test the moderation effect 
as suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986) (see Figure 3). 
In the third step, we added the interaction effects, which are significant, that is, career functions* 
mentoring culture (SRW = 0.571, p < 0.001); career functions*mentoring structure (SRW = 0.203,  
p < 0.05); psychosocial functions*mentoring culture (SRW = 0.274, p < 0.001); psychosocial functions* 
mentoring structure (SRW= 0.418, p < 0.001) (see Figure 4). Thus, the results confirm that mentoring 
culture and mentoring structure moderate the relationships between mentoring functions and career 
development, so our second hypothesis is accepted. 
To further explore the nature and form of the significant interactions between mentoring functions 
and mentoring structure and culture, we conducted simple slope analysis using one standard deviation 
above and below the mean of moderating variables. The tests of simple slopes indicated that the 
relationship between mentoring functions and career development increased when mentoring culture 
and mentoring structure were high (see Figure 5).

Discussion 
The study constantly emphasizes the importance of excellence in mentoring, by enhancing the overall 
competence level of the employees. Mentoring culture and mentoring structure strengthen mentoring 
relationships and make employees give their best and perform to the highest standards. It constantly 
emphasizes mentoring excellence by mastering and enhancing overall competence level of the employees. 
Our study explored the following issues. 
First, we explored the impact of mentoring functions on career development. Career development 
involves assessing the current position and taking steps to reach the future position. It demands 
reflection of future, thoughtful assessment and deliberate movement towards selected goals. It requires 
a link between thinking to doing. In this process, mentor becomes a supporter. Mentor always answers 
the mentee’s questions of how he can achieve his goals. In support of this theory, our results strengthen 
the fact that mentoring functions positively influence career development (Baugh and Sullivan, 2005; 
Eastman and Williams, 1993; Sallyanne, 2011; Stamm and Fischer, 2011). Our results revealed that all 
the mentoring functions are positively and significantly related with career development. Mentor 
provides a safe place for the protégé to try out new ideas without fear of being punished, which 
encourages him/her to try new ways of workplace management and customer service, especially in 
call centres. In this process, mentee is able to develop the competences which help in developing his/
her career. Coaching process helps to develop linkages between mentor and mentee by providing 
advice and feedback with the intention of improving decision-making skills of the mentee and 
enhancing competence level that, in turn, helps in the career development. Exposure, a mentoring

function, positively affects career development, which is in line with Ragins and Scandura (1999), 
because during mentoring relationship, the mentee is able to develop internal and external networks 
that help him/her to enhance his knowledge about career opportunities and develop his career 
accordingly. Further, role modelling significantly influences career development as the mentor’s 
attitudes, values and behaviour provide a blueprint and structure for the mentee to emulate for a 
successful career. Again, mentor acts as a counsellor by listening to mentees’ work and life-related 
issues and helps with these problems. The mentor also counsels the mentee about various career 
opportunities and ways to achieve them. Besides these, in call centre, social interactions result in 
mutual liking and understanding, with formal and informal exchange about work and non-work 
experiences, that help in career development of the mentees. 
Second, we analyzed the moderating effect of mentoring culture and structure between mentoring 
functions and career development relationship. And this part supported the main theme of our study. It 
revealed that all the interaction effects are significant, which suggests that through proper mentoring 
functions and appropriate mentoring structure and culture, mentor helps mentee to learn and achieve 
more in his/her career. The mentor suggests specific strategies to mentee for accomplishment of his/her 
career goals. Mentoring culture and mentoring structure require infrastructure to execute mentoring in a 
reasonable, widespread and careful way. Mentor puts in place the resources, both human and capital, 
ensures proper budgets and time, a homely feeling, guarantees protection and provides proper 
communication, training, coaching, support and direction to help mentees to develop their career (Purcell, 
2004). In the organization, a protégés has the opportunity to adopt mannerisms and traits of the mentor 
that are admired and valued, and also personalize these actions as his own. In this process, the protégé, 
with proper mentoring structure and culture, tries to develop himself professionally on the lines of his 
mentor, which results in his/her career development. 
To conclude, we can say that the mentee is able to enhance his skills, capabilities and knowledge more 
effectively when mentoring is coupled with mentoring culture and mentoring structure. 
Theoretical Implications 
This is a pioneer study on call centres regarding the impact of mentoring functions on career development 
and the moderating effects of mentoring culture and mentoring structure. This research has explored the 
impact of individual mentoring functions on career development. The investigation is important for aca-
demicians as well as researchers. It adds to prior mentoring research by evaluating the impact of indivi-
dual mentoring functions on career development. We empirically tested the moderating role of mentoring 
culture and mentoring structure through their interaction with mentoring functions and the results revealed 
their significant effect on career development. Further, this investigation shows that due to the intro -
duction of proper, structured mentoring programme and mentoring culture, organizations can channelize 
properly the mentoring functions, which can result in better career development for the employees. 
Implications for Indian and Global Manager 
The results of this investigation reveal the positive impact of protection, coaching, exposure, role 
modelling, counselling and friendship on employee’s career development. The findings reveal that mean 
of protection is little less as compared to other mentoring functions. So, organizations that practise 
mentoring should take necessary measures to make the employees feel comfortable, that is, create an
<<<PAGE=15>>>
Jyoti and Sharma 15
environment where they feel secure, and specifically in call centres, team leader/mentor should protect 
the employees by informing them in advance about problems encountered in attending the phone calls 
so that unnecessary stress can be avoided. Although these mentoring functions are significantly related 
with career development, the degree of cause-and-effect relationship is low. Proper introduction of 
mentoring culture and mentoring structure will help to strengthen these relationships. So, it is suggested 
that management should provide formal mentoring structure in order to build a strong relationship 
between mentoring functions and career development. Informal mentoring should also be encouraged as 
it helps to build personal relationships, which yield positive outcomes for the organization, mentee and 
mentor. Management should always frame individual action plans or development plans. These plans 
should include goals and objectives and learning activities to accomplish the set goals. 
When mentoring is aligned with proper mentoring culture, it is perceived as an add-on activity to 
accomplish the desired goals. It also promotes growth through enhanced learning and better utilization 
of time, effort and resources, and also enriches vibrancy and productivity. Management should also 
encourage informal mentoring culture where both the mentor and the protégé can share their experiences. 
Adoption of mentoring culture and mentoring structure helps to set standards and follow mentoring 
functions in best possible manner. Managers should make mentoring a culture and structure-bound 
competence so that it smoothens the way business is conducted. 
This study is also important for global mangers/employees as most of the organizations place their 
talented employee in important international assignments. Being a newcomer, it becomes very difficult to 
cope up with the host country culture and environment. In such a situation, if the expatriates are assigned 
mentors to guide them about their work as well as societal culture, it will help the expatriate employees/
mentees to better adjust in the foreign land. Through mentoring, employees as well as managers learn and 
transfer knowledge in a global environment more easily. Global managers can achieve various benefits for 
the organization as well as the expatriate employees by providing mentoring regarding work-related as well 
as psychosocial issues, which will reduce stress and role conflict among the expatriate employees/mentees 
and they will be able to work more efficiently and effectively to achieve the organizational goals. Once the 
expatriate employees/mentees settle in the organization, the mentors can further encourage them to take 
more out of parent country assignments to advance their careers. Thus, mentoring can help the global 
managers in better management of expatriate employees and further extend their careers through proper 
implementation of mentoring structure and mentoring culture. 
Limitations and Scope for Future Research 
All the precautionary efforts were taken to ensure the objectivity, reliability and validity of the study, yet 
certain limitations were discovered. These limitations are as follows. The study was confined to call 
centres only. Moderating role of mentoring culture and structure was investigated between mentoring 
functions and only one of its outcomes. Same can be done for other outer outcomes of mentoring fun -
ctions, namely, job performance, organizational commitment, relationship quality, personal learning and 
self-efficacy. Only employees were contacted for data collection. In future, data can be collected from 
multiple respondents, that is, mentors and mentees.
