ABSTRACT
Knowledge and capacity development (KCD) involves something more than 
the strengthening of individual skills and abilities. Trained individuals need 
an appropriate environment, and the proper mix of opportunities and incen-
tives to use their acquired knowledge. The article therefore discusses KCD 
for the water sector at three different levels, from individual to organiza-
tional to the institutional level and enabling environment. Secondly, the arti-
cle describes the current conceptual approaches to KCD. They come from 
a wide variety of fields of social sciences, as well as from field practice and 
case studies, and are sometimes contradicting. Ideas about capacity origi-
nate from fields including organizational development, political economy, 
public administration, pedagogy, institutional economics and sociology. The 
most important views and fields, including some examples from the field 
that influence our thinking on KCD, are described and discussed. The article 
will discuss the link between knowledge and capacities, clarify that one of 
the basic capacities is to learn, and highlight the importance to create, share 
and manage the knowledge that results from learning, at the three levels. 
Extensive reference will be provided to the respective other chapters in the 
volume where more detail and case studies are provided, as well as examples 
of other approaches.

4 Capacity Development for Improved Water Management
1.1 INTRODUCTION
It is nowadays generally agreed that capacity enhancement involves more than 
the strengthening of individual skills and abilities. Trained individuals need an 
appropriate environment, and the proper mix of opportunities and incentives 
to apply their acquired knowledge. Understanding capacity development 
therefore requires a more comprehensive analytical framework that takes into 
account the individual, the organizational and the institutional levels of analy-
sis (Alaerts, 1999, EuropeAid, 2005, McKinsey, 2007). The water sector is 
a sector of particular complexity, and therefore highly dependent on strong 
institutions and individual capacities. This complexity derives from the fact 
that daily decisions of each and every individual in society impact on water 
management – regarding water use, water pollution, sanitation, etc. – which is 
different from, say the roads sector. Also, water is a bulky and fugitive resource 
that has to be managed continuously in order for it to be available in the right 
quantities at the right time to sustain life – not too little to avoid drought and 
not too much to avoid flood – which means that it requires heavy investment 
and laborious operation and maintenance. The decisions and behaviour of 
mothers and farmers, thus, matter as much as those of the Minister of Water 
Resources or of Public Works. Not surprisingly, this sector was one of the first 
to identify the need for capacity development and introduce focused capacity 
development programs (Alaerts et al., 1991).
The first UN Conference on Water, in 1977 in Mar del Plata, sounded for 
the first time the alarm bell over the vulnerable and finite nature of water in light 
of the rapidly growing demands on the resource. The Mar del Plata Action Plan 
prioritized the provision of drinking water and sanitation – “drinking water 
and sanitation for all by 1990” –  and the need to save water and protect it from 
wastage and pollution. The 1981–1990 Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation 
Decade managed to dramatically increase the coverage for water services but 
proved on many counts less effective. It was outpaced by the growth in popula-
tion and demand for water. This led to the recognition that strong institutions 
and proper social behaviour are as important as the infrastructure itself. Also, 
it was found that development of this sector would require a higher level of 
pro-activity and effective strategies to deal with future challenges. The UN Con-
ference on Environment and Development in Rio in 1992, and the 2002 UN 
Millennium Development Goals re-iterated the same priorities. The 2006 World 
Water Forum in Mexico City again highlighted the role of strong local capacity. 
After three decades of major investment efforts the world has much achieve-
ment to show for, yet serious challenges remain, both old and new.
The exponential growth in demand for water, the strong urbanization, 
and the persistent poverty have kept the coverage rates for drinking water 
supply and sanitation at modest levels in some regions, though other regions 
are well on their way to close the gap. Still, major challenges remain: the water 
use efficiency and service reliability are often unacceptably low; many water 
supplies are precariously vulnerable; and pollution taints water quality much

faster than pollution control measures can be put in place. Weak performance 
of the institutions and of the users remains the bottleneck, especially in sani-
tation and in general water service delivery. Yet, it could be argued that the 
main future concern will be on water resources sustainability , as the large-
scale and steady transformation of the earth’s surface by human interventions 
as well as by climate variability is rapidly adding new stresses on the natural 
eco-hydrological systems that will have to support the continual generation of 
water resources to meet the demand for water–for food production, for drink-
ing, for hydropower and navigation, flood management, etc. Competition for 
access to water will rise.
Part of the knowledge to address these challenges is available. However, 
gaps still do exist in our knowledge, for example regarding how the global 
changes are going to affect us and what the responses should be, and how the 
water service delivery and the resource should be managed more effectively. 
This represents a first key challenge. Equally important, one often observes 
that even when available, this knowledge does not get readily translated into 
proper planning or effective action. Weak institutions, especially at local levels 
of government, and in many communities, form a second key challenge, in 
particular in developing nations. This lagging or constraining effect is espe-
cially visible in countries that are developing into modern economies, but it 
is a challenge for all societies as they continuously must adjust their sector to 
new outside changes or to new internal demands.
1.2 KNOWLEDGE AND CAPACITY
1.2.1  CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE – 
THE CASE OF DEVELOPING ECONOMIES
Many countries – that is, their governments as well as their civil society – are 
observed to have a weak “capacity”: limited knowledge bases; small numbers 
of professionals with the right education and skills; and, in general, adminis-
trative and managerial arrangements, and laws and regulations (the “enabling 
environment”) that eventually fail to facilitate the swift and effective actions 
that in their aggregate can deliver the desired outcomes and results on the 
ground. First, knowledge is required that can identify and describe the issue, 
challenge or problem that one desires to be addressed. A different knowledge 
is required to then articulate how to address this. Thereafter, this knowledge 
needs to be communicated, shared, refined and confirmed among experts, 
peers and decision-makers as prerequisite for action, after which implementa-
tion of the action necessitates a functional and capable organization and an 
enabling policy and administrative environment to do so and mobilize the 
matching financial and other resources. The implementation capacity, thus, 
also depends on the knowledge and skills of the implementing agency, and 
the incentives it responds to. This creates the potential to act. However, this

potential will materialize only in presence of positive incentives (such as, 
financial or political incentives, personal motives to further one’s career, etc.) 
which outweigh negative ones (such as, vested interests of an elite, lack of 
reward, opportunities to extract rents, etc.).
The action, therefore, comes as the aggregate of a series of sequential 
causal steps and decisions. The eventual outcome or impact from that action 
can be observed only much later, at substantial distance from the original 
knowledge. Hence, it is often tenuous to correlate the outcome with that 
knowledge, or with the capacity of the administration and the quality of the 
enabling environment. In addition, these processes take place in a dynamic 
and changing environment, and political contexts are continuously shifting. 
This difficulty to define unequivocal causalities is further compounded by 
the fact that similar outcomes can also be generated by several other sets of 
knowledge, capabilities and circumstances.
1.2.2 DEFINING CAPACITY
The concept of capacity refers to development in general, and several defini-
tions have been proposed that reflect the theoretical (or political) frameworks 
from which the subject is approached (see Box 1.1).
1 Firstly, because of the original concern with effective government, the 
public administration science was one of the first disciplines to define 
“capacity” referring to the organizational structures and operational 
procedures of administrations. In this perspective, the public administra-
tion receives its capacity from the education and training of the civil serv-
ants, from proper administrative procedures, and appropriate incentives 
(e.g. Shafritz, 1985).
2 However, drawing experience and insight from the only modestly success-
ful efforts in developing countries with the International Drinking Water 
Supply and Sanitation Decade spanning the 1980s, the water sector was 
early to devise a practical definition expressing its strong interest in mak-
ing overall development programs more effective and sustainable, and 
to articulate in a coherent fashion the need for knowledge and capacity 
development (KCD) (Alaerts et al., 1991, 1999). This experience also high-
lighted the critical function of the “enabling environment” of the broader 
policy, legal and regulatory frameworks in which the public administra-
tion, and the investment projects funded by the international donor com-
munity, have to operate. For example, many regulations and procedures in 
other sectors one way or another were found to restrict the effectiveness of 
policies in the water sector: regulations on urban settlements, for example, 
make it often impossible to extend water services to “irregular” city quar-
ters; human resource procedures in the civil service often preclude that 
incentives can be provided; and centralized administrations often have no

place for a role by local water users. It became recognized that the water 
users, the consumer, the electorate and other distinct stakeholders in civil 
society have to play equally important roles in making things work at the 
local operational level of the household, the irrigation plot or the water 
catchment, and in providing the political foundation for decisions. This 
holds especially true in developing countries where the national govern-
ment has often a very limited reach and capacity, and, thus, much depends 
on whether local users and communities are willing to take initiative, co-
operate and contribute. This approach, in addition, also for the first time 
linked capacity with knowledge – as generated and disseminated by edu-
cational institutions and knowledge centres locally and at a global level. 
The water sector is increasingly considered a knowledge-intensive sector.
3 Thirdly, UNDP, and later OECD, the World Bank and EuropeAid took 
this definition to a higher level, relating capacity to the overarching goal 
of national development across the board. That definition, however, tends 
to dissociate the capacity and the knowledge components.
Box 1.1 What is capacity?
Shafritz (1985) approached capacity from the perspective of public 
administration sciences: “… any system, effort, or process … which includes 
among its major objectives strengthening of elected chief executive officers, 
chief administrative officers, department and agency heads, and program 
managers in general purpose government to plan, implement, manage or 
evaluate policies, strategies, or programs designed to impact on social condi-
tions in the community”. The 1991 Delft Declaration  (Alaerts et al., 1991) 
suggested “Capacity comprises well-developed institutions, their managerial 
systems, and their human resources, which in turn require favorable policy 
environments, so as to make the [water] sector effective and sustainable”. 
UNDP states that “Capacity is the ability of individuals, groups, institutions 
and organizations to identify and solve problems over time” (Morgan, 1993, 
UNDP, 1993). Hildebrand and Grindle (1994) emphasize the dynamic nature 
of capacity: “Capacity is the ability to perform appropriate tasks effectively, 
efficiently, and sustainably. This implies that capacity is not a passive state – the 
extent of human resources development, for example – but part of an active 
process.” More recently, the complexity or systems nature of capacity has been 
emphasized: “Capacity is … the emergent combination of attributes that ena-
bles a human system to create developmental value” and “… the overall ability 
of a system to perform and to sustain itself: the coherent combination of com-
petencies and capabilities”(Zinke, 2006). And: “Emergent properties, such as 
capacity, come from the dynamism of the interrelationships in the system. The 
challenge is not so much to build or enhance them as it is to unleash them or 
find ways to encourage their emergence” (Morgan, 2005).

8 Capacity Development for Improved Water Management
4 Further recent work emphasizes the complex and systems nature of 
capacity in development efforts, as described below. This approach argues 
that the capacity of an organization is both a distinct entity by itself and 
the resultant of the capacities of the individuals in that organization. It 
is also the resultant of a wide variety of inputs (types of knowledge that 
have been transferred, structure and procedures, leadership and manage-
rial capabilities of the individuals, etc.). All these attributes tend to change 
over time and mutually influence each other. This complexity tends to blur 
the relationship between the capacity development input, and its outcome. 
This school of thought rejects any normative or deterministic approach 
and posits the pivotal role of process in which all stakeholders are in-
volved in determining the objectives that are consistent with the capacity 
(e.g. Pahl-Wostl, 2002).
5 Finally, the behavioural and business management sciences have extensively 
researched behaviour of humans and of organizations. Sveiby (1997) for 
instance draws from this body of knowledge and also builds on Polanyi’s 
dynamic concept of knowledge (see section 1.3.2). This approach helps 
to make the concepts more practical for the purposes of managing knowl-
edge organizations, and for budgeting and results assessment, in contrast 
with the complexity approach which tends to dispute the notion that 
capacity can be managed.
Based on the above and for our purposes here, capacity can be defined 
as the capability of a society or a community to identify  and understand  its 
development issues, to act to address these, and to learn from experience 
and accumulate knowledge for the future. A country, then, has its “gov-
ernment” and public administration system as its formal tools to make 
this possible. Other less formal systems do exist as well. This definition 
emphasizes the linkage of capacity with a verifiable impact on-the-ground 
after the “act” as well as with the generation of fresh knowledge. It also 
points out that critical “extra” capacity is required to allocate the resources 
and incentive for continual learning and improvement that characterize 
the “learning organization’. Few governments or sector agencies, or non-
governmental organizations for that matter, have provisions to allow for 
this learning.
This definition pertains equally to individuals – from technicians and 
community members up to ministers and politicians – and to the institutions 
in which they work and operate together and carry out their work. Over-
all performance thus depends on the simultaneous effect of capacity of the 
individuals as well as of the institutions. Developing countries currently tend 
to possess weak institutional and human capacity, with administrative sys-
tems that tend to be static and bureaucratic, and pre-occupied with technical 
aspects and standardized solutions. Especially local governments and local 
communities are at risk and may have little capacity to anticipate, and adapt

Progress and challenges in knowledge and capacity development 9
to the changing demands and environment effectively. Notwithstanding, many 
of these local communities have generated over generations a body of tradi-
tional knowledge regarding the local conditions and how to cope with them. 
Tribal communities in the Andaman Islands in the Gulf of Bengal appeared 
better prepared to deal with erratic devastating events like the December 2003 
tsunami than the urbanized and wealthier communities in west Indonesia and 
east India.
This weak capacity and knowledge impede the proper targeting and 
absorption of development funds and the sustainable operation and manage-
ment of “feasible” investments. Feasible proposals are those that have been 
designed properly based on sound analysis and with respect to realistic out-
comes, and that are embedded in a policy and administrative structure that 
is able to ensure sustained use and maintenance. Different from the situation 
up to the 1990s, the current experience in most developing countries suggests 
that it is the shortage of such “feasible” investment proposals that is impeding 
development, not any longer the shortage of funds per se.
1.3  SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON KNOWLEDGE 
AND CAPACITY
1.3.1 UNDERSTANDING KCD
KCD, and in a more general sense, the generation and dissemination of 
knowledge, take place through formal education, training, and institutional 
development. The KCD activity always implies a status change, and indeed, 
the capacity development in organizations and in the administrative and reg-
ulatory frameworks are irrevocably linked to change processes and reform 
(Alaerts et al., 1999, EuropeAid, 2005). The generation and dissemination 
of the knowledge can be carried out via different vehicles or modes, such as 
secondary education, tertiary education, learning-by-doing, learning from 
peers (mimicking), learning through formal and through social networks, 
purchase of patents, and the physical acquisition or import of individual spe-
cialists (and, in reverse, brain drain). However, these vehicles only concern 
the action of knowledge transfer itself, whereas in a policy or development 
context one should be equally concerned about the “indirect instruments” 
that help retain and improve knowledge and capacity. For example, financial 
and other career-related incentives in the Human Resources policy strongly 
influence the retainment and commitment of specialists and qualified staff, 
and make or break the organization’s capacity. The appropriate definition 
of the objectives of a KCD initiative and the choice of the KCD process 
and instruments depend highly on the context, as the institutions they focus 
on are the exponents of a particular set of economic, social and cultural 
factors.

10 Capacity Development for Improved Water Management
As argued in section 1.2, KCD has a broad remit, and several disciplines are 
studying parts of the subject, each highlighting an essential aspect and offer-
ing complementary and sometimes conflicting analysis and advice (Alaerts, 
2009). One can distinguish a number of “schools of thought”. For our case, 
with the aim of developing a well-performing water sector and extending 
advice to, amongst others, government, the insights of public administra-
tion sciences are of central importance. The formal water “sector” is largely 
embedded in, and is a part of the public administration (Figure 1.1). Still, as 
each individual in society must take decisions on water in his vicinity – from 
the mother in the household to the farmer – and elect his government, the 
achievement of any water sector policy depends highly on the individuals and 
communities in society, their representatives, the press, etc. Thus, many of the 
KCD processes equally pertain to the formal and informal organizations and 
processes in society. The way the organizations are functioning and are to be 
managed, is the subject of management and business administration sciences, 
and what has come to be known as knowledge management in the corporate 
sector. Several concepts are derived from political and institutional economics 
and sociology. Other contributing disciplines are educational sciences, peda-
gogy and didaxology. On a more fundamental level, the epistemology (the 
philosophy of knowledge and knowing) and the complex-systems analysis 
provide better understanding of the nature of KCD. These disciplines should 
be acknowledged by KCD practitioners as important sources of knowledge. 
Often, policy papers and working documents on KCD are not based on solid 
and disciplinary research but rather on prima facie observation and intuitive 
analysis.

1.3.2  LINEAR APPROACH VS. COMPLEX SYSTEMS 
APPROACH TO KCD
A first important development in the understanding of KCD is the distinction 
that is made between a linear approach and a dynamic systems or complexity 
approach. In approaching complex dynamics in our daily life, and certainly 
for those complex societal processes, we generally tend to apply a reduc-
tionist approach. Complex problems become more easily understandable 
when they are cut up in isolated events that stand in “linear” cause-effect 
relationships to each other. However, the process of capacity development 
is very complex, and full of interconnections. The study of the nature of the 
parts does not necessarily lead to a correct understanding of the whole as 
the whole is more than the summation of the parts, since the parts interact. 
Furthermore, the relationships within the parts and among the parts may 
be causal under certain conditions but not under others. Some of the parts 
may have a strong influence on the internal relations within other parts. In 
addition, these interactions do not take place in a static environment and 
usually play out over time in sequences. With all interconnections between 
the components of the system, trying to obtain an overview of the system as 
a whole might be impossible because of the complexity but also because of 
increasing uncertainties associated with the interconnections. Complex sys-
tems are far more difficult to engineer successfully since potential outcomes 
can be difficult to identify, let alone measure (Parker and Stacey, 1995). 
Figure 1.2 illustrates the complexity of cause and effect for three individuals 
or organizations X, Y and Z. X as central actor discovers the actions and 
preferences of Y and Z, chooses how to respond appropriately and then 
acts. That action would have in turn consequences which Y and Z discover. 
This would lead each of them to choose a position or response which may 
differ from their original one, which, of course, has again consequences that 
X then needs to discover and respond to, and so on. This mutual interaction 
creates non-linear systems. X could be for example Water Users Organiza-
tions, and Y and Z a Ministry of Water Resources and local governments, 
that all are competing for authority and budgetary power. In the context of 
achieving a reform process of decentralization of management authority over 
water, it is in principle quite possible for the Organizations to predict what 
kind of knowledge and capacity development they will require. However, 
the Ministry and the local governments may have different perspectives and 
be subject to national policies, regulations and informal vested interests that 
may or may not preclude, obstruct or re-direct the reform. It is not difficult 
to imagine that in such non-linear system, it will be difficult to predict, and 
measure, what the outcome will be of capacity development interventions. In 
complex systems feedback can be used to monitor how incremental change 
takes place or what influence a certain measure is having. It can be described 
as an influence or message that conveys information about the outcome of 
a process or activity back to its source. Whereas prediction of outcomes in

12 Capacity Development for Improved Water Management
a complex and fuzzy system such as capacity development, thus, is difficult, 
“managed learning” as a way to improve systems capacity in an iterative 
way may be a more modest and realistic option. However, this “process 
approach” assumes continuous flexibility which conflicts with the desire for 
outcomes that are agreed upon up-front. For example, governments, and 
donors will be unwilling to allocate substantial funds in annual budgets for 
ventures where the outcomes cannot be defined well, and, by implication, 
where the efficiency and feasibility of the investment cannot be confirmed ex 
ante. This outcome-focus requires a certain amount of planning in the devel-
opment processes. It is suggested that for government and accountability 
purposes a predefined goal and direction are needed, as well as a strategy to 
achieve this goal. This strategy should, however, be a flexible plan that can 
cope to a certain extent with unexpected influences and developments.

1.3.3 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
Water sector management is part of a nation’s public administration. Proper 
understanding of this field is therefore a requirement to understand capac-
ity development in the water sector. The field covers among others govern-
ance, public choice theory, management and human resources management. 
Farazmand (2004) describes what human resources management should con-
sider in public sector organizations:
 Motivating people at work is of prime importance. Employees must see real 
purpose in public service, and have a sense of belonging to the organization.
 Compensation must be equitable to treat every citizen equally, offer equal 
opportunity and avoid any semblance of preferential treatment. The organ-
ization must be seen as impartial and objective. This objective is essential 
but in practice often hard to maintain. It also tends to become very inflex-
ible and bureaucratic because the decision is determined by “the rule” 
rather than by considerations of overall effectiveness. The compensation 
should, however, also be efficient in order to prevent organizational brain 
drain and to attract the most competent talents to the public service.
 Organizational mobility and rotation are designed for strategic personnel 
to move periodically to new positions, to learn and apply their knowledge 
and experience. At the same time continuity in the organization should be 
guaranteed and skills mixes maintained.
 Personnel should have the chance to periodically refresh their knowledge 
and skills they need to manage, and function in, the organizations in this 
information age. This can be done by in-service training programs, semi-
nars, conferences, and workshops.
The above objectives are laudable and appropriate, but implementation 
remains a major challenge in developing countries facing on one hand a dearth 
of qualified staff and budget constraints limiting the number of civil servants, 
and on the other hand a weak support in society for an impartial and meri-
tocratic civil service that can be held accountable. Good governance implies 
transparency and accountability. Transparency of, say, budgets, plans and 
staffing arrangements, eliminates opportunities for corruption and closes the 
door to secrecy and abuse. Pro-active accountability mechanisms help serve as 
a strategic instrument in pursuit of excellence and trust, and hence legitimacy. 
The comparatively low compensation for employees in public sector organiza-
tions, and opaque structures and regulations in many developing nations are 
often an incentive to engage in corruptive practices.
1.3.4 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
A large proportion of the literature on “knowledge management” and 
“learning organizations” is geared at corporate businesses and firms. For the

14 Capacity Development for Improved Water Management
public sector the rationale for knowledge management is just as important, 
however, instead of the maximization of profit under conditions of competi-
tion there is a need for maximizing public service delivery at minimal cost, 
under pressure from society that demands a healthy public sector at low fis-
cal requirement.
For the water sector this would mean investing in the capacities that are 
needed for a well-performing sector, and working towards better governance, 
transparency and accountability. Knowledge management tools can be utilized 
drawn from human resources management and personnel management, and 
putting in place the objective and the administrative procedures that create a 
climate where people are encouraged to learn about their field and share their 
knowledge. A learning organization will have incentive systems that encour-
age knowledge, and internal procedures that facilitate, and require, open dis-
cussion, “peer reviews” and the valuation of knowledge. Information and 
Communication Systems (ICS – comprising both the technologies proper, and 
the interfaces and educated users who are able to utilize and work with these 
systems) are essential for example to develop databases and make information 
broadly available, and to facilitate communication and exchange of informa-
tion. In reality, many water sector agencies notably in the developing world 
do not actively promote critical reviews and discussion, and staff careers are 
often based on performance in contract management for works and political 
relationships.
Drawing on epistemological analysis, knowledge can be both explicit 
(that what can be articulated in written form, for example, and formally 
taught) and tacit (such as the capability to ride a bike). Recognizing the value 
of the tacit knowledge, and figuring out how to use it, are the key challenges 
in a knowledge-creating company; they require extended communication, 
intensive and critical personal interactions among peers, and an knowledge 
enabling environment (Krogh et al., 2000). The enabling environment for 
bringing out tacit knowledge is a shared space that fosters emerging relation-
ships. Tacit knowledge is to be considered more crucial and needs to be recre-
ated from scratch by any new apprentice who is mimicking what the mentor 
demonstrates (Sveiby, 1997). As Tsoukas (2002) mentions, tacit knowledge 
can only be manifested and valued in what we do, and “that new knowl-
edge comes about when our skilled performance is punctuated in new ways 
through social interaction”.
What makes knowledge creation a fragile process is the fact that it 
requires individuals to share their personal beliefs with others about a par-
ticular situation. There is need for justification, explanation, persuasion and 
human connectedness. In organizations with a poor transparency or a culture 
of fear, knowledge creation will be difficult. Likewise, treating staff as con-
scripts or just implementers, and applying unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, 
significantly impede effective knowledge sharing (Schenk et al., 2006). For 
the water sector in different countries, a useful indicator for the knowledge

facilitation is the presence of informal and formal networks among sector 
specialists and peers. In many countries, in particular developing ones, the 
absence or limited size and relevance of these networks is a barrier to knowl-
edge generation and sharing. These networks are of great importance in the 
exchange of knowledge between government and other actors in the sector. 
Through formal and informal networks educational institutes are connected 
to the government and society to provide part of the “answers” through 
appropriate curricula and research. They also can have the overview of the 
human resources needs both in terms of quantity and skills mixes. Similarly, 
the informal and formal debates between the water sector and the civil soci-
ety and its representatives and the press are critical to identify pressing issues 
in the sector and foster consensus on the action to be taken. In strongly 
hierarchic societies that tend to wield large bureaucracies and where the gov-
ernment basically takes all key decisions, knowledge creation and sharing is 
much less intensive.
1.3.5 EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Education and training is an obviously important aspect of knowledge and 
capacity development, especially at the level of individuals (see also Chapter 18 
in this volume). Capacity development relies on the strengthening of individual 
capacity through training and learning, in order to raise the domestic stock of 
human capital, or the “social capital”. Although some of the necessary skills 
would typically be acquired on-the-job or through learning-by-doing, devel-
oping countries characterized by less efficient organizations of work or by 
obsolete technologies might need to rely more on formal vocational education 
and training (Vincent-Lancrin, 2007).
There are four different types or levels of knowledge for which different 
methods of learning are appropriate:
 Factual knowledge (“water is boiling at 100°C”).
 Understanding (“where does rain come from?”).
 Skills (proficiency in a language, ability to work in a team).
 Attitudes (problem solving attitude, capability to approach a complex 
challenge, ambition, “gut feeling”, and the drive to keep learning).
Skills generally can be acquired by training, whereas for the other three 
types of knowledge, education is more appropriate, partly through formal 
schooling. Training can be accomplished through apprenticeships and men-
toring, seminars, workshops, classes, or through self-study. With training, a 
task analysis will yield a complete “step-by-step” list of what needs to be done 
to accomplish the skill being learned (Fabri, 2008). Training has therefore pre-
defined content and is a closed system. Usually training needs a fixed amount 
of time – weeks or months.

1.3.6 INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING
The weak institutional capacity at the levels of the organizations and the ena-
bling environment, are an equally important impediment to assimilate mod-
ern approaches in science, technology and management, essential to deal with 
the complex challenges in the water sector. The term institution is described 
by North (1990) as “the rules of the game in a society, the humanly devised 
constraints that shape human interaction”. Institutions can take the forms of 
policies and objectives, laws, regulations, administrative rules, organizations, 
Box 1.2 Effective training and education.
The World Bank evaluation on WBI training for capacity building (World Bank 
2008) suggests a number of simple but essential success factors for training, 
namely:
 appropriate pedagogical tools and frameworks, classroom teaching, self-
study, group work, etc.;
 support for the transfer of learning to the workplace, to consolidate what 
was learned by embedding it through on-the-job support; and
 targeting of training to organizational needs, anchored in a diagnosis of 
institutional and/or organizational capacity gaps, and formal assessment of 
participant training.
The early preparation to facilitate the application of what was learned in 
the workplace through action learning and practical exercises is of utmost 
importance.
Success factors for education include, to get the right people to become 
teachers and develop them into effective instructors (Fullan, 2007), (McKinsey, 
2007). With regards to capacity needs for teachers, Fullan (2007) further states 
that a high level of success in the classroom requires personalization, precision 
and professional learning by teachers:
 Personalization is the capacity of a teacher to acknowledge what each indi-
vidual student needs.
 Precision refers to the capacity to address these learning needs.
 Finally, learning by doing and mentoring by experienced colleagues are very 
effective educational and training methods.
Instructors require continuous learning and development, not only during 
their education, but especially during their working life. In general for training 
to be effective, it should be taken to the work floor, be integrated in operational 
practices and there should be room for learning-by-doing and for coaching by 
experienced colleagues.

and norms and traditions. They determine how we think and what we do 
(North, 1990, 2005).
It is now conventional wisdom to say that strong institutions are the 
critical variable in development, not only in the sense of their quality, but 
also in their very capacity – for example as defined as their quantity of civil 
servants – to absorb initiatives and funds and prepare for future action. In 
the recent past several seminal studies have provided empirical documenta-
tion on the critical role of institutions (Fukuyama, 2004). Incremental change 
comes from the perceptions of the entrepreneurs in political and corporate 
organizations that they could do better by altering the existing institutional 
framework at some margin. But the perceptions crucially depend on both 
the information that the entrepreneurs receive and the way they process that 
information (North, 1990). One aspect of capacity development is to make 
sure the information received is as comprehensive as possible and to equip 
the entrepreneur with the right skills and mental constructs to process the 
information for the benefit of the organization and society. This will deter-
mine the transaction costs. Transactions costs are the costs of measuring the 
value of attributes of what is being exchanged and the costs of protecting 
rights and of policing and enforcing agreements. When the costs associated 
with an exchange are higher than the perceived benefits, there will likely be 
no transaction, meaning, things stay the way they are. Incomplete informa-
tion, limited mental or institutional capacity by which to process the infor-
mation and the risk of failure associated with this, determine the cost of 
transacting.
1.3.7  A SCHEMATIC OF KNOWLEDGE AND CAPACITY 
DEVELOPMENT
Figure 1.3 brings together the different elements of KCD. The diagram speci-
fies in broad terms, for each of the three levels of action – the individual, the 
organization and the enabling environment – the sequence of what knowledge 
and capacity imply, by what means the knowledge and capacity development 
can take place, what the outcomes are and how these could be potentially 
assessed. These levels are “nested’, that is, the individual operates embed-
ded within his organizational context, and the organization operates within 
its broader context. The enabling environment itself is divided in that part 
that typically falls in the realm of the formal institutional frameworks, and 
in a second part referring to the broader context provided by society. (Civil) 
society itself is both part of this enabling framework and at the same time 
an actor in its own right, as within society numerous formal and informal 
non-governmental networks, associations and organizations take part in the 
broader game of water management.
The sector’s performance derives from the effective action of individu-
als with the proper knowledge and capacity, who function in larger (sector)

18 Capacity Development for Improved Water Management
organizations (such as ministries, local governments, water user associations, 
civil society organizations, etc.). The effectiveness of these organizations 
depends both on the effectiveness of those individuals and on the typical fea-
tures that shape the capacity of the organization itself through its skills mix, 
its internal operational and administrative procedures, etc. In turn, organiza-
tions with the right capacity and procedures still need an enabling environ-
ment to put in place the facilitating factors including an enabling legal and 
regulatory framework, financing and fiscal rules that stimulate proper action, 
and a broadly supportive political inclination in parliaments and among the 
voters and consumers. As mentioned above, KCD is essential to support and 
implement improvement of institutions or change in institutional arrange-
ments. Often it is difficult to distinguish KCD proper from institutional 
development, and, indeed, KCD is embedded in and in effect helps shape, 
any institutional development and reform effort. KCD is part and parcel of 
change management.
Knowledge, understanding and skills are generally developed through 
typical knowledge transfer instruments such as education and training, how-
ever, whether the desired knowledge (or capacity) is explicit or tacit does 
make a difference in the choice of instrument. As Polanyi and Sveiby argued 
from their respective epistemological and practical management insights, tacit 
knowledge is eventually far more important as it shapes the skills and deeper 
attitudes. Tacit knowledge can best be transferred through one-on-one interac-
tion between junior and senior, apprentice and teacher. Organizational capac-
ity development is achieved by educating/ training the (staff) members and

by helping the organization as such learn from the experiences from others. 
Technical assistance, management advice, learning experiences, comparison 
with peers and benchmarking, are important instruments. Both for individu-
als and for organizations, networks are playing an increasingly important role 
for generating, sharing, corroborating and improving knowledge and capac-
ity. Networks – both formal and informal associations and “communities of 
practice” – are becoming the main mechanisms for professional improvement 
for many water professionals. ICS are powerful tools to support and intensify 
communication and open up new avenues for the dissemination of knowledge 
including best-practices.
At the level of the enabling environment, governments and other actors 
also “learn” and acquire capability to, in turn, become more enabling. Policy 
makers, governmental departments, and politicians, also increase their under-
standing about new challenges and solutions by, for example, drawing lessons 
from international “good practice”. Technical advice, communication plat-
forms and peer-learning are useful instruments for exchanges of information. 
In civil society, capacity already exists in the form of what is often called social 
capital or indigenous knowledge that resides in communities, and in water 
literacy. This can be further developed through comparison activities and 
peer-learning with other communities. The press and mass communication – 
such as Discovery Channel – are powerful vehicles to disseminate knowledge 
and develop attitudes, and reach many communities that otherwise receive 
little opportunity to communicate with the government. Non-governmental 
organizations and networks are important and often effective actors in this 
capacity development. Finally, the role of society is of course critically impor-
tant as it shapes the nation’s consensus about the priorities for the future (and 
the budget allocations) through electing its political representatives and hold-
ing its government accountable.
Eventually, “capable” individuals and organizations possess aggregate 
competences to act. Four types of aggregate competences can be distin-
guished. Firstly, technical competence is required to analyze and solve the 
problems that have a technical nature. For instance, all sector agencies need 
to regularly acquire new technical knowledge on an array of subjects from 
piling and construction techniques to climate change mitigation and adapta-
tion. Second, organizations need to have an adequate pool of management 
competences embodied in their senior staff. In many developing countries sec-
tor agencies may score well on technical and civil engineering aspects, but 
often the competence to manage personnel and organizations, as well as the 
water resource itself, is modest. Third, an effective and performing water sec-
tor requires organizations that possess skills to foster and apply principles of 
good governance, such as dialogue and communication with stakeholders, 
resource allocation within policy frameworks that aim for equity and poverty 
alleviation, transparency and accountability. Finally, as mentioned before, 
capable individuals and organizations are those that manage, by deliberate

decision, to keep learning and innovate. Learning and innovation do not 
come automatically but require financial resources and personal and mana-
gerial procedures to foster knowledge generation and sharing. This learning 
can emerge from an acquired attitude or natural inquisitiveness, but institu-
tions may become interested in and coaxed into learning only after being held 
accountable for poor performance. Table 1.1 provides an overview of features 
and attributes related to these four competences.

1.4 TOOLS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR KCD
1.4.1 A STRONGER CASE
If sustainable development is our prime objective, then KCD should have the pri-
ority attention in developing and industrialized countries alike. Governments – 
for having legal authority and responsibility over the sector – can devise appro-
priate policies and take the main initiatives. Notwithstanding, an equally impor-
tant role is to be played by civil society organizations and NGOs, and through 
the awareness and political vote of the electorate. The discussion below does 
not claim to be comprehensive, and focuses on the government role.
Investing in knowledge and capacity development pays off. Recent evalu-
ations have demonstrated that development programs in the water sector are 
now more effective and sustainable than, say, before the mid-nineties. Many 
local communities have become less vulnerable to external upheaval or nat-
ural disaster. This higher effectiveness can be attributed for a large part to 
stronger institutions, better governance and more technical and managerial 
competence in the developing countries whose capacity has been strengthened. 
Several studies on irrigation, for example, have shown that nowadays the best 
return on the investment in canal improvement is achieved when a substan-
tial effort is also placed in capacity enhancement, including empowerment, of 
irrigators and local-government officials. Of course, at a higher level of aggre-
gation, the impact of education of the young generation and of communities 
on sector development and sustainability is without doubt. These impacts are 
being recognized. Although accurate figures are lacking, the amount of funds 
allocated to capacity development by donors seems to have increased about

tenfold in the period 1995–2004 over the preceding decade. For instance, the 
World Bank provided for Sub-Saharan Africa between 1995 and 2004 about 
US$9 billion in lending and US$900 million in grants for the broader goal of 
capacity enhancement and education (World Bank, 2005). Across the globe, 
the Bank financed about $720 million annually over the past years for train-
ing activities for all sectors (World Bank, 2008).
1.4.2 STRATEGIES AND NEXT STEPS
But governments and other decision-makers have still a long way to go to align 
their administrative systems and sector policies to international best-practices, 
and put in place a knowledge-management system stimulating structured 
learning. The coordination between institutions must be deepened, and more 
structural capacity developed. Communication with the stakeholder groups 
from local communities to politicians is to become a priority, partly for aware-
ness raising and education, but also to listen in and forge cooperation.
 i The fact that KCD is a formidable agenda by itself does not mean that 
meaningful KCD should always be carried out with such comprehensive 
ambition. KCD usually is more manageable and better targeted when car-
ried out on a smaller working area or on a confined issue. Still, governments 
should at the same time start analyze their sector’s knowledge and capacity 
weaknesses and outline a longer-time strategy comprising a series of steps.
ii As a first initiative to inform the policy and the next steps, the institutional 
and human capacities of the country’s sector, or part thereof, should be 
assessed to define their strengths and weaknesses, and how robust the ca-
pacities are to deliver more effective services and prepare for future uncer-
tainties. The assessment can cover a larger or smaller part of the sector (e.g. 
the management of river basins, basic sanitation, vulnerable communities, 
youth, etc.), or focus on a part of the overall institutional architecture 
and capacity (e.g. the education system, community management, or the 
legal framework). The SWOT analysis technique (Strengths-Weaknesses-
Opportunities-Threats), results frameworks, risk analysis, stakeholder 
analysis, and similar techniques can be very useful to conduct the assess-
ment (see Box 1.1–1.3). Such analysis always needs to be conducted to-
gether with all key stakeholders, including also non-governmental entities, 
and educational and training outfits besides academia. UNDP (2007) has 
reviewed and compiled the experience with capacity assessments and of-
fers a rational framework for capacity assessment. It suggests that core 
issues to be assessed cover institutional development, leadership, knowl-
edge, and mutual accountability. Critical functional capacities  include, 
e.g., capacity to engage in multi-stakeholder dialogue, situational analysis, 
vision creation, policy and strategy formulation, budgeting, and monitor-
ing and evaluation. It should be borne in mind that proper analysis requires

substantial time and funds, as the assessment is specialistic and interactive 
and presumes adequate meeting and communication opportunities. Other 
best-practices are offered in a World Bank review of experiences in Africa

24 Capacity Development for Improved Water Management
Lopes and Theisohn (2003) offer a useful check-list to help assess a sector’s 
capacity by analyzing the three levels of individual (or human resources) 
capacity, organizations (or institutional) capacity and the capacity of the ena-
bling environment (Box 1.1–1.3).
From this assessment, a strategy and action plan can be derived. The strat-
egy should be shaped contextually through dialogue and stakeholder involve-
ment. Because the environmental, social-economic and cultural contexts differ 
between countries and sub-sectors, there is no “one size fits all” strategy. Such 
process cannot be imposed from the outside, and requires a home-grown 
demand and political commitment. However, often the capacity assessment 
and its development help to make the case and demonstrate the benefits, and 
at the same time help develop capacity. The process often turns out to be slow, 
incremental and patchy. Addressing weak institutional environments is not a 
straightforward or “linear” process but often works best through “strategic

incrementalism”, i.e., pragmatic incremental reform steps that may not fully 
address all the current institutional performance problems but can alleviate 
some acute problems while at the same time creating the conditions for deeper 
and more favourable change in the longer run (World Bank, 2008). In other 
words, one should continually adapt the approach as specific new opportuni-
ties arise along the way.
iii The water sector is knowledge intensive. This calls for much investment 
in the creation of new knowledge, through research and innovation. On 
the other hand, a lot of knowledge to guide local action resides within 
the traditional knowledge of local communities, and is often untapped or 
dismissed. Knowledge on water tends to be available in fragmented form 
among a growing number of actors who each hold part of the solution. 
Communication, therefore, is becoming increasingly important in build-
ing the knowledge base and the institutional and human capacities; to 
disseminate and acquire knowledge from across the sector; and to forge 
political consensus in society. Precisely because of this complexity and the 
distributed nature of sector knowledge, a judicious balance needs to be 
sought between centralized sector management and collaborative arrange-
ments among decentralized entities.
ICS is a powerful tool to support and intensify communication and open 
up new avenues for the dissemination of knowledge including best-practices. 
ICS is also becoming the key instrument to forecast with greater precision the 
future consequences of current decisions and policies in development scenar-
ios, and to reduce the uncertainty related to climatic variability. The access to 
relevant data facilitates decision-making and in general increases transparency 
and governance. Thorkilsen (2001) and Abbott (2007) describe how ICS has 
been at the core of the broad knowledge-sharing effort that was necessary to 
create the political and societal support for one of Europe’s largest and con-
troversial infrastructure projects, namely the rail and road bridge and tunnel 
across the Øresund strait connecting Denmark and Sweden.
Decision-makers have nowadays an array of tools and “knowledge pools” 
such as data bases, research and educational centres, consultants, etc., at their dis-
posal to develop or enhance capacity and facilitate knowledge generation in those 
areas and with those actors whose low capacity is considered a key constraint.
iv The strategy generally is implemented through a combination of educa-
tion; training; technical advice for institutional strengthening and change; 
institution of appropriate incentives and procedures that encourage 
staff to seek innovation and learn; facilitation of research and innova-
tion, and of communication and interaction. Given that much of the sec-
tor’s education is actually carried out by the educational establishment – 
through polytechnics, and a variety of university-level studies – sectoral

decision-makers would do well by engaging in a dialogue with these estab-
lishments to ensure that sectoral and educational perspectives are aligned. 
The generation of professionals is in many developing countries a prime 
concern. In many countries nominally adequate numbers of graduates are 
churned out by universities and polytechnics, but their specializations and 
skills may not be attuned to the modern challenges and the expectations 
from the societies they are supposed to serve. “Education” should also be 
understood to go well beyond tertiary education, and society at large and 
youth in particular need to be educated about water and how it impacts 
their future. Finally, “education and training” encompasses a wide gamut 
of instruments spanning from conventional class-room teaching to Objec-
tive-Based Learning, hands-on learning and mentoring. Recent compara-
tive studies have shed new light on which approaches are likely to be most 
effective. In this fields too, ICS has opened up powerful new tools for 
real-time access to data and teachers across the globe, and communication 
among peers.
 v Governments can encourage the development of systems to generate and 
share knowledge among “centres of knowledge”, as well as between those 
who are in need of knowledge and those who possess it. As highlighted 
above, with the advent of ICS and globalization, governments can create 
and actively fund “communities of practice”, networks of professionals 
and institutions, and databases, on the relevant subjects. In such networks, 
local governments and communities are not to be left out – they are al-
ways the first at risk, but they also often hold a lot of traditional wisdom. 
Some such networks preferably should also be international, both south-
south and south-north.
vi A special challenge concerns the facilitation of institutional strengthening 
and KCD in civil society. Although many governments may not find this 
obvious or against their mandate, civil society needs to receive special 
attention based on the following considerations.
  With the large numbers of stakeholders in water management, govern-
ments will increasingly depend on informed and “capacitated” actors 
in civil society to play a growing role in water management, over and 
beyond the role they are already playing.
 As the technical agencies at national as well as at local government 
levels depend on budgets voted by Parliament or Councils, it is essen-
tial that their staff is better able to make the case with politicians to 
secure the budgets. Eventually, this also means that civil society too 
needs to feel more strongly about the priority for water, and lend its 
support to water sector initiatives.
 Climate and other changes need to be better forecasted, and remedial 
actions identified, agreed upon and taken. Much of this implies non-
technical measures as well as some technical measures at local level to 
strengthen preparedness and resilience of local settlements and their

arrangements for agriculture and for natural resource management. 
This is of special relevance in light of climate variability and other 
environmental changes.
 Civil society has the right to hold government accountable for delivery 
on its policies. To enhance governance, civil society therefore should 
have suitable capacities, have access to relevant information and be 
able to engage with (local) government on service delivery.
 Civil society as “user”, on the other hand, needs to be able to involve 
itself in some decision making at local, river basin and national level, 
to help decide on priorities in spending and water management, and 
in such a way that at the same time it is aware of the costs involved in 
the options, and agrees to provide for the finance.
vii Finally, it should be recognized that “learning” is a continual effort. Govern-
ments can put in place the procedures, institutions and incentives to ensure 
that lessons are learned, documented and disseminated. Each time an issue 
has been addressed, or a particular action carried out more effectively, this 
information should be fed back to stimulate further improvement.
1.5 MEASURING KCD
1.5.1 INTRODUCTION
Little agreement exists about how to identify and measure KCD. Some sources 
tend to focus on the measurement of components of KCD only, such as the 
individual capacity or the organizational capacity. Others prefer to focus 
on measuring performance as a proxy for capacity, probably because it is 
more appealing to look at apparent results than to look at the mechanism 
of KCD itself. Performance however, depends on many other factors beside 
Table 1.2 Three types of evaluation (Hospes, 2008).
Evidence-oriented evaluation Realistic evaluation Complexity evaluation
Measuring effects Investigating “black boxes” Exploring complexity
No use of policy theory Use of policy or program 
theories on what happens 
in “black boxes”
Starting point is that 
policymaking is dynamic 
and interactive
Programs stand at the 
beginning of a results chain
Programs are “black boxes” Programs are adaptive 
systems
Input => output => 
outcome => impact
Mechanism + context => 
outcome
Outcomes are emerging 
and quite unpredictable

the current capacities of individuals and organizations, and there is no direct 
causal relation with KCD; one should be cautious.
Many attempts have been undertaken to develop frameworks for the 
measurement of KCD, and numerous capacity assessment tools exist; UNDP 
summarizes 20 just for organizational capacity measurement (UNDP, 2005). 
Several web-sites are specialised in capacity assessment. Mizrahi (Chapter 20) 
concludes that not one study offers indicators, benchmarks or measurement 
tools that can be used across regions, or indicators that assess all relevant 
levels of KCD.
1.5.2 APPROACHES IN MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)
The various ways in which KCD is assessed can usually be categorised in two 
broad schools. One school advocates approaches based on results-based man-
agement; the other favours evaluation based on the complex-systems theory 
and a participatory approach.
Hospes (2008) has created a comprehensive overview based on three 
approaches (Table 1.2). The most commonly used evaluation method in devel-
opment cooperation is evidence-oriented, as is described in the left column. 
This approach focuses on the impact of a given intervention. It assumes a lin-
ear, causal relation from input to impact. This type of evaluation is convenient 
when working with the short-term project goals and time slots, as donors often 
do. Realistic evaluation however, believes that the relation between input, out-
put, outcome and impact is not linear. What happens in the process from input 
to impact, in the so-called “black boxes” should be investigated. The art in 
realistic evaluation is to map the dynamics in a program: social interaction and 
institutional influences that determine the relation between input and output.
Critics of realistic evaluation point out that the context should not be per-
ceived as something external, but as part of the process. As a reaction to realistic 
evaluation, complexity evaluation is evaluating how policymakers themselves 
respond to complex problems. It wants to capture the dynamics of the context 
as well. Hospes (2008) states that for the evaluation of complex systems differ-
ent approaches need to be brought together, based on adaptive systems, institu-
tional dynamics and assigning meaning. The evaluation of complex systems is 
rooted in various schools of thought, some of which are described earlier in this 
article, and will receive more elaborate attention elsewhere in this volume.
1.5.3 ADAPTIVE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
One management approach that is working according to the principles of 
complexity evaluation and the institutional dynamics in complex systems, 
is adaptive management (AM). AM is defined as the “integration of design, 
management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order 
to adapt and learn” (Salafsky et al., 2002). AM originates from ecosystems

research and has combined this with research on the social and institutional 
dynamics in a system. The objective of AM is to better manage the impact 
of an intervention, by investigating what happens in the “black boxes”, 
and at same time it takes along the social and institutional dynamics of the 
system. An important component is the involvement of stakeholders in the 
process from beginning to end, to capture their knowledge and use it to arrive 
at a set of management options. New knowledge about the connection and 
interaction between the social and cultural system and the ecological sys-
tem has to be generated, through extensive consultation and participation of 
stakeholders. The next step is how to use that knowledge for policy making. 
An important advantage of AM is that the process consists of step-by-step 
learning, iteratively allowing to monitor what worked and what not, and to 
adjust the intervention process. This facilitates easier and early evaluation 
of mistakes and successes, albeit that this monitoring system would likely 
involve high expense for the repeated consultations. Chapter 5 will discuss 
the principles of AM more elaborately.
