ABSTRACT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Training involves the knowledge, skills and attitudes required by an individual to perform 
effectively in assigned task s. The proper implementation of training and development 
programmes in any  organization ultimately enhances employee and organi zational 
performance. The main aim of the  study was to determine the relationship between 
training and development as a driver for performance of the Local Government 
employees in order to explore the re lationship among st the factors affecting training,  
development and performance.  
The study adopted a quantitative research approach and a closed-ended questionnaire 
comprising of a Likert Scale as the measurement instrument . The Statistical Package 
for the Social Sciences  (SPSS version 25.0)  was used for dat a collection and data 
analysis. The popul ation size of this study was 110 employees from Ndwedwe Local 
Municipality. Due to the siz e of the study’s population, a  sample of 90 employees was 
utilized and t he sampling framework was the municipal payroll s ystem. The study 
revealed that training and d evelopment did have an influence on  individual and 
organizational performance. The study also  identified a performance management 
system linked to the Personal De velopment Plan as an essential tool. Due to limited  
resources, the study was confined to  Ndwedwe Local Municipality only . Therefore, the 
findings or results should not be generalized to all Local Municipalities. The study 
recommended that the proper implem entation of Performance Management Systems 
linked to appropriate individual performance develo pment plans be implemented. The 
recommendations could be used in improving training and development and managing 
employee performance. The study further contributes to knowledge in implementing  
Human Resources Devel opment policies . It will be valuable in the upliftment of the 
social economy of South Africa.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 
 
1.1     INTRODUCTION 
 
Training and development in the Republic of South Africa has become significant since 
the adoption an d implementation of a constit utional democra cy, particularly in Local 
Government, the coal-face of service de livery. The new Constitution of the Republic of 
South Africa ( 1996) shifted the role of  local Government i nto the sphere of service  
delivery and is at the heart of poverty eradiation initiati ves. Elnaga and Imran  (2013) 
believe th at training optimizes the performance of employees . It is true that when it 
comes to the matters that affect South Africans on a regular basis, local government 
would-be the backbone of the government in dealing with these problems. 
 
1.2.     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY 
 
The purpose of  this study is to investigate the impact of training and development on 
employee performance for the local  government employees of Ndwedwe local 
municipality. In a ddressing th is o bjective, the researcher intends to investigate the 
relationship between trai ning a nd development and employee performance  linked to 
organizational performance in order to explore the relationship amongst factors affecting 
training and develop ment and organizational p erformance in the L ocal government 
sphere. However, due to limite d resources, the study was only conducted at Ndwedwe 
Local Municipality. It is one among four municipalities within ILembe District Municipality 
in the Kwa-Zulu Natal  province. The researcher also looked at approaches used by 
municipalities in capacitating  their employees to attain  the vision and objectives spelt 
out in the Integrated Development Plan (IDP). 
The reco mmendations will  contribute to existing HRD policies. The Nation al 
Development Plan 2030 of the National Commission i dentifies a long-term approach to 
capacity building as critical areas in the improvement of Local Government performance
<<<PAGE=15>>>
2 
 
and emphasi zes tha t the municipalities’  skills devel opment is aligned c ontinuously to 
provide employees with skills (RSA 2001).  
A stud y b y Devi and Nagurvali (2012) investigating the impact  of training and 
development towards the performance of employees the study c oncluded that trained 
employees perform better that untrained employees, as “training helps organizations in 
achieving their  strategic objectives and gives organizations a competitive edge ” (Devi 
and Nagurvali, 2012: 730) . Buckley, et al  (2015:16-26) conducted a study that found  
personality as the factor that having most effect on skill a chieved, which  turns to 
improved job per formance. Many studies conducted on trainin g development have 
concluded that training increases with the similarity between the lear ning contact and 
organization performance.  
 
1.3. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
The Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000  identifies the  shortage of a n intelligible a nd 
scarce skills development plan, which seeks to address the challenges  in enunciating 
the importance of capacity development. Lack of k nowledge and capacity building are 
recognized as core problematic issues faced by the  rural l ocal municipalities. 
Inappropriate financial management and backlogs in service delivery audits are a cause 
of the number of community protests for service delivery. The Local Government Seta’s 
Annual R eport 2014/2015 indicates that most municipalities con duct training  for 
compliance, not to address skills gaps. 
 
Lennie, Tacchi, Wilmore and Koirala  (2015) state that those local municipalities which 
are in developmental states  commonly expe rience shortages of funds, thus 
emphasizing the need to work on  their performance management, e valuation and 
monitoring. The MFMA Circular No. 82 of 2016 on c ost containment measu res 
emphasizes that mu nicipalities should use accredited provid ers to improve qual ity 
investment in training.  Kane-Berman (2014) indicate s that the lack of competencies in 
Local Government sphere is still an important matter.
<<<PAGE=16>>>
3 
 
Chakunda and Chakaipa (2015: 149 ) indicate that the  skills gap in deficient training 
systems remain a problem f or local go vernment capacity development. A ccording to 
Blair (2013) cited by Chakunda and Chakaipa (2015:149), Local G overnment requires 
structured leadership, strategic management and better provision of services . 
Municipalities allocate huge budgets to cater for training and development. This requires 
the proper monitoring and evaluation of skills and knowledge benefited by individuals.  
 
These have led to link ing skills development to the munici pal goals and objectives and 
overall stra tegy for upgrading the skills of working South African s. These have 
compelled the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) 
in partners hip with Provincial Treasury,  Local Government SETA  (LGSETA) and the 
Office of the Premier to form a platform to monitor the capacitation of Municipality 
Councilors and Official s. Nonetheless, this effor t seem s not enoug h to utilize  the 
knowledge gained by individuals as an active weapon to maximize municipa l 
performance (RSA report 2000). 
 
Despite this effort, Municipalities s till experience a shortage of scare skills , which is 
confirmed by the outsourcing of other core municipal functions to consultants. In 
particular, attention is in engineering and financ ial services, which are major functions 
outsourced by munici palities ( Annual Report 2015 ). Mnguni (2016)  indicates that  in 
previous years, local gover nment has continually been incompetent in facilitating  the 
relevant competencies, which has caused municipalities to rely  on service providers . 
This drains municipal funds, thus failing to implement the municipality IDP. The National 
Development Plan 2030 indicates that th e sphere of local government skills 
development should be prioritized at all levels. However, the National Development 
Plan (2011:364) identify identifies pressures caused by political administrative interfaces 
as a major challenge to local government providing effective and efficient services to the 
community. Therefore, it is necessary  to de termine whether the municipality is doing  
enough to capacita te their em ployees and properly monitor and evaluate the results  
from the training offered . More importantly, it is necessary to determine the relationship  
between training, development and employee performance.

1.3.1 Objectives of the study 
 
 
• To determine the relationship between training and development and employee 
performance; 
• To explore the relationship amongst the factors affecting training and development 
and organizational performance; and 
• To examine the relationship between training and development and organizational 
performance. 
 
 
1.3.2 Research questions 
  
 
• What i s the relationship b etween training and development and employee 
performance?  
• What is the relationship among factors affectin g the effectiveness of training and 
development and organizational performance? 
• What is the relationship between training and d evelopment and organizatio nal 
performance? 
 
1.4 DEFINITIONS OF CONCEPTS  
 
Human resource management:  defined as the key drivers of organizational success, 
for the purpose of maximizing organizational effectiveness and a suitable organizational 
culture which promotes development (CoGTA, 2010). 
 
Training: Training is defined to as an exercise for developing employee skills to assist 
organizations to develop employee knowled ge and enhance empl oyee productivity 
(Ezeani & Oladele, 2013).
<<<PAGE=18>>>
5 
 
On-Job training: It is a process which aim to develop skills while carrying out assigned 
tasks. Wilton (2013) believes that this is the best mode for e mployees at a junior level. 
On-job training is the best appropriate kind of training. 
 
Off-Job training: This is the training of employees away from their work stations. 
 
Development: Kadiresan (2015) refers to development as a method of preparing 
employees for prospective work roles and possible unforeseen problems that may arise 
in the future.  
Organizational Development (OD) : Wetterberg et al. (2015) , define Organizational 
Development as a normative disci pline that prescribes a specific model  to effect 
planned change at every level within the organization, with the main purpose  being to 
change behavior and attain total organizational effectiveness.  
Working tools : The Labour Relations Act  No.66 of 1996 specifies that one of the 
obligations of the employer is to provide working tools for employee. It is challenging for 
any employee to produce expected quality work while the tools of the trade are of  poor 
quality. 
 
Performance appraisal : Paile (201 2) explains Performance Appraisal as a method 
whereby a breakdown analysis of individual performance  is carried out , therefore 
permitting the ability to make informed decisions for particular purposes.  
 
Perception: According t o Robb ins and Judge (20 13), Perception i s described as  a 
process where people subjectively interpret information and situations.  
 
South African Local Government Association (SALGA) : SALGA was compose d in 
line with  the Local Government Act, No . 52 of 19 97 to function as a nation al and  
provincial representative of the local sphere of 52 governments.  
 
Municipal Integrated Development P lan ( IDP): This is a municipal ity’s fundamental 
guide that was composed based on Chapter 5, Section 23(1) of the Municipal  Systems
<<<PAGE=19>>>
6 
 
Act (MSA) 32 of 2 000, which compels the municipality to carry out developmental 
planned projects for the purpose of accomplishing the goals set by local government.  
 
Workplace Skills Plan (WPS): It is described as the blueprint outlining all trai ning and 
development initiatives that have been planned for an  organization in the next financial 
year.  
 
1.5    Limitations and Delimitation 
 
The study was limited to  NLM and does not cover  all municipa lities, with spec ific 
reference to the study, under  the iLembe District Municip ality. Limitations have no 
negative impact on the findings or concl usion. Therefore, an outcome  of the study  
cannot be widespread and generalised to Local Governments across South Africa. Due 
to the complexity of the South African  municipalities and limite d reso urces, it w ill be 
difficult to research every Local Municipal ity in every District.  Time constrain ts, 
availability of the  sample for c ompletion of the questionnaires  and c ost implications 
have an impact on the study.  The Researcher was restricted in the confidentially of 
documents such as  financial statements. The y outh from the community who benefited 
from the bursary programme and Ward Committee Members  will not form a pa rt of the 
survey as they were not NLM employees.  
The research was not extended  to ot her local m unicipalities based on practical 
considerations by the researcher. Subsequently the variety of the study is limited as the 
study was limited to the Ndwedwe M unicipality. This study contemplated performance 
as an outcome of training and development. 
 
1.6 Significance of the Study 
 
There is a  vast volume of  research on the relationship between tra ining and 
development and performance management. The study will try to elevate a  gap by 
focusing further on effective training and employee performance; and giving proposals 
to the organization on how they can best  use tr aining to improve their employee
<<<PAGE=20>>>
7 
 
performance in their daily tasks. The recommendations of the study will assist in 
enabling the Local government to devise suitable training that will assist individuals to 
improve their performance. 
 
1.7 BENEFITS OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE ORGANISATION 
 
The core function of training and development is to shape employees to work in  the 
relevant sections and empower them  to achieve required stand ards and to enrich their 
competencies for future challenges. Training and development programs improve 
cognizance amongst staff by implementing advanced expertise  (Imran et al.,  2014). In 
these situations, employees should be trained to overcome hindrances. Further, training 
for the use  of the latest expertise also emphasizes that the personnel responsible for 
monitoring the imple mentation of training have to confirm their commit ment towards 
employee skills development for better performance.  
 
1.8 Training Evaluation Model 
 
Training provides the individual with new skills and pe ople often pursue training that 
provides them with transferable skills . Kirkpatrick's Four -Level Traini ng Evaluation 
Model can assist individuals in evaluat ing training, considering the impact and 
effectiveness for better progress in future  (Kurt, 2016). Kirkpatrick's Four -level 
Evaluation Model is used to e valuate the efficiency of educational programs . Donald 
Kirkpatrick developed the four levels of evaluation with each level presenting an order of 
steps for the evaluation of educational programs (Meghe, et al. 2013), as follows 
 
1.8.1 Level 1- Reaction 
 
It is a response of the participant that assesses their standard of contentment with the 
program. Gill an d S harma (2013) stated tha t the levels of r eaction evaluate how  
individuals feel about the le arning program. Training programs should always include 
the two-way communication between the trainer and trainee to assess the feedback and 
measure satisfaction  (Nikols, 2013).  This level contains response s towards  designed 
work and quantify the individual’s reaction towards specific work.

1.8.2 Level 2-Learning 
 
This level emphasizes the extent to which learning has occurred.  It assesses new skills 
and knowledge received learning program the impact and contribution to close the gap 
(Nikols, 2013). Learning should be to way of communication  where the learner presents 
the expectation and facilitator aligns the program to answer and fill the skills gap , based 
on their participation in a training event.  
 
1.8.3 Level 3-Behavior 
 
This level measures how well the trainees use their new knowledge and it determine the 
change pattern of doing things in  an advanced  way (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2 009). 
Behavior influences the attitude of an employee towards assigned tasks.  
 
1.8.4 Level 4-Results 
 
This level is referred to as the  degree to which the ta rgeted outcome occu rred. This  
means that the individual or participan t who  attended the program would be able to 
enjoy the benefits from the trainin g itse lf. Since t hey have been equipped with the 
required knowledge and skill during the training program, they should then be able to   
perform accordingly in their tasks. Once employees can achieve the outcome from the 
training conducted in performing th eir jo bs, this sh ows that the training has  been 
effective.

1.9 Potential Outputs of the Study 
 
 
The study affords understandings into the background of a problem, creating concepts 
and hypotheses for la ter quantitative studies  and uncovers dominant tendencies in 
perceptions in order to identify a useful tool that  Local G overnment can utilize to 
improve performance management and to increase job satisfaction. These will increase 
effective service delivery to the community at large.   It is a duty for management and 
Human Res ources Practitioners and employees to work collectively to guarantee that 
performance man agement practi ces are enforced fairly across human capital . HR 
Practitioners should show their support  to employee development and Management 
should be held responsible for allocating budget sand resources that  are enough to 
cover all employees at their respective skills gaps.

CHAPTER 2 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
This chapter provides a comprehensive discussion on literature reviewed pertaining to 
training and development as identifie d in the resear ch t opic. It also points out  the 
relevant theoretical framework relating to each variable. The Local Government in South 
Africa accomplished a collection of pieces of legislation that structures the o perations, 
functions and powers, taken from the Constitution of 1996. Local government, as stated 
by its object ives in the Constitution of 1996, should provide sound local serv ices that 
promote the economic and social welfare of the local communities. The literature review 
presented below is link ed to the problem identification stated in Chapter O ne and sets 
out to provide a broad outline of contemporary authors on the three var iables. The 
impact of trai ning to organizations is to uplift organizational performance. This will be 
discussed in line with four areas of Kirkpatrick’s evaluation of training model.  
 
2.2 A synopsis of Human Resource Management 
 
 Botha, et al. (2013) define Human Resource Manageme nt as a component of an 
organization which ensures the drafting and implementation of policies updating the 
organizational structure in line with the vision of organization  by ensuring that practices 
and procedures are followed . It is their function to imp rove t he wellbeing of individual 
personnel by providing them Employee Assistance Programme s (EAPs) and ensuring 
that employees’ perceptions are positive to support the vision of  the organization.  
Training and Development is consid ered a key constituent of Human resource 
management, as these are integral tools  in capacitating employees of an organization. 
These discuss is further elaborated within the body of this study.

2.2.1 Human Resource Practices 
 
Gulati and Khera (2013: 43 -61) describe human resource  (HR) practices as 
encouraging the fruitful development of individuals in achieving planned organizational 
goals. Hafeez and Akbar (2015:43-61) assert with Gulati and Khera that HR practices 
are very crucial part s implemented by improved organizations globally in relating their 
key experiences and goals  in emerging and supporting organizations, as w ell a s in 
influencing employee commitment. HR Practices have been  absolutely supplementary 
with the developmental areas of employee performance in order for any organization to 
perform at  its maximum to fu lfill its goals and objectives. T his has been confi rmed by 
numerous previous studies.  
 
2.2.2 The components of Human Resources 
 
Newman and Sheikh (2014: 414) enlighten that Human resour ces are a crucial 
component within the organization and it strengthens the relationship between employer 
and employee , th ese are selection and recruitment, Skills D evelopment, Labour 
Relations and Occupational Health and safety. 
 
Training and development  – This refer to  a process whereby organizations influence 
their staff by offering  them on-the-job experiences such as talent ma nagement, 
knowledge or perception (Dilshad and Bashir 2013: 118-130). 
 
Labour Relations – This component promotes fair labour practices between employers 
and employees and enforces compliance with prescribed le gislation and organizational 
policies and promotes labour peace.  
 
Recruitment and  Selection – The main aim of recruitment a nd selection  is to find a 
qualified and competent ca ndidate. I t is not  only necessary to fill a vacant position. 
Needed is a person who can play a vital role for the organization to fulfill its mission and 
objectives.

2.3 Performance Management 
 
Sultana et al., (2012) outline performance management as the  accomplishment of 
particular responsibilities designed in contrast to already required values on reasonable, 
speed and c ost. The level of e mployee’s accuracy when  performing their assigned 
duties defines better performance. Each and every organization has specific target to be 
reached a nd employees should align  themselves with those expectations when both 
parties played the ir ro les effect ively it’s the organization performance automatically 
improved. Performance management is a significant component of dev elopment. If the 
performance management is implemented at a required standard , this process should 
be done continuously t o equ ip employe es w ith more skills to more dominate to the   
organizational performance (Long, Perumal and Ajagbe, 2012; Du Plessis, 2015). 
 
 When the employee s igns the contract of employment , it is where the perfor mance 
management starts, and supervisors can i mmediately assist where ever possible to 
achieve best result during the eva luation period. Botha et al. (2013: 4) emphasize that 
proper skills development is a vi tal instrument to advance the performance of 
employees in organizations. When supervisors  and line manag ers have a clear 
understanding on what the individual employee is  lacking, they can be able to design a 
work place skills plan that is suitable t o address the need of individual , rather compiling 
a plan for compliance (Long, Perumal and Ajagbe, 2012).

Planning- requires supervisors to set performance standards to help employees 
achieve institutional objectives.  
 
Monitoring- requires supervisors to monitor employees’ work to ensure that employees 
perform at required standards. 
 
Developing- is the process that managing the growing requirements of employees. The 
aim is to assist individual where he need s any development or to acquire new sk ills 
through attending trainings, workshop and refresher course. Introduction of  new 
technology and amendments of certain  legislations and global change may course the 
huge gap on competitiveness of employees   
 
Assessing- entails the supervisor assess ing or appraising the employee’s 
performance. Reward should be relevant and meaningf ul to e mployees. This step  is 
important h ence it assist the line managers and supervisors  to match the individual’s 
performance and with their colleagues’ performance levels . “Assessing” also involve s 
weighing the employee against the generated skills audi t repor t as appear on  
Performance Development Plan (PDP). 
 
Rewarding - This is the final element t he employer is not obli ged to reward emp loyees 
on a monetary value only , but rewards should come on v arious ways. This overcome 
the situation whereby employee  demand reward while employer is not on a  right stage 
to use that kid of reward.  
 
Though the concept of performance mana gement does not directly link to the  main 
variables (training and development) ; however, the need to discuss performance 
management was due to  the necessity in conducting and e valuating the o verall 
performance of an org anisation which equ ally entails employee’s performance which 
may be accessed  through p erformance management , after which training and 
development programmes or initiatives may have been conducted.

2.4 Conceptual Framework 
 
Below is the diagram illustrating the link between the indepen dent variable and 
dependent variables. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.2: Conceptual Framework 
Above is the diagram illustrating the relationship amongst the variables of the research, 
which defines three variables: 
• Independent variable -  employee training and development 
• Driver variable           -  employee performance and  
• Dependent variable   -  organizational performance 
 
Figure 2.2 indicates that the independent variables, employee training and development 
has a positive ef fect on the dependent variables’ organisational performance. Hence, 
the dependent variable is dependent on the independent variable.  
 
Training programmes enable employees to learn the required skills and  knowledge to 
improve perfo rmance (Salah 2016: 39) . Devel opment programmes  involve a more 
extensive employee growth plan, for future performance(Salah 2016: 41). As a result, in 
this study, organisational p erformance (dependent variable) is dependent on employee 
training and develo pment (independen t variable) because in order to improve 
organisational performance, one should focus on enhancing a nd making optimal use o f 
abilities. Therefore, to improve organi sational perfor mance, it’s important for

management to  provide appropriate t raining and devel opment to the employees to 
increase the ef ficiency of the employees individually. More importantly, management 
must plan appropriate trainings for eve ry department. And  develop a n ef fective 
workforce plan, training, and development strateg y and develop car eer paths for 
success of every department.  
 
2.5 The Approaches of Training and Development 
 
This subsection provides an espouse on approaches to training and development. 
Reactive Approach: This is a methodology of training that emanated from reactionary 
where considered  transfer of practical competences, using formal and  informal ski lls 
transfer. 
 
Proactive Approach : This method brings into line  all learning  programmes with the 
organizational approach and in order to develop competencies. 
 
Active Learning Approach : Here learners play a part in le arning based on  the 
assessment of matters under the supervision of an educator . Learners assess what 
they have learn agai nst their expectations whether facilitator presented the course in a 
manner they would improve their methodology and skills. 
 
2.5.1. Dimensions of Training and Development 
 
Many organizations use various kinds of training for their employees that suit the needs 
of desired outcome. The following are the approaches: 
 
Orientation/ Induction Training : This is  a process take place  immediate after 
employee signing an em ployment cont ract and job description which detailed w hat 
exactly expected by employer. Employer has an obligation to orientate employee not for 
better performance as well as Occupational Health and Safety issues.
<<<PAGE=31>>>
18 
 
Foundation Tra ining: This training is suitable for new recruits to gain  specialized 
competencies about the government  legislations, fin ancial transact ions, administrative 
capability, communication skills, report writing and Management skills. This is where the 
organization introduces their policies and related legislation. 
 
Job Instruction Training : This training take place  when individua l per forming th e 
assigned duties (Demetra, 2008). 
 
Career Development Training: This training involves continuous improvement of skills 
and information required to per form as signed duties at expected standard It is 
appreciated for any employee to perform exceptional beyond the given scope. 
 
Maintenance/ Refresher Training : The goa ls and strategies of each organization 
change timeously. This kind of training is offered for employees to be more relevant to 
global development and assist individual to perform their duties at required standards. 
 
2.6 The Training Concept   
 
Ezeani and O ladele (2013:266-281) discuss training as a process that supports 
employees to develo p skil ls, which assists the organization towards produ ctivity. 
According to Bird and Cassel (20 13: 6-15), training is the achievement of competencies 
and knowledge, skills  as an outcome of the education of professional or applied skills 
and knowledge that in rel ation to explicit suitable competencies. Ezeani and Oladele 
(2013:266-281) and Bataineh (2014:192-196) mentioned training as a development of 
process of equipping em ployees with new skills to develop their knowledge and 
expertise to assist an organiz ation to enhance productivity and remain relevant glob al 
and attractive to their customers . Long, Pe rumal and Ajagbe (2012) and  Punia and 
Saurabh (2013:2278-6236) and Javaid et al. (2014:73) concur with Ezeani and Oladele 
(2013:266-281) and Bataineh (2014:192-196) that Human resource management’s 
major role is skills development and that individual who partake in these plans are more 
efficient as compared to those who are not involved in training and development.
<<<PAGE=32>>>
19 
 
Comprehensive training assists employees to  do th eir ass igned duties at acceptable 
standard with improves quality service and customer sat isfaction. The aim of training if 
to bring change in the working environment  in a manner that an organization improve 
the profit margin  and reduces the level of turnover. The Local Government Seta’s 
(LGSETA) annual report 2014/2015 indicates that most municipalities conduct training 
for compliance, not to address skills gap s. The MFMA Circular no 82 of 2016 on Cost 
containment measures emphases that the municipality should use accredited providers 
to improve quality investment in training.  
 
Proper training and development supports organizations to respond more successfully 
in global needs by having restructured employees. Organizations are liable to conduct 
skills audit and ca tegorize the training need s as identifyin g train ing according to 
individual needs these assist an  organization to reach its goals and objective and 
remains re levant to in the market  (Kennedy, et al.  2013:18). Training close the gap 
among between the individual’s present  performance and expected performance 
(Jehanzeb and Beshir, 2013:243-252).  
 
Human Capital  
 
Hasebur and Abdullah (2013 ) point out  that human ca pital comprises the combined 
knowledge, abilities, skills and attitude. Furthermore, human resources play s a major 
part in an organizations ’ capacity to be economical and profitable (Ha sebur and 
Abdullah, 2013).

2.6.1 THE TRAINING PROCESS 
 
Figure 2.3: The Training Process

 Identifying the training needs 
The training cycle  begins with the needs assessment  by identifying the tra ining needs. 
Training needs can be emanating from derived from poor performance or updating new 
skills to align with new technology (Long, Mahanra and Ajagbe, 2013). Training can also 
be provided as part of an induction to newly recruited em ployees so that  they can be 
familiar with the work environment and know what  is expected from them , etc. Line 
managers and individual employees are responsible for identifying their training needs.

The EMPS aligns the identified capacity gaps and interventions which are contained in 
the individual staff member ’s personal development plans. The process for identifying  
training needs and t he areas under study Al -Kassem (2014: 129-133) include the 
assessment of trainin g needs, evaluation of training programme s and development, to 
be designed by means that contributes to organizational effectiveness. 
 
Planning the training design 
 
The second s tep involves planning of t he tra ining design. This is where the skills 
development facilitator cluster the trainings pro grammes according to the plan . It may 
include obtaining procuring service pro vider and other logistics that may be needed 
during training.  
 
Conduct training 
 
This is w here the actual training be conducted the facil itator should be well equipped, 
the organization have their unique norm of doing things even policies are differ ent from 
each other, therefore facilitator should be more trained  and familiar with the 
organization. The training material used during training  should be similar with the one 
employee’s used on a day to day operation.  
 
Evaluating the effectiveness of training 
 
Evaluation provides feedback which assists with  organizing upcoming training. This is 
the final stage where the employee can be evaluated . This can be measured by 
increase of out put high level of service customer satisfaction and improvement of profit 
margin.
<<<PAGE=35>>>

2.7 Importance of Training Development 
 
 
The purpose of training and development has been identified to include creating a pool 
of readily available and adequate replacem ent for personnel w ho may exit or move up 
in the organization, it assist in enhan cing the organizations ability to adopt and use 
advances in technology because of sufficiently knowledge staff of staff members. 
It also assists the organization to build the foundation for career advancement and staff 
recognition through promotions . It ai med at helping the employees obtain knowledge 
and skills re quired in performing and b eing a ble t o develop their abilities to the full,  
within the areas that are relevant to th e org anization. For  training to be effective, it 
should improve the performance and ability of the trained employee. 
 
2.8 Theoretical Framework 
 
The Kirkpatrick four -levels model of training assessment remains the g reatest 
extensively recommended training evaluation model be tween experts and remains the 
best known model for analyzing a nd evaluating the results of training and educational 
programs (Kurt 2018) . It takes into account any styl e o f training, both inform al and  
formal, to determine capacity based on fou r levels criteria (Kurt 2018). In another study, 
Spitzer (2005:55-70) argues that there is still lack of a practical effort on developing an 
advanced evaluation measures , however numerous conceptual has identified that 
contribute i n evaluation conclusion .  Specter proposed a decision -based evaluation 
model. Holton (2005:28 -29) suggests that A  DIY Model of learn ing transfer,  
accountability, resistance to new ideas,  change, relevant training and lack of autonomy 
could be causal fac tors of training and devel opment. Hen ce, this study adopted 
Kirkpatrick four-level approach as a relevant model of training evaluation.
<<<PAGE=36>>>
23 
 
According to Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick (2016: 42), the model has four levels which are 
inclusive of the following:  
 
Level 1 : Reaction, which measures how participants rea ct to t he training such as  
satisfaction. Level 2: Learning, analyzes if participants  truly understood the training for 
instance an increase in knowledge , skills or experience. Level 3 : Behavior, looks at if 
participants are utilizing what they learned at w ork such as change in behaviors, and  
Level 4: Results, determines if the material had a positive impact on the organization. 
 
The aforementioned model was developed by Dr. Donald Kirk patrick (1924 – 2014) in 
the 1950s. The model can be implemented before, throughout, and following training to 
show the  value of trai ning to the business  Kurt 2018. As outlined by this system, 
evaluation needs to start with level one, after which as time a nd resources will allow, 
should proceed in order through levels two, three, and four. 
 
Undoubtedly, the most widel y use d and in -demand m ethod for the assessment of 
training in businesses nowadays is Kirkpatrick’s system based around the four levels as 
guidelines. The Kirkpatrick mo del has been used for over 30 years by many dif ferent 
types of companies as the major sy stem for training e valuations. It is evident that 
Kirkpatrick’s vision has made a p ositive impact to the overall practice of training 
evaluation.

2.9 Factors affecting training and development 
 
Faizal, Saiful, Bekri, Jamil, Amiruddin, Ruhi zan and Arasinah (2017) outline a variety of 
factors which  may impede the eff iciency of training and development within an  
establishment. The main f actors highligh ted i n the ir study are motivation among 
employees, attitude of employees as well as employees emotional intelligence. Faizal et 
al. (2017) also identif y concerns such as open -mindedness of trainer, environment 
where training is ta king place, the method or approach been used to train emp loyees, 
and inadequate support from management or other colleagues
<<<PAGE=38>>>
25 
 
2.9.1 Human Resource Development Policy (HRD Policy) 
 
Erasmus and Van Dyk (2014:75) emphasize the importance of organization to have the 
training policy in place to address  the skills gap and wellbeing of employees  and 
reduces the level of turnover by: 
  
• Offering induction programmes   for all newly recruited employees. 
• Compiling a d ocument approves the relief of em ployee to attend the particul ar 
training or workshop stating the consequences of failure by employees to attend 
due to ignorance or non-submitting of assignments. 
• Training at the discretion of the  appropriate departmental m anager in 
consultation with the organization’s training officer; 
• Provision of w orking tools t hat are similar to those used during training or 
workshops, 
• this will enable the employee to reach the tip of performance desired. 
• Giving information, instruction and tr aining to ensure the health  and sa fety of  
every employee; and 
• Arranging training to add ress t he issue o f succession planning , to assist an 
organization 
• to r emain pro ductive even when the organization experiencing the employ ees 
turn off. 
 
 
2.9.2 Skills retention 
 
This is the strategy enforced by the employer to ensure that the critical skills possessed 
by employees remains in the organization as valuable asset s even during employees’ 
turnovers they ensure that the skills empl oyees share their knowledge  to you nger 
employees (Long, Maha nra and  Ajagbe, 2013) . Skill r etention wi ll vary over time, a 
given level of physical aptitude or skill either deteriorating or be ing maintained or being 
improved upon. Skill retention can also de scribe the stage in acquiring a new motor skill 
when the ath lete is  able to transfer that skill to a different setting. The municipality
<<<PAGE=39>>>

conducts formal exit interviews to determine the reas ons why e mployees leave the 
service of the municipality.  
 
2.9.3 Rewards for excellence 
 
Employee rewards are a key cost for c ouncils, representing approxima tely a qua rter of 
all expenditure, but also a key means of reinforcing and recognizing the achieveme nt of 
partnership goals and display of the required behaviors and values. The main reasons 
for core of incentive strategy thinking is to arrange in a line  the Human Resources and 
incentive provisions to maintain the preferred approach (Armstrong and Brown, 2006).

2.9.4 Employees’ Attitude and Behaviour 
 
Okeniyi (2013) vi ews attitude  as existing in the person’s psychological  sphere. 
Employee attitudes  can have a substantia l e ffect o n the organization as a whole. 
Attitude is one of the  covert and difficult to  quantity features that improve the 
productivity of an organizatio n. People ar e attracted to or repelled by something in  
terms of their views conce rning that thing. What  determines whether one will be 
attracted, get the best and make good representation of an experience is attitude.

Attitude and Behavior can influence employees when they are provided with various 
forms of trainings. The importance of training programmes will be determined by the 
employee attitude and behavior (Worlu, Adekanbi, Ajagbe, Isiavwe and Oke, 2015). 
Those employees who take training sessions as crucial opportunity not as luxury for 
holiday they turn to improve their performance. The aim of any organization to obtain 
the profit or service and keep return customers happy.  
2.10 Development 
 
Development refers to a process of development and modelling employees in a manner 
that they can be able to sustain the organization in fut ure challenges. (Kadiresan et al. 
2015:162). Bataineh (2014: 192 -196), agreed and str ess’s that  training and 
development courses warrant that the workforces have all necessary  abilities to uplift 
the organization and  Kulkarni (2013:136) views training and development as process, 
that pro vides employees with an opportunit y to discover and b ecame relevant in the 
market. Organizations should monitor performance due to training  in order to ens ure 
cost efficiency of training programs. 
 
2.10.1 Human Resource Development Strategy 
 
The HRD  strategy is the strate gy that enables th e pro cess of  holistic learning 
encompassing a universal method to training and development to take place in  society 
and the organization (Worlu, Adekanbi, Ajagbe, Isiavwe and Oke, 2015; McGuire, 2014: 
5). A com prehensive HRD strategy must have a strong lin k with both an organization’s 
human resource management and its business strategies.  
 
2.10.2 Approach to Human Resource Development 
 
Training and development is mostly significant for the preservation of the h uman 
resource foundation of the organization a nd it is require d to be regarded  as a 
fundamental measure of t he core organizational strategy  (Ogbari et al ., 2015: 1-14; 
Dabor et al ., 2015: 634-653; Worlu et al ., 20 15: 1-11). Development is designed to 
afford for strategic development of management to encounter upcoming organizational

desires and goals and objectives of an organization. Organizational development is a 
normative discipline that  prescribes a specif ic model to effect planned change at every 
level within the organization with the main purpos e being to change behavior and attain 
total organizational effectiveness (Botha, 2013:4).  
 
2.11 South African Skills Development (ACT 97 OF 1998) 
 
The purpose of the South African Skills  Development Act (SDA) of 1998 this act was 
developed to address the organizational framework to administer workplace approaches 
to advance the skills of the South African employees. The employer approaches should 
be in line with th e requirements of the National Qualification Fr amework (NQF) in the 
South African Qualificati ons A uthority (SAQA ) Act of 1998 (Act 58 19 95) to offer 
Learners hips  that lead to recognized  qualifications. This act compels all organized 
employer to provide employees with advanced techn ology frequently, to overcome the 
global challenges.  
 
 
2.12 THE N ATIONAL TRAINING AN D DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY O F SOUTH 
AFRICA 
 
This is a na tional skills development strategy composed for the objective to afford a 
human resource dev elopment system  (HRDS) with an incorporated method to skills 
development, which must respond to the needs of  the country by identifying and 
develop the needs of in  individuals. This approach aims to c hange the ed ucation 
system to address and support the lifelong learning.

2.12.1 The Objectives of the National Training and Development Strategy 
 
The following are the objectives of the national training strategy: 
• Point out the difficulties in training; 
• Alert the country to prioritizes the need to invest on training; and 
•  Draft endorsement on incorporated forthcoming method to education and training. 
 
2.13 Work-Place Skills Plan (WSP) 
 
A Workplace Skills Plan (WSP) is the blueprint outlining all the skills initiatives that have 
been planned for a detailed organization. It also contains the Annual Training Report. All 
municipalities on the 30 th of April of ea ch year  have a duty to r eport th eir training 
conducted and training plan for the capacitation of employees to the Local Government 
Sector Education and Training Authority (LGSETA ). The Workplace Skills P lan was  
established from an extensive ass essment of t he organization’s objectives and  a deep 
understanding of the opportunities and challenges within the  organization’s 
environment. A WSP identifies which skills are required within the municipality, the 
employees who need these skills and how the y are going to acquire them, even how 
much it will cost them to deliver. 
 
 
2.14 The National Skills Development Strategy (NSDS) 
 
The National Skil ls Development Strategy (NSDS) was developed by government for a 
purpose to improve HRD. The NSDS is a documen t tha t shapes the n ational main 
concerns to be in line with the development  of skills which covers a five year  period. 
The NSDS emphasizes that all South African resident have to successfully contribute in 
the social and economic development of the country.
<<<PAGE=44>>>
31 
 
2.14.1 The National Skills Development Strategy I (2001 to 2005) 
 
According to Kraak (2010:72) , this strategy remained a policy text with ambitious goals . 
This wa s, amongst other things , due to a lack of coord ination and inter -departmental 
cooperation. It was against the background of the poor  results of the first strategy that 
the Department of Education had to re -draft and formulate a new and improved 
strategy. It had its own five key objectives that put much  weight on impartiality and the 
requirement to promote constant learning in the organ ization. This strategy was very 
impressive. However, it did not amount to much. 
 
2.14.2 The National Skills Development Strategy II (2005 to 2010) 
 
NSDS II was aimed at br idging a gap and unifying theoretical lea rning and training that 
takes place in the w orkplace, as well as promoting a structure for skills development 
that would be more effective in responding to the labo ur market requirements. Its aim 
was to emphasize equity issues and the quality of skills development and training in the 
work-place. It also acknowledged the necessity to support disadvantag ed groups to 
acquire knowl edge, competencies and experience within  the environment of the 
workplace in order to obtai n essential skills. Again, not much happe ned within the five 
years of the i mplementation of this strategy. According to Kraak (2010:72 ), there were 
pervasive policy  holes in the  training and education land scape that lead to failure in 
relating demand to supply in any meaningful way. 
 
2.14.3 The National Skills Development Strategy III 
 
NSDS III promotes partnerships between public institutions of learning and ensures that 
access to skills development and tr aining opportunities i s enh anced and measured 
against the core transformation and developmen tal obligations of gender, class, race, 
age, HIV/AIDs pandemic, disabilities , as well as geographical considerat ions. It ali gns 
the work of employees  with available resources so that there ca n be e ffective service 
delivery to ensure a t ransition between theoretical learning and workplace training. Its 
aim was to bridge the gap between the theoretical qualifications which are produced in
<<<PAGE=45>>>
32 
 
learning institutions with the  demands of the labour mark et to try and ensure tha t 
organizations have employees who would be in possession of appropriate skills. It w as 
an effort to try and solve the problems of mismatches and shortag es of skills  in the 
country as a whole , as well as  to en hance productivity in t he economy. Hence it 
promotes the growth of universities, FETs, SETAs, Universities of Technology and other 
private training providers to address national skills needs. 
 
NSDS II I is based on eight strategic priorities developed f rom the shortfalls in the 
previous two strategies, with its emphasis being on organized learning and experiential 
learning that lead to proper qualifications that are recognized nationally. Because the 
NSDS emphasize s that the citizens of South Africa that can only meaningfully 
participate in their self -advancement of the country i f they are in p ossession of general 
capabilities, it advocates for partnerships in making this possible.  The strategy 
promotes partnerships between public institutions of learnin g and ensures that access 
to skills development and  training opportunities is enhanced and m easured against the 
core transformation and developmental obligations of g ender, class, race, age, 
HIV/AIDs pand emic, disabi lities, as well as geographical consider ations. It aligns the 
work of employees  with availa ble res ources so that there can be effect ive s ervice 
delivery. 
 
2.15 South African Local Government Association (SALGA) 
 
The role of SALGA is to build and monitor the capacity needed by human resources in  
order to deliver effective municipal services and promote a developmental state. SALGA 
is ta sked with the follo wing activities that it has to deliver in municipalities:  Skills 
auditing; Strategy development for hum an resource in Local Government . Training on 
conflict resolution; creating partnerships with higher education institutions to ensure that 
municipalities get involved in training  and development p rograms like project 
management; leadership; financial manage ment; and implementing capacity building 
programmes to enable municipal councilors and officials to perform their duties.
<<<PAGE=46>>>
33 
 
2.16 Municipal Integrated Development Plan (IDP) 
 
The municipal development plan was established in line with the Municipal Systems Act 
(Act No. 32 of 2000), which pursues to accomplish the following: to confirm that required 
funds are channeled to valued developments to improve economic growth; to confirm 
the scheduled plans and developments are aligned to  the tactical vision of the 
municipality; to discourse all conditions that influence on the smooth service delivery by 
the municipality; and  to record the influence of achievements, as well as accurate 
procedures to overcome the challenges. 
 
2.17 Employee Performance  
 
The functionality of human resource management has related with the improvement of 
employees and employee performance (Solomon et al ., 2012: 303-312; Hafeez & 
Akbar, 201 5: 49-64). These confirm that employee performance has a greater impact 
towards the performance of an organization. Employees plays integral part in sustaining 
the operation of an organisation. Therefore, it is significant to improve the involvement 
of employees in decision making through organised structures.  
 
Employee p erformance is the overa ll outcome o r success of a person during certain 
periods of duty compared to the standard of the work, targets or criteria that have been 
determined in  advance and h ave been agreed  upon (Pawirosumarto, Sarjana and 
Muchtar 2017: 6 04). It indicates an individual’s work achievement a fter applying 
required effo rt on the job , which is  associated with attaining  a meaningful  work, 
engaged profile and compassionate collea gues around (Pradhan and Jena 2017: 70). 
Thus, it involves individual behaviors, actions , capability  and p roductivity th at are 
relevant for the organization’s abilities to reach its goals  (Buil, Martínez and Matute 
2019: 65; Sverke et al. 2019: 4). More importantly, it  involves aspects of performance 
behaviors, task per formance, contextual performance and c ounterproductive work 
behavior (Sverke et al. 2019: 4). It’s imperative to enhance or ganizational performance 
and effectiveness (Nazir and Islam 2017: 101; Paais and Pattiruhu 2020: 578).
<<<PAGE=47>>>
34 
 
As highlighted by Buil, Martínez and Matute (2019: 66-67); Diamantidis and Chatzoglou 
(2019: 174 -175) various employee -related factors i mpact on emp loyee performance. 
These are inclusive of  proactivity which includes  controlling a situatio n by caus ing 
something to happen rather than waiting to respond to it after it happens, thus taking the 
personal initiative to intentionally change situa tions (active orientation) . Adaptability, 
whereby if employees adapt easily to a new workplace as well as to irregular situations, 
there may be a positive effect on their performances. As a result, employees with no 
particular struggle to deal with diverse job requirements and environments may be more 
efficient than others. Skill flexibility, includes the possible alternative ways through which 
employees can apply the ir skills in their job a s well as  how employees with different 
skills can be repositioned t o the appropriate places in a rapid way. Hence , an 
organisation can enhance employee skills flexibility through various processes, such as 
job rot ation and cross-functional teams. Employees who feel that an organisation’s  
behaviour towards them is good  such as through  fair treat ment, participation in 
decision-making, may increase their levels of emotional commitment to the organisation 
and in turn, their performances may improve.  Furthermore, employees with high 
extension commitment feel a strong responsibility to perform their jobs in such a way 
that is iden tified with the organisatio n’s goals, while employ ees with low continuance 
commitment feel no such obligation to support the organisation’s goals. 
 
2.17.1 Employee Satisfaction 
 
Employee satisfaction is the fulfilment or satisfying emotional state that res ults from the 
positive appr aisal of job experienc es on the part of the employee  (Amin et al.  2017: 
1259). Other researchers define employee satisfaction as a person’s assessment of the 
overall quality of his or her curr ent job assig nment (Hsu and Wang, 2008; Prajogo and 
Cooper, 2010; Jung and Yoon, 2015). Relatively, employee satisfaction is an evaluation 
to describe a person for feeling happ y or  unhappy, satisfied or dissatisfied in work 
(Darma and Supriyanto 2017: 70) . As a result, the employee s are required to h ave a 
good performance as well as the skills in  doing the work (Darma and Supriyanto  2017:
<<<PAGE=48>>>
35 
 
70). Relatively, various employee s atisfaction may  enhance productivity and 
organizational performance (Budie et al. 2019: 36) 
 
 The factors affecting job satisfaction include salary, the job, colleagues, promotion and 
work e nvironment (Darma and Supriyanto  2017: 71 ).  In addition, j ob satisfaction  is 
related to  and has a deep effect on job performance appraisals, stress and work 
pressures, conflict and work conditions and the quality of service provided to customers 
(Amin et al. 2017: 1259). 
  
Armstrong and Taylor (2014:177)  regard employee satisfaction as the dispositions 
obtained and culture d th rough the experience and attitudes based upon a person’s 
genetic inheritance. According t o Art s and  Kaya (20 14), one characteristic that 
determines satisfaction is job security. Armstrong and Taylor (2014:177), illustrate 
employee satisfaction as   subjective to fundamental motivational factors associated 
with work content . Colquitt and Wesson  (2013:96) define e mployee satisfaction as a 
sub-group of human attitudes. 
 
A study by Moloantoa (2015 :21) discovered that theoretical presenters at the National 
University of Lesotho show dissatisfaction regarding the upward mobility or promotions, 
incentives and u npleasant working conditions. The study concluded that the 
administration at the National University  of Lesotho should revised their budget to fund 
incentives and improve working conditions. 
 
2.17.2 Leadership Style  
 
Raziq (2015:719) states that effective supervision leads to job satisfaction. According to 
Voon, Lo and  Ngui (2011:29), one important characteristic o f leaders is to be mindful 
about employee  of which all decisions tak en shall be in line to advance t he life and 
conditions of services  for better life of  employees (Dabor, Isiav we, Ajagbe and Oke, 
2015; Luthans, 2011:143). A good leader led by example and inspire his subordinate, 
the communication factor is highly imperative in this regard.
<<<PAGE=49>>>
36 
 
Leadership st yle is defined as the ability of a  leader in  directing, influencing, 
encouraging and controlling subordinates to be able to do work on their awa reness and 
volunteering in achieving a certain organizational goal (Pawirosumarto, Sar jana and 
Muchtar 2017: 603; Razak, Sarpan  and Ramlan 2018: 67) . It serves as one of the 
significant factors that can affect the perfo rmance of employees in a company  
(Mendoza, Nasution and Matondang 2018: 587; Razak, Sarpan and Ramlan 2018: 67).  
As such,  to be a good leader, one s hould be able to choose  what kind of leadership 
style is suitable to be  applied in th e company to motivate em ployees, as well as to 
discipline employees in the company (Pawirosumarto, Sarjana and Muchta r 2017: 603) 
Consequently, the success and failur e of a co mpany or organization is determine d by 
leadership, an effective form of leade rship will have an impact on the progress of the 
organization in fa cing the cha llenges and changes that occur (Razak, Sarpan and 
Ramlan 2018: 67; Guterresa, Armanu and Rofiaty 202 0: 1498). Relatively, leadership is 
the key in manag ement that plays an importa nt and strategic role i n the sur vival of a 
company (Mendoza, Nasution and Matondang 2018: 587). 
2.17.3 Employees’ Perceptions and Attitudes  
 
Swanepoel, et al. (2014:373) state that the perception of employees can b e stimulated 
by many con cepts and external factors which are not connected to job itself n ot under 
the control of the employer such as social wh ere the organization situat ed, economic 
development or poli tical influence.  Saleem (2015:563 ) postulates that su pervisors 
should create a conducive  internal work culture  that satisfies the needs and 
expectations of employees. Raziq and Maulabakhsh (2015 : 717-725) also confirm that 
active supervision leads to job s atisfaction and eventually influen ce the perception and 
attitude of employee. 
 
Despite various recent studies conducted on organization al productivity Egberi, 
(2015:148-163) and Emerole  (2015:6-11) identified the perception s of employees 
towards o rganizational policies and employee benefit s. Emerole (2015:6-11) regarded
<<<PAGE=50>>>
37 
 
the effect of non-monetary incentives towards the productivity of employees as the one 
with the positive effect towards the productivity.  
 
2.17.4 Employee Motivation 
 
According to Bonsu and  Kusi (2014: 339), Employee motivation comprises a 
combination of procedures that improve individual’s moral and attitude towards any 
condition, the way and determination of struggle leads to specific target. It serves as the 
key aspect to creatin g and enabling environment where ideal perf ormance is possible 
(Sharma and Sharma 2017: 10). More so, motivation is action conducted by a manager 
in giving inspiration, to suppo rt employee to take measure, to encourage employee to  
be enthusiastic and achiev e the desired result  (Mendoza, Nasution and Matonda ng 
2018: 588).  
 
Employee motivation is defined as the willingness to apply high levels of effort towa rd 
organisational goals, conditioned by the  effort‘s ability t o satisfy some individua l 
needs(Idowu 2017: 19; Martono, Khoiru ddin and Wulansari 2018: 536) . The process 
also serves as a desire of the soul that makes a person moved to perform a productive 
action, whether or not work-oriented moneymaking(Jufrizen and Pulungan 2017: 442) . 
Thus, serves as a boost to the process of human behavi or for the achievement of goals 
and triggers the t endency t o continue  (Jufrizen and P ulungan 2017: 442; Martono, 
Khoiruddin and Wulansari 2018). 
 
Motivating factors can play a significant part in ensuring that employees are satisfied; as 
it enables employees to improve  their performance . Hence, Emplo yee Incentive 
programs can be used  as a  strategy to p romote motivation as an employer, which 
contribute towards ensuring employees feel appreciated cared fo r and deemed  
Worthwhile (Sharma and Sharma 2017: 10). Employees may also be motivated through 
appreciation, job sec urity, and promotion, employee benefits such as pension plans or 
health programs) and privileges such as fitness centers, medical care or health facilities, 
and company cars (Antoni et al. 2017: 57).
<<<PAGE=51>>>
38 
 
Robbins (2013:148) emphasizes the following factors that lead to employee satisfaction 
on their specific jobs: 
 
• Appreciation; 
• Success;  
• Inspiring work;  
• Accountability; and 
• Progress and growth. 
  
2.17.5 Employee Involvement 
  
Abdullah (201 3:91) is of the vie w that Employee Involvem ent required employee 
empowerment through training and education . Moshoeu and G eldenhuys (2015:22-43) 
attest that if employees perceived that the organization is unstable, they at a risk to lose 
their jobs, they look for better opportunities to other prosperous organization. 
 
Employee involvement leads to superior organizational performance in both private and 
public sector s (Qi and Wang 2018: 747) . It increases financial performance , 
organisational productivity, service quality  and reduces emplo yee turnover (Qi and 
Wang 2018: 747). 
The process is  a participatory initiative t hat refers to  practices which  increases 
employees participation in decision-making and managem ent, fost ering their 
commitment to the orga nisation (Qi and Wang 2018: 747; Beraldin, Danese and 
Romano 2020: 3) . Relatively it is alleged that employee involvement exists when 
employees within some defined unit ( organization, division, team, work group) mut ually 
understand that they  hold the power to make decisions and act upon those decisions ; 
may access  the info rmation sour ces needed to effectively undertake those  actions; 
have opportunities to update their knowl edge to sustain their effectiveness (Smith et al. 
2018: 617)
<<<PAGE=52>>>
39 
 
According to Beraldin, Danese an d Romano (2020: 3)  employee involvement can be 
categorised based on four dim ensions: that is the degree of workers’ influence (from 
being informed to  control a specified job aspect), the form of p articipation (direct or 
indirect), the involvement  at organisational level (e.g. task, sectio n, corporate) and the 
range of the impact (e.g. broad strategic vs. narrow restricted scope).  
 
2.18 Training and Development as a driver of Employee Performance 
Scheduling employee targets improves the performance  of the organisation as highly 
motivated employees tend to improve the performance and the organisational goals are 
positively meet (Dabor, Isiavwe, Ajagbe and Oke, 2015; Brown and Warren 2011: 100). 
McNamara (2010:548-554) believes that   both parties emp loyee and employer benefit 
through trainin g pro grammes. Any organization that needs to be relevant and 
competitive global require to invest to Human capital unit is committed to update the 
skills of their employees continuously. Training is regarded as fun damental to uplift the 
organization performance. 
2.18.1 Training and Education 
 
Training and education are both tools which lead to transformation that which improves 
knowledge gained, acquisition of a competencies. Therefore, organization link the 
training programme to their objectives and goals,  and ensure the sus tainability of an 
organization in the industry.  
 
2.19 Organizational Performance 
 
Organizational performance involves the behavior of the emplo yee and outcomes of a 
task that is completed by means of precise capabilities. These results are measured by 
various scales (Long et al., 2012: 17; 2013; 11; Imran & Tanveer, 2015:137). Khan et al. 
(2011:25- 28) indicate training as important tool with a h igh influence the employee 
performance. Jacobs and Lin cited by Karthikeyan and Graf (2010:77-83) indicate that it
<<<PAGE=53>>>
40 
 
is essential for employees to   accept ongoing adjustment. Training regarded as major 
part of the long term planning of the various  organizations. Kulkarni (2013 :136) 
conquers that  training sh ould be considered as a  primary measure of the process of 
total quality management. The Government Gazette No 7146 Volume 434 (2001:1) and 
Municipal Performance Management Systems Chapter 3 7(1 ), depicts a framework that 
defines and signifies the manner on how the municipality procedures related t o 
performance cycle, can be handled controlled and achieved and the stakeholder’s role.  
 
2.19.1 How organizations measure employee performance 
 
Osunde (2015:3) id entified various ways that are linked to employee’s  performance 
which are belie fs that employ ee pe rformance can be dignified in differen t ways like 
production, turn over. During performance assessment, employees enter  into 
agreements with employers on what is expected by employer the  level to be achieved 
by employee. These expectations define impending goals or future performance. 
 
2.19.1.1 Efficiency 
 
Amah and Ahiauz u (2013: 661-674) believe that organizations require to prepare their 
working environment in a way which will permit staff to believe they are a vital part of 
the organization. Furthermore, Olivier (2015: 861-870) indicated that South African local 
communities depend on local government. Some South African residents have 
numerous complain ts on effective and efficient basic  service delivery for lo cal 
communities. Municipalities lack skill s and  a q ualified w orkforce, and their poor  
management impacts negative ly on service delivery. This was confirmed by Jolobe  
(2014: 1-6), who states that the new lo cal government system estab lished in 2000 has 
failed to liv e up to its promises . Zelgalve and  Zaharcenko (2012 :1142-1492) mention   
economic breakdown as crucial in comprehensive transformation. This assist in helps in 
considering the accurateness the accuracy and impact of the use of economic means in 
increasing the profit margin of an organization.
<<<PAGE=54>>>
41 
 
2.19.1.2 Employee Turnover  
 
Employee turnover is the method consid ered by employees to exit the company, by 
means of resignation, or any related reasons  (Ogbari, Oke, Ajagbe and Isiavwe, 2015). 
Dissatisfaction and ins ecurity most reason for employees to le ave when emplo yees 
became uncertainly about their future they decide to leave for better offers.  
2.19.1.3 Employee Retention 
 
Ajay et al. (2015:168-173) claim that human resources systems must prioritize more on 
investment on their employees to overc ome t he turnover, those best performers and  
employees with critical sk ills be treated as most valuable asset of an organisa tion, 
therefor the significance of retai ning employees is  more significant than  recruitment 
strategy. 
2.19.1.4 Profitability  
 
Best supervision of employees affects precise operations of the organisation and 
improves organization productivity continuously (Goel, 2013 :4). Elnaga and Imran  
(2013:137-147) state that staff categorized as the most valuable strength for any 
organization as th ey ca n sustain the image of the organization effectiveness. An 
organization with a good financial stand tends to prioritize  research as one of the 
business functions (Jagelavicius, 2013 :18). Wu (2014 :12) indicates that most 
organizations that generate more  income s hows a viable improvement are able  to 
sustain in the market even during the hard times.  
2.19.1.5   Organizational Productivity  
 
Nda and Fard (2013:91-93), Dorgan (1994) and Tokarčíková (2013:5-10) all emphasize 
that employees are at the fore front of any organization to maximize productivity. Van 
Beveren ( 2012: 98-128) stated that it is important to note that there is a recent move 
from researchers to focu s th eir productivity comparisons on individual sectors and
<<<PAGE=55>>>
42 
 
countries, which has added value t o the  definition of productivity (Gholizade h, 2014: 
160-170).  
2.19.1.6 Customer satisfaction 
 
According to Hawkins and Lonney , quoted in Tjiptono  (2015), they  refer t o customer 
satisfaction as a degree which based on measurement among the level of perform ance 
expected by customers and the actual p roduct or service standard offered by the 
product. According to Rai and Medha (2013: 139)    Most of companies  have confirmed 
that for better  performance of the organization, customers should be always happy 
about the product or service offered. A research conducted in Bahawalpur, Pakistan on 
financial entities the findings confirms the positive effect amongst the customer 
satisfaction and organization performance.  
 
2.20 Factors Affecting Organisational Performance  
 
2.20.1 Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Plan 
 
The Municipal Systems Act no. 32 of 2000  provides for a municipal ity to sign a 
performance-based contract with S ection 57 managers and that contract evaluated 
yearly. However, Vallejo and Wehn (2016:1 -13) advise that inaccurate evaluation may 
lead to employee’s turnover or abandoned some developments that can be uplift the 
economy and social development. 
2.20. 2 Provision of working tools  
 
The MEC for the Department of Co -operative Governance and Tradi tional Affairs 
(Cogta) has approved the upp er limit as reflected in Gazette Not ice No. 1600 dated 21 
December 2016 , which compels all municipalities to provide Cou ncillors with tools o f  
the trade for improvement in service delivery.  The Labour Relations Act stipulates that 
the provision of working tools by employers is essential.

2.20.3 Performance appraisal 
Paile (2012) explains Performance Appraisal as a method w hereby a breakdown 
analysis of individual performance is carried out, therefore permitting the ability to make 
informed decisions for pa rticular purposes . Performance Appraisal, when effective , is 
said to increase employee  motivation and improve productivity. They may also take the 
form of opportunity for recognition, achievement and growth.  
2.20.3.1 Factors Affecting Performance Appraisal 
 
Performance-based pay : Aguinis (2013 :265) define performance-based pay as a 
process which aligned direct to individua l’s performance, here employer measure the in 
individual or team performance and reward based  on t heir contribution towards the 
goals and objectives of an organisation. 
 
 Merit pay:  Martocchio (2 013) defines merit pay as  a constant incentive  or benefit in 
kind influences by the overall performance of an organization. An organization assesses 
the c ontribution of their emplo yees toward the p rofit gained and compensate them.  
Martocchio (2013) further states that pay increases should be planned to compensate 
exceptional work by emp loyees and can motivate future performance . Moreover, 
employers can be assured of the retention of competent employees.  
 
Competency-related pay rewards : These rewards motivate  people to perform by 
paying them to reward specific desired performance (Armstrong, 2014).  
 
Suggestion systems: According to Swanepoel (2014:75), these are   regarded as a 
suggestion system as a motivation structure that recognizes the individual for 
contribution to the organisation values and increasing organizational effectiveness. 
Research conducted by Singh (2012 ) on the performance management and 
development system for senior managers in the public service reveals that management 
in public service organizations do not have individual goals that link to the organizational 
goals. Hence achieving organizational performance is often nebulous and ambiguous.
<<<PAGE=57>>>
44 
 
 
A study by Makamu (2013) on the application of performance management and  
development system at the Department of Education (Gauteng  North district)  shows 
that employees lack of t raining is one of the disadvantages of 0 Performance Appraisal 
in the Department. 
 
Organizational Values 
 
All organizations drive by clear goals and objectives specific to them. These goals serve 
as the big picture to remind all stakeho lders about the   organization’s existence, for 
possible achievement all stakeholders must contribute to strategic planning.   
 
2.21 The impact of training and development on organizational performance 
 
Employee training and development is a factor that dr ives the achievement of increased 
employee competency in order to improve good performance fo r the company (Tamba 
and Riyanto 2020: 9) . It play s a significant role in enhancing employees ’ performance 
and increases productivity  (Tamba and  Riyanto 2020: 9) . More importantly , employee 
training and development  increases skills , avoid skill uselessness , knowl edge, and 
dedication from experience in work  thereby results in organizational effectiveness 
(Sheeba and Christopher 2019: 263; Tamba and Riyanto 2020: 9). 
Effective employee training and development leads to an inc rease in quality good s and 
services as a result of potentially fewer mistakes. As a result, accurateness, 
effectiveness, good work, safe ty practices and good customer service can be expected  
(Salah 2016: 45) . It enables o rganizations to save mone y by retaining valuable 
employees, hence the costs of recruitment and tr aining of new entrants can be avoided 
due to lower levels of employees turnov er (Salah 2016: 45) .Training and development 
also result to higher job satis faction, commitment to the  organization and reduced 
revenue intention (Guan and Frenkel 2019: 164). It also increases productivity, flexibility 
and quality,  thereby lifting performance  thus contributes to improvements in  individual 
and organizational performance (Guan and Frenkel 2019: 164).

Training and development also assist in building an d strengthening the work-related 
attributes of the human resource (workers or employees) in any organization. Moreover, 
in training there is a specialist who delivers the understanding about the expertise 
required for enhancing the job  proficiency keeping in view both present and future job-
related skill requirements (Saleem e t al., 2011). Hence, we may say that Traini ng and 
Development is a more reasonable and organized way of improving the skills, 
knowledge and attributes necessary fo r th e employees  to be tter fulfill their job tasks  
Imran and Tanveer;2015;24 
For organizations to remain relevant, professional training  of employees and managers 
should be done frequently to respond to global change. Providing employees with 
relevant and updated working tools assist to improve their performance, satisfaction and 
attract retention and improve. Therefore, organizations can o nly maximize their 
performance if competent employees are employed  to carry out the daily processes of 
the business  (Ogbari, Oke, Ajagbe and  Isiavwe, 2015; Solomon, Hashim, Mehdi and 
Ajagbe, 2012). The survey suggested that all municipalities must have a c ode of 
conduct which must be complied with by all stakeholders and employees. Organizations 
should in addition  ensure the unfailing application of appropriate actions necessary 
when the code of conduct is violated. 
 
2.22 Chapter summary 
 
The aim of this chapter was to outline the literature relevant to training and development 
and organi sational performance management. Employees in any organisa tion remain 
the most effective asset for growth and development. Literature confirms that Training 
and Development plays a vital role in employee  and organizational growth. These lead 
to better and improved performance. Chapter Three will cover the research design and 
methodology.

CHAPTER 3 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
 
 
3.1 Introduction 
 
Chapter Two was based on the literature review and relate d to each variable . This 
chapter proceeds by unfolding the research methodology used . The sampling method, 
the study design and population are defined. The instrument used  to analyze the d ata 
collected, together with methods used to conserve the validity and reliability of the tool 
are illustrated. 
 
3.2 Research Design 
 
Babbie and  Mouton (2009: 74)  define research desi gn as  a strategy to conduct the 
study and to identify the relevant method ology of the particular study.  This study 
adopted a quantitative method ology and closed-ended questionnaire containing a 5 -
Point Likert Scale. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was utilized 
to assess the data collected. The population size of this study was 110 employees from 
Ndwedwe Local Municipality. For the sample , 90 employees were utilized, and the 
sampling framework was the municipal payroll system. This approach has been chosen 
as an appropriate method based on the fact that quantitative results have improved and 
are now more positive and reliable than they were years ago.  
All participants were given a similar questionnaire. T his assists all participants to 
respond freely since confidentiality was guaranteed and participants remain 
anonymous. The quantitative method assists to report any formal hypotheses and other 
expectations that did not pan out  by other researchers. The safety of respondents is as 
crucial in quantitative analysis compare to qualitative study. The quantitative methods is 
often specific to collect and record data in a manner that make subject recognition more 
difficult.
<<<PAGE=60>>>
47 
 
3.3 Sources of Data  
 
The study was conducted at Ndwedwe Local Munic ipality (NLM)  within the Ilembe 
District Municipality  in the Kwa -Zulu Nat al Province (RSA). The Municipality has an 
average of 110 employees consisting of senior managers as determined by section 56 
of the Municipal Systems Act, 32 of 2000 (MSA), Contractual and permanent 
employees. It caters for service delivery , including inf rastructure and Economic 
development; community and social services; financial services and corporate services. 
 
The researcher utilizes both sources of data collection methods, which includes primary 
and secondary sources. The primary data was collected through the distribution of pre -
coded questionnaires to the nominated sample. On other hand, the secondary data was 
gathered from already existing data in  existing muni cipal documents,  journal articles , 
reports, government publications and periodicals. 
 
3.4 Primary Data 
 
 
Primary data refers to the researcher’s thorough gathering of data on related variables, 
for the intention of achieving positive purposes of the resear ch s tudy (Brynar d, 
Hanekom and Brynard, 2014:33).  Distribution of questionnaires and conducting 
interviews are characteristic methods of collecting primary data. Questionnaire , in the  
form of the Likert scale were utilized to collect primary data in the study. 
 
 
3.5 Secondary Data 
 
Brynard, Hanekom and Brynard (2014:33) describe secondary data  as a met hod of 
gathering data from sources that already exist. Dan (2012:122) affirmed secondary data 
as information collected by any individual for a specific aim of the study. The data were 
gathered from textbooks, the Internet, published journal articl es, reports, government 
publications, and legislations.
<<<PAGE=61>>>

3.6 The Study Population  
 
Duncan (1996:133)  defines the population as the large pool from which sampling 
elements are drawn, and to which one wants to generalize findings. The study focused 
on the L ocal Government sphere. Due to the breadth  of Local Government, Ndwedwe 
Local Municipality was used as a sample. The NLM consist s of 110 employees, which 
includes management, permanent and contractual employees. 
 
Target Population 
  
Carrie and Kelvin (2014:33) define a target population as a group of p eople or objects 
with a  recognizable edge, involving the accurate  or exact features. Cooper and 
Schindler (2014: 84) concur with Carrie and Kelvin (2014:33), highlighting that a crucial 
point in drafting the r esearch project is to categorize the target pop ulation and choose 
whether a sample or a survey is desired. When nominating the sample those individual 
should be releva nt t o add value on a study and be able to provide the accurate 
information to validate the study.  
 
3.7 Sample and Technique Used 
 
Sekeran and Bougie (2013:241 ) define a sample as the sub -group or sub -set of the 
population. According to Wright and Ogbuehi (2014: 41), w hen deciding on the type of 
sampling method, researchers must also consider and deal with resource constraints 
such as time, budget and human resources. Thus, the decision on the type of sampling 
method applied in this  study needed to be well -thought out, bot h in terms of benefits 
and risks. The target population comprised 90 empl oyees based in various sections of 
the NLM. Questionnaires were delivered using emails and some were hand -delivered to 
respondents. The researcher requested them to be  completed and t o be contacted on 
completion for pick-up. Ninety employees returned their completed questionnaires to the 
researcher, where the actual response rate was 100%.
<<<PAGE=62>>>
49 
 
3.7.1 Convenience sampling 
 
Babbie (2009:74) emphasized that by choosing a sampling technique, the r esearcher 
indicates that the selection of a sample  defines the technique utilized to identify the 
sample from targeted population. The study had a target population N=110 and sample 
size of (n=90) as was recommended by Sekaran’s (1992) computed table of sa mple 
sizes based on population sizes. 
Blumenstein (2015: 28) postula tes that a sample is an element of analysis selected to 
partake in a particular study because it represents the population . Employees used as 
the sample of this survey consist of senior management. Management are the decision-
makers who propose the development of Municipal policies. They are at the forefront of 
municipality operations and lead the performance of the municipality. 
 
 
3.8 Quantitative Research Method 
 
Crisan a nd Borza (20 15: 3 8) and Magruk (2015: 234) indicate that selecting relevant 
research methodologies to engage in a documented research activity involves not only 
complex documentation, but also calls for instruments and methods that can better 
present a nd m easure the s tudied phenomenon. The intention of the research 
methodology is to afford the structure and support for ensuring planning and operational 
activities that continue after the application procedure of technical processes (Crisan 
and Borza, 201 5: 3 8; Magruk, 2 015: 234). The study implemented the quantitative 
methodology whereby questionnaire was distributed to target respondents.  
 
 
Johnson (2015: 262) describes that quantitative methodology as an empirical process of 
testing the theoretically grounded hypotheses ar e tested in line with statistically 
measured variables and some form of numerical analysis. However, Blumenstein (2015: 
25) believes that the ability to interpret data and apply numerical evidence 
systematically is central in science. In a similar fas hion, Buckley (2015: 17) indicates 
that quantitative analysis techniques  with statistical controls are utilised to analy se data 
in a quantitative study. In a quantitative case, Raich et al . (2014: 738) reveal that
<<<PAGE=63>>>
50 
 
considering the regularity of replies or collecting concepts, may assist researchers to do 
statistics. This study takes the quantitative approach whereby question naires were 
distributed to  a sample group and were  analyzed through SPSS used as a tool to  
analyze data.  
 
3.8.1 Advantages of the quantitative approach 
 
The Quantitative method has  advantages since this meth od contains standardized 
answers in research ins truments that make it easier to attempt each question. 
Questionnaires permit  respondents enough time to consider answers  before 
responding. 
 
3.8.2 Disadvantages of the quantitative approach 
 
The participants may tend to have discomfort in providing the correct information, since 
it is just a pre-coded questionnaire where they tend to tick without understanding the 
question. They might feel  as n o reason to give the accurate answer since the 
questionnaire are standardized and not allow any additional informat ion. To overcome 
such, the researcher has made a provision for respondents to ask for clarity  when 
necessary. 
 
3.9 Pilot Study  
 
A pilot study helps researchers to anticipate possible areas of ambiguity or challenges 
that the sample may face while being pa rt of a study (Walliman, 2011). Questionnaires 
were distributed to four  respondents allocated at Ndwedwe Local Municipal ity Main 
Offices to test the ambiguity. A meeting was conducted as per participants’ clusters and 
where the questionnaire was presented , the aim of the study and how crucial their 
contribution to the study was and how the Municipalit y will b enefit from the  study was 
explained. For instance, the need to revisit their human resources developmen t policy 
was highlighted.
<<<PAGE=64>>>
51 
 
3.10 Data Analysis 
 
Boeije (2010:76) describes data analysis as a process of organizing data in a 
meaningful manner and synthesizing data in order to discove r wha t is important to 
share with others in the form of findings. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(SPSS) Software was utilized to explore the data collected . T his software was more 
convenient for the study and displayed all the expected variables. Data was examined, 
categorized, tabulated and pre-coded questionnaire to define the research objectives 
and the research questions. Then it was presented in the form of detailed table s. The 
figures received were values corresponding  to frequencies and were changed into 
percentages to enable analysis.  
3.11 Reliability and Validity 
 
Clow and James (2014:272) state that in order for the measuring instrument  to be 
guaranteed as effective, it must be tested to confirm the validity.  The correlation among 
and reliability and validity is an essential to assess reliability. If results remain invalid, 
therefore reliability is not guaranteed. Therefore, when the results are not tested valid it 
proves that there is no point in considering the re liability since validity considered prior 
reliability is measured in any significant approach.  
 
3.11.1 Reliability 
 
Hair (2013:166) define reliability as the dependability with which a  mechanism 
processes the characteristic. Tavakol and Dennick (2011:53 -54) attest that for testing 
the reliability of the study, a Cronbach’s a lpha should utilize and that substances with a 
lesser total close to zero shall be  cancelled or reviewed. This study is therefore reliable 
in the sense that if the methods used in this study are to be used by another researcher 
it is most likely to obtain similar results
<<<PAGE=65>>>
52 
 
 
 
3.11.2 Validity 
 
Sekaran and Bougie (2013:225 ) define validity as the extent in which an instrument 
signifies the aspects of a study  and also pointed out that validi ty is the accuracy of the 
method utilised in collecting and analyzing the data. 
 
For th is study, v alidity was assured through the design  of the questionnaire; which 
comprised questions relating to training and development, employee performance, 
organisational performance in eN dwedwe local municipality. The approach applied in 
this study also ensured validity, which was through the use of a  quantitative approach, 
whereby, the researcher was able to determine the relationship between training and 
development and employee per formance. determining the relationships between the 
variables of the st udy. The researcher also employed  statistics to n umerically describe 
phenomena of study. More so, pilot testing was necessary to ensure both validity and 
reliability of the questionnaire.  
 
3.12 Anonymity and Ethical Considerations 
 
Anderson (2013:130) illustrates three fundamental principled values as the foundation 
for the study  research that are , admiration for integrity, individuals and consideration. 
The approval to cond uct study was obtained from the  Accounting Officer of Ndwedwe 
Local Municipality. Names and identities of the participants remain anonym ous. In this 
way, more accurate and true infor mation is obtained. Bia sed response s were  
eliminated, participants were requested to use  emails and direct communication to 
unfold the purpose of study. The researcher did not interfere or try to influence them  in 
their responses since the participants are highly professional and understand the 
process of research publication.  Participants were upraised that the study is voluntary 
and grant s them a right to withdr aw at any s tage. The recommendations will further  
contribute to knowledge in implem enting Human Resources Development policies and 
will be valuable in the upliftment of the socio-economic situation of South Africa.

recommended that the municipality should have incentive plans to rewards employee s 
for their outstanding performance. Performance Appraisal aims at establishing a great 
performance principle where employees take the initiative for the constant development 
(Armstrong 2006: 296). Performance Appraisal also encourages the growth of an 
organisation in service and quality products (Armstrong 2015: 296).

4.7 Limitations 
 
This is the combination of elements  that insufficiently be measured in the approach of 
the study and which cannot be considered for when analysing, inferring and simplifying 
the data. Quantitative data was co llected from Ndwedwe Municipality. The municipality 
is one among the four  local Municipalities un der Ilembe District Municipality. The 
research was not extended to o ther local municipalities. The reason for  focusing on  
Ndwedwe is again based on practical considerations by the researcher. Due to financial 
constraints, and human resources, the study was limited to the Ndwedwe Municipality. 
Limitations will not have a  negative impact on the f indings or conclusion. However , the 
findings and conclusion  of the st udy cannot be universal to all local municipalities . 
According to Walliman (2011: 43), in order for the study to be carried out successfully, a 
jurisdiction or location of the study needs to be clearly specified.

CHAPTER 5 
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
5.1 Introduction 
 
The aim of this  chapter is to determine the key results of the researc h and draw 
conclusions on the findings. As indicated in Chapter 1, the overall purpose of this study 
was to confirm the impact of training and development in the performance of the loc al 
government emp loyees. The study was motivated  by the observation  of t he huge 
budget allocated for skills development issues while the municipality experiences a lack 
in service delivery. The chapter contains the analysis of data and the recommendations 
emanated from the findings on Chapter Four. The recommendations of the whole study 
will be made and offered to the senior management of the Municipality.  
 
5.2 Analysis of Research Questions 
 
Question1: What is the relationship b etween training and develop ment and 
employee performance? 
Training is a  central tool for creating and im proving the skills and knowledge  of 
employees. Acquiring updated and relevant skills has a positive effect towards the 
individual performance (Botha et al., 2013: 4). Number of deficiencies in required skills 
tend to maximize the employee . Provision of relevant and relevant skills to employe es 
through capacity building has a significant part to show in assisting the organisations to 
keep esteemed and capable employees. 
 
The findings indicated that the Municipality prioritize s Investment in training. This was 
referenced by the respondents, 61% agreed. Islam et al. (2014: 399) point out that if the 
organization culture is suitable for em ployees to obtain new skills  employees turned to 
be more committe d t o accomplish organizational goals . Islam et al. (2014: 399) 
conducted a research on an individual’s perception concerning the principle of sharing 
knowledge and skills transfer in upliftin g the level of  an organization . Germain and
<<<PAGE=94>>>
81 
 
Grenier (2015: 380) state that determined and structured staff have a great influence in 
the organizations. It a duty  of facilitator to ge t an expectation from learners to ensure 
that he drives the program towards to accomplishment of those goals.  
 
Question 2: What are the  factors affecting training and development and 
employee Performance? 
The training is regarded as m ajor element for the improvement of  performance of 
individual and it can improve the performance of entire organization. It assists in closing 
the gap in  existing performance and future projected  performance. The av ailability of 
evaluation and monitoring p lan remains a factor in improvement of performance since  
the plan guides on what is expected from each part to improve the performance.  
 
 Performance Appraisal factor 
 
A vast 91% of respondents indicated that  the municipality does not have performance 
appraisal and incentive plans. H owever, 97.7% agreed that their performance 
contributed towards the effectiveness of the entire municipality, while 77% indicate that 
they do not understand  the processes of  how performa nce a ppraisal work s. It is 
recommended th at the municipality s hould have incentive plans to reward  employees 
for their performance. 
 
 Communication factor 
 
The findings indicate that the municipality d oes not effectively communicate  its goals 
and objectives to employees. It is referenced by 61% o f respondents who disagree that 
the employer communicates its goals and objectives.  An effective communication is a 
two-way communication where  one pas ses a mes sage to another and the other 
responds on what he thoug ht. N ewman and Newman (2015: 64) establish that 
organizations are highly sensitive places as they are dependent on employees.
<<<PAGE=95>>>
82 
 
Vandome and McVey  (2012:52) state that  communication ca n maintain the 
implementation of the policy  goals or the organization tr ansformation by notifying, 
supporting, inspiring, normalizing or coaching. Sethi and Adhikari (201 3:1) confirm that 
effective communicat ion is  fundamentally strategic to the accomplishment of 
organizational goals and objectives . For survival and sustainability in the industry, 
managers need to keep themselves abreast the latest developments in communication. 
 
Motivation factor 
 
Employees b ecome motivated if they are recognize d for their  excellent perfor mance. 
Amrik (2014:5) indicates that priority in training and development advance the staff self-
esteems and they turn to perform at required standards. A study conducted by Similarly, 
Madukoma, Akpa and Okafor (2014:804) proves that training and development used as 
a successful motivating tool to librarians in the University of Lagos to perfo rm thei r 
assigned duties. 
 
 A study conducted in the public sector of South Africa assessing the  performance 
matters in South Africa confirms that tra ining and develop ment is the most important 
tool to elevate the performance o f employees (Mafini and Pooe, 2013:1 -9), while the 
research efforts to observe the  attitude of employees in the public sector on th e 
complications encountered and their outcome on production, motivation was identified 
as a factor on service delivery . In this study, a majority 70% of responde nts indicated  
that the municipality does not enforce all mechanisms to motivate their employees. 
 
Human Resources Policy 
Policy plays a vital role as it serves as a guide on the role and responsibilities that must 
be performed by employers and employees. It is imperative for the municipality to have 
a sound HRD policy which informs individual expected performance and ensures proper 
implementation and monitoring at least annually to speak  to dynamic change s in local 
government. The Corporate Services Department as a custodian of policies shall ensure
<<<PAGE=96>>>
83 
 
that employees are consulted through their organiz ed labor (Local Labour Forum (LLF)) 
when developing policies. 
 
Question 3: What is the relationship between tr aining and  development and 
organizational performance? 
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996) brought new extended functions 
in Local Government. According to the Department of Provincial and Local Government 
(2014:350), Municipalities  should be now in the forefront and uplift local econom ic 
development, establishment sustainable jobs  and training develops of new skills, 
improves employee performance and organizational efficiency. 
 
The conclusion of this study indicates that training and development have a motivating 
influence on the desired individual outcome and organizational efficiency. This affiliation 
endured, confirmed by the analysis of data collected from sample s which fo und that 
individual efficiency has a direct impact and conclude  relationship with employee 
performance and training and development. 
 
5.3. Recommendations on Training and Development  
 
A significant  69 % of r espondents indicate d that the municipality does not have a 
training and development policy that guides the implementation and monitoring of skills.  
Policy provides a guide to both parties (employees and employer) and indicates what is 
required from each party. 
 
It is reco mmended for the municipality to draft a Training and Development Policy and 
Personal Development Plan which will serve as a guide on the implementation of skills. 
 
It is recommended tha t the municipality conduct skills survey s annually to ensure that 
training addresses the needs of empl oyees and the ent ire organization. According to 
Enojo et al . (2015:1-22), the training and development of staff w ithout assessing thei r 
needs is a critical problem. Competent employees perform better and save  equipment
<<<PAGE=97>>>
84 
 
and reduce unnecessary accidents in t he workplace. Training should be aligned to 
individual needs as identifi ed on the personal Development Plan.  Skills Audit is a most 
important exercise to which employers should pay attention. 
 
In a condition where growth lacks, employees require training even further to perform at 
optional levels. The municipality should develop a strategy which will nurture knowledge 
management and skills transfer. Zwick (2015:136-150) supports the outcome compare 
to the dura tion of training and its financial cost. Management should  full, support the 
implementation of skills development.  
 
5.4 Recommendations on Employee Performance 
 
Over half (58%) of the respondents stated that the Personal Development P lan (PDP) 
was designed to improve individual performance. This indica tes that employees clearly 
understand the significance of Personal Devel opment Plans as a tool to identify training 
needs analysis, which is informed by a skills audit; 57% of respondents indicate that the 
working environment is suitable to allow employee to perform up to  their maximum  
levels. Training and development is the key to  maximizing individual performance. 
Robson and Mavin (201 4: 557) state that that managers  fail to allocate funding 
responsible for training and development to show their concern about the skills acquired 
during training. 
 
The performance management process should be treated as Performance di scipline to 
allow employees to perform at their maximum levels . PM should be linked to individu al 
PDPs. Employer s must ensure that  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are reviewed 
and employee sign the job description  which serves as a guide on what is expec ted 
from them. Employers should capacitate employees to be given enough time to practice 
what is expected from them. The municipality has a dut y to identify those categories of 
positions experiencing high level of turnover and to formulate a plan to retain competent 
staff. This must appear in the municipal human resources strategy and be informed by  
the performance management plan. I t assists the municipality in succession planning.
<<<PAGE=98>>>
85 
 
The following is important to reta in and attract staff , namely: salary and conditions of 
service, career development, pleasant work environment, management sty le, provision 
of resources, empowerment of employees, optim al utilization an d p roper 
communication. 
 
5.5 Recommendations on Organizational Performance 
 
A majority ( 97.7%) o f respondents indicat ed that their  performance and commitment 
contribute to institution al effectiveness. Organizations become global competitiv e. 
Human Resource s plays a role in evaluating the individual performance  as a  tool for  
development and is not punitive. 
The Municipality must invest on  significance on knowledge and skills developm ent in 
their strategic planning  in order to respond to  global transformation and to satisfy the 
community’s need.  
 
It is recommended that organizations shall invest in employees as valuable assets of an 
organization by developing Human Resources strategy which will talk to the succession 
planning, skills transfer and skills retention. 
 
The management should create a mechanism whereby  those employees who have 
acquired skills be recognized for upward mobility and be able to share the knowledge 
gained.  
 
The municipality must continuously present the goals and missio n of the municipality to 
ensure every employee  has a full understand of what is expected from them in their 
space. The municipality mu st be able to respond on w hat the organization achieved  in 
each quarter.  According to Ku rtulmus and Warner (2015: 741), Organisational 
performance evaluation can be a major most powerful tool at management’s disposal to 
the profitability of effective approach execution.
<<<PAGE=99>>>
86 
 
Management should ensure that the organization promote s the upward mobility of all 
employees. This can be  in a manner of p romotion, succession planning and skills 
transfer. 
 
5.6 Contribution of the Study 
 
The study will contribute to the body of knowledge and serves as a future guide to other 
researchers of simi lar studies. It will further  support decision-makers to recognize the 
importance and effect of training and development on the performance of employees  
and the e ntire organization , w hich finally impacts on the service delivery and 
accomplishment of business goals and objectives. The study findings will moreover add 
value to the current body of knowledge. Other researchers will enable make contrasts of 
the outcomes with this study’s re sults, thereby improving knowledge on this field of 
study.  
 
5.7 Direction for Further Research  
 
Since the study only took place at a Local m unicipality in the  public sector , it is 
recommended that research in other non-governmental institutions on the to pic should 
be conducted . It is suggested that upcoming studies should focus on  assessing the 
management and th eir role  on how they award em ployees for their exceptional 
performance, and incentive plans as performance appraisals . The study may be based 
on promotions within the organization in returns of development in certain ski lls 
acquired by employees . The target for the st udy must be emplo yees in the supervisory 
levels. The main purpose  for influences for a n upcoming study is that 98 % of the 
respondents recognized that their performance has a huge impact in the organization to 
uplift the performance , while the municipality  does not have Pe rformance Evaluation 
Plans.

5.8 Conclusion 
 
The foremost aim of this Chapter, Chapter Five, was to discuss the findings of this study 
in conjunction with the literature reviewed. Findings were then compared and related to 
those of  other scholars in th e f ield of management sciences who investigated similar  
concepts and subjects.  The study recomme nded the proper implementation of 
Performance management systems linked to appropriate individ ual performance 
development plans . This study wil l assist managers  to prioritize investment s in the 
training and dev elopment o f employees  for the municipality  to reach and face global  
transformation.
