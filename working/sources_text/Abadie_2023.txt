Abstract
Business/policy decisions are often based on evidence from randomized experiments
and observational studies. In this article we propose an empirical framework to estimate
the value of evidence-based decision making (EBDM) and the return on the investment
in statistical precision.
1. Introduction
Many organizations use randomized experiments and observational studies to improve their
decision making. For example, Gupta et al. (2019) write “Together [Airbnb, Amazon, Book-
ing.com, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Uber, Yandex, and
Stanford University] have tested more than one hundred thousand experiment treatments
last year.” The fact that so many organizations conduct so many experiments suggests that
data evidence provides a value for guiding business/policy decisions. However, we are un-
aware of the existence of empirical tools that organizations can use to assess the value of
their EBDM practices. In the absence of such tools, it is difficult to assess whether too much
experimentation is being done, or too little, whether experiments are too large or too small,
and whether the right experiments are done. Part of the challenge in evaluating the value of
EBDM is that it requires a description of the role of evidence in the business/policy decision
We are grateful to Brad Efron for making a subset of the Cochrane data available to us.

process. In other words, it requires assumptions on what organizations will do with and
without various amounts of evidence that they can choose to generate at some cost.
In this article, we propose an empirical Bayes estimator of the value of EBDM. We study
the problem of a decision maker deciding whether to adopt a particular policy intervention.
We use the term “agent” to refer to the decision maker, and “policy”, “intervention” and
“treatment” interchangeably to refer to the policy intervention under scrutiny. The agent
can implement the intervention based on prior information or gather additional information
at some cost, for example, by running an experimental or observational evaluation of the
effect of the intervention. At the stage where the decision maker decides to implement the
intervention or not, she does so to maximize her utility given the available information. We
derive expressions for the value of the additional information and show how to estimate this
value using meta data on estimates of the effects of business/policy interventions and their
standard errors.
Our framework allows decision makers to assess the value of experimental and nonex-
perimental studies, and how this value changes with the precision of the studies. Currently,
many organizations decide on the precision of their studies based on power calculations,
which do not take into account the cost and benefits of EBDM.
2. The value of EBDM
We use the notationX „pθ, σ2qto indicate that the random variableX has mean θ and vari-
ance σ2. We use X „Npθ, σ2qto indicate that the distribution of X is Gaussian with mean
and variance pθ, σ2q. We use fXp¨qfor the density of a random variable, X, and fX|W p¨|wq
for the conditional density of X given W “ w. ϕp¨q and Φp¨q are the probability density
function and the cumulative distribution function of the standard Gaussian distribution.
2.1. Setup
Consider the problem of a decision maker who has to choose whether to adopt a particular
policy on a population of units. The per-unit payoff of the policy, τ, follows a distribution
with probability density function fτ p¨q and mean µ. We assume that the agent has risk-
2
<<<PAGE=3>>>
neutral preferences. As a result, in the absence of additional information, the agent launches
the policy as long as the expected payoff from launching is positive,
µ ´cL ą0,
where cL is the cost of launching per-unit. The expected value of this decision is max tµ ´
cL, 0u.
Suppose, however, that the agent can choose to obtain additional information on the
policy payoff, at some cost. In particular, the agent can obtain a signal, pτ, with distribution
pτ |τ „Npτ, σ2q, (1)
at cost cF `cpσ2q, with cF ě0, cp¨q ě0 and c1p¨q ď0. This aspect of the model aims to
capture information obtained from studies that estimate policy effects based on experimen-
tal or observational data. The constant cF reflects the fixed cost of a data-driven policy
evaluation, and the function cp¨qmeasures the costs of precision, which depends in part on
the sample size of the study. The restriction on the derivative of cp¨qconveys the notion that
more precise information is weakly more costly.
The Gaussianity assumption on the distribution of pτ |τ is motivated by approximate
Gaussianity of the large sample distributions of many commonly used estimators of treatment
effects. After observing the signal pτ, the expected payoff of the policy is

.
In this case, the agent launches the policy if
Erτ|pτs´ cL ą0.
For any scalar, x, let Ip0,8qpxqbe the function that takes value one if x is greater than
zero and value zero otherwise. The expected payoff with EBDM is

Let
V p8q“ maxtµ ´cL, 0u,
which is the expected payoff under no additional information besides the information in the
distribution of τ. Because max tx, 0uis a convex function of x, Jensen’s Inequality implies,
V pσ2qě maxtµ ´cL, 0u“ V p8q.
The value of EBDM is the difference in expected payoffs V pσ2qand V p8q, which is nonneg-
ative, minus the cost of acquiring the information, which is generally positive:
VoEpσ2q“ V pσ2q´ V p8q´p cF `cpσ2qq.
A second version of VoE, which we term VoID is obtained when, in the absence of additional
information about the effect of the intervention, the intervention is always deployed:
VoIDpσ2q“ V pσ2q´p µ ´cLq´p cF `cpσ2qq.
VoIDpσ2qis motivated by settings with ex-ante (pre-evaluation) ambiguity on the distribution
of τ, and agents who have a bias for action in the presence of such ambiguity.
2.2. A motivating example
A common instance of the setting described above is one where the decision maker obtains
experimental evidence on the effect of the policy. Consider an experiment with N units:
i “1, . . . , N. The experimenter assigns N1 units at random to treatment and the remaining
N0 “N ´N1 to control. If unit i is treated, an outcome is drawn
Yip1q„p θ1, σ2
1q.
4
<<<PAGE=5>>>
If unit i is untreated, the outcome is drawn
Yip0q„p θ0, σ2
0q.
Let Wi be an indicator of treatment for unit i. We observe Yi “Yip1qWi `Yip0qp1 ´Wiq.
The average effect of the treatment is
τ “θ1 ´θ0.
A simple estimator of τ is the difference in mean outcomes between treated and nontreated,
ˆτ “ 1

Then, for large N0 and N1, equation (1) holds approximately, with

In some settings, researchers favor treatment effect parameters free of units of measure-

2.3. A Gaussian distribution forτ
In this section, we obtain simple closed-form formulas for the case when the distribution of
τ can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution,
τ „Npµ, γ2q. (2)
5
<<<PAGE=6>>>
While equation (1) is supported by the Central Limit Theorem for large sample studies,
equation (2) imposes two important restrictions. First, τ is Gaussian. Second, this distribu-
tion is independent of σ2. The first is a strong parametric restriction. Gaussianity of τ could
be a suitable approximation in some settings, but not in others. The second restriction could
be violated, for example, if experimenters have some additional information about τ for each
treatment, and adapt the power of their experimental or observational studies accordingly
through the choice of sample size. We dispose of these two restrictions later in the article.
We adopt them in this section, however, to obtain closed-form formulas for the value of
EBDM.
If equations (1) and (2) hold, the marginal distribution of pτ is pτ „Npµ, γ2 `σ2q. The
posterior for τ is given by
τ |pτ „N
ˆµ{γ2 `ˆτ{σ2
1{γ2 `1{σ2 , 1

The expected payoff with EBDM is

Let

Recall that the marginal distribution of pτ is Gaussian with mean µ and variance γ2 `σ2. As
a result,

V pσ2qis decreasing in σ2 and increasing in γ2 (see appendix). This conforms to our intuition
that higher precision of the signal pτ|τ and higher uncertainty regarding τ increase the payoff
from EBDM.

As σ2 Ñ8, we lose any additional information about the value of τ beyond its distribution,
and V pσ2q converges to V p8q. As σ2 Ñ 0, we learn the value of τ. In this case, V pσ2q
converges to Ermaxtτ ´cL, 0us, the mean of the distribution of τ ´cL censored at zero.
So far, we have treated σ2 as a constant. We now allow σ2 to have a non-degenerate
distribution, independent of τ. In this case, the average payoff of EBDM is

2.4. A Gaussian mixture distribution forτ

τ follows a mixture of k Gaussian distributions with parameters pµ1, γ2

3. Empirical Bayes estimation
In this section, we consider a setting with multiple realizations from the distribution of
pτ, σ,pτ, pσq, where only pτ and pσ are observed. In this setting, ppτ, pσq are estimates and the
corresponding standard errors for a set of policy evaluations in the data set. We consider
the homoskedastic case, with σ2 constant, and the heteroskedastic case with var pσ2q ą0.
In all our calculations we approximate the per-unit launch cost as cL «0. Alternatively we
can think of the τ as capturing the net benefits of the treatment after taking out the launch
cost.
We illustrate these calculations using a subset of the Cochrane database (Cochrane Col-
laboration, 2002; Starr et al., 2009) containing information on 8821 randomized experiments.
For each experiment we observe the point estimate, pτ, as well as the standard error of pτ,
which can be seen as an estimate of σ. We use the Cochrane dataset as a benchmark, with-
out attempting to interpret the magnitude or direction of the resulting estimates. Figure
1 shows the distribution of pτ across the experiments in the dataset. The average value of
pτ is ´0.1421 with range r´8.4763, 7.1663s. Standard errors have mean 0 .7471 and range
r0.0099, 2.1232s.

<<<PAGE=9>>>
3.1. Parametric empirical Bayes
In this section, we adopt a Gaussian specification for the distribution of τ. Because pτ is
unbiased, we can estimate µ—the mean of the distribution of τ—as the mean of pτ across
evaluations. To estimate γ2—the variance of the distribution of τ—we deconvolute the
distribution of pτ as follows. By the Total Law of Variance,
varppτq“ Ervarppτ|τqs` varpErpτ|τsq.
Unbiasedness of pτ conditional on τ implies
γ2 “varpτq
“varpErpτ|τsq
“varppτq´ Ervarppτ|τqs.
As a result, we define pγ2 as the difference between the variance pτ across experiments in the
data minus the mean of the squares of the standard errors. This estimator is not guaranteed
to be positive. In the Cochrane dataset, pγ2 “1.6677 ´0.7641 “0.9036.
3.1.1. Homoskedastic case
For the homoskedastic case, we estimate σ2 as the average of the squares of the standard
deviations of pτ across studies. In the Cochrane data, this estimate is 0.7641. Plugging in
this value in (4) along with estimates of µ and γ2, we obtain V p0.7641q“ 0.2138.
3.1.2. Heteroskedastic case
We now relax the assumption that σ2 is constant. It can be shown (see appendix) that
V pσ2qis convex. Then, by Jensen’s Inequality, V pErσ2sq ďErV pσ2qs. This result implies
that the assumption of homoskedasticity may lead to underestimation of the average payoff
when σ2 is not constant. Under heteroskedasticity, we evaluate the expression in (5) plugging
in study-specific estimates of σ2. Relative to the calculations in the previous section, now
the value of experimentation is computed for each value of σ2 and then integrated over the
distribution of σ2. An estimator of V based on a set of policy estimates can be calculated
9
<<<PAGE=10>>>
in two steps: (i) use the square of the standard error of pτ to approximate σ2, and estimate
the value of each study separately, and (ii) take the average over all studies in the sample.
Doing this for the Cochrane data, we obtain V “0.2351.
3.2. Nonparametric empirical Bayes
We now relax the parametric restriction τ „Npµ, γ2qof section 3.1 and consider a nonpara-
metric distribution.
3.2.1. Homoskedastic case
Suppose we have τ{σ|σ „Gσ, where Gσ is some unspecified distribution. Then,
pτ{σ

Therefore, the marginal density of pτ{σ is

Koenker and Mizera (2014) propose an algorithm to solve (7) based on convex optimization
procedures. For the Cocharne data set, using the standard errors of the estimates to approx-
imate σ1, . . . , σn and the algorithm in Koenker and Mizera (2014) to estimate G, we obtain
the estimate pV “0.2226.
3.2.2. Heteroskedastic case
We relax the strong assumption that τ{σ is independent of σ by dividing the support of σ
into 5 intervals and doing the NPEB calculations of the previous section interval by interval.
Applying this method to the Cochrane data set, we obtain the estimate pV “0.2897.
4. Simulations
We consider two data generating processes (DGP). In DGP1, the parameters τ have a
standard Gaussian distribution τ „ Np0, 1q, so the parametric empirical Bayes model of
section 2.3 applies. In DGP2, the parameters τ follow the mixture distribution as in section
11

DGP1 and DGP2 both produce a distribution of τ with mean zero and variance one. We
generate pτ as pτ “ τ `σu, where u is independent standard Gaussian and σ “ 0.1. To
calculate the expected payoff of EBDM, we consider the case of cL “0.
We run 1000 simulations for DGP1 and DGP2 with n “500. Equation (4) with µ “0,
γ2 “ 1, σ “ 0.1, and cL “ 0 gives the true expected payoff of EBDM under DGP1. To
calculate the true expected payoff of EBDM under DGP2, we first use equation (6) to
compute Erτ|pτsover the n ˆ1000 “500, 000 realizations of pτ in the simulations, and report
the average of max tErτ|pτs, 0u. In each of the simulations, we calculate parametric and
nonparametric empirical Bayes estimates of the average payoff of EBDM. The parametric
empirical Bayes estimator is the sample analog of equation (5). This estimator is valid
only under the assumption that the true distribution of τ is Gaussian. The nonparametric
empirical Bayes estimator is as in section 3.2.1. For the simulations in this section, we treat
σ as known.
Table 1 reports the true values of the expected payoff of EBDM along with means and
95% intervals for the distribution of the estimates across simulations. When the distribution
of τ is Gaussian, the distribution of the parametric and nonparametric empirical Bayes
estimates across simulations are both centered at the true value of the expected EBDM
payoff. Moreover, there is no evidence of substantial gains from knowledge of the parametric
form of the distribution of τ. The 95% interval for the nonparametric estimator is only 1.1%
wider than the interval for the parametric estimator.
For the case when the distribution of τ is a mixture, the results for parametric estimator
reveal a clear bias, while the distribution of the nonparametric estimator remains centered
at the true value of the expected payoff. Moreover, the 95% interval for the nonparametric
estimator is 30.1% narrower than the interval for the parametric estimator.

5. Application to the Cochrane dataset
Table 2 collects parametric and nonparametric empirical Bayes estimates of the value of
EBDM in the Cochrane data. For the parametric case, Table 2 reports estimates computed
under heteroskedasticity. For the nonparametric case, Table 2 reports estimates computed
under homoskedasticity (var pσ2q “0) and under heteroskedasticity (var pσ2q ą0). Below
each of the estimates of the value of EBDM, Table 2 reports 95% intervals computed over
1000 bootstrap draws from the distribution of ppτ, pσ2q in the data. In our calculations, we
impose cL `cF `cpσ2q“ 0. The average value of pτ across experiments in the Cochrane data
is -0.1421 and the variance of pτ across experiments is 1.6677. Because pτ has a negative mean
and a variance that is large relative to the mean, this is a setting where we expect to have
substantial gains from EBDM. Indeed, both the parametric and the nonparametric empirical
Bayes estimates show positive values of about twice the magnitude of pµ. For this applica-
tion, parametric empirical Bayes and nonparametric empirical Bayes under homoskedasticity
produce similar estimates. Allowing for heteroskedasticity decreases the magnitudes of non-
parametric empirical Bayes estimates by 7.7% for the case of VoE and 4.7 for the case of
VoID.

<<<PAGE=14>>>
6. Estimation of counterfactual EBDM values
This section provides estimates of the value of EBDM under alternative levels of statistical
precision. That is, we estimate how the value of EBDM would change as a result of a change
in σ2. In the resulting counterfactuals, the variance of the estimators is equal to the variance
estimates for pτ1, . . . ,pτn in the original sample multiplied by λ. That is, λ “0.5 represents
a counterfactual scenario where the variances of the estimators are 50% smaller than the
variance estimates in the original sample, while for λ “1.5 the variances of the estimators
are 50% larger than in the original sample.
For simplicity, we consider only counterfactual scenarios such that τ is independent of
estimation variance, σ2, and estimate the value of EBDM using the parametric empirical
Bayes estimator of section 3.1. It is conceptually straightforward to extend our procedure
to more general settings (e.g., by modeling the dependence between τ and σ2 and/or using
nonparametric empirical Bayes estimators).
For each estimate, i “1, . . . , n, in our sample we draw a value from the empirical Bayes
estimate of the distribution of τ. Let τ˚
1 , . . . , τ˚
n be the resulting values for the draws. Next,
for i “1, . . . , n, we obtain pτ˚
i “τ˚

i Ui, where U1, . . . , Un are independent draws from the
standard Gaussian distribution, andσ˚

?
λpσi. We use the new sampleppτ˚
1 , pσ˚
1 q, . . . ,ppτ˚

to compute an estimate of the value of EBDM. We repeat this procedure multiple times to
obtain the distribution of EBDM-value estimates for a particular value of λ. The average of
this distribution is our estimate of the value of EBDM under variance modification factor λ.
For the parametric empirical Bayes case, this average can also be computed directly using a
empirical counterpart of equation (5) that applies the variance modification factor λ to σ2.
Figure 2 reports the results obtained from applying the procedure describe above to the
Cochrane data. The solid line represents the value of EBDM as a function of the variance
modification factor, λ. The shaded area represents 95% intervals from the distribution of
EBDM estimates. An investment that reduces estimation variance by half (about a 29.3%
decrease in standard errors) leads to an increase in the value of EBDM by 11.6%, from 0.2351
to 0.2623. Conversely, an increase in estimation variance by half (about a 22.5% increase in
