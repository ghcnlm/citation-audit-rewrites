Competence, much like beauty and contact
lenses, lies in the eyes of the beholder.
— Laurence J. Peter
It was just 2 weeks into my intensive
care unit (ICU) rotation, and I was
already preparing to witness my third
family meeting. However, this time, my
senior resident wanted me to lead the
discussion as opposed to merely observing it.
I had been an intern for 2 months, so I
considered myself a relative novice.
However, I was seasoned enough to know
that a “real-life” family meeting was noth-
ing like the standardized ones I had mas-
tered as a student. In an actual ICU, a
patient’s illness was less straightforward
than a textbook. The SPIKES protocol
(Setting Up, Perception, Invitation,
Knowledge, Emotions, Summarize) I had
religiously memorized was barely enough
when emotions ran high. And the nature
of conversations was more unpredictable
than any standardized test I had taken.
Instances like these struck me as unique to
the ICU. Years of attempting buzzword-
laden clinical vignettes in medical school
created a deceptive sense of security. Now,
as a trainee, every clinical encounter in the
ICU required me to step outside my com-
fort zone. Ironically, none of those high-
stakes assessments as a medical student
tested my ability to adapt to such chal-
lenges. Based on the evaluations, feedback,
and scores I had received over the years,
I knew I was deemed“competent.” But
the real question was,“Am I capable?”
COMPETENCY-BASED MEDICAL
EDUCATION: PEARLS AND PITFALLS
Competency-based medical education
(CBME) marks a strategic change within
health professions education. It links
learner knowledge and skill acquisition to
demonstrable outcomes, thereby
upholding medical education’s
accountability to society (1). By focusing

on outcomes, it deemphasizes
time-based training and promotes learner
centeredness (2).
Within the United States, the six core
competencies of the Accreditation of
Graduate Medical Education introduced
in 1998 and refined in 2003 to
incorporate milestones (3, 4) provide a
methodical framework for the professional
growth of trainees like me. CBME’s focus
on outcomes to ensure accountability to
patients makes intuitive sense and focuses
not solely on trainees but also on faculty
and policy makers alike. Trainee
development and wellness, transparency of
competency attainment, societal
accountability, and patient safety are a
few of the factors outlining a strong value
proposition for CBME (5).
Working up a patient’s anemia, managing
alcohol withdrawal, or interpreting an
arterial blood gas test result— each of
these examples represents a discrete
outcome expected of a trainee. Although
these outcomes may have differing levels
of complexity, set standards aimed at
ensuring proficiency among medical
graduates can ensure patients are cared
for in a manner that at least meets the
accepted standard of care.
For all their merits, competencies
unfortunately come with their own set of
caveats.
First, it is known that competency
assessments for graduates and expert
doctors are not reflective of the complex
nature of the individual patient encounter
(6). This has led to tensions created by
competing interests between measurable,
standardized outcomes on one hand and
authentic representation of the everyday
real world of health care on the other (7).
For instance, demonstrating skills or
knowledge in a standardized and well-
controlled environment may not translate
into an environment like the ICU that is
more dynamic and complex. A patient’s
complicated course often necessitates
evidence-based interventions amid a fair
degree of uncertainty. Family meetings
like the one I was preparing to lead
require one to synthesize medical judge-
ment and decisions in the best possible
manner for the patient and their family.
No matter how well constructed, it is
unlikely for a clinical vignette or simula-
tion exercise to mirror this degree of
complexity.
The focus on competencies also provides a
unique challenge when it comes to the
social determinants of health (SDOH)
curricula across medical schools. Although
well intentioned with respect to addressing
inequities, many of these often reinforce
stereotypes (8). Thus, as an intern, I
noticed myself falling into biases I had
been exposed to (often in case vignettes).
Although checking the competency boxes
here may help address SDOH, it can
occasionally serve as not only insufficient
but also contrary to the aims of any
SDOH curriculum to begin with.
Indeed, competence is not something one
can attain once and for all; there will
always be another context or occasion
that necessitates reassessment. This is
evident within the complex and
unpredictable environment of an ICU,
thus requiring a more dynamic approach
to guide learning, as well as assessment.
TOWARD A CAPABILITY-BASED
MEDICAL EDUCATION
Capability refers to having justified
confidence in one’s ability to take
appropriate and effective action to
formulate and solve problems in familiar,
unfamiliar, and changing settings (9).
Fraser and Greenhalgh further describe it
as the extent to which individuals can

adapt to change, generate new knowledge,
and continue to improve their
performance. Meaningful engagement
with uncertain and unfamiliar contexts is
thus essential to build capability (10).
Adaptability to change remains
conspicuously absent in competencies,
even though it is relevant to working in
any clinical setting, especially in an ICU.
It remains central to the idea of
capability, however. Enabling capability is
thus vital to ensure that healthcare
delivery keeps pace with its continuously
changing context (10).
By attempting to break down something
as challenging as clinical competence into
various subcompetencies, CBME has been
criticized for being reductionist in its
approach (11). Entrustable professional
activities (EPAs) were an attempt to
overcome this approach by linking
competencies to clinical practice. EPAs
represented units of professional practice
that a trainee could be entrusted to
perform, with the eventual goal of
performing these unsupervised (12).
Although actual clinical practice provided
the scope to engage with uncertainty,
EPAs themselves do not explicitly
incorporate adaptability to change as part
of their assessment framework. Capability,
on the other hand, brings in an all-around
human quality and holistic integration of a
trainee’sa b i l i t i e s .T h i ss h i f t st h ef o c u sf r o m
just outcomes to the actual person expected
to perform those outcomes. Table 1 lists
examples demonstrating the distinction
between competence and capability.
WHEN SEVERAL ROADS LEAD
TO ROME
One might rightly assume that, given the
limitations of the human mind, it is
unrealistic to even attempt to prepare for
every novel situation. Conventional
methods of deliberate practice would not
suffice educating for capability in such
scenarios. However, we must accept that
change is ubiquitous in health care.
Although adopting a capability-based medi-
cal education to accommodate change may
seem daunting at first, there are several
ways to achieve this goal in a manner that
complements current pedagogies.
First, there is a need to recognize and
respond to novelty (13). If we want to

make sure trainees are adept at these
skills, we need to prioritize them in
teaching and assessments. This can be
done by using opportunities to debrief and
provide feedback on recognizing such
novel situations (14). Educators can also
help learners engage with uncertainty in a
meaningful way by acknowledging
challenges that arise when contending
with uncertainty. This can be done by
making grappling with ambiguity a
discrete learning objective in itself (15).
Nonlinear learning and entrustment-based
discussions have also been proposed to
facilitate the same (10, 12).
Perhaps the single essential step toward
adopting a capability-based education
would be to nurture the teacher–trainee
relationship itself. Refining diagnostic
frameworks, developing mental heuristics,
and recognizing individual blind spots
and biases cannot be attained without
supportive coaching and mentorship.
Training exposes learners to clinical
volume. Reflecting on these patient
experiences through feedback sessions,
peer reviews, and mentored discussions
highlights the importance of a teacher as a
guide to derive meaning from these
encounters. The expertise and judgment
of a supportive teacher is thus essential in
nurturing one’s identity as a capable
physician.
During high school, I opted for the
premed track based on my passion for the
basic sciences. The mechanistic processes
and biochemical pathways governing the
human body fascinated the science
enthusiast in me. A decade later, the
aspiring intensivist in me has come to
realize that medicine is so much more. It
does require critical thinking to apply
scientific principles. But it also requires
probabilistic reasoning when weighing
evidence, empathy when breaking bad
news, fortitude while training in a global
pandemic, and courage to advocate for
the autonomy of our female patients.
Being a physician should mean striving
toward these values. Although it may be
enticing to reduce these to standardized
competencies, we must ensure our trainees
evolve into independent physicians who
are not just competent but also capable of
caring for their patients. The CBME
framework serves as an important tool for
workplace-based assessments, but we need
to incorporate adaptability to change
within medical training, given its relevance
to our learners. We must remind
ourselves, after all, that not all that is
measured is valuable, and not all that is
valuable can be measured.
