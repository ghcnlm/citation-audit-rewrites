Abstract
This meta-analysis aims to shed light on the added value of the complex multidimensional view on
motivation of Self-determination theory (SDT). We assess the unique and incremental validity of
each of SDT’s types of motivation in predicting organizational behavior, and examine SDT’s core
proposition that increasing self-determined types of motivation should have increasingly positive
outcomes. Meta-analytic findings (124 samples) support SDT, but also adds precision to its pre-
dictions: Intrinsic motivation is the most important type of motivation for employee well-being,
attitudes and behavior, yet identified regulation is more powerful in predicting performance and

organizational citizenship behavior. Furthermore, introjection has both positive and negative
consequences, while external regulation has limited associations with employee behavior and has
well-being costs. Amotivation only has negative consequences. We address conceptual and
methodological implications arising from this research and exemplify how these results may inform
and clarify lingering issues in the literature on employee motivation.

Employee motivation is defined as the force
that drives the direction, intensity, and persis-
tence of employee behavior (Pinder, 2008). It is
an important determinant of job performance,
on par with employees’ personal abilities (Van
Iddekinge et al., 2014), and has been considered
a contributing factor to employee well-being
(e.g., Demerouti et al., 2001). It may therefore
be no surprise that employee motivation is seen
as one of the most enduring and compelling
topics in work and organizational psychology
(Kanfer et al., 2017).
Motivation has been approached from mul-
tiple different perspectives. The old saying “Find
a job you enjoy, and you will never have to work
a day in your life” advocates for the value of
intrinsic motivation (i.e., doing an activity out of
inherent interest or pleasure) relative to extrinsic
motivation (i.e., engaging in an activity to
achieve a separable outcome; Ryan & Deci,
2017). Extending this dichotomy, in addition to
amotivation (i.e., a lack of motivation) and
intrinsic motivation, Self-Determination Theory
(SDT; Deci & Ryan, 1985) posits that people
may have several different and unique extrinsic
reasons to invest their time and energy in partic-
ular behaviors (Deci & Ryan, 2000). These rea-
sons are referred to as: external (i.e., being
pressured by others), introjected (i.e., putting
pressure on oneself through ego-involvement),
identified (i.e., doing an activity because one
finds it meaningful), and integrated regulations
(i.e., engaging in an activity because this is fully
aligned with one’s values and sense of self).
Research on these various types of motivation
in the context of work has grown exponentially
and has been frequently cited (e.g., Gagn´ e&
Deci [2005] is cited over 2000 times), and their
popularity in management books reflects their
resonance within practice (e.g., Fowler, 2014;
Pink, 2009). Given the growing importance of
these types of motivation for research and prac-
tice, the first aim of this meta-analysis is to take
stock: we provide a comprehensive overview of
what we know about the outcomes associated
with these different types of motivation, and sub-
sequently identify the gaps and limitations
within this body of research in order to guide
future research.
Second, and perhaps most importantly, we
also aim to assess the degree to which it is
valuable and necessary to differentiate between
each of SDT’s different types of motivation.
According to SDT, each of these motivation
types can be ordered along a continuum of self-
determination, ranging from more controlled to
more autonomous or volitional types of moti-
vation. Yet despite this predictable linear order,
each is also expected to have different implica-
tions for employee outcomes (Deci & Ryan,
2000). Although the underlying structure and
nature of the different types of motivation have
been carefully conceptualized, their incremental
and unique contribution to core organizational
behavior outcomes are not well understood. At
the empirical level, this is mainly due to the
Van den Broeck et al. 241
<<<PAGE=3>>>
dominance of scoring methods that combine
some of the motivation types (e.g. into a relative
autonomy index or into the overarching factors
of autonomous and controlled motivation;
Howard et al., 2020), and multicollinearity
issues caused by the highly correlated nature of
these motives (Howard et al., 2017). Moreover,
the theoretical proposition regarding how these
motivation types should relate to specific facets
of employee well-being and performance
remains rather broad. For example, SDT-
scholars argue that “when people’s goal-
directed behavior is autonomous rather than
controlled, the correlates and consequences are
more positive” (Deci & Ryan, 2000, p. 243; see
also Deci et al., 2017). This however raises the
question of whether each type of motivation
yields unique relations with outcomes. For
example, if there is linear dependence between
regulation types—that is, if intrinsic motivation
always produces better employee outcomes than
identified regulation, and identified regulation is
always better than introjected regulation—a
more simplified motivational perspective may
be warranted. While some authors have theo-
rized that each regulation type produces better
outcomes in certain circumstances and for dif-
ferent outcomes (Gagn´e & Deci, 2005; Koestner
& Losier, 2002), strong evidence remains scat-
tered and relatively scarce. Empirical evidence
for the theorized differential associations with
outcomes, and for explaining incremental var-
iance in outcomes, is necessary in order to sup-
port (or refute) the theoretical claims within
SDT.
To test the validity and unique contribution
of SDT’s multidimensional view to our under-
standing of work motivation and work out-
comes, we conducted a meta-analysis aiming to
examine how each of SDT’s types of motiva-
tion relates to a broad array of outcomes. We
used relative weights analyses to assess the
incremental validity of the different types of
work motivation in predicting employee out-
comes, and summarized their specific relations
with various aspects of employee well-being,
attitudes, and behaviors. Furthermore, we
examined the potential boundary conditions of
these relations through both contextual (e.g.
cultural contexts & job type) and methodological
(scales used and publication bias) moderators.
From these results, we address several theoretical
and methodological issues within the SDT liter-
ature and take steps to integrate SDT with
neighboring motivation theories.
In providing more detailed and nuanced
information on SDT’s different types of moti-
vation, and their consequences, this study con-
tributes to our understanding of employee
motivation over and above recent qualitative
reviews of work motivation (Kanfer & Chen,
2016; Kanfer et al., 2017). It goes beyond a
meta-analysis shedding light on the importance
of one’s level of motivation (defined uni-
dimensionally) for individual performance (Van
Iddekinge et al., 2014). Our study goes further
than meta-analyses on intrinsic and extrinsic
motivation (or proxies, such as the presence of
incentives), which have only focused on per-
formance outcomes (Byron & Khazanchi, 2012;
Cerasoli et al., 2014). Moreover, by providing
meta-analytic evidence for the relative impor-
tance of SDT’s different types of motivation in
predicting many organizationally relevant out-
comes, we extend previous meta-analytic work
that was limited to examining: a) the interrela-
tions among the different types of motivation in
and of themselves (Howard et al., 2017); b)
leader autonomy support as a specific antecedent
of these types of motivation (Slemp et al., 2018);
c) the relations of the different types of work
motivation with the basic psychological needs at
work (Van den Broeck et al., 2016); d) the
relations between specific health-related moti-
vation and health-related outcomes (e.g. smok-
ing cessation, healthy eating & mental health;
Ng et al., 2012); and e) the associations of
autonomous and controlled motivation on well-
being and autonomy support in specific popu-
lations, such as teachers (Slemp et al., 2020). In
the following we elaborate on SDT and the
specific research questions of this meta-analysis.

Self-determination theory’s
different types of motivation
Self-determination theory (SDT) is a broad
theory of human motivation that has been ap-
plied to various life domains including sports,
education, and organizational psychology. It
originated from the work of Deci (1971) which
built upon the distinction between intrinsic
motivation (i.e., doing the activity because of
the intrinsic interest derived from it) and ex-
trinsic motivation (i.e., doing an activity to
obtain an external outcome; Ryan & Deci,
2017). These ideas were developed further to
propose that people have qualitatively different
reasons to engage in extrinsically motivated
behavior (Deci & Ryan, 1985).
To date, SDT arguably presents one of the
most comprehensive perspectives on the com-
plexities of human motivation. First, as depic-
ted in Figure 1, SDT acknowledges that people
may experience a lack of motivation, otherwise
known as being “a-motivated” (Deci & Ryan,
2000). When amotivated, employees lack the
intention to engage in a behavior as they do not
see any reasons to do so. They may not value
the activity, feel capable of engaging or sus-
taining the particular behavior, or perceive a
contingency between their actions and the out-
comes they desire, thereby resulting in very
little desire to exert effort (e.g., Green-Demers
et al., 2008).
Furthermore, SDT differentiates between
qualitatively different types of extrinsic moti-
vation that fall along a continuum of self-
determination (Deci & Ryan, 2000). First,
external regulationis a non-self-determined type
of extrinsic motivation and relates to the classic
“carrot and stick” approach. Employees are
externally regulated when they do something
solely to obtain rewards or avoid punishments
from others such as managers, colleagues, or
clients. These external contingencies can be
material (e.g., obtaining a bonus or avoiding
being fired) or social in nature (e.g., when one
seeks approval or avoids being criticized by
others; Gagn´e et al., 2015). Externally regulated
tenure-track professors, for example, may put a
lot of effort into their job because they want to be
tenured.
Second, introjected regulation is a parti-
ally internalized form of extrinsic motivation
and, hence, is still relatively low on self-
determination. It is evident when people pur-
sue an activity out of ego-involvement or
contingent self-esteem such as when rewarding
Figure 1.Different types of motivation. Note: Integration is put in grey as together with previous evidence,
our results show there is little added value in considering this type of motivation.
Van den Broeck et al. 243

or punishing oneself through self-related emo-
tions, that is, when one aims to approach posi-
tive feelings such as pride, and aim to avoid
negative ones such as guilt or shame, often
using self-controlling language such as
“I should do X.” Scholars experiencing intro-
jected regulation may, for example, attempt to
publish more for perceived reputational gains,
or remain silent in seminars to avoid losing face
in front of their colleagues. Like in the case of
external regulation, introjected regulation is
characterized by feelings of being controlled
and pressured, albeit by internal rather than
external forces (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Conse-
quently, external and introjected regulations are
regarded as controlled forms of motivation and
are often combined into one factor.
Third, in the case ofidentified regulation,t h e
reasons for engaging in the behavior are more
internalized and are thus more self-determined
(Deci & Ryan, 2000). Identified regulation
reflects engaging in activities because of per-
ceived personal meaningfulness and importance.
Academics identifying with the importance of
student learning may, for example, be motivated
to provide extra help for students who are
struggling to foster such learning.
Finally, in the case of integrated regulation,
the reason underlying the behavior is not only
completely internalized and self-determined, but
also fully integrated within one’s value system.
Integrated reasons for engaging in an activity are
seen as an inherent and coherent part of one’s
identity or true sense of self (Deci & Ryan,
2000). When driven by integrated regulation,
people do not only find the behavior valuable,
they enact the behavior simply because it reflects
who they are. For example, academics may
study how to best design online classes, because
applying evidence-based procedures has become
a critical part of their professional identity,
which they endeavor to enact across situations
and time. Notably, identified and integrated
regulations are still considered extrinsic forms of
motivation as they are instrumental in reaching
an outcome separate from the activity itself—
however, they are most often considered as
autonomous due to their volitional nature, just
like intrinsic motivation.
Qualitatively or quantitatively
different constructs
Although SDT explicitly details the conceptual
differences between the various types of moti-
vation, in terms of the source and quality of
motivation, there is an ongoing debate con-
cerning whether SDT’s types of motivation
should be considered: a) qualitatively differ-
ent constructs; or b) quantitatively different
manifestations of the underlying construct
of self-determinati on, ranging from non-
self-determined (i.e., a-motivation) to fully
self-determined motivation (i.e., intrinsic moti-
vation). If the types of motivation are qualita-
tively different, they should factor into separate
constructs and relate differentially to various
outcomes. If they only differ in terms of the
quantity of self-determined motivation, it
would be possible and adequate to represent all
types by using a single factor predicting all of
the variance in outcomes (Chemolli & Gagn´ e,
2014), thus questioning the validity of the
complex multidimensional view of SDT.
Both perspectives have received some degree
of empirical support through factor analysis and
examination of the inter-correlations between
the different types of motivation. On the one
hand, Gagn´e et al. (2015) differentiated the
various types of motivation into separate con-
structs based on confirmatory factor analysis
using data from 3435 employees across several
languages (e.g., French, English, German). On
the other hand, using multidimensional scaling
based on meta-analytic correlations, Howard
et al. (2017) concluded that “people experience
these motivational regulations as differing in
degree of self-determination” (p. 1357), due to
the fact that adjacent types of motivation (e.g.,
external and introjected regulation) correlated
more strongly than non-adjacent types (e.g.,
external and identified regulation). Most

recently, Howard et al. (2018) integrated both
perspectives. Based on bifactor ESEM, they
concluded that SDT’s types of motivation rep-
resent quantitatively different levels of self-
determination, captured in a general factor; yet
they also have unique qualitative motivational
characteristics that allow them to explain var-
iance in basic need satisfaction and commitment
over and above this general factor.
One exception is integrated regulation. This
type of regulation could not be distinguished
from identified and intrinsic regulation in con-
firmatory factor analysis (Gagn´ee ta l . ,2 0 1 5 ) ,
and its meta-analytic correlations with identified
and intrinsic regulation were untenably high
(Howard et al., 2017). Questions have therefore
been raised about the distinctiveness of this type
of motivation, which may explain why inte-
grated regulation has not been included in most
validated scales (except for Tremblay et al.,
2009) and, consequently, why it has been often
excluded from research on work motivation.
Associations with outcomes
Despite their clear conceptual differentiation,
whether the different types of motivation also
hold discriminant and incremental validity in
empirically predicting important workplace out-
comes remains unknown. SDT proposes that
with increasingly autonomous forms of moti-
vation (i.e., from amotivation to external to
intrinsic motivation), employees should in-
creasingly show “optimal functioning” (Deci &
Ryan, 2000), which is defined as the “mani-
festation of intra- and interpersonal growth
and development in terms of employee well-
being (e.g., positive emotions, vitality), atti-
tudes (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational
commitment), and behavior (e.g., performance,
proactivity, and collaborative behaviors)” (Van
den Broeck et al., 2019, p. 30). However, this
general statement leaves us to question whether
each of the different types of motivation has
unique relations with such outcomes. Therefore,
to further study the discriminant validity of
SDT’s types of motivation, and hence examine
the added value of differentiating between them,
we aim to answer the following research ques-
tion through this meta-analysis:
Research Question 1: Do the types of moti-
vation correlate differentially, and in a non-
linear fashion, with outcomes, therefore
explaining incremental variance in outcomes?
Studying the discriminant and incremental
validity of the various types of motivation also
allows for a more fine-grained analysis of how
exactly the different types of motivation relate
to various outcomes. The general statement that
increasingly autonomous forms of motivation
(i.e., from external to intrinsic) should lead to
more positive outcomes (Gagn´ e et al., 2015)
leaves at least three questions around how the
different types of motivation should be related
to these outcomes.
First, the contribution of extrinsic autono-
mous types of motivation, relative to intrinsic
motivation, remains unclear. Based on their
conceptualization, we identified three different
perspectives on their relative contribution in
explaining employee well-being and behavior.
First, given that intrinsic motivation is consid-
ered the “prototype of autonomous motivation”
(Ryan & Deci, 2017, p. 197), it may be posited
that SDT considers intrinsic motivation as
the most valuable type of motivation to drive
employee outcomes (Sheldon et al., 2003).
Secondly, and alternatively, as intrinsic moti-
vation does not have “greater value or greater
autonomy” than integrated regulation (Ryan &
Deci, 2017, p. 198), both may be similar in
nature, and should therefore have similar rela-
tions with employee optimal functioning.
Finally, in specifying several autonomous types
of extrinsic motivation, SDT implies that each
type should be beneficial in at least some cir-
cumstances and for some outcomes. While
intrinsic motivation directs employees to do
what they themselves find interesting in the
moment, identified and integrated types of
Van den Broeck et al. 245
<<<PAGE=7>>>
regulation should help employees sustain
efforts toward personally meaningful goals
(Gagn´e & Deci, 2005; Ryan & Deci, 2017). In
line with this reasoning, identified regulation is
sometimes shown to relate more strongly to
outcomes such as proficient task performance,
job effort, and health behaviors such as smok-
ing abstinence than intrinsic motivation
(Koestner & Losier, 2002; Ng et al., 2012)—
suggesting that the effect of the motivational
type depends on the outcome of interest.
Research Question 2: Do identified, inte-
grated, and intrinsic regulation relate differ-
entially to outcomes?
Second, SDT’s general proposition raises
the question of whether the two forms of con-
trolled motivation (i.e., external and introjected
motivation): a) impair employee functioning
(i.e., negatively relate to well-being, adaptive
attitudes, and performa nce), b) are unrelated
to these outcomes (i.e., are not important moti-
vational processes), or c) are less positively
related to these outcomes compared to autono-
mous types of motivation. The lack of theore-
tical specification o n how external and
introjected motivation relate to outcomes has
led scholars to pose diverging hypotheses about
these relations (e.g., Gagn´ e et al., 2015; Van
den Broeck et al., 2011). The literature demon-
strates mixed empirical results; even when the
same scale is used to assess the types of moti-
vation, external regulation has frequently failed
to relate to employee functioning, but also
sometimes seems to mildly improve it (Gagn´ e
et al., 2015). Introjected regulation has been
shown to relate both positively and negatively
to aspects of well-being such as burnout (van
Beek et al., 2011, 2012). As such, it remains
unclear how each of these regulations relate to
outcomes, and the degree to which they are
empirically distinguishable (or not). Therefore,
we posit the following research question:
Research Question 3: Do external and intro-
jected types of motivation relate differentially
to employee well-being, attitudes, and beha-
vior; and are these results indicative of these
types of motivation being detrimental,
unrelated, or beneficial to employee
functioning?
Finally, while it is posited that autonomous
types of motivation lead to more beneficial out-
comes than controlled types of motivation, the
implications of amotivation are unclear. Is hav-
ing controlled types of motivation more detri-
mental for employee functioning than having
no motivation at all? Or does having at least
some motivation yield better consequences than
being amotivated. Theoretically, this has led to
debates about whether the quality of motivation
is more important than the quantity (Van den
Broeck et al., 2013); and questions about
whether the use of incentives, which are
assumed to increase levels of external regulation
(Gerhart & Fang, 2015), may foster well-being
and performance when employees are amoti-
vated. To shed light on this issue, we examine
the following research question:
Research Question 4 : Does amotivation
relate more negatively to employee well-
being, attitudes, and behavior than external
regulation?
Contextual moderators
Finally, we performed moderation analyses to
explore whether contextual factors (i.e., national
culture and blue versus white collar) and me-
thodological factors (i.e., differences between
measurement scales and publication status) in-
fluence the relations between the types of
motivation and employee outcomes.
In terms of contextual factors, we first ex-
amine whether culture may affect the associa-
tions between SDT’s types of motivation and
employee well-being, attitudes, and behavior.
Because of its emphasis on autonomy, SDT has
frequently been criticized to be less applicable to
people who may attach less value to autonomy
246 Organizational Psychology Review 11(3)
<<<PAGE=8>>>
(Iyengar & Lepper, 1999)—such as is the case in
collectivistic (i.e., Eastern) rather than indivi-
dualistic (i.e., Western) cultures, and among blue
versus white collar workers. In collectivistic
cultures, for example, following externally
imposed group norms is socially encouraged
and people are highly motivated to avoid guilt
and shame (Buchtel et al., 2018). External and
introjected regulations may naturally fit these
cultures, and following the person-environment
fit literature (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005), more
controlled types of motivation may therefore be
related to better outcomes in collectivistic
(compared to individualistic) cultures. Similarly,
while blue-collar workers attach high impor-
tance to pay and job security, white collar
workers put greater emphasis on developing
themselves and being autonomous (De Witte &
Van den Broeck, 2011). As such, the latter group
may benefit more from more autonomous types
of motivation, compared to the former. These
assumptions stand in strong contrast to SDT’s
claim of being universal (Deci & Ryan, 2000),
and research supporting SDT’s propositions in
collective cultures (Chirkov et al., 2003; Slemp
et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018) and among blue-
collar workers (Ilardi et al., 1993). Given these
conflicting perspectives, it is imperative to meta-
analytically test whether culture and job type
moderate the relations between the types of
motivation and their correlates.
Second, we also examine whether the results
depend on methodological features such as
publication status (published versus unpub-
lished) and the specific operationalizations of
the types of motivation. As the review process
tends to be biased toward publishing significant
results (Rosenthal, 1979), scholars may be
tempted to include or exclude hypotheses and
analyses based on whether or not they are
supported, which may lead to the under-
reporting of empirical evidence that does not
align with presumed theory and stronger sup-
port for a theory than is warranted based on
empirical results (Rubin, 2017). Only including
published studies in a meta-analysis may
overestimate the true effect sizes by no less than
12% on average (McAuley et al., 2000). Given
this, we deemed it necessary to examine
whether publication bias moderates the rela-
tions of the different types of motivation with
outcome variables.
Finally, we examine whether apparent dif-
ferences in the operationalization of types of
motivation alter their correlations with out-
comes. Much in line with the initial focus on
tangible outcomes (Deci & Ryan, 2000), almost
all available measures of external regulation
focus on one’s orientation to acquire money and
earn an income (e.g., “it allows me to earn
money,” “I’m paid to do it”; Fernet et al., 2008;
Tremblay et al., 2009). Recently however,
Gagn´e et al., (2015) explicitly differentiated
between external regulation for material (e.g.,
financial rewards, job security) and social
reasons (e.g., to get approval or respect from
others). While these material and social ex-
ternal reasons resulted in separate factors,
Gagn´e et al. (2015) did not examine their dif-
ferential effects. Yet, some research seems to
suggest that the implications of external material
and social motivation may diverge. For ex-
ample, compared to external social motivation,
being externally regulated for material reasons
has been found to relate more strongly to job
satisfaction (Smokrovic´ et al., 2019) but less
strongly to burnout (T´oth-Kir´aly et al., 2020).
Also, in his initial research on SDT, Deci found
that material rewards had more detrimental
effects than feedback, the latter of which is
more social in nature (Deci, 1971; Deci et al.,
1999). To examine whether the outcomes of
material and social external regulation differ
systematically, we examine, based on all avail-
able evidence, whether the nature of the external
regulation scale (i.e., material versus social)
moderates the relations of external motiva-
tion with employee well-being, attitudes, and
performance.
Introjected regulation has also been oper-
ationalized in different ways. Some scales pri-
marily include items that reflect employees’
Van den Broeck et al. 247
<<<PAGE=9>>>
motivation to avoid negative feelings (e.g.,
feeling unworthy, ashamed, guilty) that put a
threat to one’s self-esteem (e.g., Fernet et al.,
2008). Others adopt a more balanced approach,
including alsoapproach-orienteditems referring
to positive feelings (e.g. self-worth, pride) that
may boost one’s self esteem (e.g., Gagn´ee ta l . ,
2010, 2015). Yet each of these scales are con-
sidered to indicate the same SDT construct of
introjected regulation. SDT scholars thus routi-
nely ignore the well-established differential
effects of approach and avoidance motivation
(Carver, 2006; Higgins, 2002), and initial studies
suggesting that approach-oriented introjection
may be less harmful than avoidance-oriented
introjection (Assor et al., 2009). To see
whether more nuanced measurement of intro-
jected regulation is needed, this meta-analysis
systematically compares introjection scales that
rely only (Fernet et al., 2008) or heavily
(Tremblay et al., 2009) on avoidance items
compared to those that cover both approach and
avoidance introjected regulation (Fernet, 2011;
Gagn´e et al., 2010, 2015).
Finally, because integrated and identified re-
gulations are hard to empirically differentiate
(Howard et al., 2017), most scales do not have
a separate subscale for integrated regulation.
However, careful reading of the literature re-
vealed that the identified regulation scale of
Gagn´e et al. (2015) may include items that go
above and beyond finding work as merely
meaningful, and may draw upon elements of
integrated regulation (i.e., putting effort in this
jobs aligns with my personal values/has personal
significance to me). To further assess the
importance of separating the construct of inte-
grated regulation, we therefore ran a moderation
analysis comparing this scale reflecting identi-
fied and integrated regulation (i.e., Gagn´ee ta l . ,
2015) with all other scales purely referring to
identified regulation.
In summary, to examine the degree to which
our findings on the relationships between SDT’s
types of motivation and employee outcomes are
generalizable and robust, we sought to answer
the following research question:
Research Question 5 : Are the relations
between the types of motivation and their
outcomes generalizable across cultures, job
types, published versus unpublished studies,
and measures?
Method
We conducted a meta-analysis of the relations
between SDT’s types of motivation and their
conceptual outcomes that have been examined in
the literature. Before examining the strength and
direction of these relations for each motivation
type, we studied their relative importance in
explaining employee outcomes using relative
weights analysis (RWA). RWA is a procedure
commonly employed in organizational psy-
chology to determine the unique and relative
contribution of multiple correlated predict-
ors, thereby addressing the problem of multi-
collinearity and hence unstable beta coefficients
in regression analyses (Tonidandel & LeBreton,
2015). Multicollinearity is often encountered
when using SDT-based motivation scales
(Howard et al., 2017), which has forced most
researchers to use aggregated scores (e.g., con-
trolled and autonomous motivation or the rela-
tive autonomy index; Howard et al., 2020). Such
scores however prevent examination of the pre-
cise relationships between each type of motiva-
tion and the outcomes, and potentially lead to
information loss and reduced variance accounted
for in published research. Using RWA in this
meta-analysis allowed us to look at the relative
importance of each motivation type in predicting
work-related outcomes and to determine if the
multidimensional conceptualization of work
motivation offered by SDT adds valuable
information about work motivation.

referred to one of the major validated SDT
scales specific to the work domain (i.e., Blais
et al., 1993; Fernet, 2011; Fernet et al., 2008;
Gagn´e et al., 2010, 2015; Tremblay et al., 2009)
or adaptations thereof; c) provided correlations
between at least one regulation and one work-
related outcome (well-being, attitudes, and
behavior); and d) examined adult participants in
an organizational setting. This resulted in the
exclusion of studies including unemployed
people, volunteers, students, and athletes, as
well as experimental, laboratory, and interven-
tion studies.
Literature search
First, we searched for all articles validating a
work motivation scale in the realm of SDT as
mentioned above, and all studies citing these
works (years 1989–Oct 2020). Second, the
databases of Web of Science, Google Scholar,
EBSCO and PsycINFO were searched indepen-
dently by the authors using the following search
terms: “external”, “introjected”, “identified”,
“integrated”, “intrinsic”, “motivation”, and “þ
self determin*,” which were paired with
“employ*” or “work*.” Additionally, we sear-
ched using scale names as keywords (e.g.,
Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale,
MWMS). All duplicates were removed and ex-
clusion criteria were applied. Of the remaining
articles, 92 did not provide correlation tables or
other pertinent information (e.g., only aggregate
motivation scores were reported). Authors were
contacted to obtain missing information and
simultaneously asked for other unpublished data.
Accordingly, 90 authors were contacted with a
14% response rate. These authors provided an
additional 21 samples. In total, our search
resulted in 104 articles and manuscripts con-
taining 124 samples (72 published, 32 unpub-
lished samples) that met our inclusion criteria.
The overview of the search process (Figure S1),
references, and final dataset are available in
supplementary materials.
Coding
The first two authors and four research assistants
(with expertise in organizational psychology)
entered all potentially relevant information into a
spreadsheet. These variables included the scale
used, the nationality and sector of the sample, as
well as outcomes of motivation. Correlation
coefficients were collected as effect sizes of
primary interest. Intercoder agreement rates
were high (Cohen’s K ¼ .94; McHugh, 2012),
and disagreements were all resolved through
reexamination of articles. Correlations between
regulations and covariates that did not occur at
least twice and that could not be meaningfully
integrated with similar variables were removed.
Meta-analytic procedures
We conducted this meta-analysis following the
Hunter-Schmidt model (Schmidt & Hunter,
2015), with random-effects models applied
throughout. This method assumes that between-
study variance can be attributed to either study
artifacts or moderating effects. It is strongly
recommended over the alternative fixed-effects
model which assumes that between-study var-
iance is solely due to sampling error and does
not allow for moderating factors—an untenable
assumption in all but a few instances.
For each relation between a type of motiva-
tion and an expected outcome, corrections for
reliability were made before weighting correla-
tions according to sample size (Schmidt &
Hunter, 2015). When alpha coefficients were not
obtainable, mean reliability scores were imputed
for the scale. The standard deviation and stan-
dard error of the corrected correlations were
calculated (Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). Based
upon the estimated standard error, 95 % confi-
dence intervals (CI) were calculated around the
corrected correlation coefficients, with CIs in-
dicating a significant effect when zero is not
included within the CIs. Examination of 95 %
CIs were used to indicate the extent to which the
relations of the various types of motivation with
Van den Broeck et al. 249
<<<PAGE=11>>>
outcomes are significantly different or not. In
accordance with Cumming and Finch (2005),
non-overlapping CIs indicated differences bet-
ween values at a probability approximately equal
to < .01, and CIs which overlapped less than 50%
were considered indicative of differences in
values of approximatelyp < .05. The 80% cred-
ibility intervals (CV) and the percentage of the
proportion of variance explained by sampling
and measurement error (the “75 % rule”) were
used to assess the homogeneity of the effect size
distribution (Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). We used
two different metrics to assess publication bias:
Egger’s regression intercept (z) test (Egger et al.,
1997) and Begg and Mazumdar’s (1994) rank
correlation (t) test. As recommended by Van
Aert et al. (2019), we only calculated these sta-
tistics when 10 effect sizes were available in
order to achieve sufficient statistical power.
To assess the incremental validity of the types
of motivation, relative weights analysis (RWA)
was conducted in the R software package
following procedures from Tonidandel and
LeBreton (2015). Analyses were based on the
corrected meta-analytic correlations among the
types of motivation derived in this study (see
Table S2 in supplementary materials). Each
model consisted of motivation types predicting a
single outcome variable, with this process
repeated for each available outcome. Results of
these analyses produce relative weights repre-
senting the variance in an outcome accounted for
by the predictor, as well as rescaled relative
weights, which presents the information as a
percentage of R2.
Subgroup analyses were performed to
examine whether contextual and methodological
moderators would influence the results. Fol-
lowing Aguinis et al.’s (2008) recommendations,
we used Hunter and Schmidt’s (2004) proce-
dures for a subgroup analysis with categorical
variables. Even though we are aware that sub-
group analysis is suboptimal to meta-regressions
(Geyskens et al., 2009), this analysis was chosen
because of the (at times) limited number of
effect sizes per relationship.
Results
The relative importance of the motivation
types
To examine whether the types of motivation
correlated differentially and in a non-linear
fashion with employee outcomes, and therefore
explain incremental variance in these outcomes
(RQ1), we first provide an overview of the
associations between SDT’s motivation types
and broad categories of desirable (e.g., perfor-
mance) and undesirables outcomes (e.g., dis-
tress). Overall, results outlined in Figure 2 and
Table S3, show that increasingly autonomous
types of motivation related increasingly posi-
tively with desirable and increasingly negatively
with undesirable outcomes. In general, intrinsic
motivation related more strongly with the out-
comes compared to identified regulation. The
CIs of these relations did not overlap, providing
first evidence for the discriminant validity of the
types of motivation. Integrated regulation was an
e x c e p t i o ni nt h i sr e g a r da si t sr e l a t i o n so v e r -
lapped significantly with those of identified and
intrinsic motivation (Cumming & Finch, 2005).
These results should however be interpreted with
caution due to the limited number of observa-
tions containing integrated regulation and the
very large CIs resulting from this. External and
introjected regulations were positively related to
both desirable and undesirable outcomes, yet
effect sizes were generally very small. Amoti-
vation related more strongly to the outcomes
than external regulation.
Second, we performed RWA to examine the
incremental validity of SDT’s types of motiva-
tion. Integrated regulation was omitted from this
analysis due to the paucity of available effect
sizes. As presented in Table 1, the results indi-
cated that, in general, the other motivation types
each made unique contributions in accounting
for the outcomes. The total explained variance in
each outcome ranged from 1 % (i.e., absentee-
ism) to 40% (i.e., engagement), and the different
types of motivation accounted for about 30% or
250 Organizational Psychology Review 11(3)

more of the variance in the well-being outcomes
(except for distress) and CWB. Intrinsic moti-
vation was the most important motivation factor
as evidenced by its disproportionately high
relative weights and accounting for over 46.23%
of the motivational effects on outcomes. It

explained more than 50 % of the variance in
burnout, engagement, job satisfaction, affective
commitment, turnover intentions, proactivity,
counterproductive work behavior (CWB) and
absenteeism and was the strongest predictor for
10 out of the 13 outcomes.
Identified regulation was the second most
important motivation type, explaining over
22.67% of the variance in the outcomes. It was
more important for performance than intrinsic
motivation, predicted an equal amount of var-
iance as intrinsic motivation in distress, and
was, together with introjected regulation, the
most important predictor of OCB. Introjected
(11.95%) and amotivation (11.50 %) predicted
about the same amount of additional variance
in the outcomes. Introjected regulation was
particularly important in predicting normative
commitment, while amotivation accounted for
considerable variance in burnout. External reg-
ulation was the least important motivation type,
explaining less than 10% of the variance in the
outcomes. It was only of particular importance in
explaining continuance commitment. Notably,
except for external regulation, all types of
motivation explained a substantial proportion of
variance in performance, with identified regu-
lation being the most important predictor.
Specific relations between motivation types
and outcomes
We then examined the specific relations between
each of SDT’s type of motivation and the spe-
cific outcomes to answer RQ2 and RQ3. Table 2
shows the meta-analytic calculations between
the types of motivation and the four different
well-being aspects we could examine given the
available data (i.e., distress, burnout, engage-
ment, and job satisfaction). Amotivation was
clearly associated with decreased well-being: it
related positively to burnout and negatively to
work engagement and job satisfaction. External
regulation was also associated with well-being
costs, relating positively to both distress and
burnout, but it was unrelated to the positive
well-being constructs of engagement and job
satisfaction. Introjected regulation, in contrast,
seemed to have both negative and positive well-
being implications: it was positively related to
burnout and distress, as well as to engagement
and job satisfaction. Identified regulation and
intrinsic motivation were negatively associated
with distress and burnout, and were positively
associated with engagement and job satisfaction.
Results for integrated regulation followed the
same pattern.
In terms of job attitudes, we calculated the
meta-analytic correlations for turnover inten-
tion and affective, normative, and continuance
commitment (Meyer et al., 2004). As shown
in Table 2, while amotivation was unrelated to
normative commitment and turnover intentions,
it was related negatively to affective commit-
ment and positively to continuance commitment.
External, introjected, and identified regulations
were each positively associated with all types of
commitment and negatively associated with
turnover intentions. Integrated regulation and
intrinsic motivation followed largely the same
pattern, although intrinsic motivation was unre-
lated to continuance commitment.
As shown in Table 3, the results for work-
place behaviors (i.e., performance, proactivity,
organizational citizenship behavior [OCB],
counterproductive work behavior [CWB], and
absenteeism) seemed to deviate from the pattern
observed for well-being and attitudes. Specifi-
cally, although few correlations were available
for amotivation, the results showed its detri-
mental association with employee performance
and proactivity and its positive relation with
CWB. External regulation, in contrast, related
positively to performance and proactivity, was
negatively related to organizational citizenship
behavior (OCB), and unrelated to the other
performance outcomes. Introjected and Identi-
fied regulations were both positively related to
performance, proactivity, and OCB, but also
unrelated to CWB and absenteeism. Integrated
regulation was positively related to performance.
Intrinsic motivation related positively to all

constructive behaviors and was the only type of
motivation that significantly related (negatively)
to absenteeism.
We then examined if CIs overlapped to
determine whether regulations were associated
differentially with outcomes (Cumming &
Finch, 2005). Focusing on adjacent types of
motivation, amotivation and external regula-
tion were similar in only 2 out of 11 comparisons
(pertaining to distress and CWB). External and
introjected regulations were similar in 5 out
of 13 comparisons (the n egative well-being
indicators [distress and burnout], turnover, pro-
activity, and absenteeism). Introjected and id-
entified regulations overlapped on 6 out of
13 comparisons, including normative and con-
tinuance commitment, and all types of behavior
except for performance (i.e. proactivity, OCB,
CWB, and absenteeism). Finally, identified and
intrinsic motivation overlapped in 8 out of 13
comparisons. Exceptions were burnout, engage-
ment, job satisfaction, affective commitment,
and absenteeism. This indicates that there is
some overlap in the consequences of these types
of motivation for employee optimal functioning.
The results for integrated regulation overlapped
with either those of identification or intrinsic
motivation in 6 out of 8 comparisons (job sa-
tisfaction and continuance commitment were
exceptions herein), suggesting the nomological
networks between these variables are nearly
identical.
Moderation analyses
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, for most relation-
ships, sampling and measurement error account
for less than 75 % o ft h eo b s e r v e dv a r i a n c e
(Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). Only for a few rela-
tions, which were typically based on few obser-
vations, was this threshold exceeded, suggesting
that sampling and measurement error could
account for differences in the magnitude of these
few correlations. The credibility intervals were
generally large, including zero in 34 % of the
cases. Hence, moderator analyses are necessary
to explain this observed variance and to examine
the generalizability of our results (i.e., RQ 5).
This was done for all relations for which enough
effect sizes were available. For amotivation this
was generally not the case. The full results are
available in the supplementary materials S4 to
S10 and summarized in Tables 4 and 5.
In examining whether the relations between
the motivation types and outcomes varied
depending on cultural context (i.e., “Western”
cultural contexts such as Canada vs. “Eastern”
cultural contexts such as China), only 7 out of 47
correlations (15%) testing for different results
did not overlap: Introjected regulation related
more strongly to burnout, yet less strongly to job
satisfaction and affective commitment in West-
ern compared to Eastern countries. Intrinsic
motivation also related more strongly to burn-
out, engagement, job satisfaction and affective
commitment in the West than in the East.
The results comparing blue versus white
collar workers showed significant differences
between both groups in 10 out of 44 comparisons
(23%). They all pointed at a stronger relation
between motivation and employee well-being,
attitudes, and performance for blue collar work-
ers compared to white collar workers; external
regulation related more strongly to engagement,
and all types of motivation—except for external
regulation—related more strongly to job satis-
faction. Introjected regulation was more indica-
tive of affective commitment, while intrinsic
motivation associated more strongly with nor-
mative commitment. Both introjected regulation
and intrinsic motivation related more strongly to
turnover intentions and performance.
No systematic pattern was present regarding
the effects of publication status. In only 12 out
of 47 cases (25%) were differences were found
between published and unpublished data. In
nine cases the published data presented stronger
effect sizes, while in the other three cases the
effects in the unpublished data were stronger.
To gain further insight into whether publica-
tion bias was an issue in our data, we supple-
ment this moderation analysis with Egger’s
256 Organizational Psychology Review 11(3)

regression test and the rank-correlation test.
These tests further indicated that overall, the
reported results did not seem affected by pub-
lication bias. However, for burnout, smaller
correlations tended to be reported less often,
which was also the case for studies examining
the associations between intrinsic motivation
and engagement, performance, and proactivity.
Finally, we examined whether the various
operationalizations of SDT’s types of motiva-
tion, as reflected in the different measurement
scales, could explain differences in the strength
of the relationships between these types of
motivation and employee outcomes (Table 5 and
S7–10). Concerning external regulation, mate-
rial external regulation related more strongly
than social external regulation to turnover
intention, but no differences were found for
burnout, engagement, performance, and OCB.
For introjected regulation, the results indicate
that measures that only tap into avoiding nega-
tive emotions associate more strongly with
burnout, compared to measures including some
approach items or a balanced mix of avoidance
and approach items. This result was not repli-
cated with regards to distress, which was the
only other outcome on which the three types of
measures for introjected regulation could be
compared. No further differences were found in
the strength of the relations between the unba-
lanced and balanced scales tapping into intro-
jected regulation and job satisfaction, affective
commitment, or turnover intentions. Slight dif-
ferences in the operationalization of identified
regulation led to very few differences in the
relationships: Identified measures excluding
integrated regulation items associated more
strongly with distress and job satisfaction; but no
differences were found for burnout, engagement,
affective or continuance commitment, turnover
intentions, performance, proactivity, or OCB.

determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan,
2000) has provided a nuanced view on this
topic, suggesting that one should not only take
into account how much employees are moti-
vated (i.e., amotivation versus motivation), or
whether they are intrinsically or extrinsically
motivated, but also which types of extrinsic
motivation they hold (i.e., external, introjected,
identified or integrated regulation).
SDT has become increasingly popular in
organizational psychology, and it is therefore
time to take stock of the associations between
SDT’s different types of work motivation and
important outcomes in the organizational liter-
ature (i.e., employee well-being, attitudes, and
performance). This helps us to understand the
strengths and limitations of the current body of
research, and to identify avenues for future
research. By obtaining all relevant data, this
meta-analysis allows us to shed light on some
fundamental issues that remain unclear within
existing SDT research: whether (i.e., RQ1) and
how (i.e., RQ2–4) each of the SDT types of
motivation is uniquely influential in predicting
a broad range of employee outcomes, and to
what extent these results are generalizable (i.e.,
RQ5). In doing so, this meta-analysis provides a
more precise picture of the value and necessity
of SDT’s nuanced view of the nature and con-
sequences of employee motivation.
Answers to our research questions
Research question 1: Relative contribution of the
types of motivation.All in all, our meta-analysis
provides support for the discriminant and
incremental validity of SDT’s different types of
motivation in explaining variance in employee
outcomes that we consider to be crucial in the
field of organizational psychology. Our results
indicate that the correlations of SDT’s types of
motivation, ordered along the continuum of
self-determination, show a linear trend with
employee outcomes. While several relations
between the motivation types and employee
outcomes overlapped, RWA revealed that every
type of motivation (including amotivation)
holds incremental validity in predicting
employee well-being, attitudes, and behavior.
These findings align with previous research
that has examined the structure of SDT’s types
of motivation (Howard et al., 2017, 2018). Using

meta-analytic multidimensional scaling and bi-
factor analysis, respectively, these studies
showed that each of the types of motivation can
be ordered along a continuum of self-
determination (Howard et al., 2017), reflected
by their loadings on a general factor representing
the degree of self-determination in each item
(Howard et al., 2018). This “truncus communis”
likely accounts for most of the linear trend in our
data and the overlapping confidence intervals. In
addition to this general factor, SDT’s types of
motivation have been shown to possess unique
properties, which are reflected in their specific
factors. These factors likely play a strong role in
the unique and incremental effects of the types
of motivation on employee outcomes, as evi-
denced in our RWA.
Integrated regulation is an exception in this
regard: the limited results pertaining to this type
of motivation indicate that its correlations are
almost identical to those of identified regulation
or intrinsic motivation, meaning that it adds little
incremental explanatory value beyond that of the
other motivation types. Despite being clearly
differentiated at the conceptual level, the mea-
surement of integrated regulation has challenged
SDT researchers for a long time. Even the first
scale to assess SDT’s different types of regula-
tions (i.e., Ryan & Connell, 1989, tapping into
academic motivation) did not include a scale for
integrated regulation, which could be attributed
to the fact that children may not be mature
enough to have integrated extrinsic regulations
in a coherent sense of self (Howard et al., 2017).
The survey of Ryan and Connell (1989) served
as an example for many subsequent scales to
assess SDT’s types of motivation in different life
domains. Despite considerable efforts, many
other authors also failed to include integrated
regulation in these scales, as such items could
not be differentiated from items of identification
or intrinsic motivation through of factor analysis
(see e.g. Gagn´e et al., 2015, and Pelletier et al.,
1995, in the work and sports domain, respec-
tively). Moreover, meta-analytic findings indi-
cated that the integrated regulation scales that
were developed (e.g. Tremblay et al., 2009) were
highly related to identification and intrinsic
motivation and that the relations of these inte-
grated regulation scales with the other types of
motivation overlapped considerably with those
of identification and intrinsic motivation
(Howard et al., 2017).
Our meta-analysis expands these findings on
integrated motivation. It shows that integrated
regulation is hardly examined within the context
of work, which is consistent with other meta-
analyses in the academic setting (Slemp et al.,
2020) and the health context (Ng et al., 2012).
Our results add to this body of research in
revealing that the associations between inte-
grated regulation and employee well-being,
attitudes, and performance almost always over-
lap with the associations of identified and
intrinsic motivation. Further, when no overlap
was found, contrary to expectations, integrated
regulation (or scales mixing items for identified
and integrated regulation) did not show the
stronger relations with the outcomes than
(purely) identified regulation.
We therefore see little compelling evidence
to focus on integrated regulation in future
questionnaire research in the context of work.
This is not to say, however, that integrated reg-
ulations should be omitted from SDT theory.
The lack of differentiation between integrated,
identified, and intrinsic motivation in ques-
tionnaire research may simply be due to the fact
that people may describe themselves as being
more consistent across time and situations than
they truly are (Sadler & Woody, 2003). This
consistency bias may then cause individuals to
say that they consistently engage in particular
behavior because they have integrated this rea-
son (e.g., it has become a fundamental part of
who they really are; Tremblay et al., 2009),
while actually they may only merely identify
with the value of the particular behavior (e.g.,
because it allows them to attain work objectives
that they consider important; Fernet et al., 2008),
yet the behavior may not be displayed across
time and settings. Hence, because people like to
Van den Broeck et al. 259
<<<PAGE=21>>>
see themselves as more consistent than they
really are, people may confuse valuing some-
thing as a lower order goal with striving for a
higher level, well-integrated goal that defines
one’s identity and drives consistent behavior
(Kruglanski et al., 2002). Future research
avoiding, or accounting for, this consistency bias
(e.g. through observations or interviews) may be
better suited for examining whether integrated
regulation has discriminant validity vis a vis
SDT’s other types of motivation.
Research questions 2–5: Specific associations for
the types of motivation.With respect to the spe-
cific impact of the autonomous types of moti-
vation (i.e., research questions 2), the results
support the highly beneficial nature of intrinsic
motivation in the workplace: intrinsic motiva-
tion explained the most variance in almost all
outcomes (except continuance commitment and
OCB), and was the sole predictor of absentee-
ism, albeit with a small impact. Overall, these
results suggest that making work inherently
enjoyable and interesting pays off.
Comparing these results with those of iden-
tified regulation, which represents an autono-
mous type of extrinsic motivation, we see some
overlapping results. However, RWA suggests
that intrinsic motivation and identified regula-
tion yield differential and incremental effects:
while intrinsic motivation associates more
strongly with well-being than identified regula-
tion, the opposite is true for employee behavior
(i.e., performance and OCB). This supports the
idea that engaging in a particular behavior
because one considers it meaningful or valuable
(e.g., because it corresponds to one’s values,
motives or goals; Sheldon, 2011; Sheldon &
Schu¨ler, 2011) may be more important for con-
tinuous effort investment, goal directed beha-
vior, or “going the extra mile,” than engaging in
a behavior because it is inherently enjoyable—
especially when work tasks become more
tedious or stressful. This idea has already been
voiced by some SDT-scholars (Gagn´e & Deci,
2005), and adds nuance to previous meta-
analytic findings that have highlighted the
importance of intrinsic motivation for high
quality performance (Cerasoli et al., 2014). That
is, the current meta-analytical results indicate
that some types of extrinsic motivation (i.e.,
identified regulation) may sometimes lead to
higher levels of performance, extra-role beha-
vior, or helping behavior than intrinsic motiva-
tion. We encourage further research examining
the differential impact of identified regulation
and intrinsic motivation on the quantity, quality,
and duration of (ideally objectively-rated) per-
formance to further support this claim. All in all,
our findings indicate that work does not need to
be “all play” for employees to feel well and
perform well, as long as they find their work
meaningful.
Our results also help uncover the complex
nature of controlled motivation. Specifically, our
results highlight that the question of whether
controlled forms of motivation are detrimental,
unrelated, or less positively related to employee
outcomes (i.e., RQ3), should be answered in a
nuanced way, taking into account the particular
outcome and the type of controlled motivation
under study. First, our meta-analysis highlights
the Janus face of introjected regulation: enga-
ging in a particular behavior to boost one’s self
esteem was positively related to both ill-being
(e.g., distress) and well-being (e.g., engage-
ment). It also related to all forms of commit-
ment, though most strongly to normative
commitment (see also Meyer et al., 2004), and
was a relatively strong predictor of performance
and OCB. This indicates that introjected people
may perform well by pressuring themselves or
striving to feel better about themselves, but with
some well-being price to pay. In general, these
results were found across operationalizations of
introjected regulation that focused solely on
avoiding negative emotions such as guilt or
shame (i.e., avoidance-based operationalisation),
and also operationalisations that also incorpo-
rated at least some measurement of striving for
positive emotions such as pride (i.e., inclusion of
approach-based operationalisations).
260 Organizational Psychology Review 11(3)
<<<PAGE=22>>>
Second, the current results also show that
expecting rewards (e.g., praise, bonus) or aim-
ing to avoid of punishments (e.g., criticism,
being fired) may not be the best types of
motivation: they may be stressful; will mostly
lead to continuance commitment, which is the
form of commitment associated with the worst
performance and well-being outcomes (Meyer
et al., 2004); offer quite limited contributions to
employee performance; and inhibit OCB. These
results resemble previous meta-analytic find-
ings in the health context (Ng et al., 2012), but
add the perspective of RWA, highlighting the
small relative impact of external regulation in
explaining these outcomes. Notably, whether
one is driven by material (e.g., money) or social
(e.g., social pressure) external reasons did not
make a difference in terms of employee well-
being or behavior, except that being driven by
external material reasons may lead to increased
odds of turnover. All in all, the results showed
that external regulation should therefore not be
the only, or even the most important, form of
extrinsic work motivation to rely on in the work
domain.
Pertaining to research question 4, the results
indicated that amotivation proved particularly
helpful in understanding burnout and was
associated strongly (and negatively) with per-
formance. The current meta-analytic results
therefore indicate that having no motivation
(i.e., low quantity of motivation) may be more
detrimental than external regulation (i.e., low
quality of motivation).
The moderation analysis (i.e., research ques-
tion 5) showed that relationships between moti-
vation types and employee outcomes are
generally generalizable across contexts in terms
of cultures and job types. With some exceptions,
the results did not seem to be systematically
affected by publication bias or the particular
operationalizations of the types of motivation.
This attests to the universality of SDT and the
reliability of our results. However, given the
limited number of studies able to be included
in the moderation analysis, we nonetheless
encourage future research incorporating con-
textual and methodological variables to further
explain the variability in our results and inves-
tigate the generalizability of our conclusions.
In sum, our results show that SDT’s types of
motivation can have different implications for
employee well-being, attitudes and perform-
ance. However, the relationships were a bit
more complex than can be summarized by
SDT’s higher-level proposition that increasingly
autonomous forms of motivation (i.e., from
amotivation to external, introjected, and identi-
fied regulation, to intrinsic motivation) should
associate increasingly (positively) with em-
ployee optimal functioning (Deci & Ryan,
2000). Specifically, identified regulation may
sometimes associate with more beneficial (per-
formance related) outcomes than intrinsic moti-
vation; introjected regulation may associate with
both positive and detrimental outcomes; while
external regulation, and particularly amotiva-
tion, likely have negative implications. Despite
these nuances, the results support the validity
and usefulness of SDT’s multidimensional view
on motivation as a comprehensive framework to
understand the complex phenomenon of moti-
vation. Most importantly, these results indicate
that not only the quantity, but also the nuanced
differences in the quality of motivation matters.
As such, SDT goes above and beyond most
motivational theories, which do not take into
account the nature or quality of motivation, and
instead focus solely on how much one is moti-
vated (Kanfer & Chen, 2016; Kanfer et al.,
2017)—of which Goal Setting Theory is a prime
example, yet has nonetheless dominated the lit-
erature on employee motivation and practice
(Locke & Latham, 2019).
Implications for theory and practice
Modeling of the different types of motivation.Our
results attest to the discriminant validity of the
various types of motivation and provide further
evidence of their specific implications for
employee outcomes. These results thus have
Van den Broeck et al. 261
<<<PAGE=23>>>
clear implications for how the types of motiva-
tion should be modeled in future research. First,
as mentioned above, we argue that questionnaire
studies may leave out integrated regulation until
we find better ways to capture it. Second, our
results indicate that, unfortunately, relatively
few studies have paid attention to amotivation.
Some scholars have posited that people would
have at least some kind of motivation to do their
job, making the study of amotivation irrelevant
(Gagn´e et al., 2015). Yet, recent person-centered
studies estimate that about 10 to 25% of workers
are predominantly amotivated (Howard et al.,
2016). The current meta-analytic results further
attest to the importance of amotivation by
showing its incremental value for understanding
employee outcomes. We therefore contend that
SDT scholars should not only focus on the
motivational types (i.e., quality of motivation),
but also on the amount of motivation (i.e.,
quantity of motivation)—and, importantly,
include amotivation alongside SDT’s different
types of motivation in order to fully understand
employees’ motivation in the workplace.
Most importantly, the results highlight that
there are clear advantages in considering the
motivational regulations separately rather than
in composites (e.g., a relative autonomy index,
or autonomous versus controlled motivation).
These results align with the conclusions of
Howard et al. (2020), providing additional
meta-analytic insights demonstrating that con-
sidering the regulations separately may not only
lead to more explained variance, it also allows
for a more nuanced understanding of the
implications of motivation on employee func-
tioning, thus offering more nuanced guidelines
for interventions.
First and foremost, it is not advisable to group
external and introjected regulations together to
form a construct of controlled motivation, as the
use of such a composite score masks their dif-
ferential effects. Non-significant results of
controlled motivation may be driven by the non-
significant population correlations of external
regulation with the various aspects of employee
well-being, attitudes and behavior; and it may
also mask the more nuanced and complex find-
ings of introjected regulation.
Grouping identified and intrinsic motivation
into the composite of autonomous motivation
may be less problematic, as both relate to out-
comes in the same direction. However, such an
approach would miss out on the difference in the
strength of the relations of these two types of
motivation with employee well-being and
behavior (e.g., Koestner & Losier, 2002), and
further prevent research verifying the effects of
targeted interventions on each type of motiva-
tion. Future research therefore needs to consider
the role of each type of motivation. While this
can be achieved through the use of highly
complex bi-factor models (Howard et al., 2020),
this meta-analysis also points to the viability of
using relative weights analysis as a way to cir-
cumvent potential issues of multicollinearity
when bi-factor modeling is not feasible. We do
not recommend the use of regression analysis as
the current meta-analytic correlations (available
upon request) highlighted that multicollinearity
would lead to unreliable regression coefficients
when the different types of motivation are
included simultaneously, leading to suppression
effects and Heywood cases.
Contributions to the motivation literature. This
meta-analysis also amplifies SDT’s contribution
to the wider literature on (employee) motivation.
First, the results regarding the associations with
intrinsic and identified motivation make clear
there is not necessarily a tradeoff between
motivating employees to perform well and/or
sustaining their health-related well-being, as
suggested by the HR-literature (Van De Voorde
et al., 2012); enhancing both types of employee
autonomous motivation is likely to lead to both
outcomes. SDT’s types of motivation may also
help explain why focusing on HR-practices that
increase external regulation (e.g., performance-
contingent pay; Gagn´ e & Forest, 2008) or
introjected regulation (e.g. employee of the
month programs; Johnson & Dickinson, 2010)
262 Organizational Psychology Review 11(3)
<<<PAGE=24>>>
may have no or limited effects on performance
and raise well-being issues.
Second, the importance of identified regula-
tion for employee outcomes is in line with, and
contributes to the reviving of, research on the
meaning of work (Allan et al., 2019; Rosso et al.,
2010). We complement this line of work,
showing that meaningful work may not only
relate to well-being (Allan et al., 2019), but
also—and particularly—contributes to predict-
ing performance. Moreover, SDT may help to
solve some issues regarding the conceptualiza-
tion of “meaning.” When people identify with
extrinsic reasons to engage in a particular
behavior, they bring together bothinter-personal
and intra-personalexperiences into one coherent
sense of self—and meaning can therefore be
derived from both other and self-oriented
experiences (Bailey et al., 2019). SDT further
specifies identified regulation as an autonomous
extrinsic type of motivation, which helps us to
understand why employees may find meaning in
work because it serves another end (i.e., extrinsic
motivation), yet experience this type of moti-
vation as internal (Hackman & Oldham, 1976).
Our findings indicate that theories that use the
intrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy are too simplistic
to capture this important nuance. This shows
how SDT may help to understand and reconcile
issues or inconsistencies regarding facets of
motivation in the broader literature on organi-
zational psychology.
The results pertaining to introjected regula-
tion point at the importance of specifying moti-
vational constructs. We see at least four reasons
why introjected regulation has these mixed cor-
relates. First, introjected regulation includes both
a focus on avoiding emotions that pose a threat
to one’s self esteem (e.g., guilt, shame) and
striving for positive emotions that may boost
one’s self-esteem (e.g., pride). Our moderation
analysis could not find any differences in the
strength of the relations of introjected regulation
operationalized in different ways—except for
burnout, which was more strongly associated
with scales tapping into avoiding negative
emotions than with an (un)balanced mix of
approach and avoidance items. However, a true
comparison with solely approach oriented
introjected regulation could not be made, as no
such scales are available within organizational
psychology. We would encourage future
research to look further into this issue and inte-
grate approach/avoidance theories (e.g., Carver,
2006; Higgins, 2002; Kuhl, 2000) with SDT.
Such research could allow us to see whether
initial findings showing that avoidance intro-
jected regulation is more detrimental than a
focus on approach introjected regulation (Assor
et al., 2009) can be replicated and generalized
across contexts.
Second, even when focusing on either
approach or avoidance, measures for introjected
regulation can be criticized for including an
amalgam of negative (e.g., guilt and shame) and
positive (e.g., pride) emotions. Yet, each of
these emotions represent qualitatively different
constructs, with external shame and hubristic
pride for example being more negatively re-
lated to outcomes than internal shame and au-
thentic pride (Kim et al., 2011; Tracy & Robins,
2007). Third, moderating variables may alter
the implications of these discrete emotions.
Shame may for example lead employees to
engage in either OCB or CBW, depending on
the reparability and injustice of the situation
(Daniels & Robinson, 2019). Apart from these
self-relevant emotions, the focus on maintain-
ing or improving one’s self-esteem included in
introjected regulation (Leary, 2007) may be a
fourth aspect, adding ambivalence to intro-
jected regulation, as a f ocus on self-esteem
may only lead to negative consequences if it
pertains to contingent self-esteem (Ferris et al.,
2009). Future research could further investigate
whether, and under what circumstances, the
various aspects inherent in introjected regula-
tion may associate differently with employee
outcomes.
Notably, some SDT-scholars argue that the
heterogeneity inherent in introjected regulation
represents the “partially internalized” nature of
Van den Broeck et al. 263
<<<PAGE=25>>>
this type of motivation (Deci & Ryan, 2000).
Introjected regulation is neither clearly con-
trolled, nor clearly autonomous, but rather falls
somewhere in between—and therefore will, by
definition, result in a mix of desirable and
undesirable outcomes. Our results pointing at
the Janus-face of introjected regulation are in
line with this perspective and expand previous
results demonstrating that introjected regula-
tion is equidistant between external and iden-
tified regulation (Howard et al., 2017), with
moderately positive factor loadings on a gen-
eral factor of self-determination (Howard et al.,
2018). In any case, our results overall indicate
that managers should withhold from fostering
employee motivation through introjected regu-
lation, and focus instead on increasing autono-
mous types of motivation instead.
Finally, our results for external regulation
stand in sharp contrast with studies of extrinsic
motivation and monetary incentives (Cerasoli
et al., 2014), and the ubiquitous use of man-
agement methods that coerce employees into
behaving in certain ways through the use of
reinforcements, monitoring, and sanctions. For
example, the literature within HRM strongly
supports the effectiveness of monetary-based
incentives (Shaw & Gupta, 2015), and the
prevalence of individual reward schemes in
contemporary organizations likewise assume a
positive effect on employee outcomes. The lit-
erature from SDT summarized here provides
critical nuances to these strongly held beliefs.
First, our findings indicate that external regu-
lation, which likely results from striving for
rewards and avoiding punishments, is far less
strongly related to performance than the other
types of motivation. This may be explained by
previous meta-analytic findings that incentives
are more strongly related to how much one
performs (i.e., how much output one generates),
and less predictive of performance quality (i.e.,
creativity, quality of the output; Cerasoli et al.,
2014). Although the current results did not
allow us to differentiate between these types of
performance, delivering high quality
performance is increasingly important in the
context of work (Carpini et al., 2017). This then
brings into question the value of motivating
employees externally. Second, and perhaps
most notably, HRM and management studies
typically examine turnover and performance of
employees following incentivization interven-
tions, but rarely do they consider the well-being
implications (Jiang et al., 2015; Shaw & Gupta,
2015). We show that external regulation is
likely to have a negative impact on employee
well-being. Such an effect may well lead to
further problems over time, including perfor-
mance issues and turnover, and as such may not
be as beneficial as is believed. We argue that
much progress can be made through better
integration of these literatures, building upon
the current findings to inform future research.
Limitations and suggestions for future
research
This meta-analysis has some limitations, which
may also inspire future research to advance the
study of employee motivation through SDT’s
multidimensional perspective. First, the quality
of this meta-analyses is of course based on the
quality of the primary studies. As the majority
of research included in this meta-analysis relied
on cross-sectional correlational survey designs,
shared method variance and self-report bias
may have obscured our results (Podsakoff et al.,
2003). There is a clear need for longitudinal and
quasi-experimental research that would meet
more causality criteria so we can improve our
understanding of how the various types of work
motivation influence work-related outcomes.
Second, parts of the literature on SDT’s
multidimensional view on motivation include
very few studies. This limited the sample size on
which some of the effect sizes were based (e.g.,
relations with CWB, the relations of amotiva-
tion, moderation analysis) and forced us to
aggregate several constructs into a broader
category (e.g., CWB includes withdrawal as well
as interpersonal deviance) to have sufficient
264 Organizational Psychology Review 11(3)
<<<PAGE=26>>>
sample numbers to run analyses. This may have
influenced the precision of some of our esti-
mates. The limited number of available corre-
lations also prevented us from modeling the
structural relations among our variables and
testing research questions pertaining to, for
example, the relative importance of motivation
types for various aspects of performance,
including the quantity and quality of work.
Answering such questions would be informative
in understanding the extent to which results
differ for hedonic (e.g., happiness) versus
eudemonic (e.g., mindfulness) well-being (Ryan
et al., 2008).
The results of our meta-analysis clearly
demonstrate SDT’s focus on positive outcomes,
much in line with the 20-year-old criticism that
SDT does not account for the “dark side” of
human functioning (Pyszczynski et al., 2000).
Although scholars have since broadened their
scope and started to include ill-being (e.g.,
distress), this criticism is still very applicable to
the behavioral outcomes studied to date. Future
research could include more negative beha-
viors, such as antisocial behaviors (e.g., devi-
ance, sabotage, theft, cheating; e.g., Tremblay
et al., 2009) as this would increase our
understanding of whether externally regulated
people just “don’t contribute” in organiza-
tions, as our current results suggest, or whether
they actively cause trouble (e.g., conflict, cheat-
ing, etc.).
We also encourage future research to dis-
entangle the finding that all types of motiva-
tion (except external) were important for
performance. Relations between the types of
motivation and performance may not be
straightforward, and might depend on abilities
(Van Iddekinge et al., 2014), task character-
istics, and types of performance (Byron &
Khazanchi, 2012; Cerasoli et al., 2014). Con-
sequently, it may be that external regulation is
particularly relevant for task performance on
simple/boring tasks, while identified regula-
tion may be more relevant for complex tasks
that require extended effort, and intrinsic
motivation more relevant for interesting or
creative tasks. This would nuance earlier
findings focusing on performance quantity and
quality in the context of work (Cerasoli et al.,
2014) and shed light on which of the types of
motivation are likely to predict diverse per-
formance criteria such as proficiency, crea-
tivity, being a good team player, and adapting
to rapid changes.
We would also encourage scholars to move
beyond the study of SDT’s types of motiva-
tion in and of itself, and in relation to other
OB-related constructs, and integrate other mo-
tivational theories. Previous research in the
domain of work, for example, have endeavored
to marry the different types of motivation with
goal achievement theory. On the one hand, such
studies show that autonomous motivation is
related to mastery-approach goals; while con-
trolled motivation and amotivation relates to
mastery-avoidance goals and both performance-
approach and -avoidance goals (Vanthournout
et al., 2015). On the other hand, intrinsic moti-
vation and mastery-approach goals also predict
outcomes such as work effort (Dysvik &
Kuvaas, 2013). We welcome future research that
sheds more light on the temporal and synergistic
effects of SDT’s and other types of motivation in
order to facilitate a more integrated literature on
work motivation.
Relatedly, such studies could also make use
of profile analysis to see which types of moti-
vation naturally co-occur with SDT’s types of
motivation. Previous studies have differentiated
employees based on profiles characterized by
different levels of the types of motivation (e.g.,
Howard et al., 2016; Van den Broeck et al.,
2013). Whereas these studies adopt a person-
oriented perspective, our meta-analysis is
among the first to meta-analytically examine
the nomological network of each of the various
types of motivation from a variable centered
perspective. Our results may therefore help
profile studies further interpret their results and
inform the literature about the added value of
both approaches. Moreover, to shed further
Van den Broeck et al. 265
<<<PAGE=27>>>
light on the specific nature of the types of
motivation, future research may examine more
closely the implications of holding various
types of motivation at the same time by looking
at their interactions. Previous research indicates
that the specific combination of high autono-
mous and low controlled motivation is associ-
ated with high levels of performance; while a
combination of low autonomous and high
controlled motivation is associated most
strongly with distress (Grant et al., 2011;
Strauss et al., 2017). As our results provided
evidence for differential effects among the
autonomous as well as the controlled motiva-
tion types, a nuanced perspective examining the
implications of interactions between the types
of motivation may provide additional insights.
Practical implications
The results of this meta-analysis show that
when organizations want to achieve employee
well-being, positive attitudes, and performance,
they should shy away from trying to motivate
employees to work through incentives and
sanctions; external regulation was shown to be
the least potent form of motivation to regulate
performance, and was also associated with high
well-being costs. Instead, organizations should
nurture intrinsic motivation, perhaps through
motivating, job design (Van den Broeck et al.,
2016), or autonomy support from colleagues
(Jungert et al., 2018) or supervisors (Slemp
et al., 2018), as intrinsic motivation is most
strongly associated with employee optimal
functioning. However, organizations are not
limited to solely promoting intrinsic motiva-
tion. Though intrinsic motivation is the best
predictor for most outcomes, when it comes to
work performance and OCB, identified regu-
lation is potentially more important. This means
that organizations should not only think about
how to make jobs more fun and interesting, but
should also concentrate on creating meaning
by, for example, increasing the perceived
impact of one’s work on beneficiaries (Grant,
2012). Leaders can also articulate a compelling
vision that speaks to the values of their
employees, which is the hallmark of transfor-
mational and charismatic leadership research
(Bass & Avolio, 1995). All in all, our results
highlight the importance of differentiating
between the various types of motivation, above
a n db e y o n dt h e i rg e n e r a ld e g r e eo fs e l f -
determination or categorization into autono-
mous and controlled motivation. Organizations
can therefore strategically decide which type of
motivation they want to foster in order to
achieve the outcomes they value the most.
Conclusion
Self-determination theory has become a popular
theory within organizational psychology (see
also Deci et al., 2017; Van den Broeck et al.,
2016). Taking stock of this growing body of
literature, this meta-analysis revealed that dif-
ferentiating between each of the various types of
motivation is valuable for understanding
employee well-being, attitudes, and behavior.
The available empirical evidence also provided
additional detail to SDT’s overall theoretical
statement that the correlates of the different
types of motivation become more and more
positive as autonomy increases (Deci & Ryan,
2000). It seems that, in some cases, identified
regulation may be more important than intrinsic
motivation. Introjected regulation is an ambiva-
lent type of motivation, while external regulation
has small positive associations with performance
and negative relations with well-being. Our
results show that amotivation should be consid-
ered too in SDT research, particularly because it
is strongly associated with distress and low
performance. Given the promising results
regarding the incremental and discriminant
validity of SDT’s various types of motivation,
we encourage scholars to further invest in
examining their differential effects in more
detail. Such endeavors should, however, make
use of more nuanced analysis such as RWA, and
rely on more ambitious research methods so that
266 Organizational Psychology Review 11(3)

firmer conclusions can be drawn on the impor-
tance of the quality of employee motivation.
