EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
There is growing recognition of the critical role of evaluations to generate relevant information 
to guide the decisions and actions of polic y makers and project managers. Yet, there is poor 
understanding of the demand and supply of evaluations in many African countries. This study 
seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by generating deeper insights on the demand and supply of 
evaluations in Ghana,  as one of the five country cases conducted by the regional Centre for 
Learning on Evaluation and Results fo r Anglophone Africa (CLEAR AA).  Ghana was selected 
based on an assessment as having a high potential to develop evaluation capacity.  
The objectives  of the study were to understand t he conditions under which demand is 
generated for evaluation evidence  and the areas in which evaluation supply can be 
strengthened to meet and foster this demand.  To achieve these objectives assessments were 
undertaken of:  (a) the development context for evaluations in Ghana; (b) the demand for 
evaluation; (c) the various entities supplying evaluations and their capacities; (d) the areas in 
which supply can be strengthened to meet and foster this demand;  and  (e) pathways t o 
develop evaluation capacities both on the demand and supply side, involving government, civil 
society, Parliament and voluntary organisations for professional evaluation (VOPE). 
This study was carried out through a combination of desk review, including a n analysis of 
existing evaluation products, and direct semi -structured interviews with a selection of key 
informants from across critical stakeholder groupings. 
Key findings include the following: (a) practically all of the evaluation work don e in Ghana so far 
has been development partner  led, with little involvement of Ghanaian organisations and 
professionals; (b) the demand and supply of evaluations is greatly influenced by the socio -
political context; (c) there is an enabling environment for evaluation c apacity development in 
Ghana, given its deepening democratic culture as well as an emerging vibrant VOPE. 
Based on the findings, the possible areas of interv entions include: (a) using the Joint 
Assessment for Strengthening Monitorin g and Evaluation and Sta tistics (JASMES) as a platform 
for evaluation capacity development ; (b) support ing the development of evaluation policy in 
Ghana; and (c) supporting the capacity development of Parliament to demand evaluations as 
part of their mandate. 
The paper also recommends that whatever actions are to be taken, it is important that the 
political economy of the country is taken into consideration. The key argument here is that the 
development of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) must be rooted in the sociocultural context 
of the Ghanaian people. As noted by Levi (2011) and Leftwich (2006), the way forward in 
promoting effective monitoring and evaluation, and for that matter, development is to focus on 
an approach that is best suited to the local social and political context.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1. This study reports on findings concerning the demand and supply of evaluation/evaluative 
research in Ghana. It is one of five country cases conducted by the Regional Centre for 
Learning on Evaluation and Results for Anglophone Africa (CLEAR AA) 2, funded by the UK 
Department for International Development (DFID). The fieldwork was carried out by the 
CLEAR AA partner institution, the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration 
(GIMPA), with the support of a CLEAR AA consultant, mainly during the period July 22 to 27, 
2013. This study builds  upon a previous case study by Amoatey (2012) on Monitoring and 
Evaluation System in Ghana: With a focus on the link between planning and budgeting , also 
commissioned by CLEAR AA with the South African Presidency. 
2. This report maps demand and supply factors affecting evaluation and evaluative research. It 
is hoped that national stakeholders and those supporting them will use this report to better 
structure their assistance. Consequently, the principal audience of this study is intended to 
be those interested in evaluation capacity development (ECD) in Ghana. In undertaking the 
mapping of the evaluation context in Ghana , the study identifies latent and actual demand, 
the conditions under which demand is generated and potential sources of supply, with an 
explicit consideration of the political economy of the country3.  
3. This study refers to evaluation as covering both evaluation and evaluative research and 
therefore uses the terms interchangeably.  The primary objectives of the study are to 
explore:  
1) The conditions under which demand is generated for evaluation evidence; and 
2) The areas in wh ich evaluation supply can be strengthened to meet and foster this 
demand. 
The guiding questions that interface with these objectives are:  
(i) On the demand side:  
a) What has been the actual demand for evaluation from principals?  
b) Where is there latent and potential demand for evaluation? 
c) How is evaluation demanded in the current organisational arrangements? 
(ii) On the supply side:  
a) What is the range and capacity of entities supplying evaluation services? 
b) How relevant are the managers and producers of evaluation  to the actual 
demand for evaluation? 
(i) On matching evaluation supply and demand: 
c) Where can evaluation supply (actual, latent and potential) be strengthened so 
that it meets and fosters demand? 
 
4. This study has revealed that actual demand for evaluation from the executive and 
legislature has been very limited. The low latent demand is mainly due to the following

Johannesburg. CLEAR-AA aims to enhance development anchored in learning, evaluation and results.

reasons: (a) lack of awareness that evaluation can provide relevant evidence. This then 
leads to lack of actual demand for evaluations and (b) lack of  adequate capacities to 
commission and to conduct evaluations. In general, study reveals that funds allocated to 
M&E are low, and particularly low for evaluation. 
1.1 Methodology 
5. This study was carried out through a combination of desk review, including an  analysis of 
existing evaluation products, and direct semi -structured interviews with a selection of 
informants from across critical stakeholder groupings. The rest of this section presents the 
methodology of the study, and provides an overview of the stak eholder groups that were 
engaged with in the study. The methodology encompassed the following overlapping 
stages:  
a. Establishing study commitment and support from key stakeholders;  
b. Collating and analysing primary and secondary data and information of the 
evaluation system (including available academic and popular literature);  
c. Conducting a series of interviews with actors that fall within the space established 
through the broad conceptual map; and 
d. Producing a draft paper. Each of these stages is discussed in more detail below. 
6. Establishing support from key stakeholders:  Given the nature of the study, an important 
initial step was to identify relevant national stakeholders who would be engaged with prior 
to, during and after the collection of data. Whilst the study was conducted independently, it 
is important that there is some level of active buy -in from key stakeholders to support the 
use of the study. In Ghana, letters were sent to the Government via DFID to inform about 
the study, while the country researc her made contact with a range of stakeholders 4 (see 
Table 1).  
7. Collating and analysing secondary data and information:  The collation of and analysis of 
secondary data covered policy, academic and grey literature relating to the political context 
and the de mand and supply side of evaluation. Included in this was data on size and scope 
of evaluation initiatives within government and the supply that emanates outside of 
government. Following the country research phase further primary and secondary 
documentation was considered in order to substantiate the claims of the interviews and to 
expand the information base.  
8. Interviews with key informants:  A series of interviews were arranged with key in -country 
stakeholders. The design of these interviews drew upon the l iterature review. In particular, 
issues of actual and latent demand and of evaluation capacities were explored through the 
interview process. Data collection took place in a semi -structured way that allowed people 
to narrate their story â with some probing  taking place based upon the guiding supply and 
                                                      
4 Ministries for Health and Education were not included because evaluation studies in these ministries are well documented 
(see also Appendix A for List of some Evaluations conducted in Ghana by sector).

demand questions. The data from interviews was analysed during the fieldwork, with 
emerging conclusions refined and subjected to validation during the last set of interviews  
9. Time constraints for both respondents and the study team  impacted on the methodology 
used and the number of potential respondents that could be contacted. Table 1 presents 
the representatives of stakeholders that were interviewed in Ghana.

10. This study is a standalone report, which is part of the work done by CLEAR AA on evaluation 
supply and demand  in five countries. The findings of this  country case are presented 
according to the following sequence: the Ghanaian development context is described in 
relation to evaluation, then the state of evaluation demand a nd supply is mapped, followed 
by illustrations of supply and demand issues. Finally, pathways are suggested to develop 
evaluation capacities both on the demand and supply side 
2. DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT  
11. The section presents an overview of trends in the politi cal and economic development of 
Ghana and the strategic direction of the country. It also discusses Ghana's political economy 
and national development planning processes and how these are linked to national 
budgeting process and monitoring and evaluation framework in the country. 
12. Ghana was the first country in Sub -Saharan Africa to gain political independence from the 
British in 1957. It has since undergone major political and economic transformation and 
development. Over the past six decades, Ghana has experienced 11 changes in government, 
which includes four coups (Guseh 2005; Adams and Atsu 2013). Ghanaâs journey toward 
democracy is seen by many as a reaction to economic challenges of the 1980s associated 
with implementation of Economic Recovery Programme s (ERP) and Structural Adjustment 
Programmes (SAP) (Ninsin, 2007). Deepening the democratic process was expected not only 
to promote a platform for the emergence of a popular, legitimate, and responsible 
constituency for continued economic reform , but to a lso create a new governance

framework for achieving sustainable development (Whitfield and Jones, 2009).  Currently, 
Ghana practices a multiparty parliamentary democracy based on the 1992 Constitution.  
13. The Fourth Republican Constitution, which came into fo rce in 1992, provides for a unitary 
state governed by a President (and Cabinet) and a Unicameral National Assembly. It 
entrenches the separation of powers and offers appropriate checks and balances. The 
presidency has a four -year term and an incumbent can serve for a maximum of two terms. 
Since 1992, Ghana has held five (5) successful elections and on two occasions (2000 and 
2008) an incumbent government handing over peacefully to a new government. These 
highly contested elections have helped to deepen and institutionalise democracy in Ghana.  
14. In the most recent  election in 2012 , the ruling government party (National Democratic 
Congress) won by a margin of less than 1%, after which the main opposition party (New 
Patriotic Party  - NPP) contested the election results through the courts. The proceedings 
were broadcast live on both radio and television to enhance the transparency and 
legitimacy of the courtâs decision . After eight months and 48 days of hearing s, the Supreme 
Court of Ghana dismissed all the allege d claims of irregularity and fraud. The Presidential 
candidate of the NPP indicated that he would not seek a review of the courtâs decision, and 
congratulated the President and asked Ghanaians to come together to build the nation 
(Gurien, 2013). Freedom Ho use Report (2013) shows only 14.5 percent of the world's 
citizens live in countries that enjoy a free press and Ghana is the only country on the African 
continent to have what they define as a free press. 
15. Embedded democratic process is an important as it provides a strong mechanism for 
periodic review of the performance of government. Further, within a strong democratic 
regime, it is more likely that misguided  or bad policies will not only be brought to light but 
also challenged and appropriate changes mad e (Lawson, Boadi, Ghartey, Killick, Agha and 
Williamson, 2007).  
16. On the economic front, Ghana has a diverse and rich resource base, with estimated 2013 
gross domestic product ( GDP) per capita  of USD 1 670. According to the African 
Development Bank  (AfDB 2013), economic growth for 2012 was 7.1%, driven by oil 
revenues, the services sector and the strong export performance of cocoa and gold.  
Ghana's consistent economic growth has impacted positively on poverty reduction. 
According to the World Bank (2013), poverty at $2 per day dro pped from 77% in 1992 to 
63% in 1998, to 51.8% in 2006 .  Extreme poverty at $1.25 per day  fell from 51% in 1992, to 
39% in 1998, to 26% in 2006 . Ghana is projected to meet the MDG of reducing extreme 
poverty before the 2015 deadline (GOG, 2010). Other MDGs  that are on track include 
universal primary education, promotion of gender equality, empowerment of women, and 
combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (AfDB, 2013). 
17. Although t he country attained a middle income status in 2010,  it remains somewhat 
dependent on international financial and technical assistance. Despite the decline  in 
poverty, geographical, gender and disparities in poverty levels based on economic activity 
of population exist across the country. Poverty is highest among food crop farmers, who are 
mostly in rural areas of the country, where inadequate inputs, credit and limited use of 
technology lead to low agricultural productivity (Whitfield 2009).

18. Ghana gets development aid in the form of budgetary and project support. The net official 
development assistance and official aid received (aid/GDP) to Ghana increased from 0.2% in 
1960 to 2% in 1970, 4% in 1980, 9.5 % in 1990 and peaked to a high of 16% in 2004. By 
2011, however, the amount recei ved had reduced to 4.5% (World Bank  2013). The 
Government of Ghana (GoG) and its main development partners  introduced m ulti-donor 
budgetary support (MDBS) in 2003. Itâs objective is to  improve aid effectiveness by aligning 
development assistance to government âs aim of attaining the MDGs and mid dle income 
status by 2015 and 2020 and enhance the predictability of aid  to this end. About a third of 
external assistance is channelled directly through the consolidated funds. The resource 
triggers under the MDBS are based on governmentâs own fiscal and development targets 
agreed with the donor partners, which are in turn based on governmentâs medium -term 
development plans  (Lawson et al 2007; Osei, 2012). In fact, t he Ghana Aid Policy and 
Strategy (2010-2015) identifies General Budget Support or Sector Bu dget support as the 
preferred delivery mechanism. While Ghana is on-track toward achieving some of the MDGs, 
it achieved a middle-income status in 2010, about five years earlier than the original target . 
Accordingly, the Ghana Aid Policy and Strategy aims to ensure aid effectiveness by aligning 
aid to Ghana 's national development priorities  and serves as a guide to government, 
development partners, civil society organis ations and other stakeholders in the 
management and coordination of external aid in Ghana. 
2.1 Planning, Policy and the M&E framework 
19. Development planning started during colonial rule. Over the last 95 years, Ghana has gone 
through 13 national development plans prepared by various governments and with varying 
degrees of implementation and succ ess (see Table 2). The country's first ever development 
plan, t he âGuggisburg Planâ,  was developed in 1919 and implemented between 1920 and 
1927. The primary objective of that p lan was to build a model economy in Africa  through 
large investment in infrastr ucture, health, education and agricultural diversification. The 
plan was to lay a solid foundation for Ghana's future socio-economic development.  
20. The second development plan was the 1951 ten -year development plan that was launched 
by the colonial governme nt and later consolidated as an ambitious five -year development 
plan by Kwame Nkrumahâs government. The third and most noteworthy development plan 
was the comprehensive seven -year development plan for national reconstruction and 
development (1963/64 -1969/70) that sought a complete diversification of the Ghanaian 
economy through import substitution.  The plan included the Tema harbour and the Valco 
aluminium plant. The first (Guggisberg) and third (Nkrumah) plans have been described as 
the most popular (Owusu-Amoah, 2013). Table 2 below presents key national development 
plans 1919 and 2013. 
21. The most recent  development plans are the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 1), 
the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) and the Ghana Shared Growth and 
Development Agenda (GSGDA). GPRS I  was a broad based development strategy for 
accelerated growth and poverty reduction focused primarily on attaining macroeconomic 
stability; improved environment for doing business; and improved political governance. It 
focused heavily on poverty reduction programmes and projects.

22. A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan was established to track the performance of GPRS 
I with respect to its effectiveness and to identify and resolve emerging implementa tion 
bottlenecks in the policy. Monitoring results are documented and disseminated by the 
National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) through annual progress reports (APRs). 
The GPRS I M&E Plan was the first systematic attempt by Government to include M&E  in 
the governance framework and management process, at a policy level (Amoatey 2012). 
The main challenges with the GPRS I M&E Plan were poor coordination of information from 
district, regional to national levels , as well as weak institutional capacities, particularly of 
NDPC and Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) (NDPC, 2009). 
23. GPRS I was follo wed by GPRS II with the objective of supporting wealth creation for 
sustainable poverty reduction through the introduction of growth -inducing policies and 
programmes. A new M&E plan developed for GPRS II provided a more coherent framework 
for monitoring ac hievement of development goals and objectives. It outlined the 
institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities, the major monitoring and evaluation  
activities to be performed, mechanism s for disseminating findings and how the outputs of 
the monitoring and evaluation  system would be used to influence policy at the national, 
regional, and district as well as sector levels. Betley, Bird and Ghartey (2012) argue that the

monitoring and evaluation of the GPRS in the areas of  strategic budgeting and budget  
planning could be improved.  
24. The Ghana Shared Growth  and Development Agenda (GSGDA) was implemented in 2010. 
GSGDA focuses, in the main on:  
human development, transparent and accountable governance and infrastructural 
development, in support of agricultural modernisation, natural resource development, 
particularly oil and gas, private sector development, ICT, housing and energy for 
accelerated employment creation and income ge neration for poverty reduction 
(NDPC 2010: xiv).  
The framework also envisages p rotecting the environment and minimis ing the impacts of 
climate change. The GSGDA includes a full chapter on monitoring and evaluation, which will 
be considered later in this study. The implementation of the GSGDA is expected to end at 
the close 2013.  
25. The primary means of influencing public policy management with evaluation  results is 
through the national  budget . This is done through state  institutions  and  governance 
apparatus including the Cabinet, Parliament, Ministry of Finance, and NDPC. 
26. Ghanaâs Constitution establishes institutional arrangements for undertaking monitoring and 
evaluation of policies and programmes at all levels of government . According to the 1992 
Constitution of Gha na (Chapter 8, Article 87, 2) the National Development Planning 
Commission (NDPC) is required to âmonitor, evaluate and co-ordinate development policies, 
programmes and projectsâ  at the request of the President or Parli ament, or on its own 
initiative. The National Development Planning Commission Ac t (479 of 1994)  which 
establishes the  NDPC, while Act 480, on the decentralised development planning system, 
requires District Planning Authorities to âmonitor and evaluate the development policies, 
programmes and projects in the districtâ.  Accordingly, the NDPC  has initiated a process to 
provide a new national development agenda to guide the development of the country over 
the next four years (Owusu-Amoah, 2013). 
27. In addition, District Planning Co-Ordinating Units are expected to monitor and evaluate the 
implementation of the p rogrammes and projects of the District Planning Authorities within 
the region . Regional Planning Co -ordinating Units are responsible for the co -ordination, 
monitoring and evaluatio n of district development plans. T he districts use a Functional 
Organisation Assessment Tool  (FOAT) for assessing local governments  which will be 
discussed in some detail in Section 4.  
28. Each ministry, department and agency (MDA) is required to have a Policy, Planning, 
Monitoring and Evaluation Division (PPMED) w ith responsibility for planning and 
implementing M&E  within the sector, at national, regional and district levels. Other key 
institutions with M&E responsibilitie s at the national level include the Office of the 
President ( which established a Policy Evaluation and Oversight Unit (PEOU)  in 2009, to 
monitor and evaluate  government policies, programmes and projects) ; Parliament; Ghana 
Statistical Service (GSS) and the Ministry of Finance.

29. The NDPC is expected to be in continuous dialogue with the Ministry of Finance and 
Economic Planning (MoFEP), GSS, Office of the President, Ministry of Local Government, 
Rural Development and Environment (MLGRDE), other MDAs, development partners and 
civil society on all planning and monitoring and evaluation  matters. The NDPC works 
through cross-sectoral planning groups (CSPGs) for policy formulation, planning, mon itoring 
and evaluation purposes. This multi-level design is represented through a diagram that has 
been used in different pu blications (including the GSGDA and  the current PRSP) to sho w 
Ghanaâs national M&E system (Figure 1).

30. Achieving the objective s of the national monitoring and evaluation  system requires 
adhering to common timeframes for performance review and reporting to government. The 
institutional arrangements have been designed to facilitate active pa rticipation of 
stakeholders to ensure that policy recommendations are relevant and actually contribute to 
policy formulation and efficient resource allocation and use. The framework depicts flow of

information from district to regional to national levels, key actors in the national M&E 
framework and their roles and responsibilities. 
31. There are three aspects of the M&E framework to note. First, the omission of the Ministry 
of Finance (MoF), formerly called Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP). 
Given the importance of using evaluation for decisions concerning the budget the critical 
role of the MoF should be captured in the institutional arrangement  and as critical to M&E 
supply and demand . Second, the central role of NDPC is a challenge given the constraints 
the Commission has been facing for many years. Third, the framewor k describes 
information flows, actors and roles without any reference to purpose, that is, decision -
making, accountability and learning.  
32. The MoF and NDPC would comprise the central management agencies responsible for the 
M&E framework. The MoF is the key government institution responsible for the 
mobilisation, allocation and management of financial resources and for monitoring 
government expenditure. The NDPC advises the President and Parliament on the 
performance of public policy and programmes , their imp acts and on the need for policy 
reforms. As a result of this unique role and responsibility, the technical responsibility for 
coordinating the M&E system rests with NDPC in collaboration with GSS and MoF. Given the 
strategic position of NDPC in the formal M&E system, it may seem logical to consider NDPC 
the champion of evaluation in Ghana. This was the view in 1999, and it was also held by 
some of the persons interviewed for this study. But although NDPC during the last decade 
has been able to produce Annua l Reports which are used and appreciated by the public 
sector and civil society, the NDPCâs actual role in evaluation has been very limited. 
33. It has been argued that this is due to a lack of funding, but an alternative view is that 
insufficient funding may be a symptom rather than a cause of the problems faced by NDPC. 
Indeed, as pointed out in the âInstitutional Review of NDPCâ  carried out by the African 
Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET)5, an Accra based think tank:  
While the NDPCâs constitutional mandate is clear, the political economy has not been 
conducive for giving the commission the authority and tools it needs to execute. 
Strategies and programs are abruptly ended, especially with ch anges in government; 
the organis ational structure and proces ses are not suitable for its function; it lacks 
the necessary financial and human resources; and it is under constant pressure to 
attend to short-term social, political and economic needs. Consequently, the NDPC has 
not occupied the apex of Ghanaâs development planning system as spelt out in lawâ  
This statement applies also to the NDPCâs role in evaluation. It is relevant in the context of 
this study on evalua tion demand and supply in Ghana. ACETâs findings and 
recommendations (in the brief version that ha s been disclosed) proposes, âthat the 
president or the vice president should chair the NDPC to enhance its presence in the 
political economy.â

2.2 Political Economy  
34. In June 1999 a preliminary diagnosis of monitoring and evaluation capacities in Ghana wa s 
conducted by the Operations Evaluation Department of the World Bank, and in October 
1999 a workshop was held in Ghana, focusing on the role of civil society in the assessment 
of government performance  (Mackay and Gariba 2000). After 14 years there have b een 
some important changes, like the emergence of a Ghana Monitoring and Evaluation Forum, 
the development partnersâ commitments reflected in the Paris Declaration, Accra 
Ratification and Busan High Level Forum, as well as the Joint Agenda for Strength ening 
Monitoring and Evaluation  and Statistics (JASMES) initiative. However, there are important 
aspects that remain almost unchanged, particularly with respect to the almost negligible 
actual demand for evaluation from policy makers and civil society, and the  limited progress 
made by NDPC in promoting evaluation in Ghana. 
35. The slow progress made can be explaine d by political economy analysis which suggests that 
public authority and public goods required for development arise from domestic political 
processes an d contestation between interest groups. An example is the 13 different 
development plans for Ghana over the last century.  As noted by Owusu -Amoah (2013) the 
major challenge that has historically faced the development of Ghana is not the inability to 
formulate credible policies and strategies but rather the weak capacity to implement these 
policies and strategies effectively and sustainably. Some of the plans were truncated mid -
way through the plan period due to resource constraints and more importantly chan ges in 
government. It is worth noting some projects started by previous governments are 
abandoned with change of government apparently due to political expediency rather than 
efficiency use of recourses. For example, in Ghana, the NPP Government under Pres ident 
J.A. Kuffour initiated affordable housing programme in 2006 which were at different levels 
of completion but were abandoned with a changed in government in 2009. The new NDC 
Government on assumption of Office in 2009 initiated new affordable programm es rather 
than continuing what was started by the previous government. Such decisions are rooted in 
the desire of any governing party to be associated with new projects, programmes and 
policies. Indeed one of the priorities of President Mahamais to complet e the existing pipe -
line of projects. 
36. A âdrivers of changeâ study in Ghana by Booth, Crook, Gyimah-Boadi, Killick, Luckham, and 
Boateng (Booth et al. 2005 ) argues that political transformation through party compettion 
lies at the heart of reducing corruption and focusing the state on development. Other 
drivers of change include: intensified competition between political parties; the free  flow of 
information, accompanied by an â¨increasingly critical mass media and informed â¨public 
opinion; an increased role in national political, as well as economic, life of the diaspora of 
Ghanaian emigrants; vigorous growth of a civil society that combines strong social roots and 
a healthy mix of forms of interest representation. 
37. The relatively stable democracy and regular elections with changes in parties in power is a 
reflection of the growing public demand for good governance and accountability that ca n 
translate into tangible improvement in the living conditions of the citizens. In this regard the 
one of the key drivers of change in Ghana is present and is becoming an effective

instrument to focus government and other political office holders who are likely to be voted 
out upon results. Although challenges do remain in broadly dispersed patronage networks 
in the Ghanaian state  as shown by recent studies related to Policing (Tankebe 2013 ), 
Logging (Teye 2013) and in regards to the economy (Kelsall 2012) 
38. The growing public demand f or accountability and results, seems to be an incentive for any 
ruling government in Ghana to put in place mechanisms for self assessment towards 
meeting citizens demands. In this regard the Government in 2011, through the leadership of 
NDPC, undertook a s elf-assessment study of its capacity to Manage for Development 
Results (MfDR) using a capacity scan (CAP -Scan) methodology adopted to Ghana's context 
in order to identify its strengths and weaknesses, as well as to develop an action plan to 
improve the del ivery of public services in the country. CAP-Scan6 is a short -term diagnostic 
review to identify and prioritis e needs in the five pillars of MfDR: leadership, accountability 
and partnerships, monitoring and evaluation, planning and budgeting, and statistic s.  CAP-
Scan uses self-assessment with guided questions and a measurement framework, to explore 
these issues. An action plan is developed as part  of the exercise. The Ghana CAP -Scan was 
funded by the Swiss Government, implemented by NDPC and facilitated by the World Bank. 
An overview of the national MfDR capacity rankings by results is provided in Figure 2 using a 
4 point scale where 1 represents the awareness stage and 4 , full implementation. The 
ministries and institutions assessed were Ed ucation, Finance and Economic Planning, Ghana 
Statistical Service, Health, Local Government and Rural Development, Roads and Highways, 
Women and Children and the NDPC.

39. As can be observed from Figure 2 above, the MDAs are improving their accountability 
mechanisms but weak in areas like "leadership" and tracking of performance to feed into 
decisions. The most serious weakness, as pointed by almost all sectors , is the low capacity 
for the monitoring and evaluation of public policiesâ ( CAP-Scan 2011: 7). The 2011 review 
also identified weakness in statistics among MDAs, poor intra -ministry engagement in 
developing M&E plans and poor coordination  between governme nt and development 
partners (DPs).

40. Following this diagnostic study a task force was established under the Ghana M&E Sector 
Working Group (NDPC, Ministry of Trade and Industry ( MoTI), CIDA, UNICEF, UNFPA, WB) 
which later developed what has become known as the Joint Agenda for Strengthening 
Monitoring and Evaluation and Statistics (JASMES). The objective of JASMES is to provide 
donor and government funding with relevant information for supporting programmes and 
activities aimed at strengthening national, sec toral and district M&E and statistical systems 
for the timely and sustainable production, analysis and use of quality data for evidence -
informed decision -making, dialogue and accountability. It is expected to cover a ten year 
period, consistent with the tr ansitional arrangement under the GoG -DPs Compact which is 
aimed at strengthening country systems for effective policy management and coordination. 
The key beneficiary institutions are NDPC, GSS, MDAs, municipal, metropolitan and district 
assemblies (MMDAs) and civil society organisations ( CSOs). Table 3 provides a summary of 
the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of  the M&E and statistical 
system in Ghana. This SWOT analysis was used to inform the development of the JASMES.

41. JASMES is based on four pillars considered fundamental to a successful M& E and statistical 
system:  (a) intensive utilis ation of M&E information in one or more stages of the policy 
cycle; (b ) information that meets standards for data  quality and evaluation reliability; (c) 
resilience of the system to survive changes in administration, government ministers, or top 
officials; and most importantly (d ) leadership in the form of  senior level commitment to 
M&E and statistics, to the use of information and to ensuring a sustainable system. 
42. The JASMES would adopt a system -wide approach by focusing on the strategies required to 
enhance the national and sub -national capacities in M&E and statistics. Implementation of 
JASMES requires sustainable funding for M&E and statistics activities by MDAs. In preparing 
the 2012 -2014 budgets MoF requested al l MDAs to allocate between 2.5  to 3 percent  of 
their resources to M&E (JASMES 2011). Stakeholders of JASMES have proposed the 
establishment of pool funds from government in the form of a lump sum payment and from 
DPs through the direct transfer of funds. G overnment can make  contributions based on 
agreed annual w ork programme. The NDPC would be responsible for managing the pooled 
funds in close collaboration with Ghana Statistical Service.  Interventions would focus 
primarily on the  GSS, Office of the Preside nt (OoP), MDAs and MMDAs with the NDPC as 
focal point for coordination, monitoring and reporting. 
3. MAPPING EVALUATION DEMAND AND SUPPLY IN GHANA 
43. This section presents the mapping of evaluation demand and supply in Ghana. The mapping 
is guided by a concep tual framework  represented in Figure 3. The framework includes 
drivers that tend to stimulate various agents to demand or supply evaluations in Ghana. The 
interactions among those who demand and those who supply evaluations then reveals
<<<PAGE=22>>>

capacity gaps that if addressed could enhance effective demand and supply of evaluations 
in Ghana.

3.1 Principals  
44. The analysis of principals includes the executive, parliament (or leg islature), development 
partners and civil society. This group of stakeholders is placed together because they 
represent an array of the most important political actors who use and demand evaluation 
and are distinctive from government agents and evaluation agents. 
The Political Executives  
45. The executive arm of government is a major actual (or potential or latent) 7 source for 
demanding evaluations so as to provide evidence on the performance of various 
government policies and to distil lessons to guide policy  review. In this regard, the 
Presidency established a Policy Evaluation and Oversight Unit (PEOU)  in 2009 mandated to 
monitor and evaluate the implementation of the policies, programmes and projects of the 
                                                      
7 In contrast to actual or effective, that is demand that is actually made, âpotential demandâ is  the demand that does not 
become actual because of lack of funding, whereas âlatent demandâ Is the demand of which there is no awareness but is latent 
in the sense that there is a need for evidence which could be translated into a demand (for more elaborat ion of these concepts, 
see the Inception Report of this study).

various MDAs with the view of generating evidence to guide appropriate decision s and 
actions that can deli ver on the campaign promise of âbetter Ghanaâ. The  PEOU developed a 
web-based national data collection and analysis system that allows MDAs to regularly 
report on the status of the projects and programmes under the Better Ghana A genda.  This 
data system is called the Evidence Based Performance Management System (EBPMS) was 
aligned to the political priorities of the government. Some key informants expressed 
reservation that these priority areas of government, which are the focus of  PEOU, may be 
for political expediency and not necessarily linked to a long -term national vision. The PEOU 
was also noted to have inadequate technical personnel to effectively deliver on its mandate. 
46. Since February, 2013, the government appointed a Senior Policy Advisor to the President, 
who is considered to be doing similar work to PEOU. S ome informants expressed their 
suspicion that the appointment of a Policy Advisor to the President was a ploy to side -line 
PEOU, due to government di scomfort with PEOU op erations. The situation with the 
development of the PEOU is evolving as the new President develops his executive 
framework.  These suspicions may have merit in view of the recent complain ts by POEU of 
lack of resources to undertake its policy evaluation an d oversight activities and non-
cooperation from some MDAs in providing relevant data. It is surprising that a unit like 
POEU placed under the Office of the President should lack resources or p ower to undertake 
its work. Furthermore, the NDPC is also expected to provide evaluation feedback on various 
government policies and programmes to the Executive, which is similar to the role of POEU. 
Amoatey (2012) reported of consensus among the key informants interviewed that, over 
the years there are growing concern s and confusion about the conflicting roles between 
PEOU and the NDPC. There is clear need for harmonis ation of work and roles between 
POEU, the Policy Advisor to the President and NDPC.   
47. Furthermore, something remarkable in Ghana, in comparison with othe r SSA countries, is 
the evolution of a set of restrictions imposed on the Executive  (Fosu 2013) . Even though 
power is legally and constitutionally concentrated in the hands of the executive branch in 
general, and the president and the governing political p arty, the situation has evolved 
during the years towards a more diffuse power. This implies higher requirements for 
evidence-based decision -making at the decentralised levels and additional evaluation 
capacities.  
The Legislature  
48. Parliament is legally man dated to approve budgets and authoris e spending as well as 
demand accountability for the results generated through the spending of tax-payersâ money.  
The 1992 Constitution states that Parliament has full control over public finance. The 
Parliament of Ghan a is increasingly demanding accountability from some MDAs as the 
various sub-committees of Parliament occasionally visit projects of national importance to 
assess progress. Various Ministers have also been called to Parliament to give account of 
specific a spects of their work. Furthermore, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of 
Parliament makes use of Auditor -General (AG ) report s in mounting public hearings on 
irregularities identified in the report. However, issues such as the misapplication of funds 
recurring over the years suggest limited impact of the work of the PAC.
<<<PAGE=24>>>

49. For example, in the transmittal letter included in the Report of the Auditor -General on the 
Accounts of District Assemblies for the financial year ended 31 Dec ember 2011 to the 
Honourable Speaker, Office of Parliament, dated 28 December 2012, the Auditor -General 
wrote  
I had in my previous reports on the Management and Utilisation of the DACF, 
recommended to the Honourable Minister of Local Government and Rural 
Development to set up effective monitoring and follow -up mechanisms to track 
actions to be taken on my conclusions and recommendations in my audit reports and 
management letters (â¦) I wish to reluctantly conclude that the increased and 
widespread instances of malfeas ance and mismanagement of the finances and 
resources of the Assemblies by public officials as portrayed in my current report under 
review may be indicative that the Ministry has not significantly implemented the 
admonitions and recommendations in my previous reports .  
It is worthwhile to mention the finding of Betley , Bird and Gharety  (2012) that training of 
the media in the role of the PAC and the broadcasting of PAC hearings on radio and TV 
served to generate significant public interest and, consequently, to raise the standard of the 
proceedings (although not necessarily follow -up), as this can be one of the areas in which 
ECD could focus in Ghana and other countries. 
50. Despite various efforts by Parliament to demand accountability from the Executive, the 
response has been weak and Parliament on its own has not commissioned evaluations to 
generate evidence that can strengthen their demand for accountability. This may be 
attributed to insufficient awareness among parliamentarians o n the role of evaluation in 
holding the Executive accountable. In this regard, Parliament has a latent rather than actual 
demand for evaluations in Ghana. Further progress could be made by interventions that 
could awaken Parliamentâs demand for evaluations into an active one where th ey could 
directly commission evaluations on issues whenever necessary.  
51. Key informants during this study indicated that the demand for evaluations from political 
leaders is weakened by the growing tendency of some political leaders to maintain  their 
political power through vote -buying rather than through an ability to deliver development 
results tha t can convince the electorate. These continuing tendencies stand in tension to 
the growing demands for accountability and performance from the public.  
52. Parliament has a latent (rather than an actual or potential) demand  for evaluation . The 
Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts, for example, could benefit from 
commissioning evaluations on different topics  given a Constitutional provision which 
entitles the Par liament to request NDPC to undertake evaluations of policies.  Their 
presentations are televised  and the press reports on them. The work that STAR Ghana  
(Strengthening transparency accountability and responsiveness in Ghana)  has been carrying 
out with parliamentarians can be complemented with developing awareness that 
evaluation is a source of evidence for their committees, thus transforming their latent 
demand for evaluation into an effective demand.

Development Partners 
53. Most of the evaluations in Ghana  have been conducted by, or on behalf of, development 
partners, driven by their own requirements to evaluate operations supported by them. The 
triggers in multi donor budget support have become an incentive driving evaluations, but so 
far the involvement o f Ghanaian evaluators in managing or conducting these 
evaluations/joint reviews have been rather symbolic. The development partnersâ 
commitment to use and strengthen country systems (including evaluation systems), could 
have been a potential incentive, but  so far there is consensus among respondents that 
donor have not been using existing local capacities for conducting or managing evaluations. 
54. The major group of stakeholders who demand evaluations in Ghana are the development 
partners. Key development part ners in Ghana include World Bank, DFID, UNDP, FAO, GIZ 
and STAR-Ghana. Development partners have taken the initiative, and the lea d, in most of 
the evaluations that have been carried out in Ghana. The key motivation for evaluations of 
the projects  they sup port is to comply with their own accountability and learning 
requirements. However, if care is not taken to ensure that there is Ghanaian involvement 
and ownership in these evaluations, it  is unlikely that they will be actually used by the 
country.  
55. In fac t, there is no updated repository or inventory of evaluations carried out by 
development partners in Ghana. The Ghana M&E Forum (GMEF) had a good initiative i n 
elaborating such an inventory  but it was interrupted in 2010  due to financial resource 
constraints to continue performing this function. The GMEF repository can be 
complemented by the Ghana evaluations included in the Organisations for Economic 
Cooperation and Development Development Assistance Committee (OECD -DAC) evaluation 
resource centre8.  
56. The study on âResources Spent on M&E and Statisticsâ (NDPC 2011) provides an estimate of 
the support offered by development partners for de veloping M&E capacity in Ghana. 
However, the appendix included in that document  on available funding alerts in a footnot e 
that âthese figures should be interpreted cautiously as they may not represent actual 
amounts allocated to M&E and statisticsâ (NDPC 2011: 87/97). In fact, of the 42 
programmes supported by development partners listed i n the 7 pages of the appendix only 
one is related to evaluation, the JICA programme (discussed later). The rest are unrelated to 
evaluation.

57. A major CSO involved in evaluation is the Ghana Coalition f or Extractive Industries (GCEI)  
whose focus is in tracking and  advocating for transparent management of the extractive 
industry in Ghan a. GCEI periodically engage experts to evaluate aspects of the extractive 
industry so as to generate evidence that could strengthen their advocacy agenda. 
58. The Trades Union Congress (T UC) of Ghana is another CSO that has been advocating for 
evaluations of some government programmes.   For example, the TUC Policy Bulletin ( June

2013) made a strong call on government to undertake an evaluation of the Ghana Youth 
Employment and Entrepreneur ship Programme ( GYEEDA). This led government  to 
commission an independent investigation into GYEEDA which revealed some perceived acts 
of corruption, which is currently being investigated by the Government. This illustrates the 
need to clarify the distinct ion between evaluation and audits/investigations). The TUC has 
practically no capacity to undertake evaluations (even though in its area there is a potential 
supply from the ILO, about which they are not aware).  
59. There are national and community -based NGOs  in Ghana that underta ke various 
development projects  with funding support from donors.  As a means of demonstrating 
results and accountability to their donors, these NGOs periodically commission evaluations 
of their projects.  Major NGOs in Ghana who occa sionally commission evaluations of their 
projects include CARE Ghana, PLAN Ghana, JICA, IBIS, World Vision, and Action Aid. 
Discussions with some of these NGOs revealed that they have a strong commitment to 
implement the recommendations from the various evaluations they commission since there 
is an incentive for them to improve their performance through uptake of the 
recommendations to secure  funds. Furthermore, CSOs can contribute to hold ing 
government agencies  more accountable and responsible for the deli very of goods and 
services as well as exposing malpractices. However, the capacity for CSOs to demand such 
accountability based on evidence generated from evaluations is weak.  
60. The positive in terests of civil society organis ations in knowing and improving the results of 
policies, programmes and projects, and holding public officers accountable for those results 
and for learning from implementation, can become an important source of demand for 
evaluation, which development partners can contribute to str engthen, complementing 
these efforts with the promotion of country -led evaluations, following up on their Paris 
Declaration and subsequent  commitments. Making progress in these fronts would 
contribute to country ownership and use of evaluation results to enhan ce accountability 
and  learning 
61. An illustration of evaluative work done on behalf of PLAN Ghana is shown in Box 1. 
Box 1:  Plan Ghana evaluation of improved cook stoves  
Quality evaluation work (applying a theory of change and implementing a rando mised control 
field trial) was done in Ghana on a relevant issue (an improved cook stove programme) i n 2009 
on behalf of Plan Ghana (Burwen and Levine 2012). The cook stove programme is an innovation 
which attempted to reduce the fuel needs of the rural populati on and achieve better health, as 
part of the fight against global climate change. 
The conclusion of the evaluation was that even when used, the new stoves did not reduce fuel 
use or exposure to emissions by a large amount (if at all).  
âBy identifying whet her a stove project has substantial impacts or not, the approach should prove 
useful for non-profit organisations and others attempting to discern whether or not a stove project 
is cost -effective at achieving its goals. The reductions in wood use we found are insufficient to 
warrant scaling up the stove building programme, at least using the current design of the stove and 
its roll-out programmeâ.
<<<PAGE=27>>>

The evaluation was done by two researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, without 
any substantiv e participation of Ghanaian evaluators.  It could have been an opportunity to 
involve Ghanaian evaluators and/or researchers, and this may have facilitated the dissemination 
of an evaluation potentially useful but practically unknown developing Ghanaian ownership of 
the evaluation.9  
3.2 Government Agents 
62. The major government agents who demand (and sometimes supply) evaluations are the 
ministries, departments and agencies . In Ghana, most of the M&E work of MDAs had to do 
with monitoring, and evaluations wer e donor -led, to comply with donorsâ requirements. 
Furthermore, the amount of resources allocated to (and by) MDAs for evaluation was very  
limited: the baseline study  on resources spen t on M&E and statistics indicates that 
evaluation accounts for a small pr oportion of M&E expenditure, 3% in 2009 and 1% in 2010 
(NDPC 2011: 13).  
63. All the Ministries in Ghana are expected to establish Policy Planning and Monitoring and 
Evaluation departments which, among other things, are expected to undertake monitoring 
and evaluation to generate evidence to guide policy and design of interventions within the 
various Ministries. These PPMEDs do mor e monitoring than evaluations. Indeed, most of 
these PPMEDs do not have the requisite capacity to undertake rigorous evaluations.  Th ey 
do however prepare annual progress reports (often limited to implementation issues) and 
occasionally commission consultants to undertake mid-term or end of project evaluations of 
specific projects under their respective ministries funded by donors. Ther e is also disparity 
among the various PPMEDS in their capacities to deliver on their mandate.  
64. An illustration of evaluation supply, combined with ECD, is the Evaluation of the Guinea 
Worm Eradication Programme led by the PPMED of MoF and representatives o f other 
MDAs is provided in Box 2. 
Box 2: Evaluation of Guinea Worm Eradication Programme 
Guinea worm disease is a parasitic disease transmitted to the host through drinking or coming 
into contact with water infected with water fleas. Work in the 1980s s howed that there were 
about 180 000 cases of Guinea Worm Disease (GWD) in Ghana, ranking the country second after 
Sudan.  It takes about a year for the disease to present itself after the parasite infects the victim. 
The disease manifests itself with a painful, burning sensation as the female worm forms a blister, 
usually on the lower limb. 
Earlier reports indicate that because there are no drugs or vaccines to combat the disease, 
preventing transmission is the best means of elimination and contro l. Prevent ive measures 
include educating the community about the risks of allowing infected persons to enter sources of 
drinking water, such as open wells or ponds; building walls or other barriers around water 
sources to prevent entry; filtering drinking water through a nylon filament or something similar; 
providing safe sources of water supply, such as capped wells or catchments with pumps; and 
                                                      
9 Perhaps due to its negative findings (which are nevertheless valuable to improve future designs), the evaluation is 
not posted in the commis sioning organisationâs website ( https://plan-international.org/where-we-
work/africa/ghana/).
<<<PAGE=28>>>

using temephos for chemical control. The effect of the GWD included closure of schools in 
endemic communities due to large  numbers of students being afflicted, farmers were unable to 
tend their fields, and families became further entrenched in dire poverty. Estimated losses in 
annual productivity in Africa ranged between US$300 million and US$1trillion by the end of the 
1980s. In Ghana, the disease became an important issue because it affected fertile lands and 
farm productivity. For example, it affected three of the highest yam production centres in the 
northern region of Ghana.  
In response to the negative effe cts of the dis ease, many organis ations including the Carter 
Centre, WHO, JICA and UNICEF colla borated with the Government of Ghana to establish the 
Ghana Guinea Worm Eradication (GWE) Programme. The key implementation strategies 
included (1) health education ; (2) use of  filters; (3) vector control ; (4) direct  advocacy with 
water organisations; and (5) increased efforts to build safer hand-dug wells. 
JICA conducted an evaluation of a GW E eradication project which provided an opportunity to 
sharpen the evaluation skills of trained Ghanaian professionals. The Joint Project was evaluated 
in 2011 by a team including JICA consultants and Ghanaian professionals. The evaluation report 
showed that the GWD eradication program me was successful and the ke y contributory factors 
included community involvement, strengthening surveillance and alignment to national 
programmes. This evaluation contr ibuted to the institutionalis ation of M&E in health programs 
across the country as most of the funding from JICA was linked to districts having M&E units or 
personnel to monitor program me outcomes. Furthermore, in 2009 , JICA support ed the 
establishment of a two -year programme to strengthen the M&E capacities of the MoF and 
selected MDAs. Two categories of officials were trained under the project. The basic group was 
trained in M&E while the core group was trained as trainer s of trainees. Having completed their 
training, the core group members were assigned to conduct the ex -post evaluation of the JPGWE 
as technical cooperation by the JICA. The purp ose of the ex -post evaluation exercise was to 
sharpen the skills of the core group in the selected MDAs. It is to be noted that the Terms of 
Reference of this evaluation stated that âthe evaluation is part of a pilot exercise meant to enable 
the Core Team of the Strengthening the M&E Capacity of the Mo F and other MDAs to conduct an 
ex-post evaluation of the Guinea Worm Eradication Project in Ghanaâ. The evaluation report was 
used for the certification of Ghana as a guinea worm -free zone. Although most of th e M&E 
trainees do not currently work on M&E, the approach followed, combining training, study tour 
and opportunity for practice in conducting an actual evaluation, is a useful approach that with an 
appropriate selection of trainees could yield a higher benefit cost ratio.

Ghanaâs Constitution mandates the National Development Planning Commission (ND PC) to co -
ordinate the planning, monitoring and evaluation of national develo pment policies and 
programmes. However, NDPC has limited capac ity in terms of staffing and resources to 
effectively deliver on its mandate.  For example, out of the twenty (20) technical staff within 
NDPC, only five (5) are in the M&E division (NDPC, 2012). Furthermo re, out of the NDPC budget 
of GHâµ 429,394 in 2009, only 14% was spent on M&E activities (NDPC, 2011).  In contrast, the 
2009 expenditure on M&E by Parliament and the Office of the President was   GH âµ 1,883,168 
($1.2 million) and GH âµ 2,301,425 ($1.55m) respectively (NDPC, 2011).  Even though the 
mandate of NDPC for M&E is broader than that of Parliament and the Presidency, NDPC 
receives less budgetary allocation.
<<<PAGE=29>>>
21 
 
65. Informants attributed the weak c apacity of NDPC to the politicis ation of the organisation 
over the years.  They cited examples of change of key personnel at NDPC with any change of 
government, apparently to ensure that NDPC follows the priorities  of the government of 
the day. Despite these limitations, NDPC demands M&E reports from various MDAs, 
including the District Assemblies to enable them compi le an annual composite progress 
report on the GSGDA which is the framework guiding national development. However , 
NDPCâs annual reports are based on monitoring of interventions rather than on evaluations. 
NDPC's mandate also allows it to undertake evaluation based on request from the Executive. 
However, there is no evidence of any evaluations commissioned or conducted by NDPC. The 
NDPC has recently developed an M&E Manual to guide and enhance the M&E function of 
various MDAs and districts.   
66. The Ministry of  Food and Agriculture (MOFA)  has over the years engaged consultants to 
undertake evaluations of their projects.  For example, in 2003, GIMPA Consultancy Services 
was engaged by MOFA to undertake an evaluation of their Roo ts and Tuber Programme 
(RTIP). The evaluation found that even though the new variety of cassava introduced by 
MOFA had high yield, there were no marketing avenues to absorb th e increased supply of 
cassava. The recommendation for cassava market development was taken up leading to the 
next phase of the programme focusing on cassava processing and marketing which resulted 
in improved incomes to farmers. However, that evaluation was an exception. At MOFA M&E 
is weak, and practically no evaluation is government driven. It is worthwhile to mention that 
support from European Union (EU) was provided to MOFA to strengthen their capacities in 
M&E, including an expert posted in the ministry for 2 years. But at best this support led to 
better monitoring. There is no demand for evaluation (not even for M& E) from the top level 
of the Ministry. The weak MOFA capacities for evidence based analysis and evaluation 
related themes are considered in detail in the USAID/LEAD (2013).   
67. The Ministry of Health has been implementing various donor supported programmes l ike 
the Guinea worm control project an d the malaria control project. The Ministry engaged 
independent consultants to evaluate these projects.  These evaluations were commissioned 
to com ply with donorsâ requirements. The review of the Health Sector in Ghana , 
coordinated by the PPME  department listed several of these evaluations .  With respect to 
monitoring and evaluation , the review pointed out that to better pro mote and support 
decentralisation the capacity of central and regional levels for M&E has to be strengthened. 
This appl ies to human resources, systems and instruments. This activity could build on 
several important initiatives, such as M&E and performance assessment, adopted in recent 
years and adapt ed to a decentralis ed system. The key o bjective is to enable these systems 
to produce reliable information at the district level . Finally, the review also recommended 
strengthening capacity for monitoring and evaluation at central and regional levels ( Saleh 
2013) 
68. Since 2007, the Ministry of Loc al Government and Rural Development has been conducting 
performance evaluations of Metropolitan Municipal and District Assemblies (M MDAs) using 
a Functional Organis ational Assessment Tool (FOAT). FOAT measures the performance of 
MMDAs against some defined criteria and indicators  and cash rewards are given to those 
MMDAs that perform well.  This has been a strong motivation for many MMDAs to improve
<<<PAGE=30>>>
22 
 
their performance over the years so as to obtain the reward.  FOAT is discussed in detail  in 
Box 3.  
Box 3: The Functional Organisational Assessment Tool 
As part of its efforts to improve the performance of the District Assemblies, the government of 
Ghana, with support from development partners, introduced a performance based grant system 
since 2006. Under the sys tem, the District Assemblies are assessed on agreed indicators on a 
yearly ba sis using the Functional Organis ational Assessment Tool (FOA T). The indicators for 
assessment indicate compliance with the legal and regulatory framework as well as level s of 
delivery on their mandate. The indicators usually assessed under FOAT include the following 
(MLGRD, 2013): (a) coherence of district development planning, in terms of linkage with 
situational analysis and good budgeting ; (b) annual percentage increase in inter nally generated 
funds; (c) amount of internally generated funds used for development projects; (d) transparency 
and openness in financial management ; (e) level of adverse findings or financial irregularities 
from Audit Service s; (f) procurement planning an d management ; (g) human resource 
management; and  (h) relationship with sub-district structures. 
Independent consultants are hired every year to conduct the assessment of all the 271 MMDAs 
in the country. Assemblies that perform well in the FOAT assessment  are rewarded with 
financial resources from the performance based grant system established by the MLGRD and 
DPs.  Those Assemblies that do not perform well are given capacity building support, based on 
identified capacity gaps, to ensure enhanced performance. 
Since a uniform tool is used to assess all the districts annually, it has become a basis for inter -
district comparison. It is common to hear managers of well performing districts publicly boast of 
their good performance.  There have also been instances  for citizens of a district to call for the 
removal of the District Chief Executive when they fail to qualify during the FOAT assessment.   
The incentive attached to good performance in the form of financial rewards and image 
bolstering in the eyes of citi zens and peers is a strong incentive for districts to implement 
recommendations from the assessment team.   The fear of agitation by citizens for the removal of 
non-performing District Chief Executives is also a strong disincentive for bad leadership. Even  
though FOAT is not a rigorous evaluation tool, it is a form of performance evaluation system 
which employs carrots and sticks to ensure uptake of recommendations.  The recommendations 
are taken seriously and guide subsequent decisions and actions. The other lesson from the FOAT 
system is the latent power of citizens in demanding results or improved performance from their 
leaders.  When such latent citizensâ pow er is activated through sensitisation, it could be a strong 
force to enhance the demand and suppl y of evaluations towards improved performance by 
leaders at all levels. 
FOAT has contributed significantly to improved performance of many District Assemblies over 
the years. For example, analysis of records from the FOAT secretariat revealed that in the 
Northern Region, the number of MMDAâs which complied with the various assessment areas 
increased from 33% in the 2006 FOAT to 85% in the 2008 FOAT (Engineers without Borders , 
2010).  
FOAT is seen as a better performance tool for decentralis ed M& E compared to the systems 
developed by NDPC and the PEOU. FOAT findings are viewed as more credible because the 
assessment is undertaken by independent consultants for the entire population (of districts) 
rather than a sample. The FOAT is well respected by  district administrators because the findings 
are actually used in making supplementary budgetary decisions.
<<<PAGE=31>>>
23 
 
The limitation of FOAT is its emphasis on compliance to rules and procedures rather than 
questioning the appropriateness of these rules, as expecte d in effective evaluation processes. 
Besides, FOAT does not distil lessons that can feed into national policy decisions, thereby 
limiting its value. But it has potential for learning and identifying critical success factors in those 
districts that perform better. It may be desirable for the instrument to include results and 
explore the possibility of extending the assessment to cover MDAs. 
69. The MoF (until recently Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning ) is expected to ensure 
that MDAs are held accountable for the use of financial resources, demanding evidence 
from MDAs to demonstrate effective use of budgetary allocations based on which 
subsequent budget provisions are made. In this regard, the MoF tend  to push MDAs to 
generate the evidence that can support annual budget allocation as well as feeding the 
M&E information into policy formulation and implementation. However, the capacity of 
these MDAs to undertake effective evaluation, as indicated in the p receding paragraphs, is 
weak and the evaluations are not implemented (except those that are donor-led). 
70. The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) undertakes nationwide surveys, which are used to track 
the performance of development indicators like poverty levels  and employment status of 
population, allowing for comparative analysis over the years to generate evidence of the 
development performance in the country.  Such evidence feeds into various planning and 
decisions by both government agencies and development partners, and also by the private 
sector. Through the JASMES initiative, GSS capacity will be built to provide improved access 
to high quality data by members of the public or non -governmental organisations. 
Furthermore, GSS sometimes provides technical su pport, particularly on sampling, to 
various consultants or age ncies undertaking evaluations. In this regard, GSS indirectly 
participates in the elaboration of evaluations. 
3.3 Evaluations Agents  
71. The various agents who are related to the supply evaluations may be grouped into four (4) 
categories: (1) consultants; (2) universities; (3) research institutions and think tanks ; and (4) 
voluntary organisations of professional evaluators (VOPEs). The major agents in each of the 
above categories will be discussed i n subsequent sections, highlighting the extent and type 
of their evaluative work and the driving forces underpinning their services. 
Consultants 
72. There is a growing number of individual consultants and consultancy organisations that 
have been undertaking  evaluations or related work on projects, programmes and policies. 
Among the organisations some that can be mentioned are the Centre for Democratic 
Development, Innovation for Poverty Actions (IPA), KPMG,  Ernst & Youn g and GIMPA 
Consultancy Unit. The financial incentives associated with evaluation are the major driving 
force for these consultancy organis ations to seek opportunities to undertake evaluations or 
related work (see Appendix A for an inventory of evaluations conducted by some 
consultancy organisations in Ghana).
<<<PAGE=32>>>

Universities   
73. There are currently eight public universities in Ghana and plans are quite advanced to 
establish two more in Ho and Sunyani. Additionally, there are seventeen private universities.   
The University of Ghana is the oldest and la rgest with student population of 29,754 ran ging 
from bachelor to PhD levels. The University is endowed with highly qualified teaching and 
research staff thereby presenting great opportunities to conduct various evaluations.  The 
2011 basic statist ics of th e University of Ghana revealed that out of the 654 teaching and 
research sta ff, 412 of them (63%) have Ph Ds and 242 (37%) have Masters degrees. In 
addition, the  average number of PhD students graduating annually is 37 and the average 
number of Masters students graduating from the university annually is 658 (University of 
Ghana, 2011).  
74. Generally, the public universities are more endowed with research capabilities than the 
private ones.  Apart from the Faculty members undertaking research work in the various  
Schools and Faculties, most of the public universities have speciali sed research centres.  For 
example, the University of Ghana has four research institutes or centres that conduct 
research to feed into policy.  These are the Institute of Statistical Soci al and Economic 
Research (ISSER); the Nuguchi Memorial Medical Research Centre; Regional Institute for 
Population Studies and the Centre for Social Policy Studies.  Indeed, ISSER in partnership  
with the University of Carolina  conducted an impact evaluation  of the Livelihood 
Empowerment against Poverty Programme (LEAP) in 2012, which led to a review of aspects 
of the LEAP programme.  Again ISSER evaluated the implementation of the Paris Declaration 
on Aid Effectiveness in Ghana in 2010.  
75. Interviews conducted with some researchers at the University of Ghana expressed concern 
over low government funding for research work.  Consequently most of the research work 
in public universities is conducted with donor funding or in collaboration with other external 
universities who tend to dictate the research focus which may not be consistent with 
national research priorities.    
76. A World Bank study in 2001 reviewed selected Ghanaian institutions to identify their 
strengths and weaknesses in M&E, assess their ability to pr ovide quality training as well as 
undertake consulting work for government, civil society and the private sector. The 
institutions were: 1) the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration 
(GIMPA); 2) ISSER at the University of Ghana; 3) the Sch ool of Administration at the 
University of Ghana; and 4) the Department of Planning of the University of Science and 
Technology (UST)  (World Bank, 2001). Some of the key findings of the ass essment are 
provided in Table 4.

Research Institutions and Think Tanks 
77. Independent research institutions and think tanks like the African Centre for Economic 
Transformation (ACET), IMANI Ghana, Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), and the Center for 
Policy Analysis (CEPA)  occasionally undertake evaluations or policy research to generate 
evidence and propose policy alternatives to governm ent. Key informants lamented that the 
uptake of these research outputs by policy  makers is g enerally weak due to the polaris ed 
partisan political climate and that these research outputs have been unsolicited thereby 
weakening sense of ownership and commitment to take them on -board in policy decisions.  
Nevertheless the work of these r esearch institutes and think tanks is often recognised in 
public debates and reported in local media.  
78. The African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET) is an economic policy institute that 
undertakes policy analysis, evidence -based advocacy and advice  to African governments to 
enable them formulate and implement good policies and strengthen public institutions 
towards accelerated development. The Headquarters of ACET is based in Accra and has a 
core staff of 30 personnel from 8 African countries. ACET has undertaken analytical research 
in areas like foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows; export promotion policies and

strategies; and education and skills development. In 2010 the AfDB engaged ACET to 
undertake analytical studies to generate evidence to guide the Bank in its efforts to 
promote economic integration among the 15 nations of the Economic Community of West 
African States (ECOWAS). 
79. IMANI Ghana is a public policy research and advocacy organisation.  In 2010, Foreign Policy  
magazine ranked IMANI Ghana as the 5th most influential think tank in Africa.  Based on the 
various policy research conducted, IMANI Ghana has often issued public statements and 
provides policy alternatives to government on various issues like the proposed sale of 
International Commercial Bank to the First National Bank of Nigeria; as well as the failure of 
the Ghana Food and Drugs Board to effectively implement its policies leading to sub -
standard drugs in Ghanaian market (IMANI, 2013). 
80. The Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA-Ghana) was established in 1989 with a mission to 
promote good governance, democracy and a free and fair market economy. Over the years, 
IEA-Ghana has served as a centre for policy analysis and public education on issues related 
to Ghanaâs economy, good gov ernance and democracy. For example, during the 
preparation of Ghanaâs Oil Revenue Management Bill, IEA made recommendations that 
were taken into account.   Also the Institute is often asked by the Ministry of Finance and 
Economic Planning to contribute to the national budget preparation process and the r eview 
of government contracts. During the 2012 elections in Ghana, the Institute was actively 
involved in supporting the democratic process by organi sing the presidential and vice -
presidential debates, as well as votersâ education and election observation. IEA-Ghana has a 
core staff of 19 and produces a series of monographs on various economic policy issues, and 
a new peer -review journal, called the Ghana Policy Journal . In addition, the Institute 
published an Annual Economic Review and Outlook of Ghana in 2007.  
81. The Centre for Policy Analysis (CEPA) was established in 1993 as an independent, non -
governmental think- tank, which provides rigorous analysis and perspectives  on economic 
policies and poverty reduction issues in of Ghana. Over the years, CEPA has conducted 
research in areas such as fiscal and monetary policy, trade policy, industrial policy, the social 
sectors, and agricultural policy, based on which policy alternatives are proposed. The Centre 
holds seminars and workshops to share its findings with Ghanaians and the wider 
international community.   
82. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is an American -based non-profit organisation operating 
in Ghana and other Afr ican countries, conducting randomi sed impact evaluations, with the 
involvement of  Ghanaian researchers. For example, in 2012, IPA was engaged by CARE 
Ghana to evaluate Villag e Savings and Loan Associations  in Northern Ghana.  IPA was also 
engaged by SNV t o evaluate the efficacy of School Based Financial Education Program mes 
with Children in Ghana 
83. Ghanaian independent think tanks could become leading actors in conducting evaluations in 
Ghana. However, most of these think tanks and research institutes have i nadequate 
technical personnel to undertake evaluations should demand increase quickly.
<<<PAGE=35>>>
27 
 
Voluntary Organisation of Professional Evaluators (VOPE)  
84. The main VOPE in Ghana is the Ghana Monitoring and Evaluation Forum (GMEF), a VOPE 
supported by UNICEF, which a cts as an interface between supply and demand for 
evaluations. Since its  establishment in 2008, membership has grown from 15 to about 150 
in an informal network within the past five (5) years. Official members (dues paying)  
currently stands at 75. As a body of various evaluation practitioners, who are convinced of 
the importance of evaluations, and who have a direct profess ional interest in evaluations, 
GMEF is able to advocate and draw attention of some organi sations on the need for them 
to undertake evaluation of their initiatives. In this way GMEF contributes to activating latent 
demand for evaluations, hosting important events with the purpose of nurturing evaluation 
demand, including one in the northern region of Ghana.  At the same time GMEF 
periodically o rganises training programmes to enhance the capacity of M&E practitioners 
thereby growing t he supply side of evaluations. GMEF has in the past organised 1 to 2 day 
fora to share evaluation best practices and discuss current evaluation topics (such as i mpact 
evaluation), thereby strengthening the community of evaluation practitioners in Ghana. It is 
currently undertaking the preparation of a feasibility study for a Masterâs in Evaluation with 
the University of Ghana. 
4. PATHWAYS, OPPRTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES  
85. This case study has assessed the conditions under which latent and potential demand for 
evaluation is generated, the range and capacity of entities supplying evaluation services, 
existing gaps in evaluation capacity in the public sector and the areas in which supply can be 
strengthened to meet demand. This study has shown that there are currently active, latent 
and potential  demands for evaluation from different  principals and  agents. The mapping 
exercise conducted and presented in Chapter 3 indicates that there are challenges as well as 
opportunities for evaluation capacity development in Ghana. This section discusses deficits 
in evaluation supply and demand and proposes potential areas for evaluation capacity 
development.  
4.1 Demand 
86. This section discusses the identified gaps or challenges with respect to latent and potential 
demand for evaluation in Ghana. There is latent demand for evaluation for policy making at 
both the executive and legislative levels of government. Development partners and civil 
society organisations have demonstrated actual demand for evaluation and have been 
active in supporting evaluation capacity development of public sector institution s as well as 
other non-state actors.  
87. This study has revealed that actual demand for evaluation from the executive has been very 
limited. The activities of PEOU have been limited to monitoring of programmes and projects 
rather than evaluations which could be used to inform policy.  
88. The latent demand from the executive and parliament is mainly due to the following 
reasons: (a) lack of awareness that evaluation can provide relevant evidence. This then 
leads to lack o f actual demand for evaluations;  (b) lack of adequate capacities to
<<<PAGE=36>>>

commission and to conduct eva luations across many MDAs, legislature s and CSOs though 
potential exists; and (c) l ack of adequate budgeting allocations for evaluations compared to 
monitoring of activities. As stated in NDPC (2011)  âmonitoring activities accounts for 
approximately 63% of  the total expenditure on M&E. This is followed by capacity building 
(25%). Publication accounted for 6% while planning and evaluation accounted for only 3% 
respectivelyâ. In general, that report shows that funds allocated to M&E are low, and 
particularly low for evaluation. 
89. One approach to driving demand for evaluation by both executive and legislative is the 
development of national evaluation policy. Ghana currently has no evaluation policy that 
provides a clear and coherent institutional framework for ev aluation w ithin the public 
sector. The Presidential Advisor is undertaking work in the Office of the President in 
developing an evaluation policy for Ghana . The guidelines will define roles and 
responsibilities of stakeholders, as well as content definitio n and conditions for 
commissioning, managing and using evaluations. This could be an area for ECD support, to 
clarify government policy direction and framework for monitoring and evaluation at the 
Presidency. 
90. Development of a country evaluation policy c an be done using two approaches. First, to 
develop an evaluation policy, as has been done by South Africa, with a clear definitio n of 
roles and responsibilities. I t could be a Cabinet approved policy, rather than passing it 
through Parliament, to avoid furthe r delays . Second, to complete the regulations 
considered, but not developed, when NDPC was established. 
91. Parliament, by its constitutional mandate, is expected to hold government and its agents 
accountable on how public funds are spent. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of 
Parliament makes some use of AG reports to call government agents and political office 
holders to account , but there has been limited follow -up. Currently parliament lacks the 
capacity to commission evaluations on its own.  
92. Development p artners can support capacity development of parliamentariansâ research 
assistants and perhaps also a sort of parliamen tarians evaluation support unit  (PESU). 
Parliamentarians have a strong demand for accountability, which is a latent demand for 
evaluation. STAR Ghana has been doing valuable work with parliamentarians which could 
be further supported. The African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) is one institution 
that can support such an initiative. ACBF is instrumental in capacity development within the  
South African Development Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum by funding an M&E 
officer position at the SADC Secretariat. The M&E officer assists parliament with the design 
and implementation of an M&E system.  
93. The AGâs office staff is mostly compliance oriented, and they could strengthen their capacity 
to undertake performance audits. This could be another area for ECD support, taking into 
account international experiences and considering incentive schemes co mpatible with 
Ghanaian policies.  
94. The evaluation capacities of PPMED are very limited. Some MDAs do not have functional 
PPMEDs, and where they exist, their activities have been limited to routine data collection
<<<PAGE=37>>>

and activity reporting. Under the JASMES programme, Government and  development 
partners ha ve committed to support ECD  in the public sector. Planned capacity building 
programmes must place greater emphasis on evaluation capacity development. One of th e 
key ECD initiatives could be evaluations funded by donors involving PPMEDs in managing 
and Ghanaian evaluators in conducting the evaluations. 
95. There are some promising opportunities for making ECD progress at the sub -national level: 
the decentralis ation process is strong and maturing. Statistica l services are being 
decentralised and there is an Institute of Local Government Studies which includes among 
its activities, training on district level project planning, monitoring and evaluation. In 
addition, there is an ongoin g World Bank US$ 175 million Local Governments Capacity 
Support project which aims  to improve citi zensâ engagement. The project is developing 
capacities of urban district assemblies, which could include monitoring and evaluation 
capacities (that may be linked to the decentralisation of the statistical services). 
96. Most evaluations in Ghan a have been commissioned by development partners and 
conducted by agents of these development partners. The key motivation for development 
partners calling for evaluations of the projects they support is to comply with their own 
requirements to conduct evaluations of the operations they support, both for accountability 
and for learning. Utilis ation of these evaluations by the executives, legislature and 
government agents has been limited.  
97. There is a strong need for support to develop a country -led evaluati on system.  The 
government could take an active role in requiring donors to follow their Paris 
Declaration/Accra Ratification/Busan Forum commitments to use country systems, which 
would be a way to contribute to st rengthen these systems through learning by doing.  
Supporting this active role could be one of the key ECD lines of work in Ghana and other 
countries, helping to transform the proliferation of development partnersâ  different 
requirements for conducting evaluations into an opportunity to strengthen country systems, 
taking into account donorsâ commitments and funds.  
98. In Ghana civil society organisations have been identified to potential of acting as principals 
to conduct and commission evaluations . Activities of most CSOs in Ghana are actually 
funded by development partners. If their capacities are adequately developed, CSOs have to 
potential to both conduct and commission evaluations especially at the decentralised levels 
of government. STAR Ghana has been supporting evaluation capacities of CSOs in G hana 
mainly through training. 
4.2 Supply 
99. In Ghana there are significant gaps between evaluation and demand. In general, local 
capacities for conducting high -quality evaluation are quite limited. The study identified and 
assessed the strength and limitation s of in -country institutions supplying ev aluation. The 
findings indicate that potential exist s to build the capacities of these institutions to bridge 
the evaluation supply -demand gaps identified. As can be expected an increase in demand 
for evaluation has  the potential for driving supply for evaluation. A first step therefor e for 
driving evaluation supply is nurturing demand for evaluation through the type of evaluation
<<<PAGE=38>>>

advocacy events that GMEF has been doing and which could be further supported, and 
through the dissemination of information about evaluations that produced evidence useful 
for decision making.   
100. An annual prize or award for the bes t Ghanaian led evaluation could be an incentive to 
promote high-quality country led evaluations, which may not o nly have an influence on the 
supply of evaluations but could also contribute to make more visible Ghanaian evaluations 
and to create an awareness of their existence, which could be another way to promote their 
use and thus to nurture demand for evaluation. 
101. Some development partners have collaborated with evaluation agents (research 
institutions and universities) on in -country evaluation capacity development initiatives. A 
case in point is the partnership between UNICEF, GMEF and the University of Ghana to s tart 
the first ever Master of Arts programme in Evaluation.  
102. There is growing awareness at all levels of government on the important role of 
evaluation in decision -making and sustainable development. Demand and supply and 
evaluation continue to be driven b y development partners with limited country ownership 
of the processes. The introduction of the JASMES initiatives, if effectively implemented, will 
help bridge the evaluation supply and demand gap by ensuring sustaining funding of M&E 
and encouraging utilisation of country evaluation systems and personnel for commissioning 
and conducting and evaluations in Ghana.
