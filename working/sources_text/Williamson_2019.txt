Abstract
Background: Evidence generation partnerships between researchers and policy-makers are a potential method for
producing more relevant research with greater potential to impact on policy and practice. Little is known about
how such partnerships are enacted in practice, however, or how to increase their effectiveness. We aimed to
determine why researchers and policy-makers choose to work together, how they work together, which partnership
models are most common, and what the key (1) relationship-based and (2) practical components of successful
research partnerships are.
Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 18 key informants largely based in New
South Wales, Australia, who were (1) researchers experienced in working in partnership with policy in health or
health-related areas or (2) policy and programme developers and health system decision-makers experienced in
working in partnership with researchers. Data was analysed thematically by two researchers.
Results: Researcher-initiated and policy agency-initiated evidence generation partnerships were common. While
policy-initiated partnerships were thought to be the most likely to result in impact, researcher-initiated projects
were considered important in advancing the science and were favoured by researchers due to greater perceived
opportunities to achieve key academic career metrics. Participants acknowledged that levels of collaboration varied
widely in research/policy partnerships from minimal to co-production. Co-production was considered a worthy goal
by all, conferring a range of benefits, but one that was difficult to achieve in practice. Some participants asserted
that the increased time and resources required for effective co-production meant it was best suited to evaluation
and implementation projects where the tacit, experiential knowledge of policy-makers provided critical nuance to
underpin study design, implementation and analysis. Partnerships that were mutually considered to have produced
the desired outcomes were seen to be underpinned by a range of both relationship-based (such as shared aims
and goals and trust) and practical factors (such as sound governance and processes).
Conclusions: Our findings highlight the important role of policy-makers in New South Wales in ensuring the
relevance of research. There is still much to understand about how to initiate and sustain successful research/policy
partnerships, particularly at the highly collaborative end.

Background
Bridging the evidence – practice gap in health services
has the potential to make a substantial contribution to
improving health outcomes and service efficiencies [ 1, 2]
and to reducing research waste [ 1]. Proposed solutions
to bridging this gap originally focussed heavily on strat-
egies to enhance the dissemination of research findings
to research users [ 2, 3] or on building the capacity of
policy-makers and clinicians to engage with and use re-
search evidence [ 4]. More recently, focus has turned to
the potential for evidence generation partnerships
between researchers and knowledge users, such as
policy-makers, community groups, clinicians and con-
sumers, to improve the availability of relevant, timely
evidence to help inform decision-making [ 5, 6]. There
has been a proliferation of research funding initiatives
internationally that require researcher/knowledge user
collaboration [ 7] and increasing demands on researchers
to demonstrate that their work has had an ‘impact’ on
policy or practice [ 8– 10].
A number of research approaches that centre around
evidence generation partnerships have been outlined in
recent years, including integrated knowledge translation
[5, 11], participatory action research [ 12, 13] and en-
gaged scholarship [ 14, 15]. Most of these approaches
emphasise the co-production of knowledge [ 6], whereby
researchers and those most likely to use or be affected
by the evidence produced, work together to produce evi-
dence. By combining the varied skills and expertise of
these groups, it is hypothesised that the resultant re-
search will have greater relevance to knowledge users
and will more likely be used in decision-making [ 16, 17].
Much has been published about many of these ap-
proaches from a conceptual standpoint [ 18, 19], and
there has similarly been a considerable amount of litera-
ture examining how evidence generation partnerships
function [ 13, 20, 21]. Most of this research, however,
does not explore evidence generation partnerships spe-
cifically between researchers and policy-makers [ 22, 23],
focusing instead on partnerships with community groups
[13], clinicians [ 24] and others. All of these partnership
combinations are likely to share some common features
such as a requirement to take into account the diverse
perspectives and needs of all partners; however, the
policy-maker/researcher combination is likely to present
some unique partnership challenges and opportunities
due to the vastly different work environment and pres-
sures that these groups face [ 25– 27]. Further, while
rarely the case with most other common partnership
combinations, evidence generation partnerships between
policy agencies and researchers may be initiated and
funded by the policy agency themselves or be funded
through external research grants (such projects may be
more likely to be researcher-initiated). These different
modes of funding and initiation may have important im-
plications for how a partnership functions [ 28]; however,
this has rarely been explored. Thus, there remains much
to be learnt about how research/policy partnerships are
enacted in practice [ 29] and how best to bring the dif-
fuse skills, needs and priorities of researchers together
effectively [ 30, 31].
The current paper is the first step in a broader initia-
tive which aims to develop a set of tools to help facilitate
successful research/policy partnerships around evidence
generation activities. In this paper, we explore the views
and experiences of researchers and policy-makers with
extensive expertise in research partnerships regarding
why and how researchers and research users work to-
gether in New South Wales, Australia, and the factors
which underpin successful research partnerships. In par-
ticular, we address the following research questions:
1. Why do researchers and policy-makers choose to
work together? What are the perceived benefits?
2. How do they work together? Which partnership
models are most common?
3. What are the key (1) relationship-based and (2)
practical components of successful research
partnerships?
Methods
Participants and setting
Data was collected between October 2017 and April
2018. We sought to interview participants from two
groups; namely (1) researchers experienced in working
in partnership with policy in health or health-related
areas and (2) policy and programme developers and
health system decision-makers (hereafter policy-makers,
defined as “someone employed in a policy agency who
drafts or writes health policy documents or develops
health programs, or who makes or contributes signifi-
cantly to policy decisions about health services, programs
or resourcing ” [32]) experienced in working in partner-
ship with researchers. Participants were purposively
identified by an Advisory Committee guiding this pro-
ject. The role of the Advisory Committee was to provide
expert advice on issues relating to the scope, implemen-
tation and dissemination of a programme of work
centred on partnership research of which the current
paper is a part. The Advisory Committee included an
approximately equal mix of researchers and senior
policy-makers, selected for their expertise in partnership
research, and their extensive knowledge of researchers
and policy-makers who work in partnered research. Ad-
visory Committee members asked the permission of po-
tential participants before passing on their contact
details to the study team.

Participants were eligible to participate in the current
study if they were nominated by a member of the Advis-
ory Committee based on the criteria that they (1) were a
researcher or policy-maker; (2) worked primarily in
health or health-related areas (e.g. social care); (3) had
extensive experience in partnering with researchers (for
policy-makers) or policy-makers (for researchers) on re-
search projects (partnership on at least five projects);
and (4) were employed by a university, policy or
programme agency or Local Health District. All partici-
pants provided written, informed consent to participate.
Data collection
A semi-structured approach was used to elicit partici-
pants’ opinions and experiences regarding the barriers
and facilitators to successful evidence generation part-
nerships amongst researchers and research users in ac-
cordance with best practice guidelines (Additional file 1:
Appendix 1) [ 33]. Interviews were conducted by AW, a
researcher with extensive expertise in conducting re-
search in partnership with policy-makers. Each interview
sought information on why the interviewee engaged in
partnership research and the perceived risks and bene-
fits, how the interviewee would characterise the types of
partnership models they have engaged in (and the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of each), characteristics of
successful and unsuccessful partnerships (and the factors
associated with each), and indicators and predictors of
impact. Interviews were conducted in person or by
phone depending on the preference of the interviewee
and ranged from half to one hour in length. Data was
audio recorded before being transcribed by a person
with no personal or professional connection to the par-
ticipants involved in the study.
Analysis
Data was analysed thematically. Two researchers (AW
and HT) independently read all of the transcripts and
coded the data to discern themes inductively. No prede-
termined framework was used to guide analysis. The re-
searchers met regularly to review the draft codes and
themes throughout the process until agreement was
reached regarding the final version. Synthesised data and
emerging themes were reviewed by the Advisory Commit-
tee who participated in sense making of emerging data.
Results
A total of 18 key informants participated in interviews,
of whom 7 were primarily researchers and 11 were cur-
rently primarily policy-makers. All participating re-
searchers were employed by universities at the Associate
Professor or Professor level and had more than 15 years
research experience in public health research. All of the
policy-makers who participated were employed at a
Manager level or above by government agencies whose
work focussed on health or health-related issues (such
as social care). Six of the policy-makers had PhDs and/
or had previously been employed as researchers and
were thus able to bring both a researcher and a
policy-maker lens to their analysis of research partner-
ships. All participants, except for one researcher, were
based in New South Wales, Australia. The themes which
emerged from the interview with the participant from
outside New South Wales were consistent with those
which emerged more broadly.
Why do researchers and policy-makers choose to work
together?
Three major themes emerged regarding why researchers
choose to work with policy, namely (1) increasing the
likelihood of research impact; (2) gaining access to
sought after resources; and (3) obtaining funding. The
reason most commonly cited by researchers for wanting
to partner with policy-makers to conducting research
was the belief that the resultant research would more
likely have an impact on policy and thus contribute to
improving health.
“I do research so that I can improve health … the main
way in which research impacts health is through
policy... Research without any sort of policy
engagement will often sit on the shelf and do
nothing… ” Researcher
Many researchers were also motivated to partner with
policy-makers due to the access to otherwise unavailable re-
sources this could facilitate (such as routinely collected data
held by agencies or the data req uired to evaluate large-scale
government policies or programmes). Researchers also re-
ported seeking collaborations with policy-makers due to
the funds attached to the work, either through completing
a tendered project or, preferably, receiving funds to carry
out a project the researchers had initiated or co-produced
in collaboration with a relevant agency.
Five major themes emerged regarding what policy-
makers perceived they gained by partnering with re-
searchers, namely (1) access to a dditional skills; (2) links to
researchers who can be called on for timely, informal ad-
vice; (3) access to the networks of their research collabora-
tors; (4) the creation of high quality, relevant evidence; and
(5) public, evidence-based support for government deci-
sions. Policy-makers most commonly reported seeking to
collaborate with researchers in order to gain access to skills
and capacity over and above that already available within
their agency.
“… the reason you go to a researcher is that they ’ve got
the expertise or the resources or the time or whatever
Williamson et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:41 Page 3 of 11
<<<PAGE=4>>>
in order to be able to collect that information that you
need and therefore that ’s helpful to you. ” Policy-maker
Having established collaborations with researchers was
also said to create a situation in which policy-makers felt
able to contact these researchers when they required fast
expert advice on a relevant issue. Policy-makers also noted
that their collaborators often assisted them in making
links with researchers outside of the collaboration who
possessed additional specific skills or knowledge they
needed. Policy-makers were also driven to collaborate
with researchers in order to create high quality evidence
that was seen to have credibility to support their work.
Collaborations with researchers were also seen to be
helpful when the researcher elected to support govern-
ment decisions in the public domain, for example, by
speaking about the evidence base underpinning policy,
programme or health service delivery decisions. While
research users did not report requesting assistance of
this nature, they appreciated it when provided.
How do researchers and policy-makers collaborate on
research projects?
Four major themes emerged in relation to researcher/pol-
icy-maker collaboration, namely (1) wide variation in ex-
tent of collaboration; (2) policy agency-initiated
partnerships; (3) researcher-initiated partnerships; and (4)
co-produced partnerships. Most participants agreed that
“someone has to have the initial idea ” for a partnership; as
such, participants agreed that most partnerships could be
categorised as either policy agency initiated, including pro-
jects put out for tender by agencies and commissioned
work, or researcher initiated, either through a partnered
funding application to an external granting body or by a
direct approach to an agency to fund a particular piece of
work. Once these partnerships began, there was said to be
a considerable level of variation in the extent to which the
researchers and agency staff involved collaborated from al-
most no collaboration through to high levels of collabor-
ation throughout all stages of the research process. This
sustained, high level collaboration was considered by par-
ticipants to characterise co-production. Policy-makers and
researchers tended to nominate research projects centred
around evidence reviews and analysis of existing datasets
as requiring minimal collaboration, while closer collabor-
ation was considered important when conducting inter-
ventions and evaluations.
“So, I see partnerships as a sort of continuum. At one
end is that transactional type interaction, through to
co-production at the other end. ” Policy-maker
However, these partnership categories (policy- or
researcher-initiated and extent of collaboration) were
not seen to be entirely clear cut, with some researchers
and policy-makers explaining that, as some policy agen-
cies move towards embedding researchers within their
teams and sometimes funding research centres, the dis-
tinction between policy-makers and researchers can
sometimes be blurry.
A few policy-makers felt that highly collaborative,
co-produced research partnerships were always preferable;
however, most participants reported that various levels of
collaboration could be effective depending on the situation.
“I guess again we don ’t come at it from which model
works best. It ’s more like what are the requirements of
the project .” Policy-maker
Policy agency-initiated partnerships
A range of shared benefits (two subthemes), perceived
unique risks to researchers (five subthemes), perceived
unique benefits to researchers (two subthemes), and
unique risks to policy-makers (five subthemes) of policy
agency-initiated partnerships were identified (see Table 1
for illustrative quotes). Most researchers and
policy-makers alike agreed that policy-makers are best
placed to identify the critical issues around what evi-
dence is needed to guide their decision-making. Thus,
agency-initiated work was thought by both researchers
and policy-makers to often be particularly well targeted
for real-world impact.
Small, short term, policy-initiated projects were
rarely seen by researchers as offering opportunities to
conduct ‘cutting edge research ’,a n dr e p o r t e d l yo f t e n
did not generate publications or turn a profit. Re-
searchers reported willingness to engage in these and
other types of agency-initiated projects anyway as
they were seen as an effective way to build a relation-
ship with a policy agency and gain a better under-
s t a n d i n go ft h ep o l i c yc o n t e x ti nt h eh o p e so f
developing more advantageous collaborations.
On the other hand, most researchers outlined a num-
ber of potential risks or costs that were sometimes asso-
ciated with agency-initiated work. Chief among these
was a perceived opportunity cost, with time spent work-
ing on agency-initiated research sometimes resulting in
less traditionally valued research outputs (such as
peer-reviewed publications) than time spent on
researcher-initiated work. Indeed, policy-makers and re-
searchers alike reported that, as policy-makers often
needed evidence around a specific issue, within a specific
timeframe and at a specific cost, research methods
needed to be determined pragmatically, rather than
striving for the most scientifically excellent design. In
addition, the evidence produced was sometimes ren-
dered irrelevant by changes in the political environment.
Williamson et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:41 Page 4 of 11
<<<PAGE=5>>>
Time was again a concern amongst researchers when
the amount of time spent to complete a project to an
agency’s satisfaction was seen to ‘blow out ’. Researchers
and some policy-makers reported that this was often
due to agencies not being “clear [about] what they
want”, resulting in a more iterative process than was an-
ticipated. This challenge was also sometimes seen to be
related to agencies not disclosing key information to re-
searchers, limiting their understanding of the context
and what was required.
Policy-makers also reported potential risks related to
engaging with researchers in agency-initiated research,
including not receiving the information or evidence they
required, or it being of poor quality, or delivered well
after the agreed deadline. Another commonly reported
barrier was researchers overpromising to win a tender
but not being able to deliver on these promises. Frustra-
tions were sometimes said to arise due to researchers ig-
noring the complexity of the issue being investigated.
Finally, policy-makers reported that, in policy-initiated
projects, researchers often failed to adequately synthesise
the reported evidence and/or provide recommendations
for action. As recommendations for action were report-
edly often one of the key outcomes sought by agencies
in these partnerships, this was particularly disappointing.
Researcher-initiated partnerships
One shared benefit related to research-initiated partner-
ships was commonly identified by researchers and
policy-makers. Policy-makers also identified a range of
risks associated with such partnerships (four subthemes).
Researchers considered that partnerships they led con-
ferred a range of important benefits (three subthemes),
but also some risks (two subthemes) (see Table 2 for
illustrative quotes). Researcher-initiated partnerships
were seen by policy-makers as an important source of
innovation, but not necessarily of major immediate rele-
vance to their work. Despite this, if the policy-makers
agreed to partner on a researcher-initiated project, they
reported that they did expect to engender benefits from
this. Nonetheless, one of the key risks noted for
researcher-initiated partnerships was that the evidence
produced did not fill an evidence need for the agency, or
that it took so long to produce that, by the time it was
available, it was no longer relevant.
This risk was seen to be exacerbated by another com-
monly noted risk of this partnership type, namely that
the researchers take over and offer little opportunity for
policy-makers to help shape the research agenda. Relat-
edly, many policy-makers reported previous dissatisfac-
tions related to researchers not sharing credit for the
work the partnership produced, for example, through
co-authorship or shared publicity.
Researchers cited significant benefits associated with
researcher-initiated partnerships, including the oppor-
tunity to focus on their specific research interests and
employ more ambitious study designs, increasing their
chances of obtaining peer-reviewed grants and high im-
pact journal articles. The chief risks researchers reported
in researcher-initiated research partnerships were that
the policy-maker partners did not engage (attend meet-
ings, provide information and advice) or did not deliver
on promised resources such as access to particular
datasets.
Co-produced partnerships
All participants reported that co-production was a
worthy goal and likely to be highly effective when done

the problem and that ’s often unknown to
researcher. They’re just not in the trenches.
They just kind of can ’t see it. ” Researcher
Stepping stone to future
collaborations

Doing the work that they ’re
commissioning but also with a view
to potentially collaborating with them
on bigger things that we might
potentially have an interest in, in the
future.” Researcher
Opportunity cost
“I have a research team of people
who are ambitious … In an ideal
world they ’ll be doing projects
which are targeting high impact,
international journals. The sort of
work that we do for government
here isn ’t that sort of work. So, it
does come at that cost as well. ”
Researcher
Researchers not engaging with
complexity
“Sometimes they get very narrow in
terms of what they get interested in
or they need to define things in a
very narrow way that means that
they can measure it, so it makes it
easier for them, but it doesn ’t
necessarily answer the questions
that you want. When from our
point of view we ’ll think, they ’re
just not even trying to get how
complex, they just want it to be
simple because that ’s their area of
expertise.” Research user
Evidence generated more likely to be
used in policy or practice
“I think if they ’ve got a specific evidence
need and know the evidence they need
to gather or synthesise to answer it, I
think that ’s quite an acceptable process
that will probably lead to really quick
translation because they need the
evidence and as soon as they get it,
they’ll make the decision on its basis. ”

Changing political environment
“So honestly my best work was
dead in the water within six
months because of politics. ”

well (four subthemes). Some regarded it as the most ef-
fective partnership model for real world impact (see
Table 3 for illustrative quotes). Achieving co-production
was also noted to be difficult, with common challenges
(two subthemes) and a range of facilitators (four sub-
themes) identified.
The benefits of co-production were seen to derive in
part from the greater levels of engagement between all
members of the team seen to be implicit in this model,
driven by mutual aims and interests. This high level of en-
gagement was in turn seen to allow the complementary
skills and knowledge of all partners to be optimised.
Resulting from this, a core strength of co-production was
thought to be its ability to integrate tacit, experiential
knowledge with traditional ‘evidence’, resulting in particu-
larly nuanced and relevant outputs. Co-production was

Innovation
“Investigator driven research is fine, we actually
encourage it all the time. That ’s where ideas
come up, where things that we haven ’t thought
of - we don ’t have the capacity to think of
everything and have every partner and be at
every meeting. So certainly, there ’s a very
important role for investigator driven research. ”

Increased opportunity for cutting edge research

to be characterised by sort of something quite
new in terms of maybe methods or thinking
outside the square. ” Policy-maker
Long timelines
“… they [researcher-initiated partnership projects]
can take a long time, longer than you need or
have available. So you don ’t get the answer you
want when you want it, you get it eventually, but
it may be too late by that point, in which case it ’s
something of a waste of time. ” Policy-maker
No acknowledgement
“...they [policy-makers] weren’t acknowledged.
They weren ’t told that a peer review paper had
been produced, it just came out … There wasn ’t [1]
the respect to even ask to produce the paper, and
[2] to even ask whether someone could be an
author on it. Someone who put a lot of
intellectual property into the project. ” Policy-maker
Lack of practical outcomes
“[A risk is that researchers were not] … making
recommendations in reports that speak to those
issues of policy and practice implications, rather
than being airy fairy high falutin, more research
needs to be in A, B, C. It ’s not very helpful. ”

Research more likely to be used
“… what increases the likelihood of research being used is if it ’s coproduced,
because then we ’re actually interacting all the time. We ’re talking, we know
what the priorities are, and we ’re actually setting an agenda for research
and we ’re collaborating on that … if we ’re involved in the process from day
dot, involved in its implementation, of course we ’re going to use it, more
likely to use it aren ’t we? ” Policy-maker
Co-production difficult to achieve
“I think the agency-led or researcher-led in my experience is common. But we
have pursued that co-led idea, because I think that could have so many
benefits. We haven ’t - I don ’t think we ’ve had a lot of success with it, but I
think it ’s a really great model. ” Policy-maker
Merging of experiential and scientific knowledge
“… there is a lot of evidence that is really more implicit, part of the tacit
knowledge, part of the [experiential] knowledge that stakeholders have,
and that engagement process and coproducing evidence of what works
and what does not work is really quite promising. I tell you that in many
cases, even systematic reviews … sometimes you might have strong evidence,
but it doesn ’t mean that at the level of implementation in governing
contract it would work. This is where the knowledge coproduction piece is
important.” Researcher
Co-production may require shared risk
“… you do need shared risk. Whether it ’s financial shared risk, outcome
shared risk, reputational shared risk, and that ’s what kind of drives a lot of
things, and sort of shared input in some ways, whether it ’s in kind, or not in
kind, or whatever it is. So, I think shared input, and shared risk, I think, is
something that, probably, people might not want to say, but it ’s very true,
because that ’s where you ’ll get a lot of input .” Policy-maker
Keeps research relevant
“I think it makes the research better … .you can check in with the people
who are going to be most impacted by the research as you go along. Make
sure you don ’t go off on an academic tangent and lose relevance. Because
real-world questions are messy and crowded, and often not exactly as they
would be in the perfect academically articulated research questions. ”

also seen to provide opportunities for frequent ‘relevance
checks’ to ensure that the research being undertaken re-
mains in line with ‘real world’ priorities.
Nonetheless, while co-production was the goal for
many participants, some noted that, thus far, they had
not been able to achieve it, with either the policy or the
researcher partners dominating partnership projects in
practice. Multiple reasons were given for the reported
tendency for one group to dominate research partner-
ships, ranging from lower expectation amongst one
group that the project might benefit themselves or their
agency resulting in reduced engagement, to the dominat-
ing group offering little real opportunity for their part-
ners to contribute to shaping the research agenda. The
most frequently mentioned facilitators of co-production
were things that allowed long-term relationships and
trust to develop between researchers and policy-makers,
namely stability of staff at policy agencies and policy
agency-funded research centres.
What does ‘success’ in research partnerships look like?
Seven subthemes were identified in relation to the char-
acteristics of successful partnerships. Key informants
most commonly described a successful partnership as
one where “all stakeholders are happy with the out-
comes”. Expanding further, common perceptions of suc-
cessful partnerships included all parties having a shared
understanding of why they were partnering and what
this would involve, the planned deliverables being deliv-
ered to a high standard and relevant, usable evidence be-
ing generated. Many participants noted that a successful
partnership produces more than any partner could have
alone and that it results in mutual gain. Creating evi-
dence that impacts on policy and practice was consid-
ered an indicator of success, but as participants
recognised that impact is influenced by a complex array
of factors, they considered that partnerships could be
considered successful even in the absence of this.
What are the components of successful research
partnerships?
Participants identified a range of relationship-based (six
subthemes) and practical facilitators (six subthemes) of
successful partnerships as well as three cross-cutting fa-
cilitators (Table 4).
Shared aims and goals were seen as the fundamental
building block of successful partnerships, and something
that motivated partners to withstand the difficulties and
challenges that can emerge over the course of partnerships.
“So that ’s my little tip there. All the energy at the start
has to be about where you want to finish and why a
partnership is important, because it will also help you
during the times when the partnership ’s tested, to
remind yourself why working together was important
in the first place. ” Researcher
Participants were also keenly aware of the differences
between researchers and policy-makers in relation to their
needs and goals. For example, researchers are generally
expected to demonstrate their productivity through publi-
cations and funded grants, whereas policy-makers need to
provide advice or develop policies or programmes around
complex issues, often with very little preparation time.
Both groups emphasised the necessity of understanding
and attempting to accommodate these different needs.
“… it’s the relationship building that ’s critical, being
prepared to put the time and effort into the
relationship building and having the ability to
empathise with the perspective of someone who ’s trying
to run a health service or someone who ’s having to
make a policy decision … ” Researcher
Practical components of successful partnerships
All of the practical components of successful partner-
ships were seen to be underpinned by the need to take

time at the outset of the partnership (and throughout) to
ensure that ‘everyone is on the same page ’. Practical
ways of doing this that were frequently cited included
documenting and agreeing on timelines, deliverables and
who is responsible for what at the outset (but allowing
some flexibility for when changes arise), agreeing on
governance structures and processes and a publication
policy (which specifies the potential role of research
users in publications). Adequate funding was seen as an-
other core practical component of success, as was all
parties delivering as promised. Ongoing engagement,
expressed through attendance at meetings, participation
in discussions and provision of feedback, for example,
was also seen as key. Mutual benefit was cited by all par-
ticipants as fundamental to partnership success.
“The best partnerships are clearly win/win … Where it
becomes one-sided, all the gains being on one side at
the expense of the other, that ’s where things fall apart
because the side that ’s not gaining is thinking well,
what am I doing here? ” Researcher
Discussion
Our findings suggest that both researcher-initiated and
policy agency-initiated evidence generation partnerships
were common among researchers and policy-makers in
New South Wales. While policy-initiated partnerships
were thought to be the most likely to result in impact
[34], researcher-initiated projects were seen to play an
important role in advancing the science and often pro-
vided researchers with more opportunities to achieve the
outputs valued in their profession such as high impact
publications. In keeping with the literature, participants
acknowledged that levels of collaboration varied widely
between research/policy partnerships [ 16, 20, 28, 35, 36].
Co-production, or collaboration across all stages of
the research process, was seen by some participants as
the ideal model for collaboration, increasing the rele-
vance of the research produced and the likelihood of
impact [ 37– 39]. Others considered that this time and
resource-intensive way of working was not always war-
ranted [ 40]. While agreeing aims, goals and deliverables
collaboratively was always viewed as essential [ 41],
these informants suggested that, once this was accom-
plished, some types of projects, such as analyses of
large datasets and evidence reviews, could be com-
pleted largely independently by researchers with no loss
of quality or relevance. In contrast, co-production was
seen to be particularly worthwhile in relation to evalu-
ation and implementation projects where the tacit, ex-
periential knowledge of policy-makers provided critical
nuance to underpin study design, implementation and
analysis. Of note, several policy-makers suggested that,
while ideally they would like to co-produce research, in
practice they had not found this to be possible. Partici-
pants suggested that trusting , long-term relationships
were generally a precursor to co-production. These
were seen to be facilitated by policy agencies having a
stable workforce; frequent staff changes in policy agen-
cies are frequently cited as a barrier to successful evi-
dence generation partnerships in the literature [ 31, 42]
and policy agency-funded research centres [ 43].
Key informants in the current study highlighted a clear
distinction between researcher and policy agency-initi-
ated partnerships. In keeping with the literature,
policy-makers were thought by both groups to be best
placed to identify what evidence is needed to guide real
world decision-making [ 5, 44, 45]. The relevance of the
ensuing research and the ability of policy agencies to
utilise it meant that policy agency-initiated work was re-
ported to be particularly likely to lead to real-world im-
pact [ 22, 34]. Achieving such impact was the primary
motivation reported by researchers for engaging in evi-
dence generation partnerships [ 22]. Potential opportun-
ity costs were also noted, including time taken away
from producing ‘world class ’ research [ 28, 46], chal-
lenges agreeing on final outputs [ 28, 29], unexpectedly
iterative processes [ 47] and the potential for the evi-
dence produced to remain unused due to changes in the
policy landscape [ 29].
Many of the key frustrations expressed by policy-
makers around policy agency-initiated partnerships in
the current study have been less commonly reported in
the literature. These include researchers overstating
what is possible in order to win tenders (leading to dis-
appointment with the final product), choosing only to
focus on the elements of a topic that interest them, or
oversimplifying things in order to make them ‘doable’
and failing to fully engage with the complexity of an
issue. As systems thinking approaches gain momentum
in research [ 48, 49], it will be interesting to observe
whether this last challenge becomes less common. A key
frustration noted by policy-makers was the failure of re-
searchers to provide recommendations for action, one of
the main outcomes reportedly sought by agencies when
they initiated partnerships with researchers [ 28, 50, 51].
Despite the noted risks, researchers stated that even
small agency-initiated projects were worthwhile as
relationship-building and learning exercises [ 27, 52],
which may later help to underpin partnerships they felt
to be more favourable to themselves. Policy-makers for
their part continued to initiate evidence generation part-
nerships in order to access additional capacity and ex-
pertise to produce high quality, credible evidence to
inform their work.
Researchers in the current study placed particular
value on researcher-initiated partnerships. These were

<<<PAGE=9>>>
considered to offer the opportunity to conduct research
that was both ‘scientifically excellent ’, and likely to have
impact. Policy-makers, on the other hand, noted that,
while sometimes providing useful evidence, these pro-
jects were less often of immediate relevance or import-
ance to them. Unsurprisingly then, the major risk
researchers reported in researcher-initiated partnerships
was that policy-makers did not engage [ 29, 53]. This
suggests that even researchers who aim to conduct re-
search with real world impact, and who are experienced
in working partnership with policy, are often not in
alignment with policy agencies in their opinions as to re-
search priorities. This finding is consistent with the large
body of literature describing the widespread differences
between the research and policy worlds [ 26, 27, 37, 54],
whereby researchers most often attempt to ‘push’ their
research to policy agencies rather than ascertaining
when there may be a policy ‘pull’ for evidence and build-
ing at least some of their research agenda to align with
this [ 55, 56]. One mechanism governments in New
South Wales [ 57] and others internationally [ 58– 61] em-
ploy to help develop long-term collaborations with re-
searchers and increase the production of policy-relevant
research is government-funded research centres. While
as yet there have been few evaluations of such initiatives,
it seems a potentially promising method of facilitating
productive, lasting partnerships.
Many of the key barriers and facilitators reported to
underpin partnership success or failure noted in the
current study are consistent with those reported in the
literature. Many of these appeared to speak primarily of
a clear need to ensure that the different needs and
drivers of all parties were understood, valued and ac-
commodated as much as possible. Thus, participants
underlined the foundational need for shared aims and
goals, ensuring that all parties were benefiting from the
collaboration and maintaining open communication,
trust and mutual respect [ 16, 20, 21, 27, 42].
Amongst our key informants, practical tools were also
thought to be of great value in supporting a
well-functioning partnership; these included having
clearly documented and agreed timelines, deliverables,
workplans, publication policies and governance struc-
tures [ 31, 53]. While some groups appear to have
well-developed methods in this area, this appears to be a
partnership capacity gap for others. As noted elsewhere
[29, 31], ongoing engagement, expressed through things
such as attendance at meetings, participation in discus-
sions and provision of feedback and presenting findings
as they emerge, was described as critical to keeping the
project on track and maintaining relationships.
A strength of the current study is the participation of
both researchers and policy-makers who are highly experi-
enced in working in partnership on evidence generation
activities as we expected this group to be able to provide
considerable insight into the complexities of research/pol-
icy partnerships. By exploring their views broadly, rather
than in relation to a particular project, we were able to
draw out their key learnings from working in partnership
on evidence generation activities. We acknowledge the
limitations inherent in the small sample size utilised here,
the fact that most of our participants were from New
South Wales and that our sample was not randomly se-
lected. Indeed, the experiences of these highly practiced
individuals may diverge from those of researchers and
policy-makers who have less experience of participating in
research/policy partnerships, or who work in settings
where such partnerships are less common. Although
many of our findings align with the existing literature,
these limitations mean that our findings may not be
broadly generalisable.
There is still much to understand about how to initiate
and sustain successful research/policy partnerships, par-
ticularly at the highly collaborative co-production end.
Our findings highlight the important role of
policy-makers in ensuring the relevance of research,
mostly in evaluation and implementation projects where
co-production appears to be particularly valuable. The
next phase of our work will seek to provide a more de-
tailed exploration of the specific practical strategies, in-
cluding governance approaches, that can be put in place
to facilitate strong and effective evidence generation
partnerships between researchers and policy-makers.
