Key Findings
n Simulation-based education (SBE) has been
successfully applied to improve outcomes in a
variety of contexts across low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs), with most studies demonstrating
at least a partial improvement in outcomes.
n Simulation modalities are most commonly low-
technology modalities, including mannequins and
scenario-based simulation.
n Learning methods are often reported insufficiently
to judge against reporting standards which have
been predominantly developed in high-income
countries.
Key Implications
n Further research is needed in LMICs and into
specific SBE modalities.
n Improved reporting of SBE is needed, which may
require greater representation and consultation of
LMICs in the development of a future global
consensus on reporting.
ABSTRACT
Introduction: Simulation-based education (SBE) is increasingly used
to improve clinician competency and patient care and has been
identified as a priority by the World Health Organization for
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The primary aim of
this review was to investigate the global distribution and effec-
tiveness of SBE for health workers in LMICs. The secondary aim
was to determine the learning focus, simulation modalities, and
additional evaluation conducted in included studies.
Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis guidelines,
searching Ovid (Medline, Embase, and Emcare) and the Cochrane
Library from January 1, 2002, to March 14, 2022. Primary re-
search studies reporting evaluation at Level 4 of The Kirkpatrick
model were included. Studies on simulation-based assessment and
validation were excluded. Quality and risk-of-bias assessments
were conducted using appropriate tools. Narrative synthesis and
descriptive statistics were used to present the results.
Results: A total of 97 studies were included. Of these, 54 were in
sub-Saharan Africa (56%). Forty-seven studies focused on neona-
tology (48%), 29 on obstetrics (30%), and 16 on acute care (16%).
Forty-nine used mannequins (51%), 46 used scenario-based simu-
lation (47%), and 21 used synthetic part-task trainers (22%), with
some studies using more than 1 modality. Sixty studies focused on
educational programs (62%), while 37 used SBE as an adjunct to
broader interventions and quality improvement initiatives (38%).
Most studies that assessed for statistical significance demonstrated
at least partial improvement in Level 4 outcomes (75%, n¼81).
Conclusion: SBE has been widely applied to improve outcomes in
a variety of contexts across LMICs. Modalities of simulation are
typically low-technology versions. However, there is a lack of stan-
dardized reporting of educational activities, particularly relating to
essential features of SBE. Further research is required to determine
which approaches are effective in specific contexts.
INTRODUCTION
T
he World Health Organization (WHO) predicts a
global shortfall of 10 million health workers by
2030, with low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
most affected.1 Underinvestment in training and a mis-
match between workforce strategy and health needs are
contributing to this shortage. Consequently, numerous
strategies have been developed to improve training and
retention of health workers. Simulation-based educa-
tion (SBE) is an approach identified as a priority by the
WHO and other stakeholders.

In 2004, Gaba defined simulation as a technique
“used to replace or amplify real experiences with
guided experiences that evoke or replicate substan-
tial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive
manner.”
5 Increasing awareness of medical errors
has catalyzed interest in simulation as an educa-
tional method to improve clinician competency
and patient safety.
6 Subsequently, there has been
an increase in the published literature focusing on
SBE and an expansion of relevant professional
bodies.7,8 Numerous studies support the use of SBE
to improve knowledge, confidence, and skills.9,10
Additional benefits for low-resource settings include
training entry-level health workers and traditional
providers.
11 Importantly, simulation technology
and educational efficacy should not be conflated,
as research suggests that low-technology simula-
tion can be equally effective as high-technology
simulation.
12–14
High-income countries continue to be the pre-
dominant source of publications and SBE guide-
lines.
7,15,16 In contrast, little is known about the
landscape of SBE across LMICs. It has been sug-
gested that LMIC settings may benefit from SBE,
particularly in the context of relatively high rates
of adverse events resulting from unsafe experiences
in the hospital setting.
17,18 Despite this, there is an
indication that SBE is underused in LMICs.18 As c o p -
ing review by Puri et al. identified 203 studies report-
ing simulation initiatives in LMICs.
18 Of these, only
85 used simulation in training. The most reported
educational modality was low-technology manne-
quins. There is also limited information available re-
garding how SBE programs are evaluated in LMICs.
A more comprehensive understanding of how SBE
has been used in LMICs may serve as useful infor-
mation for educators and researchers looking to im-
plement this approach.
The primary aim of this review was to investigate
the global distribution and effectiveness of SBE for
health workers in LMICs, specifically those initia-
tives that evaluate program outcomes. The sec-
ondary aim was to determine the learning focus,
simulation modalities, and additional evaluation
in each included study.
METHODS
Three authors (SR, AR, and RN) completed this
review following the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis guide-
lines.
19 They were additionally informed by the
guidelines for Synthesis Without Meta-analysis.20
The systematic review was registered on Prospero
(CRD42022354079).
Eligibility Criteria
Primary research studies that trained health workers
or health students in LMICs and were published
in English between January 1, 2002, and March
14, 2022, were included. Reviewers were guided
by Gaba’s definition of simulation and the Healthcare
Simulation Dictionary.
5,21 The World Bank’sL M I C
classification and the WHO health worker classi-
fication were also used.
22,23 Studies were re-
quired to quantitatively evaluate at Level 4 of the
Kirkpatrick model.
Studies using simulation exclusively for assess-
ment (without an associated educational initiative)
were excluded. These were distinguished from pro-
grams that incorporated measurements of student
performance as an evaluation of a learning pro-
gram.
24 It should be noted that while both assess-
ment and evaluation appear similar, they serve
different purposes and have different implications
for learners.
24 Learner assessment using simula-
tion has the potential to create an environment of
performance anxiety, which may conflict with the
important principle of psychological safety in SBE.
It is for these reasons we separated SBE from
simulation-based assessment. In practice, the bal-
ance between education and assessment needs to
be managed carefully. Additional exclusion criteria
are listed inTable 1.
The Kirkpatrick model is a widely applied evalua-
tion framework and includes 4 levels: reaction, learn-
ing, behavior, and results (Table 2).
25 Evaluation of
results (Level 4) has been identified as a priority for
SBE research moving forward.26 However, it remains
difficult to evaluate to this level.25,27,28 Importantly,
successful evaluation at Level 4 is not causally re-
lated to other levels, and each level should be con-
sidered individually.
29,30 The model’s focus on
summative evaluation is another concern, which
potentially neglects investigations of how changes
occur.29,31 However, it has been recommended
by the WHO, with return on investment included
as a fifth level.
32,33
For this review, we required that Level 4 evalua-
tions were clearly linked to patient outcomes rather
than being inferred from context. As an example,
our research laboratory conducted a study using
simulation training for air enema in pediatric intus-
susception.
34 The length of patient hospital stay was
a Level 4 outcome for this study, which was subse-
quently included. The reduction in the operative

garding the relative advantages of nonoperative
approaches. Given it was not feasible for reviewers
to have expert knowledge of all the disciplines

included in the review, evaluations that changed a
treatment approach but did not have a direct link to
patient outcomes were excluded.
Information Sources and Search Strategy
Four databases were searched based on consulta-
tion with 2 qualified librarians and used keywords
and MeSH terms, including all LMIC names
(Supplement 1). The reference management pro-
grams used were Endnote and Covidence (Veritas
Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia).
Selection Process
SR and AR independently screened study titles
and abstracts. Conflicts were resolved through dis-
cussion and consultation with RN. Except for the
deduplication process of Endnote and Covidence,
no automation tools were used.
Data Collection Process
Data relating to the Kirkpatrick model and simula-
tion modalities were extracted independently by
SR and AR using Covidence. The remaining data
were extracted by SR, with ongoing consultation
of AR and RN.
Data Items
Data extracted included study settings, educational
focus, learner populations, simulation modalities,
and Kirkpatrick Level 4 outcome measures, as well
as which additional Kirkpatrick levels were evalu-
ated. To avoid skewing data, results of multiple
studies of identical programs were aggregated.
Included simulation modalities were guided by an
established simulation dictionary (Table 3).
21,35,36
Missing or unclear data were recorded as such.
Outcomes were judged by SR as to whether
they achieved statistically significant improvement
to the Level 4 outcome measure. Partial improve-
ment was defined as an improvement in some mea-
sures, settings, or time points. It should be noted that
partial improvement is not necessarily inferior to
complete improvement, as studies observing partial
improvement may have included more outcome
measures. A single standardized metric for outcomes
was unsuitable due to study heterogeneity. Missing
or unclear data were noted as unspecified.
Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias
Given the variation in study designs, several quality
assessment and risk-of-bias tools were used: the

Synthesis Methods
Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were
used due to study heterogeneity.37 Studies were
divided into educational programs, which focus
exclusively on training, and broader interventions
using SBE, which usually included additional
quality improvement strategies beyond education.
Within these categories, they were further separated
into standardized programs, which involve standard-
ized curricula previously used in different settings,
and independent programs, which are implemented
in a single context or study. For example, Helping
Babies Breathe (HBB) is a program initially designed
by the American Academy of Pediatrics but has since
been applied in many settings, so it was classified as a
standardized program.
38 Conversely, any study us-
ing a novel simulator or simulation program would
be classified as an independent program.
Other characteristics were tabulated and graphed
using GraphPad Prism version 10 (GraphPad
Software Inc., MA, USA) and Microsoft Excel
version 16 (Microsoft Corporation, WA, USA).
RESULTS
Study Selection
The initial search yielded 27,738 records. After re-
moving duplicates and screening, 97 studies were
included (Figure 1). Included studies are listed in
Supplement 2.
Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias in
Studies
Studies assessed using the National Institutes of
Health tool included 29 good quality, 35 fair
quality, and 12 poor quality articles. Of those assessed
using risk-of-bias tools, 8 studies were at low risk of
bias and 13 at moderate risk (or“some concerns”).
Study Characteristics
Geographic Distribution
Studies across 50 LMICs were included, with
54 representing sub-Saharan Africa (56%) and
15 representing South Asia (15%) (Figure 2).
Sixty-seven studies included middle-income coun-
tries (69%), 23 included low-income countries
(24%), and 7 included a combination (7%).
Learning Focus and Populations
The most common educational focus was neona-
tology (48%) or obstetrics (30%) (Table 4). There
were 41 studies training doctors (42%) and 34
training nurses (35%). However, 35 studies also
included at least 1 unspecified health worker pop-
ulation (36%).
Simulation Modalities
SBE modalities are listed inTable 5.
Kirkpatrick Levels
In addition to Kirkpatrick Level 4, 82 evaluated
additional program outcomes (85%). Most com-
monly, this was Level 3 (behavior), which was eval-
uated by 80 studies (82%). Nine studies evaluated
all levels (9%).
Simulation-Based Education Programs
Simulation has been used in numerous education-
al programs across LMICs, with 60 relevant studies
identified (62%).
Standardized
Standardized education programs using simulation
were described in 36 studies (37%), with 27 including

a neonatology focus and 13 with an obstetric focus
(some were focused on both areas). The most fre-
quently reported was Helping Babies Breathe (HBB),
which incorporates low-technology mannequins
and scenario-based simulation to teach neonatal
resuscitation.
39,40 HBB has been studied across sub-
Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America.40–45
The program had success in 8 Tanzanian facilities,
resulting in a 42% reduction in neonatal mortality.41
However, Arlington et al. demonstrated skill decay
4–6m o n t h sa f t e rH B Bt r a i n i n g .46 This influenced
other HBB initiatives to incorporate maintenance
training.42 A robust evaluation at Haydom Lutheran
Hospital, Tanzania, where HBB training was main-
tained with frequent refresher sessions, demonstrated
ongoing improvements in mortality over 5 years after
implementation.
47
To expand the use of HBB, some programs use
“train the trainer” (TTT) approaches.40,48 This is a
training cascade where skills and knowledge are
transferred to trainees, who then teach others.49
Goudar et al. successfully initiated the TTT model
for HBB in India, resulting in 599 trained birth
attendants.40 Ultimately, stillbirth reduced from
3% to 2.3% (P¼.035).
PRONTO, another standardized simulation
course, has minimal didactic content and incorpo-
rates hybrid simulation using“PartoPants” simula-
tors to train interprofessional teams on providing
optimal neonatal and obstetric care during birth.
50–52
Combined with volunteers or simulated patients,
this simulates the birth process.51,52 PRONTO has
been studied in Mexico, Guatemala, India, Ghana,
Kenya, and Uganda.
51–55 Walker et al. observed a
statistically significant 40% lower neonatal mortality
rate in Mexico 8 months after intervention.
52
Other programs incorporating simulations in
LMICs include Practical Obstetric Multi-Professional
Training,
56,57 Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics,58
and Advanced Trauma Life Support.59
Independent
Twenty-four studies described independent
educational programs that included simulation
(25%).

Paludo et al. described training Brazilian doc-
tors in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal
cancer.
60 The simulation program incorporated
244 hours of virtual reality laparoscopic simulation
into the hospital curriculum over 4 years. Among
the 124 surgical patients, those operated on by the
simulation-trained group were significantly more
likely to achieve the“trifecta” of no complications,
negative surgical margins, and minimal decrease in
renal function (P¼.007).
60
Dean et al. studied cataract surgery across 5
sub-Saharan African countries.61 As a m p l eo f5 0
trainee ophthalmologists received either a 5-day
simulation program in addition to standard training
or standard training exclusively. The program in-
cluded surgery on synthetic eyes and described
feedback, deliberate practice, and reflective learn-
ing. Following completion, clinical outcomes and
a validated competency assessment were compared
between groups, and posterior capsule rupture rates
were significantly lower among the simulation
group (7.8% vs. 26.6%,P<.001). Competency as-
sessment scores were significantly higher after
3 months and 12 months (P<.001). It was not until
the 15-month assessment that the difference in
scores normalized.
Simulation-Based Education Components of
Other Interventions
SBE has been successfully used to complement other
quality-improvement strategies.53,62,63 Thirty-seven
(38%) studies were included in this category.
Interventions Including Standardized Simulation-
Based Training
Seventeen initiatives used SBE as a core compo-
nent of their intervention (18%). The Emergency

Triage Assessment and Treatment Course com-
bined role-play with modular learning of guide-
lines. Variations of this course have been applied
in several settings.64–66 For example, Hands et al.
implemented a 5-day program in Sierra Leone
training nurses. Subsequently, pediatric mortality
and treatment practices improved; however, statis-
tical analysis was not conducted.
64
Other studies used previously described stan-
dardized programs but packaged them alongside
other initiatives. For example, Rule et al. studied
HBB in Kenya but included policy revision and ad-
ministrative changes relating to data collection.
43
After completion of the quality-improvement pro-
gram, including training 96 providers in HBB, the
rate of asphyxia-related mortality decreased by
53% (P¼.01).
A similar adaptation of PRONTO was reported
by Walker et al. in Kenya and Uganda.
53 The
intervention package additionally included data-
strengthening strategies, quality improvement colla-
boratives, and a childbirth checklist. The study was a
cluster-randomized trial, where facilities were pair-
matched and assigned intervention or control. The
findings demonstrated reduced neonatal mor-
tality and stillbirth among the intervention facilities
(15.3% vs. 23.3%,P<.0001).
Interventions, including social media campaigns
and workforce changes, have also been used along-
side formalized simulation programs.
54
Interventions Including Independent
Simulation-Based Training
Broader interventions, including nonstandardized,
independent SBE, were described in 20 studies
(21%).
One example by Gill et al. trained traditional
birth attendants in Zambia.67 The program included
teaching a resuscitation protocol using infant
mannequins. The second major component of the
intervention was the provision of antibiotics and fa-
cilitated referral for possible sepsis. Traditional birth
attendants received delivery kits for each birth, in-
cluding resuscitation equipment, medications, and
general materials. The program ultimately resulted
in a significant reduction in neonatal mortality.
Another program in Kazakhstan involved a
variety of interventions, including patient regis-
tries and clinician training to encourage patient
self-management of chronic diseases.
63 Role-
playing was used to teach and encourage clinicians
to engage in supportive dialogue with patients.
Among other results, the program successfully
improved the management of hypertension, with sig-
nificant changes in the blood pressure of patients
following the program. Specifically, the percentage of
patients with blood pressures below 140/90mmHg
increased from 24% to 56% (P<.001).
Outcome Improvement
Eighty-one studies tested for statistical signifi-
cance (84%). Of this subset, 42 (52%) demonstrated

a partial improvement in outcomes and 19 (23%)
demonstrated a complete improvement. Standard-
ized programs were more likely to be associated
with improvement in outcomes when compared
to independent programs (78% vs. 71%). Seven
studies provided information regarding cost of
programs (7%) but did not report comparable
measures.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review found that SBE has been
successfully incorporated through standardized and
independent programs in LMICs. Studies were most
frequently in the fields of neonatology and obstetrics
and in sub-Saharan Africa. We believe this is the first
study to provide systematic and comprehensive in-
sight into SBE use in LMICs. The findings support
the potential for SBE to effectively train health
workers in LMICs. Many studies demonstrated sig-
nificant improvements in patient outcomes follow-
ing programs.
40,41,43,47,52,53,60,61,63,64,67 Innovative
approaches, such as TTT, may be effective methods
to further improve simulation capacity. The results
of this review support using SBE to complement
traditional educational approaches in LMICs.
The significant representation of neonatology
and obstetrics in this review may be due to their
acute and interdisciplinary nature, which is parti-
cularly suited to SBE.
68 Funding is likely relevant,
with child and maternal health being major recipi-
ents of international financing.
69 This finding differs
from the review by Puri et al., where infectious dis-
eases and reproductive health were the most
common fields. This difference is likely explained
by the inclusion of simulation-based assessment,
which may be more suited to these topics.
18 The
significant representation of sub-Saharan Africa in
our study is unsurprising given the region’sc o m p a -
rably greater number of LMICs, though this differs
again from the findings of the Puri study.
22
The most frequently reported modalities were
mannequins, scenario-based simulation, and syn-
thetic part-task trainers, likely due to their afford-
ability and accessibility as lower-technology
approaches. However, low-technology differs from
low-efficacy, and low-technology approaches have
been identified as a priority in resource-limited
settings.
12,18 The widespread application of lower-
technology modalities suggests the educational val-
ue of low-cost simulation is being realized. Puri et
al. reported simulated patients as the most frequent
modality in LMICs with a significant number of
studies involving them as a method of quality as-
sessment. When looking exclusively at SBE, they
found mannequins to be most prevalent, which is
consistent with our findings.
The number of studies identified (n¼97) de-
monstrates evaluation at Level 4 of the Kirkpatrick
model has been achieved in many LMIC settings.
However, only 9 studies evaluate all 4 levels, which
is consistent with previous reviews of health care ed-
ucation.
28,70 Level 3 of the Kirkpatrick model, evalu-
ation of behavior, was also evaluated in the majority
of studies.
When discussing SBE broadly, it is difficult to
draw definitive conclusions about its efficacy in
LMICs based on this review. This is due to the va-
riety of contexts, simulation modalities, and out-
come measures included. Consequently, many
studies were judged as“partially” effective, an is-
sue with systematic reviews that has long been
recognized.
71 Overlaid upon this is the issue of
“causal attribution,” where it is difficult to deter-
mine definitively that the program was responsi-
ble for outcomes.25 Despite this, we found good
evidence to suggest SBE can be used in LMICs,
with statistically significant improvements evident
after numerous initiatives.
Evidence demonstrating the efficacy of stan-
dardized programs can be more robust than inde-
pendent programs as they have been studied in
more contexts. In particular, the HBB program
has been associated with significant reductions in
stillbirth and neonatal mortality. The program
also demonstrated the importance of skill mainte-
nance for program efficacy, a finding consistent
with previous studies.
18,46,47,72
Independent programs have proved that effec-
tive SBE is also possible outside of standardized
structures. Such programs have confirmed the

value of integrating training into formalized insti-
tutional structures or curricula.60 This is consistent
with established simulation literature, which high-
lights curriculum integration as critical.73 Despite
the benefits of standardized courses, they may not
be contextualized appropriately unless necessary
modifications are adapted.
74 Consideration of the
educational context is vital to the success of SBE.73
This review highlights that SBE is not limited
to educational programs and is also used to intro-
duce other initiatives, such as guidelines and proto-
cols, or as an adjunct to additional interventions.64
Despite successful applications, it remains dif-
ficult to judge what makes an SBE program effec-
tive in LMICs. This can be partially attributed to
deficits in SBE reporting. Few studies report meth-
ods in sufficient detail to facilitate comparison to
reporting guidelines, which is unsurprising given
both the recency of guideline development and
their lack of emphasis on perspectives from
LMICs.
15,16 Nonetheless, there is typically mini-
mal reporting of simulation design, prebriefing,
and debriefing, and limited discussion of educational
factors, such as deliberate practice and mastery learn-
ing. Issues, including skill maintenance, feedback,
and curriculum integration, are discussed sporadically
but not to the extent where meaningful comparisons
can be made. This is an issue for educators and
researchers, given the importance of these factors
for educational effectiveness. Ongoing simulation
training is necessary to maintain skills. It has been
suggested that reflective debriefing is the most
important feature of SBE to facilitate learning.
73
While evidence suggests debriefing may occur dif-
ferently across different societies and cultures,
75 it
remains important to understand how feedback is
given to learners in any context. We also were un-
able to extract meaningful data regarding other rel-
evant features, including learner groups, facilitator
training, and TTT approaches, despite their impor-
tance.
73 We recommend authors improve reporting
of SBE initiatives to provide greater detail regarding
their approach, which will improve transparency
and replicability. This should include the above fea-
tures of programs, as well as others such as program
cost and duration. Such reporting would provide
greater insights regarding the features of successful
programs. In addition, it may help address miscon-
ceptions around SBE, including the idea that it is
prohibitively expensive for low-resource settings.
We also recommend greater involvement of LMIC
perspectives in the development of future guide-
lines to ensure they are appropriate and consider
all settings.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of the review include its comprehen-
sive search strategy, the number of articles screened,
and the focus and detail of data extraction. However,
the topic required interpretation of definitions that
are often contested in the simulation community,
such as simulation modalities. For example, simula-
tion scenarios can be described to varying degrees,
so determining when studies qualify as scenario-
based simulation was difficult. Similarly, determining
when a program is describing team training was diffi-
cult, so we relied upon this being explicitly articulated
by the authors, and equivalent issues were encoun-
tered when ascertaining evaluation levels. For exam-
ple, when training communication skills for doctors
providing contraception, determining what classifies
as a Level 4 evaluation is debatable. It may be patient
satisfaction, contraceptive uptake, pregnancy rates,
or pregnancy-related complications. Judging the mo-
dalities used in standardized courses was also difficult
as some materials are not publicly available. In these
situations, modalities were determined based on
organizational websites, course resources, and pub-
lished literature. To minimize any subjectivity, we
relied upon the independent consensus of 2 investi-
gators for study inclusion, judgment of Kirkpatrick

levels, and simulation modalities, with a third in-
vestigator resolving conflicts. The variability of pro-
gram details reported, as previously discussed, also
limited the conclusions that could be drawn.
CONCLUSION
Ultimately, SBE has been used successfully to train
health workers in LMICs across numerous settings.
However, there is a need for further research in
low-income countries, and the evidence supporting
some modalities is greater than others. Reporting
varies significantly, with often insufficient informa-
tion provided to judge against reporting standards.
Furthermore, standards are based heavily on re-
search from high-income countries and are rarely
referenced in LMICs. This suggests a need to devel-
op and adopt region-specific reporting standards or
to include LMICs in the development of a future
global consensus. This would ensure standards are
appropriate for all settings and would potentially
improve their use in LMICs.
