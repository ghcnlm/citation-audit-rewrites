from a policy perspective: a critical
interpretive synthesis

Abstract
Background: The fields of implementation science and knowledge translation have evolved somewhat
independently from the field of policy implementation research, despite calls for better integration. As a result,
implementation theory and empirical work do not often reflect the implementation experience from a policy lens
nor benefit from the scholarship in all three fields. This means policymakers, researchers, and practitioners may find
it challenging to draw from theory that adequately reflects their implementation efforts.
Methods: We developed an integrated theoretical framework of the implementation process from a policy
perspective by combining findings from these fields using the critical interpretive synthesis method. We began with
the compass question: How is policy currently described in implementation theory and processes and what aspects
of policy are important for implementation success? We then searched 12 databases as well as gray literature and
supplemented these documents with other sources to fill conceptual gaps. Using a grounded and interpretive
approach to analysis, we built the framework constructs, drawing largely from the theoretical literature and then
tested and refined the framework using empirical literature.
Results: A total of 11,434 documents were retrieved and assessed for eligibility and 35 additional documents were
identified through other sources. Eighty-six unique documents were ultimately included in the analysis. Our
findings indicate that policy is described as (1) the context, (2) a focusing lens, (3) the innovation itself, (4) a lever of
influence, (5) an enabler/facilitator or barrier, or (6) an outcome. Policy actors were also identified as important
participants or leaders of implementation. Our analysis led to the development of a two-part conceptual
framework, including process and determinant components.
Conclusions: This framework begins to bridge the divide between disciplines and provides a new perspective
about implementation processes at the systems level. It offers researchers, policymakers, and implementers a new
way of thinking about implementation that better integrates policy considerations and can be used for planning or
evaluating implementation efforts.

Contributions to the literature
/C15This study unpacks the implementation of evidence-
informed policies and practices through the systematic de-
velopment of new theory drawing from three distinct fields
of scholarship: policy implementation, implementation sci-
ence, and knowledge translation, answering a call from im-
plementation researchers for more integration.
/C15The conceptual framework views implementation from the
“outer context ” and includes (1) a model describing the
process of implementation and (2) a framework that
identifies the policy-related determinants of implementation
success.
/C15This conceptual framework provides researchers,
policymakers, and implementers with a new way of thinking
about implementation and can be used for planning or
evaluating implementation efforts.
Background
Implementation has captured the attention of public
policy scholars for well over 50 years [ 1], yet remains
relatively under-studied compared to other stages of
policy-making. The reasons for this are many and in-
clude challenges with isolating implementation from
other parts of the policy process and a lack of agreement
about conceptual underpinnings [ 2]. This then leads to
challenges in identifying relevant explanatory variables
and analysts often must resort to a “long list of variables
that are potentially useful ” [2]. Even once decisions re-
garding these challenges have been made, the complex,
multi-level, and multi-faceted nature of implementation
creates difficulties designing and conducting high-quality
empirical research that can offer useful generalizations
to those interested in improving the process of imple-
mentation and thus achieving better policy results [ 2].
Research on implementation has also independently
come into sharp focus through the related fields of
knowledge translation and implementation science. Con-
ceptual work on implementation from these fields has
increased at a seemingly exponential rate to the point
where there is a great deal of focus on sorting and classi-
fying the many frameworks, models, and theories and
providing guidance toward their use [ 3–6]. The empir-
ical literature is also rapidly increasing, with over 6200
systematic reviews on consumer-targeted, provider-
targeted, and organization-targeted implementation
strategies in the health field alone (based on a search of
www.healthsystemsevidence.org).
Despite the large number of models, theories, and
frameworks being generated in the knowledge transla-
tion and implementation science fields, the role of policy
in the implementation process appears to be under-
theorized. When policy is included in conceptual work,
it is often identified as a contextual variable [ 7, 8] rather
than being central to the implementation concept itself.
It is also often presented as a broad category of “policy”,
rather than as a variable that is specific and therefore
measurable in empirical work. This lack of conceptual
clarity and empirical work about policy and other
policy-related structural constructs has been noted by
several researchers. For example, a systematic review of
measures assessing the constructs affecting implementa-
tion of health innovations makes specific reference to
the “relatively few ” measures available to assess struc-
tural constructs, which they define as “political norms,
policies and relative resources/socio-economic status ”
[9]. As a result, the field of public policy appears to have
on the one hand, a challenge of too many policy-related
implementation variables, and on the other hand, the
fields of knowledge translation and implementation ap-
pear to have too few.
In recent years some researchers have recognized
these silos in scholarship and have called for more im-
plementation research that integrates public policy and
implementation science and knowledge translation per-
spectives [ 10]. For example, Johansson concludes that
implementation problems could be better understood
through the inclusion of research in public administra-
tion, with more focus on issues such as resource alloca-
tion, priorities, ethical considerations, and the
distribution of power between actors and organizational
boundaries [ 11].
In addition to these challenges, much of the seminal
policy scholarship on implementation from both the
public policy and knowledge translation and implemen-
tation literatures come from the USA [ 12–15]. This has
resulted in a concentration of theoretical and empirical
works that reflect the governance, financial and delivery
arrangements that are particular to the USA [ 16, 17] and
that may not always readily apply in other contexts.
These differences are particularly marked when it comes
to the policy domain of health given the differences of
the US system compared to most others [ 18]. One not-
able exception to this is the European contributions to
the “second generation ” of policy scholarship on imple-
mentation, which adopted the perspective of those at the
“coal face ” of policy implementation [ 19].
In response to these challenges, the objective of our
study was to develop an integrated theoretical frame-
work of the implementation process from a policy per-
spective by combining findings from the public policy,
implementation science, and knowledge translation
fields. By integrating knowledge from these fields using a
critical interpretive synthesis approach, we specifically
examine how policy considerations are described in

<<<PAGE=3>>>
implementation theories, frameworks, and processes
from existing published and gray literature. Our goal
was to generate a theoretical framework to foster an im-
proved understanding of the policy contributions to im-
plementation that can be used in future studies to
generate testable hypotheses about large-scale system
implementation efforts.
Methods
Study design
Given the broad goal of this study, the question of inter-
est, and the scope of potentially applicable literature
from discrete fields that could inform this work, we se-
lected a critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) approach.
Drawing from the techniques of meta-ethnography com-
bined with traditional systematic review processes, CIS
employs an inductive and interpretive technique to crit-
ically inspect the literature and develop a new
conceptualization of the phenomenon of interest. Unlike
traditional systematic reviews that often focus on ques-
tions of effectiveness, CIS is helpful in generating mid-
range theories with strong explanatory power [ 20, 21].
This is suitable for our goal of developing a conceptual
framework that better integrates findings from diverse
fields and affords the opportunity to critically inspect
both individual studies and the literature from each field
as a whole in terms of the nature of the assumptions
underlying each field, and what has influenced their pro-
posed solution [ 22]. The method begins with a compass
question, which evolves throughout the course of the re-
view [ 22, 23]. Our compass question was as follows:
How is policy currently described in implementation
theory and processes and what aspects of policy are im-
portant for implementation success?
Review scope
Our review casts a very broad net in terms of implemen-
tation processes and theories. While our main focus is
on large-scale implementation efforts in health, behav-
ioral health, and human services areas that are not spe-
cific to a particular condition, we also drew from other
large-scale implementation theories and empirical work,
such as from the field of environmental science, that
may yield important insights toward a more integrated
framework of implementation. We drew from two key
sources of literature: (1) existing frameworks, models,
and theories (public policy, implementation science and
knowledge translation) and (2) empirical studies that re-
port on specific implementation processes.
Given our interest in implementation processes from a
policy perspective, we limited our review to implementa-
tion frameworks, models, theories and empirical reports
that describe implementation efforts at a community or
systems level (e.g., city, province/state or country) where
policy considerations are most likely to be an important
factor. Implementation of a single evidence-based prac-
tice (unless across a large-scale) or implementation in a
single organization were excluded, as was research that
focused on behavior change at the individual level.
Electronic search strategy
Using the compass question, and in consultation with a
librarian, we constructed a table of Boolean-linked key
words and then tested several search strategies (Table 1).
The search was then conducted in October 2020 for the
time period of January 2000 –September 2020 using the
following 12 databases: ASSIA, CINAHL (via EBSCO),
EMBASE (via Ovid), ERIC, Health Star (via Ovid),
MEDLINE (via Ovid), PAIS Index, PolSci, PsychINFO,
Social Sciences Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, and
Web of Science. The dates for the policy databases
(PolSci and Social Sciences Abstracts) were extended to
1973 to ensure key conceptual articles would be re-
trieved, such as the seminal work by Sabatier and Maz-
manian in 1980 [ 14]. A gray literature search was also
conducted using Health Systems Evidence (which in-
dexes policy documents related to health system ar-
rangements and implementation strategies, as well as
systematic reviews). Similar search strings were used
across all databases with minor adjustments to ensure
searches were optimized. We prioritized sensitivity
(comprehensiveness) over specificity (precision) in our
search strategy.
Article selection
We excluded articles based on their titles and abstracts
if they did not fit within the study scope or if they were
not conceptual or empirical works. We created add-
itional inclusion criteria that were based on the follow-
ing questions: (1) Is there a moderate (or greater)
chance that the article will shed light on the role of pol-
icy in an implementation process or on the outcomes of
the process? (2) Does the article describe implementa-
tion efforts at a community or systems level? And (3)
does the article identify actors at the government,
organizational or practice level such as policy entrepre-
neurs who may be central to policy implementation ef-
forts? Any articles that did not meet at least one of these
criteria were excluded.
Complementary to the formal search and in keeping
with the inductive strategies that are part of the CIS
process, we also conducted hand searches of the refer-
ence lists of relevant publications and searched the au-
thors’ personal files to identify further articles and
theoretically sampled additional articles to fill conceptual
gaps as the analysis proceeded.
After completing the searches, an Endnote database
was created to store and manage results. Once
Bullock et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:18 Page 3 of 24
<<<PAGE=4>>>
duplicates were removed, a random selection of two per-
cent of the articles was independently screened by two
reviewers (H.B. and A.M.) who were blinded to each
other’s ratings and used the same inclusion criteria. The
reviewers classified each title and abstract as “include”,
“exclude”,o r “uncertain”. Inter-rater agreement was de-
termined using the kappa statistic. This process was
undertaken to improve the methodological rigor by en-
hancing trustworthiness and stimulating reflexivity, not
to establish a quantitative assessment per se [ 24]. Any
discrepancies were then discussed between reviewers
until consensus was reached. Next, one reviewer
assessed the remaining titles and abstracts. Articles clas-
sified as “include” or “uncertain” were kept for full text
review.
The full text of the remaining articles was then
assessed by one reviewer. Articles were excluded at this
stage if they did not provide detailed insight into the
compass question. Articles were also sorted according to
whether they were a conceptual contribution (i.e., pre-
sented a model, theory, framework or theoretical con-
cept on implementation) or an empirical contribution
(i.e., used qualitative, quantitative, review or other re-
search methods to present new findings, or an analysis
of implementation).
Data analysis and synthesis
Our data analysis proceeded in four stages. First, while
screening and assessing the articles for inclusion, we
noted some general observations of how policy was in-
corporated in the literature from each field of interest
(policy/public administration, implementation, and
knowledge translation). Second, we classified articles ac-
cording to how policy was portrayed in implementation
theory and processes. Third, we constructed a data ex-
traction template for conceptual and empirical studies
that included (1) descriptive categories (the author(s),
the name of the model, theory or framework (if pro-
vided), year of publication, author location, focus of the
article, and whether a graphic or visual aid was in-
cluded), (2) content from the article that addressed the
compass question regarding how policy is portrayed and
what aspects are important for success, and (3)
interpretive categories including “synthetic constructs ”
developed by the review team from the article and add-
itional notes on how the article contributed to the devel-
opment of the conceptual model. Additionally, the data
extraction form for the conceptual articles included a
classification of the type of framework according to Nil-
sen’s taxonomy of implementation models, theories, and
frameworks [ 3].
In the fourth and final stage, we initially focused on
the conceptual literature and used it as a base from
which to build our integrated conceptual model. We de-
veloped the synthetic constructs by reviewing the con-
tent from each article that addressed the compass
question and interpreting the underlying evidence using
a constant comparative method to ensure that the emer-
ging synthetic constructs were grounded in the data,
similar to a grounded theory approach [ 25]. These syn-
thetic constructs were then used to begin to build the
conceptual model and an accompanying graphic repre-
sentation of it. We then critiqued the emerging con-
structs to identify gaps in the evidence and emerging
constructs.
Using this emerging model, we purposively sampled
additional conceptual literature to fill the gaps that we
identified and to ensure we incorporated as many rele-
vant concepts as possible. We did this by consulting re-
views of existing models, theories, and frameworks [ 2–6]
to identify additional relevant concepts not captured by
our search strategy and by hand searching the reference
sections of some seminal conceptual papers [ 7, 26].
Once saturation of the conceptual literature was
reached, we purposively sampled a subset of the empir-
ical literature and used this subset to “test” the model
and add additional detail to the theoretical constructs
gleaned from empirical report. We used a similar data
extraction template with the exceptions of removing the
descriptive category of model or theory name and the
interpretive classification using the Nilsen taxonomy [ 3],
but adding the descriptive category of “methodology”.I f
our model did not capture findings from the empirical
studies, we revised it and re-tested. This process contin-
ued until saturation was reached and additional empir-
ical studies yielded no further insights into our model.

Results
Search results and article selection
Our database search retrieved 16,107 documents and 11,
434 unique documents once duplicates were removed.
The review of titles and abstracts was completed inde-
pendently by two reviewers on a random sample ( n =
171) of the documents. The Kappa score was 0.72 indi-
cating substantial agreement. Figure 1 provides a flow
diagram outlining the search strategy. Following these
criteria for the remaining titles and abstracts resulted in
1208 documents included for full text review. The full
text review excluded an additional 940 documents leav-
ing 268 potentially relevant documents (excluded docu-
ments and the rationale for exclusion are available upon
request). Of these, 23 conceptual documents, 243 empir-
ical documents, and two documents that included both
conceptual and empirical elements were included for the
data extraction and analysis phase. We sampled and ex-
tracted data on all of the conceptual articles. For the em-
pirical articles, we chose a maximum variation sampling
approach based on the subject matter and article topic
with an initial sample of 10% of the articles. We also
noted that nine of the articles related to a large, multi-
year national implementation study [ 27–35]. Because
this was the largest and most comprehensive account of
the role of policy in large-scale implementation efforts
identified through our search, we included these as a
sub-group for data extraction. This approach led to data
extraction for 34 empirical articles.
In addition to these two appr oaches, we sampled articles
that filled in conceptual gaps as our model developed. This
process resulted in the retrie val of an additional 26 concep-
tual articles and 3 empirical articles. In total, 86 unique
documents were included with two of these documents
used in both the conceptual an d empirical data extraction
(Tables 2 and 3). While our process was inclusive of English
language publications from any country, the majority of ar-
ticles were conducted by US researchers ( n = 57), with the
others coming mainly from other Western countries (the
UK ( n = 8), the Netherlands ( n =7 ) ,A u s t r a l i a(n =5 ) ,
Canada ( n = 2), Sweden ( n =2 ) ,G e r m a n y(n =2 ) ,a n d
E u r o p e ,C h i n a ,a n dO E C D(n = 1)). Articles covered a
range of topics including health and health care, public
health, mental health and addi ctions, children and youth,
social care, justice, and clima te change, among others. The
conceptual documents included all of the categories of the-
ories, models and frameworks identified by Nilsen [ 3], with

The empirical articles employed a wide array of methods
that fall into the broad categories of qualitative, quantita-
tive, and mixed methods.
General observations
Through this process, we noted several general observa-
tions regarding the characteristics of existing literature.
In terms of the scholarly disciplines, most of the imple-
mentation science literature focused on the
organizational or service provider levels with an em-
phasis on changing practice, often by introducing an
evidence-informed policy or practice (EIPP). The know-
ledge translation literature included policymakers as a
target audience for research evidence, but the focus was
on the agenda setting or policy formulation stages of the
policy cycle, as opposed to the implementation of an
EIPP. Here, the scholarship focused on strategies to in-
crease the use of evidence in policy decision-making.
The public policy literature included theory describing
“top-down”, “bottom-up”, and integrated approaches to
implementing an EIPP. The object of implementation in
this area was the policy itself, rather than a specific pro-
gram or practice. There was often no clear articulation
of independent and dependent policy-related implemen-
tation variables across any field, although many articles
did partially address this.
How policy is described in implementation theory and
processes
Our coding based on the compass question resulted in
the following characterization of how policy is described
in implementation theory and processes:
Policy is described as follows:
1. Context in which implementation occurs (i.e., only
briefly citing a policy as the reason for
implementation)
2. Focusing lens, signaling to systems what the
priorities should be (i.e., referring to policy
statements or attention by policymakers as a signal
about what is important to prioritize)
3. Innovation itself — the implementation object (i.e.,
the “thing”being implemented is policy, such as
new legislative policy on tobacco cessation)
4. Lever of influence in the implementation process
(i.e., policy is identified as at least one of the factors
influencing the implementation process)
5. Enabler/facilitator or barrier to implementation
(moderating variable) (i.e., while policy is identified
as being external to the implementation effort, it is
later found to be a barrier or facilitator to
implementation)
6. Outcome — the success of the implementation
process is at least partially defined and measured by
a change in policy.
7. Policy actors as important participants or leaders in
implementation
Theoretical framework
Our approach to developing the theoretical framework
was twofold. The findings from our analysis suggested
constructs that addressed both the process of implemen-
tation and the factors underpinning the success or fail-
ure of implementation. We therefore first developed a
process model [ 3] that describes the steps in the process
of translating EIPPs into effectively embedded system
changes. Next, we developed a determinants framework,
which specifies the types of policy determinants (inde-
pendent variables) that affect implementation outcomes
(dependent variables). This two-part theoretical frame-
work achieves two goals: (1) the process model is most
useful in describing the process of implementation from
a policy perspective and (2) the determinants framework
is most useful for understanding and explaining policy-
related influences on implementation outcomes.

Part 1 — process model
Figure 2 depicts this novel process model focusing on
one policy or system level. What follows is a narrative
description of the model.
Policy is shaped as it moves through systems. The
process through which policy travels from one level to
another is known as policy transfer [ 36, 45, 46]. Each
policy level is nested in a context that includes existing
ideas (values, evidence, etc.), interests (interest groups,
civil society, etc.), institutions (existing rules and institu-
tional structures), and external factors (natural disaster,
change in economic conditions) that affect the interpret-
ation of the policy package [ 107, 108]. This context af-
fects how a problem is defined, whether it has the
attention of decision makers and whether it is up for ac-
tive decision-making. This aligns with the “problem

definition” and “agenda setting ” stages of the policy cycle
but is also described as part of the “exploration phase ”
in implementation science [ 12, 109]. Once a decision
has been reached that something should be done to ad-
dress a given issue, attention shifts to the “policy devel-
opment” stage of the policy cycle, which aligns with the
“adoption decision and preparation ” stage of implemen-
tation. It is during the policy development/adoption de-
cision and preparation stage that the policy package gets
developed.
Policy package
A policy package usually includes a mix of policy levers
or instruments, including legal and regulatory instru-
ments, economic instruments, voluntary instruments, or
information and education instruments [ 58, 110]. The
policy package can also include some implementation
guidance such as a description of the overall implemen-
tation strategy architecture, the major streams of activity,
timing of events and milestones, and roles and
responsibilities.
The level of ambiguity of the policy package in terms
of its goals and means of attaining them, and the
amount of conflict among actors with respect to the pol-
icy package are important to help characterize the im-
plementation process and to explain its outcomes.
According to Matland [ 64] the consideration of ambigu-
ity and conflict leads to four types of implementation
processes: (1) administrative implementation occurs
when there is low policy ambiguity and low policy con-
flict (e.g., eradication of small pox), (2) political imple-
mentation occurs when there is low ambiguity but high
levels of conflict (e.g., public transit), (3) experimental
implementation occurs when there is high ambiguity but
low conflict (e.g., Head Start programs for young chil-
dren), and (4) symbolic implementation occurs when
both ambiguity and conflict are high and policies only
have a referential goal and differing perspectives on how
to translate the abstract goal into instrumental actions
(e.g., establishing youth employment agencies).
Implementation process
The policy implementation process can start at any level,
move in any direction and can “skip” levels. Power also
shifts as implementation proceeds through levels [ 29,
56]. The level with the most implementation activity
tends to have the most power. This is true not only for
different levels of governance, but as implementation
cascades across organizations, through “street level bu-
reaucrats” [13] and on to the end-user or target popula-
tion (the “recipient”) of the implementation process.
Policy decisions at one level become context for other
levels. Implementation activities at one level can exert
either direct or indirect effects on another level. The
context surrounding each level (prevailing ideas, inter-
ests, institutions, and external events) influences the ac-
ceptability and ultimate success of implementation.
Finally, the overall implementation approach may need
to shift over time in response to a constantly evolving
context. For example, one study found it necessary to
change the implementation approach for a road safety
program in respond to changes in policy authority [ 81].
Outcomes
The process of implementation is undertaken in order
to lead to outcomes, which can be separated and mea-
sured at different levels. Proctor et al. [ 69]e identifies
three separate outcomes: (1) implementation outcomes,
(2) service outcomes, and (3) recipient-related outcomes.
Along with these outcomes, our model includes policy-
and systems-level outcomes. These can be evaluated ac-
cording to the policy outputs (i.e., enforcement variables,
change of perspective of street-level staff), policy out-
comes (i.e., unemployment levels, life-expectancy of
population) or indices of policy system change (i.e., ad-
ministrative re-organization, privatization) [ 56]. While
the measures and levels will vary depending on the size,
scale, and focus of implementation, there is broad agree-
ment that outcomes should be clearly defined a priori
and precisely measured. Evaluation findings regarding
outputs and outcomes can dynamically feed back into
the implementation process as it unfolds. This creates
feedback loops and the process becomes very dynamic
and multi-directional.
Part 2 — determinants framework
Figure 3 presents an overview of our determinants
framework and the relationship among the determinants.
Our findings point to three sets of policy-related factors
that affect the process, outputs, and outcomes of imple-
mentation: (1) policy instruments and strategies, (2) de-
terminants of implementation, and (3) policy actors,
including their characteristics, relationships, and context.
Collectively, these feed into the process of implementa-
tion that proceeds in an iterative fashion along the
stages: exploration, installation/preparation, initial im-
plementation, and full implementation/sustainment [ 12,
109]. The types of policy influences vary according to
the stage of implementation [ 12]. The process of imple-
mentation leads to a variety of outputs and outcomes as
described above.
Policy instruments and strategies
Policy instruments and strategies are the most common
set of factors mentioned in the literature and we found
evidence for each of the instrument types described here,
although with varying levels of detail. Policy instruments
can be applied to implementation in differing ways, often
Bullock et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:18 Page 11 of 24
<<<PAGE=12>>>
with two or three levers used concurrently to implement
a single initiative or strategy [ 90]. In order to classify
these strategies in a meaningful way, we drew on and
adapted elements of a mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive framework that identifies key features of
health and social systems [ 107] and honed in on strat-
egies that are particularly important for implementation
(Table 4). These include strategies focused on the gov-
ernance arrangements, financial arrangements, service
delivery arrangements, and implementation-related sup-
ports in systems. We then divided these strategies ac-
cording to the intended “target” of implementation.
Common targets of implementation from a policy per-
spective include the whole system, organizations, the
workforce or service providers, consumers, and the
innovation itself (the EIPP to be implemented). We wish
to note, however, that because policy-related variables
have not necessarily been treated with the same specifi-
city as other types of implementation variables, the most
common strategies do not reflect the full array of strat-
egies that could be employed.
Determinants
Our framework identifies eight categories of determi-
nants (see “Determinants” box and elsewhere in Fig. 3).
Each of these categories represents a suite of factors that
are hypothesized to independently affect implementation
outcomes. These determinants are described briefly
below and in more detail in Table 5.
I—Characteristics of the evidence-informed policy or
practice (EIPP). The success or failure of a particular
policy package cannot be evaluated based on its intrinsic
characteristics alone [ 56]. Instead, it is important to
examine whether the policy selected is an appropriate
“fit” with the problem [ 91], well-justified [ 78], and
aligned with existing context [ 12, 88].
II— Policy formulation process. This is the shape given
to a policy by the initial formation processes [ 45]. It in-
cludes who in government is responsible for formulating
the policy, their legitimacy and the extent to which there
is opportunity to provide feedback, how much feedback
is given, and the responsiveness in terms of adjustments
made [ 45].
III—Vertical public administration and thickness of
hierarchy. Vertical public administration is the term
used to identify the layers in the policy transfer process.
It refers to separate governments exercising their au-
thority with relative autonomy [ 45]. Policies generated
outside of a socio-political level may be more or less ac-
ceptable to that level. Within a given layer, a particular
policy area may require the mobilization of any number
of institutions, departments, or agencies, and these agen-
cies must act in a coordinated, interdependent fashion,
termed “thickness of the hierarchy ” [55].
IV—Networks/inter-organizational relationships. The
existence and nature of the relationships between paral-
lel organizations who must collaborative in order to
achieve effective implementation and who do not have a
hierarchical relationship [ 45].
V—Implementing agency responses. The factors affect-
ing the responses of implementing agencies can be di-
vided into issues related to the overall characteristics of

the agencies and the behavior of front-line or street-level
staff [ 13, 56].
VI—Attributes and responses from those affected by
EIPP. Attributes include the diversity of target group be-
havior and the target group as a percentage of the popu-
lation [ 14]. Responses include thing like impacts on
workforce stability [ 12].
VII—Timing/sequencing. As implementation is a
process that unfolds over time, it does not always align
with the cycles to which it is subject and the time con-
straints inherent therein [ 86, 87]. Additionally, the exter-
nal context in which implementation occurs is ever
changing and “quintessentially unstable ”, and success
hinges on the ability to perceive those changes and take
the necessary actions to adjust along the way [ 68]. In
Fig. 3, timing/sequencing is placed outside of the deter-
minants box to reflect its importance across all of the
other elements.
VIII—External environment or policy context. Much of
the literature identified factors outside the policy area of
focus that may influence implementation (Fig. 3, outside
the hatched line). Many authors referred to this gener-
ally as the “political and social climate ”, as unmodifiable
or macro “context”,o ra s “socio-economic conditions ”
[9, 14, 38, 40, 52, 70, 75, 80]. We organized this deter-
minant using (1) the 3I+E framework [ 113] and (2) a
taxonomy of health and social system arrangements
[114].
In general, these categories of determinants should be
viewed as interactive and not completely discrete [ 56]
and the inter-relationship among the determinants is
key [ 45].
Policy actors
Our analysis revealed a wide range of policy actors who
are important for implementation. In an attempt to cre-
ate a category of variables that is analytically useful
across contexts, we first divided the types of policy ac-
tors into the broad categories of political actors, bureau-
cratic actors, special interests, and experts [ 115]. To
provide more specificity, we further divided these into a
non-exhaustive list of actor sub-types that were fre-
quently mentioned in the literature and included exam-
ples of the types of roles they tend to assume in
implementation (Table 6). While many of the sub-types
are commonly identified in other phases of the policy
cycle, some receive particular attention in the
implementation literature. These include two types of
special interests: (1) implementing agencies, organiza-
tions or programs that are responsible for implementing
the EIPP (e.g., hospitals, schools), and 2 street-level bu-
reaucrats who, due to the relatively high degree of dis-
cretion in their jobs, and therefore discretion over the
dispensation of public benefits or sanctions to citizens,
can be critical to realizing any large-scale implementa-
tion efforts. There are also three expert sub-types that
are particularly visible during implementation: (1) field
or practice leaders who can be influential in supporting
practice change among professionals, (2) innovation de-
velopers/disseminators who have developed the EIPP to
be implemented and who may contribute or adapt tools
and other types of support to encourage successful im-
plementation, and (3) intermediaries/technical assistance
providers who are organizations, programs, or individ-
uals that work “in between ” policymakers, funders, and
front-line implementers, to facilitate effective implemen-
tation drawing on expertise in implementation.
There are also three categories of actor-related vari-
ables that are important: (1) actor characteristics, (2)
actor relationships, and (3) the context in which the ac-
tors are embedded (Fig. 4). First, the characteristics of
the policy actors (either individual- or organizational-
level) such as their knowledge of the implementation
context, their legitimacy, power and control, and their
leadership in the context of the implementation effort
are often cited as being critical to the success in large-
scale implementation initiatives. Second, the relation-
ships policy actors have with other actors, such as the
level of shared values and beliefs or the coordination
and alignment of actors and their activities, can be pre-
dictive of successful implementation. Finally, the context
of the actors, such as the sustainment of political will
and commitment and the stability of the actors them-
selves can predict the long-term success of
implementation.
Discussion
Our study represents one of the first comprehensive at-
tempts to answer the call of scholars to integrate the
fields of implementation science, knowledge translation,
and policy implementation in an effort to build a more
comprehensive and accurate understanding of imple-
mentation. By integrating conceptual and empirical
works from all three fields, the resultant two-part

all of the policy formulation process to other stakeholders
[12]
3. Level of involvement of service organizations, street-level
bureaucrats and recipients may influence the confidence in,
and support of, the policy decision and improve the chances
for successful implementation [ 97]
1. Government actors responsible for formulating policy [ 56]
2. Perceived legitimacy of government actors [ 56]
3. Extent to which there is opportunity to provide feedback
[56]
4. Responsiveness of policymakers to feedback [ 56]
5. Level of involvement of non-governmental actors [ 12, 78,
97]
6. Adequacy of planning for implementation (consideration
of resources for implementation) [ 97]
7. Constraints experienced during formulation [ 12, 26]
III. Vertical public
administration and
thickness of hierarchy
1. Vertical Public Administration
(a) Term used to identify the layers in the policy transfer
process
(b) Refers to separate governments exercising their authority
with relative autonomy [ 56]
(c) Policies generated outside of a socio-political level may
be more or less acceptable to that level
2. Thickness of Hierarchy
(a) Number and complexity of institutions, departments, or
agencies at a particular socio-political level
(b) The thicker the hierarchy, the more managerial
competence, professionalism, and governance skills are
required by public servants in order to support effective
implementation [ 59]
1. Number of socio-political levels [ 56]
2. Acceptability of policy generated outside of a particular
socio-political level [ 114]
3. Appropriateness of socio-political level [ 86]
4. Thickness of each socio-political level (number and com-
plexity of institutions, departments, or agencies and their co-
ordination and interdependence) [ 55]
IV. Networks/inter-
organizational
relationships
1. Reflects the existence and nature of the relationships
between parallel organizations who must collaborative in
order to achieve effective implementation and who do not
have a hierarchical relationship [ 56]
2. Better connections among stakeholders also increases the
opportunity for rapid diffusion and informal spread of
innovation, facilitating implementation
1. Degree of coordination among:
(a) Systems [ 80]
(b) Organizations [ 86]
(c) Donors /other funders [ 84]
(d) Leaders [ 12]
2. Formality (formal or informal) [ 72]
3. Network type (e.g., policy or inter-organizational) [ 53]
4. Coherence and strength of connections [ 112]
V. Implementing
agency responses
1. Factors affecting the responses of implementing agencies
can be divided into:
(a) Issues related to the overall characteristics of the
agencies
(b) Behavior of front-line or street-level staff [ 56]
2. Overall “health” of organizations and how front-line/street-
level bureaucrats use their discretion and power impact im-
plementation success
1. Overall characteristics of the agencies:
(a) Level of organizational control [ 56, 76]
(b) Rate of staff turnover [ 88]
(c) Organizational decision-making processes [ 88]
(d) Extent of policy and behavior-related change required
[14, 67]
(e) Attitudes of the agencies [ 14, 47]
(f) Resources of the agencies (e.g., minimum “investment
threshold” in implementation infrastructure [ 97] or cost-
absorptive capacity of agency to absorb additional costs as-
sociated with implementation [ 12] or certainty of funding
[49])
(g) Impetus for chang e[ 77] (e.g., external mandates may
increase an agency ’s predisposition (i.e. motivation), but not
its capacity to adopt an innovation; mandates may divert
activity away from other innovations or locally generated
priorities [ 26])
(h) Perception of implementation approach (e.g. if approach
is punitive, mandatory, or “top down ”)[ 82]
2. Behavior of front-line or street-level staff
(a) Level of discretion and level of relative autonomy from
organizational authority affect the amount of interpretation
of EIPP [ 13, 76]

theoretical framework provides additional clarity regard-
ing the process of implementation viewed from a policy
perspective and identifies a number of policy-related de-
terminants that can be tested empirically in the future.
A key strength of our study was the methodological
approach we took to theory building.
First was the comprehensiveness of the search strategy,
which aimed to identify scholarship from more than one
academic discipline and across wide range of topics be-
yond health. The literature identified through the search
process revealed some interesting parallels and unique
differences between the fields that made it clear to us
the extent of the lack of integration up to this point. Per-
haps not surprisingly, the area of public health seemed
to be the most fertile ground for integration. This is
likely due to their focus on population-level concerns re-
quiring system-wide implementation of EIPPs and a di-
verse implementation ecosystem. The search strategy
was part of the mixed methods approach of the CIS,
which blended the rigor of a systematic search method-
ology that is explicit and replicable, with the inductive,
iterative, and purposive sampling techniques from
Table 5 Determinants of implementation from a policy perspective and the factors that characterize the determinants (Continued)
Determinant Description Factors that characterize determinant
(b) Competing accountabilities (e.g., state, market,
professional, societal) [ 76]
(c) Power distribution between actors at the front-line,
agency, and political levels [ 30]
(d) Personal characteristics including their knowledge, skills,
and perceived support from colleagues [ 88]
VI. Attributes and
responses from those
affected by EIPP
1. The characteristics of the people affected by the EIPP,
their response to it, and the impact of the responses
2. Most evident when those affected are powerful, such as
in regulatory policy when those regulated are large
organizations [ 56]
1. Diversity of target group behavior [ 14]
2. Target group as percentage of the population [ 14]
3. Impacts on stability of the workforce and responses to
instability [ 12]
VII. Timing/sequencing 1. Implementation processes at scale require adequate time,
which does not always align with the cycles they are subject
to and some authors have identified the lack of time or
short-term opportunism as barriers to effective implementa-
tion [e53, 54]
2. The sequencing of activities and alignment of
implementation with other cycles is also important
1. Balance of predictability and adaptiveness to changing
circumstances [ 68, 93]
2. The simultaneous address of system levers (including
policy changes, measurement systems, and regulatory
mechanisms) [ 97]
3. Timing and pace of cycles, such as political, policy, and
funding cycles [ 104]
4. Specific aspects of time that impact implementation:
(a) The phased structure of the implementation process
[104]
(b) When and how the implementation efforts are initiated
[104]
(c) Timeframes for funding and leadership support [ 104]
(d) The need to demonstrate the impacts early
(e) Return on investment of time and money [ 104]
VIII. External
environment or policy
context
1. Factors outside of the policy area of focus may influence
implementation
2. Can be referred to generally as the “political and social
climate”, as unmodifiable or macro “context” or as “socio-
economic conditions ” [9, 14, 38, 40, 52, 70, 75, 80]
3. While most included articles did not address these
determinants in depth, an overall examination of extracted
data suggested two theoretical frameworks would be useful
for classifying and understanding these determinants:
(a) 3I+E framework that identifies the institutions, interests,
ideas, and external events that help explain what influences
policy choices [ 113]
(b) Taxonomy of health and social system arrangements
classified according to the governance, financial, and
delivery arrangements [ 114]
4. These broader context and system arrangements may be
critically important in explaining implementation outcomes
and these frameworks provide some logic and organization
to potential variables
1. 3I+E framework
(a) Ideas (e.g., the interplay between beliefs and values of
policymakers and research evidence in a general way [ 38])
(b) Interests (e.g., the political culture and the depth of social
cleavages [ 58])
(c) Institutions (e.g., relevant policies from other areas that
“may represent potentially powerful contextual effects ” [74,
78])
(d) External factors (e.g., technology and technological
changes [ 14, 40]) economic forces operating in the overall
society [ 60], and environmental (in)stability [ 53, 67]
2. Taxonomy of health and social system arrangements [ 114].
(a) Governance arrangements that are not specific to the
EIPP being implemented but are still relevant to
understanding implementation outcomes (e.g., centralization
and power distribution of government [ 30, 72] or the form
of governance structures (omnibus/discrete) [ 72])
(b) Financial arrangements (e.g., private/public contractual
relations, reimbursement rates and mechanisms [ 72], and
existing resource distribution [ 30])
(c) Delivery arrangements — referred to more generally in the
health-focused articles as “health(care) system and services
context” [38, 75]o r “medical delivery system ” [40]

qualitative review methods to build mid-range theory.
The result is a theoretical framework that is clearly
linked to the literature, which should instill some confi-
dence in the academic community regarding its ground-
ing. Critical interpretive synthesis is a relatively new
approach but is growing in popularity for these reasons.
Despite the merits of our approach, we did identify
some challenges. First, we believe the literature from
public policy may be underrepresented for several rea-
sons: (1) search terms did not retrieve as much from
those fields (it could be that there are terms used more
commonly in those fields that would have increased
yield), (2) the disciplinary approach to the scholarship in
public policy often means the articles were less explicit
about methods and this meant that more were excluded
as not being “high yield ”, and (3) more of that scholar-
ship is captured through other media (e.g., books) and
while some of these were included, our approach was
not as sensitive to retrieving these types of documents.
We also did not include all of the empirical articles for
data extraction and we may have missed a key theme or
framework component. While we believe this is unlikely
because we continued to sample until saturation was
reached, it is still possible something was missed. Finally,
there were few documents from low- and middle-
income countries included in the final sample. Specific
efforts to include relevant documents from LMICs in fu-
ture may enrich and refine the model.
As a result of this research, policymakers and practi-
tioners looking to use a conceptual model to guide their
implementation activities have two additional options
that they can be confident draw from existing theory
and empirical works. Large-scale implementation en-
deavors or those that have started small and are looking
to scale-up should at least be mindful of the critical roles
of policy during the process and what policy-related fac-
tors may be important for success. Those planning im-
plementation activities can consider the elements
presented in the framework as factors that may require
consideration and adjustment prior to implementing
something new. Our work supports thinking beyond the
program or practice levels and unpacks policy consider-
ations that may have influence on, or affect the effective-
ness of, a program or practice. Furthermore, the
inclusion of policy-related outputs and outcomes in our
framework offers policymakers and practitioners the op-
tion of additional indicators of success on which they
can measure and report.
Like any new theoretical contribution, our framework
would benefit from further refinement and testing by
the research community. Future research could adopt
the process model to guide a policy-intensive implemen-
tation effort and test it to determine its usefulness in
such efforts. Researchers could also select particular
framework elements and unpack them further for add-
itional precision and clarity, drawing from multiple fields
of scholarship. Our framework also offers some much-
needed policy variables that have been lacking in the im-
plementation science and knowledge translation fields,
which could be incorporated as part of a suite of vari-
ables in implementation research.
Conclusions
Our study represents an early effort at integrating the
fields of public policy, implementation science, and
knowledge translation. We have learned that there is in-
deed a great deal that each of the fields can learn from
the other to advance our understanding of policy- and
systems-level implementation efforts and hope that these
efforts are followed by more interdisciplinary research in
order to truly bridge this divide.
