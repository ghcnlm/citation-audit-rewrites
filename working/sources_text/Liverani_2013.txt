Evidence in Public Health Policy. A Systematic Review

Abstract
Background: There is increasing recognition that the development of evidence-informed health policy is not only a
technical problem of knowledge exchange or translation, but also a political challenge. Yet, while political scientists have
long considered the nature of political systems, the role of institutional structures, and the political contestation of policy
issues as central to understanding policy decisions, these issues remain largely unexplored by scholars of evidence-informed
policy making.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies that examined the influence of key features of political
systems and institutional mechanisms on evidence use, and contextual factors that may contribute to the politicisation of
health evidence. Eligible studies were identified through searches of seven health and social sciences databases, websites of
relevant organisations, the British Library database, and manual searches of academic journals. Relevant findings were
extracted using a uniform data extraction tool and synthesised by narrative review.
Findings: 56 studies were selected for inclusion. Relevant political and institutional aspects affecting the use of health
evidence included the level of state centralisation and democratisation, the influence of external donors and organisations,
the organisation and function of bureaucracies, and the framing of evidence in relation to social norms and values.
However, our understanding of such influences remains piecemeal given the limited number of empirical analyses on this
subject, the paucity of comparative works, and the limited consideration of political and institutional theory in these studies.
Conclusions: This review highlights the need for a more explicit engagement with the political and institutional factors
affecting the use of health evidence in decision-making. A more nuanced understanding of evidence use in health policy
making requires both additional empirical studies of evidence use, and an engagement with theories and approaches
beyond the current remit of public health or knowledge utilisation studies.

Introduction
In the past two decades there has been a tremendous increase in
expenditure on global health research. The Global Forum for
Health Research, for example, reported that international funding
for this has risen from US
$30 billion in 1986 to an estimated$163
billion in 2005 [1]. Despite this growth, concerns remain that
health policy and practice are not adequately informed by the best
available evidence, and that research findings may take too long to
be incorporated in policy processes. As former World Health
Organization (WHO) director Lee Jong-wook stressed ‘‘there is a
sense that science has not done enough, especially for public
health, and there is a gap between today’s scientific advances and
their application: between what we know and what is actually
being done’’ [2]. In this context, a growing body of literature has
begun to study the use of evidence in public health policy-making
through empirical and conceptual analyses, attempting to identify
technical barriers and facilitators that may influence the timely
uptake of research findings [3,4]. In addition, a diverse range of
initiatives has attempted to bridge gaps that are seen to exist
between research and policy [5], including regional networks to
link researchers and policy makers [6], user-friendly data
repositories [7], guidelines for drafting and using evidence-
informed policy briefs [8], and training of decision makers on
how to use systematic review information [9].
However, within research and policy communities there has
been increasing awareness that getting research into policy is not
only a technical matter of knowledge translation and exchange,
but also a political challenge [10]. A report by the Alliance for
Health Policy and Systems Research, for instance, noted that:
‘‘Policy making is a complex and essentially political process that is
influenced by several factors (…) Recognition and understanding
of decision-making processes and factors that influence the process
can increase the potential for inserting research information into
the process’’ [11].
Outside the field of public health, the discipline of policy studies
has long explored the decision-making process, illustrating how
different political systems shape the capacity of governments to

develop effective policies. Key political system features include the
territorial structure of the state – whether it is a unitary
(centralised) or a devolved (federal) state [12] – the level of
democracy (the degree of political pluralism and freedom), and the
role of the bureaucracy (in particular their degree of control over
the policy advice given to decision makers) [13,14].
It is also well established in social and political science that
decision-making processes involve tradeoffs between competing
interests and values [15] and, as such, analyses of policy making
must pay attention to the ways in which a given issue is politicised.
Even within a single sector (such as health), policy decisions can be
contested in numerous ways. All decisions will have implications
for sectoral budgets and priorities, and will imply certain
opportunity costs; but health policy issues are also likely to involve
social considerations beyond clinical outcomes alone - such as
questions of equity, justice, or morality – all of which can influence
decision making around any given body of health evidence [16].
While social and political scientists have long considered the
nature of political systems, the role of institutional structures, and
the political contestation of policy issues as central to understand-
ing decision making, these issues remain largely unexplored by
scholars of evidence-informed policy making. It remains unclear,
for example, how the political nature of a given health issue might
affect the use of relevant evidence (for example, when an issue is
morally contested or impinges on powerful economic interests).
Nor is there significant understanding of whether particular state
structures or institutional bureaucratic arrangements may facilitate
or impede the use of evidence for health decision making.
To advance our understanding of these questions, we conducted
a systematic review of empirical studies that examine the complex
interface between politics, policy, and the use of evidence. Previous
systematic reviews have been undertaken on aspects of health
research utilisation, but these have primarily focussed on technical
aspects of knowledge translation including barriers to evidence use,
and ways to overcome them. Past reviews have addressed, for
example, policy makers’ perceptions of their use of evidence [17],
the effectiveness of interventions designed to increase the use of
research in clinical practice [18], and the usefulness of systematic
reviews for health care managers and policy-makers [19]. This
journal has also recently published a systematic review of the use of
evidence in settings with universal health care systems, which
concluded that ‘‘organisational, political, and strategic factors’’
restricted the use of evidence in public health decision making.
That paper further noted that most systematic reviews of policy
studies ‘‘tend to overlook the impact of political and institutional
context’’ [20]. By contrast, our systematic review explicitly
addressed the political nature of decision making, seeking to
identify what is currently known about the ways in which political
factors shape the uptake and use of evidence in health policy
making. In order to capture the variety of potentially relevant
themes, we maintained a broad understanding of ‘politics’ that
goes beyond state institutions and party politics, to include political
culture, ideologies, and informal arrangements at both the
national and international level [21]. For the same reason, we
reviewed studies that focused both on specific health conditions as
well as broader health concerns such as access to care, the
organisation of health services, and the social determinants of
health. However, as our focus was specifically at the policy level,
we discarded studies that did not focus on public health issues,
such as studies that examined the uptake of evidence-based
guidelines within routine clinical practice.
Methods
Search Strategy
The methods of the analysis and inclusion criteria for the study
were specified in advance and are documented in the attached
protocol (Text S1). Eligible studies were initially identified using
the following health and social sciences databases: Global Health,
Healthcare Management Information Consortium (HMIC),
International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), MED-
LINE, PubMed, Social Policy and Practice, and ISI Web of
Science. No limitations were placed on language, although all
search terms were in English. Whilst there is a literature on
evidence use in policy making that predates the period reviewed
[22–25], we limited our search to materials published after 1990
for two principal reasons. First, we were mainly interested in
exploring the contemporary context of health policy making.
Second, the ‘evidence based medicine’ movement, which gave an
increased impetus to demands for evidence informed health policy,
is widely seen to have taken shape in the 1990s [26] (for example,
with the creation of the Cochrane collaboration in 1993). The
listed databases were searched in May 2012, using two broad
query strings that enabled comprehensive searches of relevant
material:
1) Health polic* AND (research OR evidence) AND (governance OR
institution* OR polit*);
2) Evidence-based AND (health* OR medicine) AND policy AND
(governance OR institution* OR polit*)
Internet search engines such as Google and Google Scholar
were also used to identify material which was not published in
journals or available online (e.g. monographs and book chapters).
The British Library catalogue was searched to identify relevant
titles which met our inclusion criteria. Individual websites were
then reviewed for grey literature, selected on the basis of their
relevance to the subject and on recommendation from key
individuals working in the field. These included the online
repositories of the Program in Policy Decision Making at
McMaster University, the Centre for Evidence & Policy at King’s
College, the WHO Evidence into Policy Network (EVIPNet), and
Evidence to Policy Initiative (E2Pi) at the University of California
at San Francisco.
Finally, manual literature searches were undertaken in the
online archives of the following journals from 1990 until May
2012: BMC Health Services Research; Evidence & Policy; Health Policy;
Health Policy & Planning; Journal of Health Politics, Policy, and Law;
Milbank Quarterly; Social Science & Medicine; Health Research Policy and
Systems. The bibliographies of all included text were also reviewed
for further relevant citations. Articles were downloaded to an
Endnote database and duplicates were removed. All remaining
references were then transferred to aMendeley database to facilitate
collaboration during the screening and data extraction phases.
Selection of Studies
Electronic searches yielded 9,730 items. A further 34 items were
identified through searches in journal archives, recommendations
of colleagues, and through following up of references found in the
included articles. After removing of duplicates, 9,257 unique
studies remained. The first and second author conducted a
preliminary screening of all retrieved studies on the basis of titles
and abstracts. 647 articles met the inclusion criteria and were
retained. The full texts of these were obtained and assessed for
relevance (Figure 1).

Given the dearth of specific studies on the politics of evidence-
based health policy, we adopted an inclusive approach throughout
the selection process. It was decided to include works whose aims
were tangential to the central focus of our review, but which
presented and discussed relevant findings. However, papers that
provided a description of wider political and institutional contexts,
but did not explore the ways in which such contexts may have
shaped the use of evidence were excluded. We also excluded all
contributions that were not supported by empirical data, such as
commentaries, letters, and conceptual frameworks. Finally, all
three authors discussed and refined the inclusion criteria at several
stages of the process and independently reviewed the final list of
articles included.
Data Extraction and Analysis
The first and the second author extracted data from included
studies using a uniform data extraction tool (Table S1). In addition
to information on the study characteristics (e.g. methodological
approach, data sources, country focus, health issues), relevant
findings were identified and analysed according to three research
questions derived from political studies theories and designed to
address the gaps identified above in the existing literature on
evidence to policy processes:
1. Whether the study analysed features of political systems that
influenced the use (or neglect) of evidence for health policy;
2. Whether the study analysed institutional mechanisms that
influenced the use (or neglect) of health research;
3. Whether the study analysed other contextual factors that
contributed to the politicisation and contestation of health
evidence.
The relevant material extracted from the included studies was
tabulated and organised according to the three overarching
questions noted above. Within these broad thematic areas,
collected data were combined according to recurrent issues that
emerged from the studies themselves and presented by narrative
review [27]. Given the diverse and generally non-cumulative
nature of selected studies, it was not possible to incorporate all
extracted information in the presentation and discussion of results.
However, Table S2 provides the comprehensive collection of
research findings.
Results
After full-text review, 56 studies were selected for inclusion.
They focused on a variety of countries, settings, and health issues.
Most included studies utilised qualitative methods such as semi-
structured interviews and critical analysis of policy documents,
although different approaches and sampling criteria were used.
Most studies examined single cases of research use in one country,
but 12 studies included multiple country comparison or data and 4

studies provided comparative analysis of different cases of research
utilisation in the same country. With few exceptions, selected
studies can be situated in the field of public health and were
primarily driven by practical concerns with health care and health
services. Indeed, 35 out of 56 studies were published in health
journals, while the majority of the remainder were published in
public policy journals. In most contributions the analysis of
political and institutional elements was often subordinate to other
research objectives, such as the identification of technical barriers
to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence or descriptions of the
ways in which evidence was used to inform specific health policies
or programmes. Only 6 studies were judged to have explicitly
engaged with political theories or concepts [28–33]. In the
majority of cases, when issues relevant to our research questions
were included in the studies, often there was only passing mention
of these factors, and the points raised were rarely analysed in
depth. However, due to the multi-disciplinary nature of our
inquiry and desire for maximum coverage, we opted to include
any studies which might provide insights for each of our research
questions.
Political Systems
The first of the key questions we set out to explore is whether
any links could be found between the use of evidence for health
policy and key features of different state political systems (such as
the structure of decision making authority, or level of public
participation and democracy). We identified 4 studies that
explicitly addressed this question, all of which were concerned
with the implications of centralised governance. One study
explored decision-making processes at the UK National Health
Service (NHS) prior to the reforms of the late 1990s [30]. This
study suggested that centralised political systems are likely to be
less open to the uptake of research findings than de-centralised
systems. The concentration of power was found to prevent
pluralistic debate and thus the need for evidence to support
competing views. By contrast, it was argued that in countries in
which policy is made through ad-hoc, issue specific coalitions, such
as the United States, and in federal systems in which policy is
made at the provincial level, ‘‘there is more need for research as
legitimation or ammunition’’ to justify policy decisions and defend
them against the criticisms of opponents.
Another study examined the failure of the British government to
handle risk communication during the public health crisis of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the late 1980s.
Having analysed the political and institutional context in which
decisions about scientific evidence were made, this study found
that a centralised system in which government agencies control
expert advice with little public oversight is more vulnerable to the
pressure of expert interest groups in decisions around evidence use
[29]. Other studies documented how financial and corporate
interest groups exert pressure on decision makers either to take up
or ignore research findings, based on their commercial interest
[34–37]. One study argued that the lack of pressure from
organised lobbies in Laos facilitated the use of evidence for health
policy on essential medicines in this country [38]. However, none
of these studies explicitly examined whether differing political or
institutional contexts may be more or less susceptible to such
influences. Finally, one study on the use of health research in
Mexico found that hierarchical management of information in a
centralised system may prevent research results to arrive at
operational levels, where they could have greater impact and
usefulness [37].We did not identify any studies that analysed in
depth the use of health evidence in one-party or authoritarian
states. However, a case study on the development of health
insurance in rural China illustrated the value of having a broker in
the research team who understands political practices and thus can
propose solutions that are compatible with the wider policy agenda
of the central government [39]. The same study also noted that
international experts and organisations have played a key role in
providing research input for radical policy change in this country,
given the lack of autonomy of domestic bodies that support health
and health services research.
We found no studies that systematically explored the effects of
democratisation on the use of evidence, but the findings of some
studies which noted the importance of changes in regime are
relevant to this question. Two studies reported that the shift to
parliamentary democracy in South Africa in 1994 created a new
governance model that was more open to the uptake of research
findings, as academic researchers were appointed to managing
positions in the National Department of Health and new research
institutes were established to support policy making [40,41].
Similarly, another study reported that the establishment of a
democratic government in Uruguay after the end of the military
dictatorship in 1983 contributed to the enhancement of research
capacities for infectious disease control and a culture of evidence-
based policy. For example, new funding was allocated to science
and the reconstruction of research facilities, which had been
reduced drastically during the totalitarian regime [42]. However,
none of these studies provide an analysis of specific political
mechanisms that facilitated these developments. In principle,
health research institutes could also have been appointed during
the previous regimes. Indeed, a comparative study of the ‘‘market
for evidence’’ in child health policy found that the nature of the
political system (e.g. democratic or autocratic) is not necessarily a
key factor in influencing the use of evidence in policy making [43].
Other studies suggested that potential biases in the use of evidence
may result from processes of democratic deliberation, including
opportunistic use of evidence to delay decision-making [44], to
legitimate particular policy positions or to discredit opponents in
political debates [45–48]. One study on the policy process around
the implementation of a bowel cancer screening programme in
Australia noted that evidence may become more contested during
electoral campaigns, as underlying tensions between stakeholders
who control the selection of evidence for policy are likely to be
amplified [49]. Finally, one study on health policy making in
Australia found that issue polarisation dictates the extent to which
research or researchers are used technically or politically [50].
Institutional Mechanisms
Our second area of analysis was to identify empirical studies of
how different institutional mechanisms (such as the structures,
processes, or regulations followed by bureaucracies) shape the use
of health evidence. While more studies were identified which
addressed this issue than the theme of political systems, many
studies cut across a wide range of topics, providing a variety of
disparate findings.
One study on policy for health inequalities in the UK, for
example, found that the division of responsibilities within
government bureaucracies limited the use of evidence, arguing
that ‘‘individual civil servants are compelled to focus on small,
specific areas of policy activity, making it extremely difficult for
them to engage with ideas beyond their immediate area of
responsibility’’ [32]. Two further cases illustrated how institutional
‘silos’ could limit evidence consideration for complex health issues
that require multi-disciplinary evidence and horizontal thinking
across sectoral boundaries, such as in a bowel cancer programme
in New Zealand [51] and HIV/AIDS policy in Cambodia [52].

<<<PAGE=5>>>
Institutional path-dependency was found to be another impor-
tant hurdle to unbiased or systematic evidence use. A study of
WHO’s management of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggested that
previously chosen policy responses are likely to be prioritised over
alternative evidence-informed options, especially when the health
issue is surrounded by scientific uncertainties [28]. Another study
of HIV policy in Tanzania suggested that path-dependency may
result from self-perpetuating mechanisms of organisational prac-
tices. This study found that evidence indicating a need to address
upstream structural drivers of HIV was not acted upon because,
‘‘any shift in prevention priorities would imply taking funds away
from some organisations and directing them to others - putting at
stake the former’s institutional existence’’ [53].
Another institutional challenge noted in three studies was how
high turnover of staff in health departments could undermine the
systematic use of evidence for policy or planning [32,49,53]. One
of these studies noted that frequent replacement of civil servants in
UK health departments resulted in a lack of ‘institutional memory’
and the recycling of old but seemingly novel ideas, thus ‘‘creating
the illusion that research is informing policy far more than it is’’
[32].
We found a number of studies which included some institutional
analysis of bodies outside government departments of health which
are tasked with facilitating evidence utilisation and knowledge
brokering. A comparative study of nine Latin American and three
European countries, for example, found that the use of evidence
from economic evaluations for health policy decisions was
increased in countries (such as the UK and Portugal) which had
formally-mandated organisations to provide such evidence [54].
Other studies reported that the existence of organisational and
institutional structures for knowledge brokering and exchange can
greatly facilitate the uptake of evidence [6,55–58].
Works focussing on non-governmental evidence-providing
bodies also pointed to how personal connections between
knowledge brokers and decision makers can be an important
factor increasing the uptake and use of evidence in both high-
income [55] and developing countries [39,59]. One study,
however, found that in three high income countries (US, UK,
and the Netherlands) greater attention was paid to the reputation
and professional legitimacy of institutions charged with the
production or use of evidence, while in three middle-income
countries (China, South Africa and Chile) it was personal
relationships with experts that appeared essential [60]. Another
comparative study in Bolivia, Cameroon, Mexico, and the
Philippines found that the existence of a strongly motivated senior
health official who championed evidence-informed concepts was
essential in driving the policy process [61].
The Political Nature of the Health Issue
Our final theme of analysis was to explore other contextual
factors that may influence and politicise the use of evidence in
health policy making. A set of studies were identified that analysed
how existing normative positions including: values and moral
convictions [31,48,62–64], religious and cultural identity [65,66],
or nationalism [46,67,68] can bias the selection or interpretation
of evidence used for health policy development. One study showed
how the understanding of evidence on the advantages of
breastfeeding in the US may have been biased by highly
entrenched values and beliefs around motherhood and infant
rearing [64]. Another study in Ghana similarly noted that
evidence on the health effects of procedures such as male
circumcision were influenced by religious and cultural views
[66]. Two further studies found that resistance to Western
concepts of science, grounded in ideas of nationalism and cultural
specificity, helped to explain why former South African president
Mbeki rejected evidence on the causal link between HIV and
AIDS [67,68].
Several further studies noted how the alignment of health issues
with existing political priorities in a country can affect the use of
evidence. A study on health policy in China reported that research
findings on the impact of health expenditure on rural poverty had
a direct impact on policy because they reflected already existing
concerns of policy-makers about economic growth and poverty
reduction [39]. Further case studies from the UK [69,70], the US
[71], Uganda [46], and a comparison of three African countries
[72] also suggested that the objectives of the wider policy agenda
may influence how and what evidence is used. Related to the
above, 4 studies noted the importance of the discursive framing of
evidence in shaping its use in policy debates [31,36,73,74]. One
study, examining the policy debate on tobacco control in New
Zealand, concluded that ’exceptional storytellers’ are needed to
drive the process of policy making [36]. Another study illustrated
that successful political uptake of evidence-based solutions may
require ‘‘a shift in meaning of the idea or, at the very least, a more
flexible construction of the idea’’ [33], especially if policy strategies
overtly conflict with the dominant political ideology.
An article from Canada further suggested that policy decisions
about the content of an intervention may be more amenable to the
influence of research than broader or more conceptual decisions
with multiple social implications [75]. Another study from Israel
made a similar distinction, finding that evidence is more likely to
be used for ’second order’ decisions (how to do something), rather
than for ‘first order’ decisions (whether to do it), although it found
first order decision which were technical in nature were also likely
to be informed by data [76].
Several studies from lower-income settings noted that when a
health issue is particularly important to international donors, this
too can impact on the use of evidence, including the ways in which
research is prioritised and conducted, and how findings are
interpreted and used to inform policy decisions. Donors tended to
promote interventions with strong evidence bases, but they do so
in ways that may neglect local context, needs and capabilities
[43,52,53,77,78].
Finally, the tensions between national and international
concerns and the influence of national as opposed to international
evidence was also a theme that appeared in some included studies.
A study from the Netherlands found that there was a growing
reliance on international rather than national data, raising
concerns over the relevance of such research to specific country
needs, the ease of access to findings, and the perceived legitimacy
by local policy makers [79]. However, a seven-country compar-
ative study of vaccine adoption [80] and a health insurance study
from China [39] both reported that the use of local data had a
stronger impact on national policy process than evidence from
international sources.
Discussion
This review arose from recognition of the importance of
political factors in shaping the use of evidence to inform health
policy processes, yet the limited explicit engagement with relevant
theories in the literature on evidence-informed health policy. We
structured our analysis around three analytical themes emerging
from social and political sciences as explaining policy outcomes:
the features of state political systems, the institutional structures
and arrangements of bodies using evidence, and the politicisation
of specific issues. A stand-out finding from our review was that
little empirical work has been done explicitly analysing these

<<<PAGE=6>>>
issues, with many included studies dealing with them only
indirectly.
The systematic review approach, however, enabled us to
identify the political and institutional factors that have so far been
identified in the existing literature as important in shaping the
uptake of evidence for health policy making. These factors include
concentration of power and political centralisation, levels of
democratisation, institutional mechanisms and processes, turnover
of staff in government bodies, the influence of donors and external
organisations, the pressure of wider policy strategies and political
cultures, as well as the alignment of evidence with predominant
values or existing political agendas. Results also indicate that
processes of evidence-based policy making often involve a complex
interplay of these factors, both at the national and international
level.
Nevertheless, our understanding of these issues remains patchy
and inconclusive. The selected studies do not constitute a clearly
defined body of research, developed around shared debates,
research questions or theoretical approaches. While many studies
relied on theories of knowledge utilisation, these were generally
applied to support and guide empirical work rather than using
empirical works to test or refine specific theories. Most notably,
despite the fundamentally political nature of decision making
processes, the extensive literature on political institutions, and the
highly contested nature of many health issues, very few works
could be identified which explicitly applied policy science
perspectives to understand the use of evidence in health policy
making. As a result, the analysis of political and institutional
influences was limited, with no significant consideration of key
issues such as the influence of party systems, the relations between
different branches of government, power imbalances and hierar-
chies, and questions of political legitimacy.
Furthermore, the highly contextual nature of the policy process
points to the need for comparative case study analysis to facilitate
theory development [81]. For example, comparative approaches
would be particularly fruitful to test hypotheses about the effects of
more or less centralised political or administrative systems on the
use of evidence. A number of multi-country studies relevant to our
issues of interest were included in our review, but we found no
studies that explicitly tested hypotheses in such a way and only 5
studies in which the use of a comparative approach was associated
with a more explicit engagement with political and institutional
analysis [33,43,66,78,82]. Similarly, we found only 4 studies that
examined comparatively the effects of political and institutional
change on evidence use practices within the same country
[37,42,69,74].
Finally, we conducted this literature review according to
systematic, and therefore replicable, criteria for data collection
and inclusion [83]. However, the application of these standards for
analysis and data extraction was not always straightforward.
Quality appraisal posed particular challenges, given the diversity
of selected studies, the multitude of disciplinary approaches (with
no standard of practice on methods or method reporting) and the
lack of universal standards for the definition of ‘quality’ in
qualitative research [84,85]. In light of this, we decided to include
all empirical studies that met our inclusion criteria as long as they
documented their data sources, including those in which methods
of data analysis were not clear. We shall note that similar
challenges have been raised in past discussions around the
difficulties in identifying clear criteria by which qualitative
research should be assessed in systematic reviews [86].
Despite these limitations, our review contributes to improved
recognition of the political dimension of health evidence utilisa-
tion, and can thus stimulate critical thinking about current policy
debates. In particular, the perceived need to ‘bridge the gap’
between research and policy has encouraged the development of
technical recommendations to facilitate research uptake; with the
universal value of using the research often taken for granted. For
example, some consensus has emerged in recent years about the
benefits of closer interactions between researchers and policy-
makers, from the early stages of research processes [4,87–89]. One
study concluded that ‘‘effective use of evidence requires a move
away from a simple characterisation of ‘two communities’ and a
new view of research being generated jointly in partnership with
researchers and decision-makers’’ [90]. As recent initiatives
illustrate [5], such interactions have the potential to promote the
generation of policy-relevant research in different contexts.
However, such efforts typically overstate the ability of better
linkages between researchers and policy makers to facilitate
evidence use or overcome political contestation, as was docu-
mented by an early evaluation of research utilisation at the UK
Department of Health [22]. Given the high turnover of politicians
and administrators in key decision making positions, training or
linking of individuals may not produce sustained improvements in
evidence use. Rather, establishment of institutional processes and
procedures setting the standards for evidence use over time may be
needed.
Furthermore, our approach raises concerns about the public
health community’s tendency to depoliticise the idea of evidence
use, evaluating policy making processes simply by whether, how
much, or how quickly pieces of evidence are taken up by policy
makers. Such an approach can obscure the complexity of the
policy making process in which policy makers must evaluate
competing social outcomes and value systems in ways which are
accountable to local populations. Simply calling for policy to be
‘evidence based’ encourages decision makers to prioritise those
issues where a large or more coherent body of evidence is available
(such as for clinical treatments which have been evaluated in
experimental trials) as opposed to more complex social and
structural interventions to prevent ill health for which it is not so
easy to identify direct causal mechanisms or gather evidence of
immediate effect [16,91].
Our review also suggests that an unreflective acceptance of
over-simplified concepts of ‘evidence based policy’ is not
conducive to good governance practices. For example, political
pressures may encourage a selective use of evidence as a rhetorical
device to support predetermined policy choices or ideological
positions, or may delay decision-making on contentious issues
while less contentious topics with clearer, uncontested evidence
bases are followed. Such biases are likely to be amplified when
there is a lack of institutional capacity or structures able to provide
competent and independent scientific advice. However, empirical
studies indicate that even institutional bodies that operate
according to the most rigorous procedures may be vulnerable to
distortions and/or the influence of interest groups [29,92]. Thus,
more attention needs to be paid to the specific kinds of evidence
used at different stages of the policy making process, and the ways
in which different political and institutional drivers may contribute
to more or less appropriate evidence utilisation.
Conclusions
This review identified a number of key issues at the interface of
health policy, politics, and evidence use. With a greater awareness
of the politics of evidence-informed health policy, more specific
and explicit questions must be asked about the effects of different
political factors impacting on evidence use in policy making and
their interdependencies. What kind of institutional arrangements

<<<PAGE=7>>>
are more likely to facilitate a ‘good’ use of evidence in different
political contexts? Are decisions seen as more legitimate if evidence
is used to inform decision-making? How can these be evaluated?
What can be done to reduce the biased and opportunistic use of
evidence for political ends? To what extent can evidence-based
guidelines promote policy change across different political and
institutional settings?
Improved understanding of questions such as these requires the
in-depth analysis of case studies of research uptake, with careful
consideration of the institutional and organisational arrangements
that may influence the selection and use of evidence. The work of
Kogan and Henkel in the 1980s, for example, undertaking a seven
year evaluation of the UK Department of Health’s use of evidence
[22], has continued to inform discussions of evidence use today
[23,93] as it is a rare example of in-depth empirical work on the
subject. Similarly Carol Weiss’ pioneering work in the 1970s and
80s on the multiple meanings of research utilisation [24,25]
continues to set the basic conceptual framework for many
contemporary studies looking at evidence uptake or knowledge
transfer [94–96]. At the same time, however, exploring the
complexity of the multi-dimensional links between research and
policy making requires innovative thinking and an engagement
with theories and approaches beyond the current remit of public
health and knowledge utilisation studies. Relevant insights are
likely to be drawn from fields such as political and institutional
theory, public administration, political sociology, and science and
technology studies. There is a rich body of comparative studies of
science policy and environmental risk regulations, for example,
which could provide useful methodological tools and theoretical
insights to this task [97–99], but which have not yet been applied
to current policy questions in public health. Comparative analysis
of evidentiary practices would be particularly useful to discern
patterns and regularities across different institutional and political
environments. In turn, the analysis of such patterns would provide
empirical foundations for a more theoretically informed under-
standing of these issues. This will be a major research challenge,
given the complexity of decision-making systems, and the
important role of intervening variables in the wider socio-cultural
contexts. Yet, it is a challenge worth taking up if we are to develop
institutional structures and mechanisms that can work to ensure an
effective and appropriate use of evidence in health policy and
practice.
