Abstract
This 5-year study of graduating seniors at Elon University (n  = 2,058) evaluates the 
impacts of experiential learning depth (amount of time commitment) and breadth 
(number of different types of experiences) on student outcomes. Data on study 
abroad, undergraduate research, internships, service, and leadership experiences were 
pulled from cocurricular transcripts and paired with responses to the National Survey 
of Student Engagement. Both depth and breadth were associated with acquiring a 
broad general education, writing clearly and effectively, contributing to the welfare of 
communities, relationships with faculty and administration, and desire to attend the 
same institution. Depth (but not breadth) was associated with higher order thinking 
(synthesis and application) in the senior year, as well as overall educational experience. 
Breadth (but not depth) was associated with working effectively with others and better 
relationships with other students. Overall, key learning outcomes desired for a college 
student are driven by both experiential learning depth and breadth.

Introduction
The broad-ranging benefits of individual forms of experiential learning are widely 
recognized. However, there is far less known about the relative benefits of depth, the 
amount of time a college student spends engaged with these high-impact practices, and 
breadth, the different types of experiences a student has while in college.

Better understanding questions of depth and breadth in experiential learning could 
have far-reaching implications for program design, the structuring of general educa-
tion requirements, advising practices, and overall student success. As Kuh and 
O’Donnell (2013) have said, what is needed next in our understanding of experiential 
learning and high-impact practices is a “more advanced logic model that will allow us 
to document the relative importance and influence of the structural and programmatic 
characteristics of high-impact practices in terms of inducing student effort and other 
desirable outcomes” (p. 8).
In the context of this study, depth and breadth are explored across five forms of 
experiential learning common in higher education: study abroad, undergraduate 
research, internships, service, and leadership experiences.
A recent study of Association of American Colleges & Universities (AAC&U) 
member institutions found that a majority offer the high-impact practices tested in this 
study Internships are offered by 98% of institutions, study abroad by 96%, undergradu-
ate research by 96%, service-learning by 93%, and student organization leadership 
opportunities by 100% (Hart Research Associates, 2016). However, there is significant 
variance in whether these high-impact experiences are or should be required.
Outcomes of Depth
The question of how much time a college student should engage in experiential learning 
is often driven by the perceived value of the experience and the time a student has to 
dedicate to the experience while continuing on to graduation. For example, in the case 
of study abroad, more than 60% of study abroad experiences are now short term (1-8 
weeks), a percentage that has grown substantially over several decades (Institute of 
International Education, 2015). Students on short-term study abroad programs do show 
meaningful learning gains (Dwyer, 2004; Gaia, 2015; National Survey of Student 
Engagement [NSSE], 2007). However, studies have found that study abroad of longer 
duration (typically a semester or longer) has more benefits in developing intercultural 
sensitivity, global perspective, linguistic ability, lifelong friendships with host-country 
nationals, and so on (Dwyer, 2004; Ingraham & Peterson, 2004; Kehl & Morris, 2008; 
Medina-Lopez-Portillo, 2004; Zorn, 1996). Gaia (2015) concluded that short-term pro-
grams are an “effective and practical option” (p. 29) but that “long-term programs 
remain a particularly valuable academic experience for which short-term programs will 
never be a substitute” (p. 29). Likewise, a study found that employers associate low 
importance with shorter study abroad programs of 1 to 3 weeks and much higher impor-
tance with longer programs (Trooboff, Vande Berg, & Rayman, 2008). Engle and Engle 
(2003) proposed a five-tier system for indicating program quality and depth of immer-
sion, progressing from study tours of a few days to a few weeks (Level 1) to cross-
cultural immersion programs of a semester or year (Level 5). In a stinging criticism, the 
president of the Foundation for International Education went so far as to say that short-
term programs “blur the distinction between education abroad and educational tourism” 
and “weaken the credibility of our field,” while going on to say that they may be justi-
fied when students have no other opportunity (Woolf, 2007, p. 503).

Numerous studies suggest that undergraduate research that spans multiple semesters 
is most beneficial for student outcomes (Russell, Hancock, & McCullough, 2007; 
Zydney, Bennett, Shahid, & Bauer, 2013). A study comparing student research gains 
after a summer experience versus a yearlong experience found that students in the latter 
showed significantly higher gains overall, especially in research skills that require time 
to develop and that often occur toward the end of research projects (data interpretation, 
communication of results, independence, relating results to the bigger picture of their 
fields, and so on; Adedokun et al., 2014). Gilmore, Vieyra, Timmerman, Feldon, and 
Maher (2015) found that graduate-level research skill performance increased substan-
tially with the duration of undergraduate research experiences. Craney et al. (2011) 
found that undergraduates with more research experience find the research more advan-
tageous for employability and graduate school admissions than students with shorter 
experiences. Similarly, Fechheimer, Webber, and Kleiber (2010) found that longer 
undergraduate research experiences were positively related to student grades.
Research on the outcomes of internship depth is sparse and often focuses on train-
ing teachers. Spooner, Flowers, Lambert, and Algozzine (2008) found that preteachers 
in yearlong internships reported better relationships with supervising teachers, greater 
knowledge of school policies and procedures, and higher scores for the perceived ade-
quacy of time spent in school than did the students in a semester internship. However, 
preteachers did not differ in perceptions of their own teaching ability (Spooner et al., 
2008). Chambers and Hardy (2005) found that two-semester internships did not lead 
to added benefits over one-semester benefits in terms of instructional management, 
behavioral management, or self-efficacy. However, another study found that the most 
effective teacher training programs require 6 or more months of internship (Darling-
Hammond, Chung, & Frelow, 2002). A study by the company Intern Bridge found 
that, across 6,147 students, the level of student satisfaction with an internship was 
directly correlated with length, ranging from short experiences of 1 to 4 weeks to long 
experiences of 13 to 16 weeks (Grasgreen, 2012).
Student outcomes are also affected by depth during service-learning experiences. 
Students involved in more than 20 hr of service-learning tend to gain a greater sense 
of social issues and a deeper commitment to community involvement than students 
involved in less than 20 hr (Kendrick, 1996; Markus, Howard, & King, 1993). 
Likewise, civic identity is shaped only when service-learning is regular and sustained 
(Hepburn, Niemi, & Chapman, 2000; Mabry, 1998).
Student leadership is another form of experiential learning that, though less studied, 
shares a developmental framework with other forms (Guthrie & Jones, 2012). The 
Multi-Institutional Study of Leadership (MSL; 2015) found that students who held 
more leadership positions scored significantly higher on measures of congruence, com-
mitment, consciousness of self, collaboration, handling controversy with civility, citi-
zenship, overall socially responsible leadership, resiliency, leadership efficacy, complex 
cognitive skills, and social perspective-taking. A study of leadership at a military acad-
emy found that more experienced student leaders were more self-critical (West, 2012).
The overall trend of the literature on depth is that longer experiences produce better 
outcomes. However, none of these studies address how choosing more depth in one

experience might compare with alternatives such as gaining more breadth through dif-
ferent forms of experiential learning.
Outcomes of Breadth
The vast majority of experiential learning research studies focus on one type of experi-
ence, and thus, studies of breadth are far fewer in number than studies of depth.
One previous study, based on videotaped interviews with graduating seniors at Elon 
University, found that increased breadth of experiential learning led to increased career 
development benefits, a greater likelihood of altering students’ future plans, and other 
gains (Coker & Porter, 2015).
Finley and McNair (2013) brought together NSSE data from 38 institutions to show 
the influence of various high-impact practices on gains in deep learning, general edu-
cation, practical competence, and personal and social development. Self-reported 
learning gains continued as students did several types of experiential learning, sug-
gesting that breadth was valuable (Finley & McNair, 2013).
An indirect line of evidence supporting experiential learning breadth involves the 
benefits of exposing students to new, unfamiliar environments (Ewert & Yoshino, 
2011; Mackenzie, Son, & Hollenhorst, 2014). It seems logical that breadth would 
often expose students to new environments and encourage learning as a result.
Context for Study
Elon University is a logical environment to conduct a case study and pose research 
questions that span multiple forms of experiential learning. The school has required 
experiential learning for more than 20 years and has significant participation by stu-
dents in several experiential areas. Elon also has participated in the NSSE since 2003 
and consistently performed near the top of all institutions, largely due to a rich envi-
ronment for experiential learning. Students are required to complete an experiential 
learning requirement (ELR) as part of the Elon Core Curriculum, choosing from the 
following: study abroad, undergraduate research, internships, service-learning, or 
leadership experiences. The vast majority of students far surpass the requirement. At 
the time of this study, 72%, 25%, 87%, 85%, and 47% of graduating students partici-
pated in study abroad, undergraduate research, internships, service, and leadership 
experiences, respectively. This level of student participation provides a large sample 
size for comparative studies. Although this particular study focuses on quantity of 
experiential learning, it is worth noting that experiential learning quality is a focus at 
Elon (most experiences involve structured mentoring, reflection, etc.).
The NSSE
One of the principal tools for demonstrating the connection between student experi-
ences and educational outcomes is the NSSE. Established in 1999 and in use by more 
than half of all colleges and universities in the United States, the NSSE employs a
<<<PAGE=6>>>
Coker et al. 9
number of self-reported variables to measure and illustrate effective educational prac-
tices. Past studies comparing NSSE results with direct measures of learning have 
found the NSSE to be a good proxy measure for growth in important educational 
outcomes (NSSE, 2007; Pascarella, Seifert, & Blaich, 2010).
The NSSE asks students whether or not they have participated in several forms of 
experiential learning, but it does not typically ask about depth within those practices 
(except one service-learning question that was added in 2013). Thus, pairing NSSE 
data with other sources of information is necessary for studies of depth. To conduct 
this study, 5 years of data were used from responses to the NSSE and cocurricular 
transcripts of graduating seniors at Elon University.
Method
Data from five graduating classes of Elon University (N = 4,763) were drawn from 
Elon Experiences Transcripts (EETs) and the NSSE. The final data set included only 
students who began college at Elon, graduated within 6 years, and completed the 
NSSE (n = 2,058).
The EET documents for-credit and not-for-credit experiences at the university in five 
areas of experiential learning: study abroad, undergraduate research, internships, ser -
vice, and leadership. The EET is generated and validated by compiling the annual reports 
from each of the experiential learning offices and by a review of students’ academic 
transcripts.
Weighting of the Elon Experiences
To make depth and breadth comparisons across different forms of experiential 
learning, a common unit was needed. The basis for a “unit” was borrowed from 
Elon’s long-standing ELR, for which each type of experience has established crite-
ria for what satisfies a unit. Starting with these established criteria, and in consulta-
tion with campus leaders from each area, the following coding scheme was 
established:
•• Study abroad
|| 4 units for fall or spring semester-long programs abroad
|| 1 unit for a 3- to 4-week course; 3 units for a 9-week program
•• Undergraduate research
|| 1 unit for every 1 credit-hour of undergraduate research awarded
|| 4 units for a summer research experience (summer research program)
|| 0.2 units for presenting at a conference or at a student undergraduate 
research forum
•• Internships
|| 1 unit for every 40 hr of internship
•• Service
|| 1 unit for every 40 hr of service
<<<PAGE=7>>>
10 Journal of Experiential Education 40(1)
•• Leadership experiences
|| 1 unit for every mentored leadership experience
|| 1 unit for every semester of executive leadership (e.g., president or vice 
president)
|| 0.6 units for every semester of nonexecutive leadership
For experiences reported as hours (internships and service), values were coded as a 
portion of whole units using the following tiers: 0 units = 0 to 3 hr, 0.1 units = 4 to 7 
hr, 0.2 units = 8 to 15 hr, 0.4 units = 16 to 23 hr, 0.6 units = 24 to 31 hr; 0.8 units = 32 
to 39 hr; 1.0 unit = 40 hr. For example, 22 hr of service was coded as 0.4 units and 120 
hr of service was coded as 3 units.
Calculating Total Activity, Depth, and Breadth
Total experiential learning activity was calculated by adding the total number of units 
earned for each of the five Elon Experiences.
A “deep experience” was defined as having at least 4 units of one type of experi-
ence before graduation.
Breadth was measured by the number of unique experiences of at least 1 unit that a 
student had while in college. A student could have up to five unique types of experi-
ences (study abroad, undergraduate research, internships, service, and leadership).
Statistical Analysis
Typical assumptions for parametric tests were not met by the data set because of skew 
toward the upper boundary of NSSE questions. Thus, nonparametric tests were used to 
test for differences in population distributions. Specifically, the Kruskal–Wallis test 
was used to test for differences based on depth and breadth of experiences. To test for 
pairwise differences based on the amount of breadth, simultaneous confidence inter -
vals on the ranks were conducted using Bonferroni’s adjustment for multiple compari-
sons to control the Type I error.
Results
Overview of Experiential Learning Engagement at Elon
Total experiential learning activity, depth, and breadth were characterized for 5 years 
of graduating seniors to understand the study population.
The total amount of experiential learning completed by individual students at Elon 
University over a 5-year period is shown in Figure 1. The range was from 1 to 63 
experiential units, or 40 to 2,520 hr of validated engagement. The average number of 
experiential units completed was 9.4 (SD = 7.2, n = 2,058) units per student, or 376 hr. 
No graduating student could have had less than 1 unit, because the university’s Core 
Curriculum required 1 unit during the study period.

Most Elon students have substantial depth in at least one form of experiential learn-
ing. Figure 2 shows the percentage of students who completed various numbers of 
“deep” experiences. Deep experiences were defined as those having at least four expe-
riential learning units, or more than 160 validated hours of activity, in a single experi-
ence type. Examples include semester study abroad, summer-long research or 
internship experiences, and so on. Two thirds (66%) of students completed a deep 
experience of some sort, and 28% completed two or more.
As shown in Figure 3, most Elon students also have breadth in their experiential 
learning activities. An Elon student completes a full unit of 2.6 (SD = 1.1, n = 2,057) 
different types of experiential learning on average (of the five documented by the 
institution). About 20%, 29%, 30%, 16%, and 5% of students complete a full unit of 
one, two, three, four, and five experiences, respectively.
Overall, Elon students are very engaged with experiential learning as measured by 
total activity, depth, and breadth. Nevertheless, there is a wide variance in these three 
measures across the student population. Taken together, high engagement and vari-
ance in the study population create excellent conditions (e.g., substantial sample sizes) 
for studying the effects of depth and breadth on student outcomes.
Perceived Learning and Higher Level Thinking
Table 1 shows how experiential learning based on depth and breadth is associated with 
self-reported learning gains in a variety of NSSE areas. Students responded to the 
question “To what extent has your experience at this institution contributed to your 
knowledge, skills, and personal development in the following areas?” (1 = very little, 
2 = some, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) for 15 items shown in the table.
Both depth, χ
2(1) = 10.71, p = .0011, and breadth, χ 2(4) = 9.71, p = .0457, were 
associated with differences in scores on the item regarding acquiring a broad general

education. Pairwise comparisons in the number of breadth experiences indicated that 
having four experiences was significantly greater than having only one experience. 
Differences in depth, χ
2(1) = 9.85, p = .0017, and breadth, χ 2(4) = 19.52, p = .0006, 
were also present in responses to the item related to contributing to the welfare of the 
community. Differences in scores for the item related to writing clearly and effectively 
were also detected based on depth, χ
2(1) = 5.83, p = .0158, and breadth, χ2(4) = 14.63, 
p = .0055. For each of these items, scores were significantly higher for students who 
had completed a deep experience compared with students who had not completed a 
deep experience. Significant differences in scores on the item related to working effec-
tively with others were reported based on breadth, χ
2(4) = 12.59, p = .0135, but not 
related to depth, χ2(1) = 1.55, p = .2135.
Interestingly, the impacts of breadth became significant for students completing four 
different experiences compared with students who only completed one experience for 
the items associated with acquiring a broad general education, writing clearly and effec-
tively, and contributing to the welfare of the community, suggesting a possible goal for 
students and a useful point for academic advisors. Pairwise comparisons indicated a few 
additional differences (as seen in Table 1), all of which indicated that scores for students 
with more breadth were higher than those for students with less breadth.
As shown in Table 1, a significant difference in scores on the item associated with 
analyzing quantitative problems was detected based on the depth of experiential learn-
ing, χ
2(1) = 4.85, p = .0277. Paradoxically, scores on the item related to analyzing 
quantitative problems were higher by 0.10 for students who did not complete a deep 
experience compared with students who had completed a deep experience. It seems 
possible that this is not a causative relationship but rather an artifact of fewer students 
in quantitative disciplines (sciences and business) being able to achieve experiential 
learning depth because of curricular requirements.
While some of the other outcomes in Table 1 may be associated with individual 
experiences, they were not significantly associated with experiential learning depth or 
breadth overall.
Table 2 shows how experiential learning depth and breadth are associated with vari-
ous mental activities for seniors who were asked to respond to the question “During 
the current school year, how much has your coursework emphasized the following 
mental activities?” (1 = very little, 2= some, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much) for five 
items shown in the table. Unlike Table 1, Table 2 focuses on the activity and percep-
tions exclusively in the senior year. The data show a clear pattern of depth being 
related to greater scores on the higher order thinking items like synthesizing, χ
2(1) = 
5.92, p = .0150, and applying, χ2(1) = 7.08, p = .0078, and lower scores on memoriza-
tion, χ2(1) = 16.59, p < .0001. Increased breadth had no impact on the type of mental 
activities with which students were engaged.

experiential learning. Students were asked to “mark the box that best represents your 
relationships with people at your institution” (1 = unfriendly, unsupportive, sense of 
alienation; 7 = friendly, supportive, sense of belonging) for the groups indicated in the 
table. Both depth and breadth are strongly associated with significant differences in 
scores on the items regarding relationships with faculty members, depth: χ
2(1) = 12.26, 
p = .0005; breadth: χ 2(4) = 25.47, p < .0001, and relationships with administrative 
personnel and offices, depth: χ2(1) = 5.57, p = .0183; breadth: χ2(4) = 11.89, p = .0182. 
Interestingly, significant differences in scores on the item related to relationships with 
other students were detected based on the breadth of experiences, χ
2(4) = 16.96, p = 
.0020. However, no significant differences were detected in responses to the item 
related to relationship with peers based on depth, χ
2(1) = 0.16, p = .6851.
Similar to Table 1, the benefits of breadth among pairwise comparisons of different 
breadth amounts seem to be triggered most strongly after completion of four experi-
ences compared with fewer experiences as seen in Table 3.
Overall College Experience
Two questions were used to explore how the depth and breadth of experiential learning 
were related to students’ overall college experiences.
The first item related to overall experience was the NSSE question, “How would 
you evaluate your entire educational experience at this institution?” (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 
3 = good, 4 = excellent). Differences in depth of experience were associated with dif-
ferences in responses to this question, χ
2(1) = 4.04, p = .0444. In particular, the mean 
response for individuals categorized as not having a deep experience was 3.60 (SD = 
0.60, n = 612), and the mean response for individuals categorized as having a deep 
experience was 3.65 (SD = 0.57, n = 1,189). There was no evidence of a difference in 
responses to this item based on the breadth of experiences, χ
2(4) = 5.66, p = .2256.
The second item related to overall experience was the NSSE question, “If you 
could start over again, would you go to the same institution you are now attending?” 
(1 = definitely no, 2 = probably no, 3= probably yes, 4 = definitely yes). Both depth, 
χ
2(1) = 6.06, p = .0138, and breadth, χ2(4) = 9.81, p = .0438, were associated with dif-
ferences in responses to this question. Individuals who had not completed a deep expe-
rience had a mean score of 3.36 (SD = 0.81, n = 613) compared with individuals who 
had completed a deep experience with a mean of 3.46 (SD = 0.75, n = 1,192). No 
significant differences in scores on this item based on breadth were detected based on 
pairwise comparisons.
Discussion
Impacts of Depth and Breadth on Outcomes
Overall, this study suggests that both experiential learning depth (amount of time com-
mitment) and breadth (number of different types of experiences) are valuable and lead 
to additional learning gains in a range of areas. Both depth and breadth were positively
<<<PAGE=16>>>
Coker et al. 19
associated with acquiring a broad general education, writing clearly and effectively, 
contributing to the welfare of the community, relationships with faculty and adminis-
tration, and desire to attend the same institution. Put simply, more experiential learning 
is better whether in the form of depth or breadth.
Conceptual models for experiential learning suggest a process that is affected by 
the duration of the experience, though the specifics are often ambiguous. For example, 
in Kolb’s (1984) classic experiential learning theory, the cycling between concrete 
experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimenta-
tion implicitly suggests a time-sensitive process. A more modern model, Co-Constructed 
Developmental Teaching Theory (CDTT), is more explicit. It suggests that experien-
tial learning takes place through iterative learning cycles that increase in time and 
complexity with more and more advanced learning (Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015). 
The results of the current study support the notion of iterative learning cycles and addi-
tive learning over time, whether through depth or through breadth. As Kuh (2008) 
said, among the “key elements” of high-impact educational practices is a “significant 
investment of time and effort by students over an extended period of time” (p. 9).
Although more experiential learning is better, generally speaking, depth and breadth 
are not the same and each has unique benefits. Depth (but not breadth) was associated 
with higher order thinking (synthesis and application) in the senior year, as well as 
overall educational experience. In terms of maximum impact on cognitive gains, then, 
depth may have an edge over breadth. This would seem consistent with findings on the 
cognitive value of depth related to individual experiences (Adedokun et al., 2014; 
Gilmore et al., 2015; Kehl & Morris, 2008; Kendrick, 1996; MSL, 2015).
An implication of this study is that experiential learning depth should be taken 
more seriously across higher education. There is a temptation for colleges and univer-
sities to drift toward shorter and shorter experiential learning opportunities, which 
favors breadth. Economic pressures on higher education may make it difficult to sup-
port the costs of deep, mentored experiential learning. Shorter experiences are also 
incentivized, in part, because schools commonly promote the percentages of students 
doing various opportunities (e.g., study abroad or service) as part of admissions mes-
sages, and various ranking systems take such percentages into account. Depth is less 
likely to be considered. Even the NSSE does not typically report depth of experiential 
learning, except for one question about service that appeared in 2013. This overall 
environment has led to trends such as study abroad experiences getting far shorter on 
average over time (Dwyer, 2004; Woolf, 2007). Although the artificial incentives for 
breadth overwhelm the incentives for depth in many situations, the learning value of 
depth equals or exceeds that of breadth.
On the contrary, breadth (but not depth) was associated with working effectively 
with others and better relationships with other students. In terms of maximum impact 
on relational gains, then, breadth may have an edge over depth. This finding suggests 
that interactions with more people in a wider range of environments may be more 
beneficial to building people skills than relationships with a smaller group over a lon-
ger period of time. This is supported by literature on the learning benefits of exposure 
to new, unfamiliar environments (Ewert & Yoshino, 2011; Mackenzie et al., 2014).
<<<PAGE=17>>>
20 Journal of Experiential Education 40(1)
The impact of experiential breadth on relationships is reflected by Takacs and 
Chambliss’s (2013) observation, “This pervasive influence of relationships suggests 
that a college, at least insofar as it offers real benefits, is less a collection of programs 
than a gathering of people” (p. 12).
Finley and McNair (2013) found that the typical American student engages in 
between 1.2 and 1.5 different high-impact practices while in college. Because this 
approximation included experiential learning as well as other practices such as capstones 
and writing-intensive courses, the national average for experiential learning is surely 
lower. The additive benefits of experiential learning shown in the current study at Elon 
suggest that the national average is quite low compared with how far the additive learn-
ing benefits of experiential learning extend. Kuh (2008) suggested, “Ideally, institutions 
would structure the curriculum and other learning opportunities so that one high-impact 
activity is available to every student every year” (p. 20). The current study suggests that 
at least tripling the national average amount of experiential learning would have substan-
tial benefits for many students. It also supports Kuh’s specific suggestion of one experi-
ence per year and/or other curricular arrangements that support four or more across the 
college experience (scaffolded experiential pathways, deeper ELRs, etc.).
Interestingly, the unique gains of depth loosely correspond with “hard skills” of the 
workplace, whereas those of breadth loosely correspond with “soft skills.” Clearly, both 
hard and soft skills are highly valued by employers and graduate schools (Hart Research 
Associates, 2013; Kyllonen, 2013). Likewise, both depth in a field and breadth of 
knowledge and skills are highly valued by employers, as are the various forms of expe-
riential learning investigated in the current study (Hart Research Associates, 2013). 
Overall, the ideal situation for a college student is likely to include both experiential 
learning depth and breadth—an approach that develops the full array of knowledge and 
skills that are highly advantageous for succeeding in life after college.
Study Limitations and Future Work
The limitations of this study are threefold. First, although the NSSE is a widely used 
instrument with verified correlation to direct measures of learning (Pascarella et al., 
2010), it is still an indirect measure. Second, definitions of “breadth” and “depth” may 
vary depending on context. Although it seems likely that the findings here will be trans-
ferable to many other institutions, differences in student demographics, experiential 
programs, and curricular requirements may lead to different perspectives. Third, the 
relationships uncovered in this study may not be causal. Specifically, it is possible that 
other causative agents (income level, mind-set, major, etc.) are partially driving both 
levels of participation in experiential learning and the outcomes measured by the NSSE.
Future studies on the impacts of experiential learning depth and breadth will be 
very valuable for improving undergraduate education. Such studies will further resolve 
what role experiential learning should (and should not) play across curricula to achieve 
maximal educational benefits. For example, it would be valuable to explore which 
particular types of experiences lead to the most gains when depth is achieved, whether 
the ordering of experiences changes the effectiveness of breadth, which variables alter
<<<PAGE=18>>>
Coker et al. 21
postgraduation outcomes such as employment, and whether effects of depth and 
breadth are different among different demographic populations. It would also be use-
ful to verify (or contradict) the findings here by asking similar questions at other insti-
tutional types, using other interpretations of depth and breadth, and measuring student 
learning more directly. Of particular value would be highly controlled studies in which 
students are randomly assigned situations of more/less depth and breadth to eliminate 
any biases of self-selection, demographics, and so on. However, performing such ran-
dom assignments may not be ethical or desirable in many educational contexts.
