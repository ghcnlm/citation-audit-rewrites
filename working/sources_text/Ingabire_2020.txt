ABSTRACT  
 
This study was conducted to assess the significance Performance Contract (Imihigo) on 
socio-economic development of Rwanda:  A case of Nyamasheke District (2014 -2019). The 
researcher has used both secondary data and primary data for assessing the study hyp othesis. 
The researcher also used descriptive and correlative research design. Primary data were 
collected from 54 sampled staffs of Nyamasheke District. The study findings (secondary 
data) have been shown that 100% Nyamasheke district respect the format o f Imihigo, 
Nyamasheke District also use national priorities, pillars for setting outcome, outputs, 
indicators sector by sector. In other case, indicators are well defined with clear baseline, 
targets, responsibilities and budget. These findings were used b y the researcher to reject H01 
“Nyamasheke District performance contracts (as a whole) and individual staff performance 
contracts are not well formulated”. The assessment of H02 “Imihigo signed by District in last 
6 years (2014 -2019) on socio -economic deve lopment was poorly performed” also have 
revealed that Nyamasheke District ensures moderate performance in terms of imihigo 
evaluation. On the case of the economic pillar, this district was ranked good with more than 
80% marks the same case for individual p erformance. This was resulted in the authority to 
the researcher for not accepting this hypothesis. Assessment again of secondary data has 
shown that Nyamasheke district is a poor performer in the real economy (the researcher use 
this as the difference of paper evaluation and field visit (visiting households one by one) as 
made by NISR through EICV5 and find that Nyamasheke District ranked the last (30th) in 30 
districts in poverty reduction. Due to that, the researcher has accepted the H03. For the H04, 
the researcher has tested primary data (findings from the field) on the perception of 
respondents (District staffs) on both variables). Pearson correlation (r) is 0.210 meaning that, 
there is a weak positive correlation between imihigo (performance contract)  and socio -
economic development. Sig. (2 -tailed) is equal to 0.001 showing that, thus correlation 
resulted or signified by r is statistically significant. Thus, the researcher concludes that H04 is 
not accepted. Thus, evaluation of Imihigo may rank a district or a staff on good rank while on 
field people are suffering. A good ranking should be delivered from households looking 
changes they got in their living conditions with the support of local government authorities. 
In Other case performance contracts ha ve a little (weak positive correlation) on socio -
economic development; it counts only 21% while the remaining 79% is from other factors not 
captured by this study.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
After the most serious and violent conflict faced by Rwanda in the 20th century (1994 
Genocide against Tutsi), the country is making a good and quick recovery in all sectors 
(political, social and economy). Development of the country after the 1994 Genocid e against 
Tutsi was made as a joint initiative for both people (nationals and foreigners) together with 
the government of Unit and reconciliation, other governments and non -governmental 
organizations. But the main role was played by nationals and Rwandan G overnment of Unit 
and Reconciliation.  
 
To achieve this, the government has initiated performance contracts as a tool for increasing 
the performance of authorities and population in general (Imihigo). Rwanda’s performance 
contracts are binding agreements b etween government agencies and the President of the 
Republic for the former to reach certain targets on socio -economic development indicators 
(IPAR, 2016) and people (households) also has Imihigo notebook. This study focus on the 
agreements (imihigo) signe d between local authorities the higher authorities (districts and 
ministry). Performance contract has started in 2006 and now cover most central and 
decentralized government agencies. Local authorities at district to cell levels are these 
working closely w ith the local population hands in hands for all policies and programme 
implementation of the government. In Rwanda, imihigo, also known as performance 
contracts, are signed between the president, local governments, and line ministries to achieve 
community targets. They play an integral role in the ability of the Rwandan government to 
deliver a better life for all. Imihigo reflect pre -colonial governance where each chief explains 
to the king what is planned to perform to his people (Daniel et al, 2014 ). The main purpose is 
to strive authorities and measuring the socio -economic achievements in a specific period, 
poor performers are advised in public. Based on this effort the country expects to become a 
middle-income country by 2024 (MINECOFIN, 2018). Thus, th is study intends to evaluate 
the extent to which signing imihigo or performance contracts has boosted socio -economic 
development of Nyamasheke District in the last 5 years (2015-2020).  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
Imihigo is delivered from plural Kinyarwanda word of Umuhigo, which simply mean to vow 
to deliver. Imihigo also tends also to signify Guhiganwa, which means to work hard and 
achieve more compared to others in the same works. Imihigo is not a new concept as it 
describes the pre -colonial cultural practice in R wanda where an individual sets targets or 
goals to be achieved within a specific period of time. The person must complete these 
objectives by following guiding principles and be determined to overcome any possible 
challenges that arise could be solved (IPAR, 2017). 
 
As part of efforts to reconstruct Rwanda after 1994 Genocide against Tutsi, and nurture a 
shared national identity, the Government of Rwanda drew on aspects of Rwandan culture and 
traditional practices to enrich and adapt its development program s to the country’s needs and 
context. The result is a set of Home -Grown Solutions culturally owned practices translated

into sustainable development programs. One of these Home -Grown Solutions is Imihigo 
which is still in use as a tool for encouraging and creating performers. 
 
According to IPAR (2016) as published by World Bank (2017) Rwanda’s extraordinary 
recovery to complete political, economic, and social collapse following the 1994 genocide 
against the Tutsi is one of Africa’s most encouraging developm ent success stories (Simeone, 
2017). The Government of Rwanda (government of Unit and Reconciliation) has since 
committed to undertake a fundamental, broad -based economic and social transformation 
intended to shift the country from low to middle -income cou ntry’s status, and this 
commitment has already yielded highly remarkable results. Rwanda is one of the few African 
countries that achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its real 
economic growth averaged 8% per annum from 2001 to 2015, wh ich translated into 
significantly reduced poverty levels, from 56.7% in 2000 to 39.1% in 2014, as well as a 
decline in extreme poverty levels from 35.8% in 2000 to 16.3% in 2014 (IPAR, 2016). 
 
A key element of Rwanda’s success is linked with the implementa tion of Imihigo, an 
ancestral cultural practice relating to performance contracts. The modernization of this 
practice is one of several innovative approaches being used to reinforce development 
planning, implementation, and evaluation towards improving liv ing conditions for Rwandans 
(Odi, 2012). All levels of government including national, provincial, and district are required 
to plan and implement their own Imihigo commitments and targets (e.g. infrastructure 
development, job creation, etc.). These are inf ormed by broader medium and long -term 
planning and budgeting processes, such as Rwanda’s Vision 2020, the Economic 
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS), sector -specific strategic plans, 
annual action plans, and the 5 -year District Development Plans and the current underuse are 
NST1 (National Strategy for Transformation) and Vision 2050 (Jonathan, 2018). 
 
3.0 LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
District performance contracts (Imihigo) stand from the national goals (also delivered from 
international goals and domestic initiatives) which decentralized to local authorities. District 
imihigo is formulated as follows: 
 
The pillars for district imihigo are (1) Economic transformation; (2) social transformation; 
and (3) Transformational Governance. Within each pillar , specific sectors are settled, under 
which outcomes per sector are defined, per each outcome outputs are defined and per each 
output, indicators are defined. For measuring this, each indicator has a baseline (defined in 
the clear source), targets (by quar ters within a year), total annual target, activities and 
responsible personnel under each indicator and the end budget allocation is based on these 
activities (Nyamasheke, 2019).

Preparation of performance contracts (Imihigo): 
 
Reference concept paper developed by Bruno Versailles (2012) here are identified four steps 
for Imihigo preparation: (1) National priorities identification by each line ministry to be 
implemented by local authorities under their guidance and this could be parallel with budget 
transfers to local authorities which signed to implement; (2) In local from government 
priorities are discussed and communicated to local government leaders; (3) District takes 
initiative with all stakeholders to develop these prioriti es and define them in the district 
development plan (five years range with annualized targets) and (4) final decentralized 
Imihigo and discussion of this draft to all stakeholders at all levels under district and QATT 
(Quality Assurance Technical Team) which ended by approval of Imihigo (Bruno, 2012).  
 
Imihigo is not only signed by District officials because they are not alone in district. Districts 
sign performance contracts after that other central government institutions like line ministries 
also sign p erformance contracts with the President. After districts five levels (from the 
bottom-up): (a) Village, (b) Cell, (c) Sector, (d) districts and (e) Provinces and the city of 
Kigali. Unless otherwise indicated, this note deals with performance contracts at the district 
level, the most visible of the imihigo. “Imihigo is the cultural practice in the ancient tradition 
of Rwanda where an individual would set him/herself targets to be achieved within a specific 
period of time and do so by following some principl es and having the determination to 
overcome the possible challenges” it is in that context even people in their households set 
annual Imihigo to be achieved and sets way to achieve them  (Habamenshi et al, 2019).  
 
Socio-economic development indicators at District level: 
 
Reference to the essay of N’Kosi Craigwell -Walkes (2018) a given area is said socio -
economically developed when there are remarkable changes happened on people’s per capita 
income (increased), creation of new opportunities in education, he althcare, employment in 
different economic sectors (agriculture, industry, services and transport). For example in each 
district of the country people are into four social -economic classes (Ubudehe categories) and

most of Imihigo takes a look to the last c lasses (1st Ubudehe category which composed by 
the very poor people in the district) for moving them from the 1st class to the 2nd or the 3rd 
but also if possible to the 4th Ubudehe class.  
 
Decentralized to Nyamasheke District from the national level (Rwa nda), agriculture occupies 
70% of the total households and 75% of agricultural production is from smallholder farmers 
(RDB, 2019). With NST1 (1st National Strategy for Transformation 2018 -2024), Rwanda 
needs to become a middle -income country with a knowled ge-based economy. It is in that 
context the Imihigo in agriculture sector stand for land consolidation and growing modern 
crops with modern agriculture tools and technics use. This offer inputs to agro -processing 
industries. Looking socio-economic development in the district, the evaluators look different 
indicators to all sectors, for example, number of jobs created per economic sector, crops 
production, land consolidated, milk and meat production, health post or centres constructed, 
access to sanitation, performance against malnutrition, schools constructed and overall 
infrastructures, number of households and productive uses connected to electricity and with 
access to water, an increase of income per capita, and overall changes in social integration, 
etc.) (IPAR, 2017). 
 
4.0 THEORETICAL REVIEW 
 
Performance contract was delivered from contract theory which studies how economic actors 
can and do construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of asymmetric 
information. Because of its connection s with both agency and incentives, contract theory is 
often categorized within a field known as Law and economics. One prominent application of 
it is the design of optimal schemes of managerial compensation (Letangule, 2012).  
 
A performance contract is applied in management science for management control systems. It 
is a contractual arrangement for setting goals and ensuring arranged and easy management of 
goals implementors (Simiyu, 2012).  
 
The theory of contract is concerned with the choice between a sa les contract and an 
employment contract. The theory of incentives is concerned with a choice that is applicable 
to either type of contract, is looking of interest is on method for indirectly guiding the actions 
of the agent, a worker or a contractor (Kihar a, 2013). Yawell formulates a general decision -
theoretic incentive model and investigates its properties under sets of assumptions, including 
certainty and uncertainty. The incentives relationship he studies includes only two parties. 
This relationship is further simplifying for purposes of analysis so that the payoff to the 
principal results exclusively from the action of the agent, while the agent’s reward is 
determined solely by the principal according to the perceived results of the agent’s actions. 
Yawell assumes that the basic relationship between the two parties is formed for the benefits 
of both and investigates the extent to which the principal can guide the agent’s actions by 
establishing rewards conditional on the results the agent achieves. This is similar to the way 
Imihigo or performance contracts in Rwanda are underutilized toward socio -economic 
development. It is mandatory to the employee to achieve contracts and the best are getting a 
reward (not mandatory) but the poor performers decide them selves to resign (Kogei et al, 
2013).

It is difficult for management and control of public interests’ activities which are managed by 
people who work for monthly income and work for personnel or family interests. Supervision 
from ministries to districts and from districts to villages need inter coordination which could 
be evaluated easily rather than making daily checkup. That’s why contract theory selected to 
be linked to performance contract management which is being assessed by this study on its 
significance on socio -economic development. Looking initiatives created by signing 
performance contract on socio -economic development. This is due to the fact that 
performance contract is communicated to the population, are evaluated in public and poor 
performers get punishment clear to everyone (MINECOFIN, 2018).      
 
6.0 STUDY GAP 
 
In his study Habamenshi et al, (2019) on the contribution of Imihigo on the socioeconomic 
development in Rwanda (2013 -2018) a case study of Gakenke District, by using a mix of 
quantitative and qualitative approaches whereby primary data were collected using 
questionnaire, interview, focus group discussions, personnel observations and telephone calls; 
and secondary data were collected using archival review. The findings explain that s igning 
Imihigo for district authorities has improved agricultural techniques that increased the 
production which in turn improved the lives of the citizens and reduced hunger (affirmed by 
100% of respondents); New forest and trees planted and soil protecti on against erosion and 
increased agricultural productivity (affirmed at 100%). Signing Imihigo contributed to the 
improvement of new roads and the creation of new roads (affirmed at 97%); signing Imihigo 
contributed to the increase of access to electricity  (70%). Signing Imihigo system resulted in 
the creation of new jobs (72%) (Habamenshi et al, 2019); Cooperatives were improved 
(affirmed at 69%); Imihigo improved the lives of poorest households through social 
protection programs namely VUP and Girinka (af firmed at 100%); education sector was 
improved by new classrooms constructed (affirmed at 100%); Signing Imihigo implemented 
mechanisms reducing dropouts together with school feeding (affirmed at 86%); Imihigo 
system improved health care services (affirmed  at 90%). Challenges outlined by the research 
include limited budget allocated to infrastructure, fertilizers, BDF (Business Development 
Funds), VUP (Vision 2020 Umurenge Program) and Girinka (Habamenshi et al, 2019). 
 
According to the National Institute o f Statistics (NISR, 2018), imihigo is one of the home -
grown solutions embarked on by the Government of Rwanda to solve some of the most 
pressing challenges that the country faces. It creates the ability to Rwandans to take part in 
their own development and  aspirations. Rwandans access their own problems and take 
initiatives for solving them without thinking of external support. This is the logic and spirit 
that has been driving Imihigo Performance Contracts since 2006 (NISR, 2018). These 
contracts, signed b etween ministers, district mayors, senior executives of selected Boards 
(parastatals) with the Head of State, aim at improving Rwandans living conditions. 
Consequently, Imihigo is a tool for accelerating the ambitions that have been set by the 
leadership of the country that are geared towards meeting the expectations that the people of 
Rwandan have for their leaders enshrined in national strategic plans (NISR, 2018).  
 
Learning from EICV5 (NISR, 2018) poverty rate in some districts, most notably Kicukiro, 
Nyarugenge, and Gasabo, is relatively low (below 15%), while in some it is very high, 
reaching close to 70% in Nyamasheke. Nyamasheke District is the first district reported in

Rwanda as a poorest district (with a high rate of poor people) in 2013/14 around  62% which 
increased to 70% in 2016/17 (NISR, 2018). This poor performance was marked while 
employees coted good performance in terms of the performance contract. According to 
imihigo evaluation report 2017/2018 published by NISR, it is stated that “The performance of 
Nyamasheke District on Imihigo has relatively declined in terms of improvement for over the 
last three years.  In FY2015/2016, it was ranked 9th while in the Financial year 2016/2017, it 
was ranked 11th and 17th in this financial year 2017/201 8 respectively with 67.1% % in the 
overall performance”. Thus, the gap is how in the same period in Imihigo Nyamasheke was 
ranked 17th while in a survey on poverty ranked indicators ranked the last among 30 districts 
from 2013 to 2017 (NISR, 2018). However, they are several indicators to be considered while 
evaluating Imihigo and poverty is the main indicator covering more others for assessing 
socio-economic development. It is in that context; the researcher intends to assess the 
contribution of performance  contract (Imihigo) to the socio -economic development of 
Nyamasheke District (2015-2019).

As seen from the above figure and defined in the literature review, national priorities are 
decentralized to the district. To define district imihigo there defined into outcomes pillar by 
pillar, each outcome also defined into output, and from each output,  indicators are defined 
with clear (with source) baseline. For each indicator, targets are settled (total annual 
disaggregated into quarterly targets) and activities per each which later facilitate to estimate 
targets. Each employ within District set Imihi go delivered from District Imihigo. For 
measuring the achievement of District Imihigo each indicator is evaluated looking at the 
achievement level (in the form of a percentage). District Imihigo performance on side of 
socio-economy are measured in terms of  number of infrastructures developed, number of 
households secured from poverty (this include change in income, crops and animal 
production, etc), number of jobs created, education development, health services to the 
population, sanitation (quality of toil et and access to water) and achievements in people’s 
opinions and association via unit and reconciliation and working together in cooperatives.

Nyamasheke district is one among 7 districts of Western Province (Rw anda), it has 15 
sectors, 68 cells and 588 villages. Nyamasheke district has surface area of 1,174 -kilometer 
square with 412,352 population (Murangwa, 2014). The average size of the household for 
Nyamasheke district is 4.9 persons, which is the same as for  Western Province. It is slightly 
higher than the national average (4.8). Nyamasheke district has 123 females per 100 males, 
which is above the national average of 111 females; Nyamasheke is ranked first country-wide 
on this indicator (Murangwa, 2012).  
 
7.2. Research design 
 
This study is a descriptive design and correlational design. It is descriptive as the researcher 
gives description of Nyamasheke District employees and their Imihigo structure. This study 
also describes the socio-economic indicators which are observed as results of Imihigo signing 
(performance contracts). This study also is correlative as it intends to analyse the correlation 
between performance contract and socio-economic development of Nyamasheke District.  
 
7.3. Population 
 
Primary d ata of this study was collected from District employees who used to sign a 
performance contract with District mayor (individual performance contracts) which are in 
line with districts performance contracts signed between the mayor and President of 
Republic. The total is 119 staffs which subdivided to 36 district employees (working at 
Nyamasheke District head office), 15 executive secretaries from 15 sectors of Nyamasheke 
District and 68 executive secretaries of cells. As populations seem to be large, the re searcher 
has applied sampling formula to reduce the size of the population to sample size. 
 
7.4. Sampling methods and techniques  
 
Yamane (1967:886) provides a simplified formula to calculate sample sizes. This formula 
was used to calculate the sample size s from 119 Nyamasheke District Staff (as total 
population) to 54 staff of Nyamasheke District (sample size).  
 
𝑛 = 𝑁
1+𝑁∗(𝑒)2 = 119
1+119∗(0.1)2 = 54.33 ≈ 54 
  
Where N represents the total population, n signify sample size, e confidence level (which is 
90% for this study). Sampling technique adopted is non -probability sampling “purposive 
sampling” which stand from the fact that the researcher chose to staff from different 
departments. The reason why at sector and cells level only executive secretary was selected 
as the target population.  
 
7.5. Data collection tools 
This study has used both primary and secondary data for assessing validity of its hypotheses 
and ob jectives. Secondary data was collected using a documentary review (District 
Development Strategy Report and District Imihigo Reports 2014 -2020). Primary data were

collected using a questionnaire, and this questionnaire was filled by the researcher as an 
output of face to face talks between the researcher and the sampled respondent.   
 
7.6. Study objectives  
 
This study focuses on four angles: 
 
1. Evaluate the quality of Nyamasheke District Performance contracts and staff 
individual performance contracts (pillars, outcome, output, and indicators); 
2. Evaluate the level of imihigo performance in last 6 years (2014 to 2019) at all sectors 
of socio-economic development. 
3. To assesses socio-economic development of Nyamasheke District from 2014 to 2019; 
and  
4. To evaluate t he significant correlation between performance contract and socio -
economic development of Nyamasheke District.   
 
7.7. The hypothesis of the study  
 
This study focuses on four hypotheses: 
 
H01: Nyamasheke District performance contracts (as a whole) and ind ividual staff 
performance contracts are not well formulated. 
 
H02: Imihigo signed by District in last 6 years (2014 -2019) on socio-economic development 
were poorly performed. 
 
H03: From 2014 to 2019 Nyamasheke District has ensured poor performance in socio -
economic development.  
 
H04: There is no significant correlation between performance contracts and socio -economic 
development of Nyamasheke District.   
 
7.8. Data analysis 
 
As explained above, this study was analyzed in both primary and secondary data. H01, H02 
and H03 were tested using secondary data while H04 was tested using primary data. 
Secondary data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and primary data for testin g 
Hypothesis H04 was used bivariate correlation analysis.

8.0 FINDINGS OF THE STUDY 
 
8.1. Background of respondents Nyamasheke District Staffs  
 
Respondents were classified based on their working level (groups), sex, ages and years of 
experience as employees in Nyamasheke District. Respondents characteristics facilitate to 
understand the value of findings from them. W here performance, ideas, and reasoning 
capacity as well as working ability and role in the society vary from one person to another 
with the interaction of the working group or level, ages, sex, and experience. For example, if 
other factors remain constantly experienced employees are good performers (these with more 
years of experience at work).

experienced between 5 to 7 years, 7 (13%) experienced 7 years and more and 4 (7.4%) are 
experienced less than 3 years.  
 
8.2. Test of H01  
 
H01: Nyamasheke District perfor mance contracts (as a whole) and individual staff 
performance contracts are not well formulated. 
 
The researcher has observed and assessed performance contracts signed by Nyamasheke 
district from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019 and find that, they are in line with government 
priorities. They are all developed as follows: Pillar, outcome, output and per each output a 
number of indicators are defined where per each a baseline is well defined, source, targets, 
responsible person and estimated budget. Based on this obse rvation and as it's in line with 
government priorities the H01 is rejected.

8.3. Test of H02 
 
H02: Imihigo signed by District in last 6 years (2014 -2019) on socio-economic development 
were poorly performed. 
 
To test this, the researcher has analyzed the performance of Nyamasheke District vis a vis 
another district in Imihigo. The figure below gives more clarifications.

As seen in Figure 2, Nyamasheke District does not have con sistency in Imihigo performance, 
always vary from one year to another. In general, from 2014/15 there is a descending rate 
from 76.7% to 67.1% of 2017/18 because 2018/19 evaluation was not conducted at a national 
level. The position always remains above 10 th position in 30 districts. This mark middle 
performance while on individual Imihigo performance this district got 8th position with 
80.3% marks in 2016/17. In the same year (2017/18) social-economic pillar Nyamasheke also 
has got a good position (5th) wi th 80.7% marks. Based on that, the researcher stands on 
findings and conclude that H02 is not accepted.  
 
8.4. Test of H03 
 
H03: From 2014 to 2019 Nyamasheke District has ensured poor performance in socio -
economic development.  
 
Secondary data assessed on socio -economic performance of Nyamasheke District were 
captured from EICV5 (NISR, 2018). This report shows that Nyamasheke district has 69.3% 
poverty incidence rate, 41.5% extreme poverty rate, 45.1% labour force participation ra te, 
34.4% unemployment rate, 17.3% percentage of land under consolidation, 70.3% percentage 
of land protected against soil erosion, 2.1% percentage of land under irrigation, 22.1% of 
households using electricity, 89% households using an improved water sour ce, 34% of 
stunted children under five years, 1.2% households owning a computer, 69.9% literacy of 
population aged 15 and above, 80% of adult financial inclusion and 28.7% of households 
with rainwater catchment systems. All these indicators lead to the ran king of Nyamasheke 
District on the 30th Position on poverty ranking (the last among 30 Districts) or the poorest 
among others. Thus, due to that, the H03 is accepted.

9.0 CONCLUSION 
 
This study was conducted to assess the significan ce Performance Contract (Imihigo) on 
socio-economic development of Rwanda:  A case of Nyamasheke District (2014 -2019). The 
study findings (secondary data) have been shown that 100% Nyamasheke district respect the 
format of Imihigo, Nyamasheke District also  use national priorities, pillars for setting 
outcome, outputs, indicators sector by sector. In other case, indicators are well defined with 
clear baseline, targets, responsibilities and budget. These findings were used by the 
researcher to reject H01 “Nya masheke District performance contracts (as a whole) and 
individual staff performance contracts are not well formulated”. The assessment of H02 
“Imihigo signed by District in last 6 years (2014 -2019) on socio-economic development was 
poorly performed” also have revealed that Nyamasheke District ensures moderate 
performance in terms of imihigo evaluation. On the case of the economic pillar, this district 
was ranked good with more than 80% marks the same case for individual performance. This 
was resulted in th e authority to the researcher for not accepting this hypothesis. Assessment 
again of secondary data has shown that Nyamasheke district is a poor performer in the real 
economy (the researcher use this as the difference of paper evaluation and field visit (v isiting 
households one by one) as made by NISR through EICV5 and find that Nyamasheke District 
ranked the last (30th) in 30 districts in poverty reduction. Due to that, the researcher has 
accepted the H03. For the H04, the researcher has tested primary dat a (finings from the field) 
on the perception of respondents (District staffs) on both variables). Pearson correlation (r) is 
0.210 meaning that, there is a weak positive correlation between imihigo (performance 
contract) and socio -economic development. Sig . (2 -tailed) is equal to 0.001 showing that, 
thus correlation resulted or signified by r is statistically significant. Thus, the researcher 
concludes that H04 is not accepted. Thus, evaluation of Imihigo may rank a district or a staff 
on good rank while on  field people are suffering. A good ranking should be delivered from 
households looking changes they got in their living conditions with the support of local 
government authorities. Other case performance contracts have a little (weak positive 
correlation) on socio-economic development, it counts only 21% while the remaining 79% is 
from other factors not captured by this study.
