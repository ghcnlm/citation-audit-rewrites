Making research relevant to policymaking: from brokering
boundaries to drawing on practices

ABSTRACT
While urban policy makers and social scientists both aim to
successfully address societies ’ most pressing problems, their
interactions are frequently strained or even counter-productive. A
case study describing a collaborative research project on Cost
Beneﬁt Analysis shows that shifting from a representational
perspective on knowledge transfer towards a performative
understanding of problem structuring highlights how diﬀerences
between research and policymaking can be made conducive to
learning instead of frustrating it. To this end knowledge
development is analysed in terms of Translations in institutionally
embedded knowledge practices. This approach supplements the
two-community approach by opening up collaborative practices
where problem structuring and group formation coevolve.
Depending on circumstance and design, such practices can both
reproduce or transform real-world urban problems. Furthering
academic understanding of these practices can strengthen the
capacity of cities and universities to successfully address
unstructured problems.

Introduction
Cities are gaining in political and administrative importance. As Barber (2013) argues, the
most challenging problems of our time such as climate change, terrorism, poverty, and
traﬃcking of drugs, guns, and people are too vast, interrelated and contested for national
governments. Having to deal with such complex issues can safely be considered a knowl-
edge-intensive enterprise for which one requires state-of-the-art scientiﬁc insight. Yet it is
precisely in relation to wicked, or rather unstructured problems, that outcomes of tra-
ditional scientiﬁc practices fall short of societal expectations and often are contested as
being normatively biased (Fischer1990), ineﬀective (Weiss 1980) or counterproductive
(Van Buuren and Edelenbos2004). It is against this backdrop that this paper inquires
into new ways for making scientiﬁc research relevant for addressing unstructured urban
problems.

Although there are contending views on the best ways to improve the relevance of
research with regard to unstructured problems (Hoppe2011), there is a common thrust
towards extending, deepening and strengthening boundary-crossing collaborations
(Campbell and Vanderhoven 2016; Biegelbauer 2016; Mead 2015; Newman and Head
2015; Daviter 2015; Van der Arendt2014; Marsh and Evans2012; McCann and Ward
2012). Policy scholars stimulate collaborations between universities and governments as
they are expected to provide knowledge which is relevant in terms of society and rigorous
in terms of science (Evans, Karvonen, and Raven2016). Surprisingly little work has been
done on how actors involved in collaborative practices of knowledge production actually
come to develop a congruent approach to unstructured urban issues. The commonly used
Transfer model has serious shortcomings in understanding knowledge sharing between
practices (Stone 2012): its inadequacy in accounting for the subjective perceptions
involved in diﬀerent sites (Dolowitz and Marsh1996, 357) remains an empirically and
conceptually under-explored aspect (Benson and Jordan 2011, 374). In this article,
through studying how policy adversaries develop scientiﬁc research on Cost Beneﬁt
Analysis, we come to a better understanding of how collaborative knowledge generation
by practitioners and researchers works. While such collaborations between research and
policymaking are traditionally analysed in terms of cross-boundary interaction between
two communities separated by institutional boundaries, we will adopt a diﬀerent, perfor-
mative, approach here (Meyer & Kearnes2013).
A rich environment for investigating science-policy interactions with regard to urban
issues is the Dutch Nicis
1 Kennis voor Krachtige Steden (Knowledge for Vital Cities,
KKS) research program. This article draws on observations and other data on speciﬁc pro-
jects from that programme. The KKS research program, founded in 2006 (and closed in
2014), was aimed at stimulating“state-of-the-art” scientiﬁc research on urban problems
in the Netherlands, as well as promoting the contribution of universities to the economic,
social and governance capacities of cities (Nicis2006). Within the programme, more than
four hundred scientists and policymakers cooperated in overﬁfty research projects in an
eight-year period, with a total budget of forty million euro. Nicis strove to attain socially
relevant research by organizing each project around a consortium of scholars, municipa-
lities, and local stakeholders. In fact, in addition to the usual criteria of scientiﬁc quality,
originality and the projected contribution to the literature, Nicis made the establishment
of such a consortium a requirement for obtaining research funds. The partners in the con-
sortium would share the responsibility for designing the research project, specifying its
objectives, research problem and questions, but also for collaboratively executing the
project and disseminating and valorizing the results. The expectation was that in this
way the research objectives, research questions and project design would reﬂect not
only each party’s speciﬁc interest but also a more conjoined interest that is shared by
both academic and municipal practices. The work processes during the execution of the
research were self-assembled by academic and oﬃcials in regular project meetings and
workshops moderated by Nicis. To underline this joint responsibility each consortium
is ﬁnanced in equal measure by the participating parties: Nicis, cities and the university.
In our case study, we will come to see how the conditions provided by the programme
work out in shaping new knowledge practices and problem structures. We willﬁrst elab-
orate the rationale and outline of the performative analytical perspective.

Problematizing boundary work
Making policy research relevant to policymaking
Since the nineteen seventies scholars have scrutinized the science-policy interface and
argued for a collaborative design to connect these “… separate communities with
diﬀerent and con ﬂicting values, di ﬀerent reward systems, and di ﬀerent languages”
(Caplan 1979, 459). Such arrangements should contribute to making researchers aware
of policy needs and to making practitioners more sensitive to the demands of academic
knowledge. These two interdependent communities essentially require an intermediary
in order to cooperate. How such intermediary actors and arrangements contribute to
knowledge development continues to inspire research and debate.
In a recent debate, Mead (2015) lists a number of pertinent reasons for the limited
inﬂuence of policy analysis on policymaking. Heﬁnds that academic research is out of
touch with political ideologies, provides little in the way of supporting strategic
decision-making, prioritizes academic publishing and uses a language that is diﬀerent
from that of policymakers. These assertions are followed by a number of recommen-
dations to scholars. Their“… research would be more compelling to oﬃcials if it were
done inside government rather than outside it” (265); it should focus on problem articu-
lation because “[o]nly when the problem deﬁnition comes from within the organization
does research address problems as they appear there” (266). In other words, Mead who
is concerned over the limited relevance of research, urges scholars to improve their
capacity to collaborate in policymaking– more speciﬁcally to improve their ability to
“translate” research ﬁndings to be of use in everyday policymaking practice.
Newman and Head (2015) in a response to Mead claim that his lamentations result
from using Caplan’s two-community approach, wherein relevance for policymaking is
conﬂated with being instrumental to it. Policymakers, however, are not a homogenous
group but a varied collection of people. Depending on task and function they can appreci-
ate knowledge for either its instrumental, conceptual or symbolic use to everyday policy-
making. Reducing “relevance” to instrumental utility leads to missing out on “quite
signiﬁcant use of academic research by policy makers” (Newman and Head2015, 383).
Appreciating that research has a broader impact, Newman and Head argue against
Mead’s recommendations for “re-engineering” the ways problems are articulated.
Instead, they advise to invest in cross-boundary collaborations; improving knowledge
transfer and knowledge brokering to intensify interactions and convey knowledge from
research in formats digestible in the course of regular policymaking (Newman and
Head 2015).
Following up on Stone (2012) I propose applying an alternative conceptualization of
“translations”,
to meet points raised in the debate outlined above. In writing oﬀ the
two-community metaphor – as Newman and Head suggest– we let go of a common
setting for studying knowledge sharing between researchers and oﬃcials. Doing away
with the two-communities, we no longer assume boundaries separating them and we
can forgo the notion of knowledge brokers who span this boundary. By tracing researchers
and policymakers as they struggle and tinker with multiple knowledges, values and inter-
ests we come to see how knowledge and groups shape each other. To describe what actors
do when they come together to develop knowledge, I will describe what Hoppe (2011)
refers to as problem structuring. Within this process, I will focus on howTranslations

are established. The setting in which this takes place is conceptualized as embedded
practices.
The italicized concepts will be elaborated in the next section after which they are
applied on a case study.
An alternative approach to knowledge development
Problem structuring
University researchers and municipal policymakers come from diﬀerent institutions and
have diverse backgrounds. These backgrounds provide them with diﬀering conceptions of
the problem that is addressed in a collaborative practice (Hisschemöller and Hoppe1995;
Hoppe 2011). Theirﬁrst challenge is to deﬁne problems“properly”, i.e. in a way that takes
into account the problem perceptions of societal stakeholders, problematic conditions as
well as potential policy solutions (Hoppe2011). By all accounts, this is a deeply political
process – although sometimes tacitly so. Policy makers are prone to formulating problems
such that they can solve them with the instruments they have at their disposal. Researchers
are wont to formulate problems that are researchable within the paradigm they work in
and that will result in papers respected by their peers.
By taking problems to be discrepancies between an actor’s representation of the actual
(or anticipated) and a desired situation, problem structuring provides a useful concept to
map interactions between actors from diﬀering backgrounds. If all parties involved agree
on what knowledge is relevant and which values apply, the actual and the desired situation
are uncontested. Problems may then be treated as structured problems that can be dealt
with by traditional science. However, where consensus on knowledge or values is
absent (and maybe most common: when a problem considered structured by some is
being contested by others) application of traditional scientiﬁc research easily leads to
scientists becoming a party in a political struggle for deﬁning the problem (Van Buuren
and Edelenbos 2004). When communication between policy makers and researchers
breaks down, scientiﬁc research can be considered irrelevant: science as just another
opinion (Latour 2013). Collaborative knowledge generation, with collaborative problem
structuring at its core (Hoppe2011, 231), is a more productive way to deal with such
problems.
Translation
Scholars writing on knowledge utilization and boundary work have come to use“trans-
lation” uncritically as a synonym for making something technical or otherwise unintelli-
gible comprehensible to laymen or a wider audience, i.e.“… by translating scientiﬁc
knowledge into usable knowledge and translating users’ questions into research ques-
tions.” (Turnhout et al. 2013, 355) and “… simply translating between the worlds of
science, policy and the market…” (Meyer and Kearnes2013, 424). Based on studies in
Science and Technology Studies, however, Translation has acquired a more sophisticated
meaning (Callon1986; Latour1987).
The concept points attention to, and provides insight in, the process by which problems
are redeﬁned in such a way that others perceive it in their interest to cooperate on them
26 R. DUIVEMAN
<<<PAGE=6>>>
(Callon 1986; Latour1987). Translations are simultaneously a linguistic process and a dis-
placement: to include or exclude certain knowledge and values in a problem design has
consequences for their use to those involved. As perspectives converge or diverge the
relations between actors change, increasing or decreasing the possibility to share insights,
interests and resources. Tracing actors as they deliberate and decide on (re-)structuring a
problem in terms of Translations shows how structuring problems are related to making
interests con- or diverge and re-assembling the relations between the practices the parti-
cipating actors are embedded in. It is for referring to this multi-layered understanding of
Translations that I write it with a capital T.
Embedded practices
Rather than assuming“two communities”, “boundaries” etc, I will consider academics and
policymakers as being engaged in collaborative problem structuring in a shared practice
(Hamilton 2011; Shove2010). Practices are
… a routinized type of behaviour which consists of several elements, interconnected to each
other: forms of bodily activities, forms of mental activities,‘things’ and their use, a back-
ground knowledge in the form of understanding, know-how, states of emotion and motiva-
tional knowledge (… ) a practice is thus a routinized way in which bodies are moved, objects
are handled, subjects are treated, things are described and the world is understood. (Reckwitz
2002, 249)
Actors in a collaborative knowledge practice draw on both scientiﬁc and policy-making
practices to shape the way in which urban public problems are addressed, understood
and approached. Actors participate in them by virtue of being part of a diﬀerent practice
(in casu, a university or municipality); what I will call their,home-practices. Thus colla-
borative knowledge production practices must be seen as essentiallyembedded in a set
of diﬀerent home-practices, which beyond the organization one works for can consist
of professional, cultural or social settings which provide the discursive, institutional and
material structure an actor is part of.
In order to describe and understand such embedded practices as they develop, they
should not only be approached or appreciated in terms of the academic or administrative
communities that surround them, but rather sui generis, in terms they come to constitute
in and for themselves. It is for grasping the emergence and enactment of these terms that
an embedded practice can best be described as one that“ [… ] continually supplies and
deﬁnes its own contexts and resources in the practical attempt to grasp and extend a
research situation” (Knorr-Cetina 2007, 363). In short, they can best be analysed in a per-
formative manner (Meyer and Kearnes2013).
Research design
In this article, we will present a case study of such an embedded practice: one of the con-
sortia from the Nicis programme discussed in the Introduction. A performative under-
standing of its activities was established by tracing the actors as they move between
knowledge and home-practices (Latour1987). The research underlying this case study
consisted of document analysis (proposals, agenda’s, minutes, reports, articles produced
POLICY STUDIES 27
<<<PAGE=7>>>
by or for the knowledge practice as well as external documents, articles, papers and pub-
lications), multiple interviews with four of the central researchers, three municipal and
two national oﬃcials who provided the material for describing this case-study.2 The
ﬁrst round of analysis was explorative, drawing on sensitizing concepts derived from
the literature on the role of experts in structuring problems (Bowen2006). The second
round of analysis concerned several iterative rounds of written and verbal checking of
the “integrity” of the case study (Blaikie 2010, 90) by verifying and validating the
reading provided by the actors who were engaged in the described consortium.
The case study addresses three questions:
(1) How do we understand problem structuring as a process of Translation?
(2) How are di ﬀerent home-practices drawn upon in these problem-structuring
practices?
(3) How do characteristics of the home-practices inﬂuence the problem structuring
process?
Case study: the consortium Cost Beneﬁt Analysis in physical planning
In 2007, the Dutch national government has made Cost Beneﬁt Analysis (CBA) a legally
mandated condition for its contribution to regionally funded infrastructural and planning
projects exceeding 125 million Euros. With this rule, this policy analysis instrument
acquires considerable inﬂuence in designing and assessing such projects. One of the
eﬀects of this procedure has been the emergence of frequent tensions between central gov-
ernment and regional parties as well as between economists and planners. Economists
analyse the beneﬁts of a proposed infrastructure project by monetizing the public costs
and beneﬁts of its realization, for example by calculating how much the project will con-
tribute to shortening travel times to shops and suppliers and so increase accessibility of
markets. A number of politicians and policy makers believe that such an approach
leads to a bias towards solving tra ﬃc problems without regard for the underlying
spatial economic rationale. This tension becomes explicit in the preparation of a CBA.
According to local and regional plan makers, CBA discussions on calculations, future
scenarios and zero alternatives (a CBA score is relative to the costs and beneﬁts of an
alternative in which the proposed planning project is not executed; this is the so-called
zero-alternative) require a lot of resources without contributing to improve a project.
As a result, the CBA, which was introduced to provide objective information, is seen as
a contested policy instrument that frustrates instead of helps a project planning process.
At a Nicis meeting, problems with the application of CBA in local planning projects are
introduced by a municipal civil servant. A recent planning experience taught this policy
maker how the instrument signiﬁcantly narrowed down the relevant eﬀects of their
plan; beneﬁts of a landmark bridge, for example, are quanti ﬁed in travel minutes
gained, neglecting the expected aesthetic and thereby the commercial value that an
artful bridge would provide inbranding the designated area. In eﬀect, the CBA seemed
to determine which knowledge and values are of consequence in weighing the public
cost and beneﬁts of a planned problem solution in their city. Discussions on this topic
with national policymakers proved unproductive, stimulating the municipality to
quickly acquire knowledge and expertise on the use of CBA.
28 R. DUIVEMAN
<<<PAGE=8>>>
A professor in planning at the Nicis meeting is interested in investigating the problems
that municipalities experience with CBA’s. Scholars since the nineteen eighties have gen-
erally judged the instruments’central principle as sound– that in making a decision one
should way its costs against its beneﬁts – but have taken issue with its operationalization
(Hansson 2007). The criticism centres on the mechanism of monetization which can not
suﬃciently capture the environmental outcomes and social values that are considered rel-
evant by stakeholders (Turner2007; Lahdelma, Salminen, and Hokkanen2000).
The professor in planning starts assembling a research consortium. He suggests to write
a proposal together with a professor specialized in economics and infrastructure from a
diﬀerent university. Their research design is a combination of theories from economic
science and urban/regional planning. Instead of a single deﬁnition, it contains multiple
problem deﬁnitions which are derived from experiences in planning practice. In a separate
section of the proposal, suggestions are put forward from a planning and from an econ-
omics perspective on what are possible sources for the problems policymakers experience
with CBA. The planners suggest it has to do with the role of CBA in the decision making
procedure. The economics perspective focusses on the instruments’inner workings.
This dual approach attains two goals. First, the research problem is left suﬃciently open
for actors with diverging perspectives and stakes to collaborate on a problem is such a way
that they can appreciate it as familiar and relevant. Secondly and in consequence, the con-
sortium represents familiar knowledge practices for both planners and economists as it
includes preeminent professors from established universities in their respective networks.
Through this problem design, a coalition is assembled that incorporates policy adversaries
who are willing to participate in a new knowledge practice.
In the absence of an unambiguous deﬁnition of the research problem, aim and ques-
tion, the research design includes a section drawing on organizational learning theory
to organize the collaboration between the two universities and the interested municipali-
ties and stakeholders. The civil servants from the ministry’s research institute concerned
with CBA policy and calculations refrain from formally entering the consortium, but agree
to be a guest member. The ministry is most directly involved with institutionalizing CBA’s
policy and procedures in guidelines and law. By their own account, they have agreed to
cooperate in order to supply the consortium with the relevant information and keep an
eye on what they see as the correct representation of CBA policy and practice.
At this point, we see interdependent policy makers working at the municipal and national
level who oppose each other’s perspective on the role of CBA in large planning projects.
Oﬃcials responsible for CBA development and application relate positively to the consor-
tium project as it applies concepts and ideas familiar to them on an issue at the heart of
their work, enacted by economics researchers well known to them. They acknowledge
that planners have a creative role in developing projects butﬁnd the planners’analysis of
a project’s value in contrast to their“objective” analysis. In contrast, the municipal planners
are of the opinion that the economists can contribute to analysing the consequences of a
project butﬁnd their valuation too limited. However, they relate positively to the consortium
project as it takes a planning perspective they are familiar with on their issues with CBA. Two
out of the three municipal lead partners are acquainted personally or professionally with the
planning department of the university involved. They are interested in investigating ways to
better deal with CBA as part of realizing their projects. It is by structuring the problems with
CBA through familiar disciplines and research departments that it makes sense to
POLICY STUDIES 29
<<<PAGE=9>>>
collaborate both to the local and national policy-making practices involved. It is not likely
that planners would invest in an economics research project as it is the stringent application
of economics on planning that they are opposed to. Similarly, the national oﬃcials are not
eager to collaborate on a project that would only take the planners’approach to issues with
CBA. However, the policymakers recognize they are interdependent actors whose inter-
actions are strained due to diﬀerences they are not able to overcome by themselves and
both are interested in researching the issues as presented in the research proposal. We see
that with the re-articulation of the problem, crosscutting working relations can be estab-
lished between municipal and national policy makers and the researchers from urban plan-
ning and economics. In terms of Translation, we see that the policy problem is restructured
in such a way that the actors perceive it in their interest to cooperate through the consortium.
The ﬁrst year of research is dedicated to establishing a more precise common problem
deﬁnition by organizing consortium meetings. Every three months one of the consortium
partners hosts a meeting where they present the CBA casus that motivated them to par-
ticipate in the consortium. The researchers and local practitioners collaboratively organize
the logistics and content of the meetings in the cities they concern. In addition to the con-
sortium members, local stakeholders are invited and stimulated to share their experiences.
The workshops focus on issues with CBA in a local example, brought forward by one of
the practitioners. After researchers in economics and researchers in planning propose
their respective ways to address the practitioners’ CBA problems, discussions ensue on
the local consequences of each approach. It is by the situated contrasting of perspectives
from the academic and policymaking practices that the actors structure the problem.
There is a marked diﬀerence between the deliberations as conducted by the economics
and the planning researchers. Illustrative for this is the workshop dealing with the so-
called zero-alternative. The economic researchers explain how the zero-alternative is for-
mally established in a CBA by economic formulae. Based on this explanation, he presents a
number of ways to oﬀset a proposed projects’beneﬁts in the most favourable manner.
The stakeholders present at the workshop respond to these solutions by emphasizing
local complexities. They argue that given their peculiar political, natural, governmental
or technical exceptionalities, the proposed solution won’t yield the desired results. In
other words, applying the formulae as suggested, will not solve their problems. The
researcher in response presents alternative solutions, to which the policymakers and sta-
keholders respond by bringing in more peculiarities, et cetera. The researcher from the
planning department, treating the same zero-alternative topic in a parallel session, intro-
duces a diﬀerent approach to structure the problem. The planners do not explain CBA,
and neither do they propose solutions. Instead, they present the origin and consequences
of diﬀerent rationalities (e.g. technical and communicative rationality). Subsequently,
these rationalities are employed for describing the problems that stakeholders experience
when using CBA. In this workshop the participants do not scrutinize the limitations of the
measurements made by a CBA, instead, they discuss their troubles with the zero-alterna-
tive in terms of diﬀerent rationalities They collaboratively reﬂect on the beneﬁts of a com-
municative space facilitating learning around the use of CBA in planning processes.
In terms of problem structuring, the separate workshops illuminate the intricacies of
two diﬀerent trajectories. In the economics’ workshop the researcher is dealing with
CBA problems as if it concerns a structured problem. The economists oﬀer explanations
for CBA’s inner workings, but don’t acknowledge that certain characteristics of the
30 R. DUIVEMAN
<<<PAGE=10>>>
problem (planning) situation are relevant to the stakeholders but cannot be captured in
economic terms, nor be addressed by them. Suggestions to do so are disqualiﬁed by the
economist as partisan and biased and therefore invalid arguments for revising the CBA.
As the stakeholders and researchers both reproduce the problem structure common to
their home-practice, the issue nor the relations or the interests involved are changed. Con-
trary to the technocratic attempt to structure the problem by getting the facts straight, the
planning researchers provide a perspective that helps to acknowledge ambivalence and
ambiguity of the problem and suggests concepts to better deal with these. As a result,
this workshop makes direct progress in restructuring the problem: the stakeholders
start articulating their problems with CBA as an obstacle to what the researchers have
labelled as “just, informed and eﬃcient decision-making”, and start discussing the con-
ditions for a learning approach to urban planning decision-making.
In a joint closing session, the planning professor concludes – in reference to the
obstacles encountered in the economists’ workshop – that planning projects feature
“elusive eﬀects” that are relevant for establishing its costs and bene ﬁts, but which
cannot be grasped in the terms of economic science. Reminiscent of the workshop pro-
ceedings, planning and economics scholars, as well as local and national policymakers,
can agree to this restructuring of the problem. Through it, an avenue of research can be
set out that is relevant to all practices involved. It does so by touching upon a subject
upon that is at the core of the policy controversy without adding to the conﬂict. In
other words, it transcends the common points of view and opens the door for collabora-
tively answering the question: how can we best deal with that which cannot be measured?
This constitutes a purposeful adjustment of the relations between the policy adversaries by
restructuring the problem in a manner that leads to their interests becoming aligned– in
answering the question– where contestation used to prevail.
The researchers rewrite their research design. Or rather, the PhD students specify how
they are going to research the questions established during theﬁrst year. In this endeavour,
the planning researchers follow up quite directly on the consortiums’interactions. Their
speciﬁcation of the central research problem is that some aspects of planning cannot be
calculated and should, therefore, be collaboratively assessed in a more qualitative way.
Both in providing arguments for framing the problem in this way, as well as for developing
solutions to it, the researchers draw on the insights gathered in the workshops with the
local and regional stakeholders in the consortia. Pursuing the alternative rationalities per-
spective, a hypothesis is developed on the scientiﬁc notions of“high levels of communi-
cation” and “high levels of trust” as a requirement for decision making that involves
phenomena that present limits to measurement. A growing scientiﬁc interest in this
line of thinking enables the PhD student to publish theﬁrst researchﬁndings in a high-
ranking peer-reviewed international scientiﬁc journal. The research continues by develop-
ing empirical testing of the hypothesis. The research team organizes experiments in
real-world settings with municipalities.
Viewed as Translations we see that the adversaries were able to jointly articulate the
limits of CBA reasoning and restructure the common problem in terms of “elusive
eﬀects”. Moving the debate beyond the merits of monetizing planning projects, the
emphasis shifts to evaluating CBA in terms of good decision-making. Sharing this
approach with academic peers in high-ranking journals, contributes to wider recognition
of the problematics involved when using CBA as part of a decision-making process. In
POLICY STUDIES 31
<<<PAGE=11>>>
addition to over ninety citations in scientiﬁc papers, theﬁndings of the planners’research
also lead to the organization of experiments where policy makers and stakeholders can
experience working with a learning approach to CBA.
Beside the planners’study, the economics researchers have conveyed a survey which
focused on the question: what is a good zero-alternative? Lacking examples of these the
research is based on a survey in which experts judge the value of CBA for good planning
decisions. Each interview is protocolled and the respondents are carefully selected. The
report is a benchmark of good zero-alternatives that is ceremonially welcomed by the min-
istry. Subsequently, the researchers are involved in further developing the national CBA
guidelines. Here, in terms of Translations, we see a restructuring of the problem that
reinforces established relations.
For the economic researchers, the situated consortium meetings do not provide valid
data: the relevant variables nor the participant selection is scientiﬁcally controlled and
the “respondents” are primed by an on-topic lecture before the panel discussions start.
Including these proceedings as data would compromise the validity and representativeness
of their research. Not only for the scientiﬁc community they belong to, but also to the
national governments economics bureau they work with. It is exactly by establishing
knowledge that is valid and representational on a national level that CBA is considered
relevant for national policymaking. By sticking to the same scientiﬁc criteria for validity
the researchers and policy makers reinforce a problem structure that is central to both
research and policymaking, re-establishing the relationship between their practices.
Analysis
Structuring problems in an embedded practice
The case study described how researchers and policymakers attempted to make research
relevant to policymaking. Instead of describing actors working across boundaries, we ana-
lysed how researchers and policymakers collaborated in an embedded practice. Such a
practice was formed when through restructuring a problem, the policy adversaries who
come from diﬀerent institutes are re-assembled into partners in a consortium. As these
actors bring diﬀerent approaches to the research to the table, we see them collaborating
to simultaneously ﬁnd a workable articulation of the research and real-world problem
they are engaged in.
We noted in the case that actors’proposals to restructure a problem (or their rebuttals
to those of others) were initially linked directly to governmental or academic institutions.
We also noted that along the way actors also start to look beyond the requirements of their
particular home-practices. Struggling to ﬁnd new ways forward multiple knowledges,
values, discourses and interests started to merge. Interacting with each other and the situ-
ation at hand, the actors developed a collaborative practice that provides its own context
(Knorr-Cetina 2007). From such a setting a problem approach like“elusive eﬀects” can
emerge: a restructuring of the research problem that does not follow from, nor directly
ﬁts within the home-practice involved, yet is meaningful in terms of them. Clearly, ana-
lysing the interactions leading up to such a transformative approach of the research
problem is key to understanding how research is made relevant to policymaking. As it
is the capacity to transcend academic or governmental home-practices that is at the

heart of this process, it is obvious that we could not have fully grasped it in terms of the
(two) communities involved.
To better understand the process of problem structuring in an embedded practice we
will delve deeper into the process of Translation.
Translations
How problem approaches and relations are restructured through Translations is analysed
here by contrasting the two workshops introduced in the case study. Their analysis shows
actors drawing on diﬀerent conceptions of validity and relevance to shape diﬀerent
trajectories of problem structuring. The Translations thus achieved are solidiﬁed by the
(re-)production of speci ﬁc problem structures within actors ’ home-practices. For
example, in academic proposals and articles, in new guidelines on CBA policy or as
part of collaborative experiments. It is by tracing actors as they suggest, judge, move
and solidify Translations that we come to see how– over time – a problem approach is
shaped by participating actors’ home-practices. We will now explore more precisely
how this has played out in our case.
Contrasting the two workshops illustrates how exactly the characteristics of home-prac-
tices are involved in Translations. The participants in the economics workshop established
whether the solution proposed by the researcher is acceptable by projecting it on the
problem situation in their home-practice. The rebuttals put forward at the workshop
are answers to the questions put to themselves in performing that exercise:“Which pro-
blems could I address if I employed the proposed solution in my home-practice?”, “What
would be the results of this?”, “Do I like these results?”. The rebuttals, the policy makers
provided to the solutions of the economist researcher are actually representations of the
feedback the policy makers expect to receive when acting on these suggested solutions
in their home-practice.
The policy makers indicated, however, that the solutions proposed in the economics
workshop do not directly enable them to address the problems they face within their
home-practice. The municipal policy makers were reluctant to accept solutions that a
CBA has to oﬀer as these do not allow them to include the values they deem relevant
to their plans. In short, the proposed problem structure did not meet their criteria for rel-
evance. Their objections did not lead the researchers to restructure the problem so as to
include the locally preferred values. From the economics perspective, the local wants
and needs were seen as situation-speciﬁc, interest-driven and subjective. Including these
particularities was seen as incompatible with the epistemological validity criteria in
their discipline, which are aimed at establishing objective and representative knowledge.
Maintaining these scientiﬁc standards of rigour are coupled to the way that the discipline
of economics articulates its relationship with national policy makers: scientiﬁcally-based
criteria produce the“objective” evaluation that makes CBA an authoritative policy tool.
From their side, local policymakers did appreciate the value of the economics workshop.
It informed them on the workings of the national CBA policy practice. Becoming more
knowledgeable about the CBA formulae, provided them with new leverages to address
their local problems: building on these insights they understood how to emphasize
certain characteristics or conditions in their plans in order for a CBA to better capture
its value.
POLICY STUDIES 33
<<<PAGE=13>>>
The planners’workshop succeeded more directly in contributing to the policymakers’
capacity to deal with problems in their home-practice. It provided a perspective (through
the diﬀerent rationalities) that enables policy makers to legitimately argue for including
alternative values into a planning process in general and the CBA in particular. Interest-
ingly the answer provided by the research did not directly enable them to change the appli-
cation of CBA in their home-practice: they still had to conform to the CBA procedure
designed at the national level.
So restructuring of the problem did not directly meet their criteria for relevance.
However, it did enable the municipal oﬃcials to problematize their issues with CBA’s
in a new manner, which they expected to be successful. Restructuring the problem of
CBA in terms of decision-making has provided them with new options to act on in
their deliberations with the national government on the value of CBA’s. The municipal
oﬃcials now had a rebuttal to the compelling rationality of the CBA; they could discern
between equally legitimate rationalities and propose to apply the correct one depending
on the circumstance and type of judgement required. The planning researchers success-
fully restructured the problem by providing an answer to a question the policy makers
did not know they had. Through this consortium, the planning researchers were able to
extend their methods to studying CBA’s. This is a successful Translation: interests con-
verge as the problem is restructured.
When proposing and discussing problem structures, actors applied criteria for deter-
mining the restructured problem’s relevance and validity in terms of their home-practice.
By analysing the problem structuring trajectories we see that depending on the problem
structure employed and home-practices involved, this yields diﬀerent results. This leads
to a perspective on knowledge development that enables the de-trivialisation of the
phenomena through which academic and governmental practices structure a knowledge
practice: we come to see more precisely how structuring the knowledge and values
applied to a problem situation is related to structuring the relations between the practices
involved. The case showed how the diﬀerent criteria in a discipline inﬂuence the capacity
for structuring a policy problem. It draws attention to the way actors draw upon the
characteristics of diﬀerent policy and academic practices in establishing the knowledge rel-
evant for addressing a problem.
From intermediaries to moderators
Analysing the relevance of research for policymaking in terms of two communities– as
discussed in the introduction– goes hand in hand with an emphasis on intermediaries;
both as an empirically deﬁnable object of study and a focal point for recommendations
on how to make research relevant (Horst and Michael2011). In this paper, we do not
explicitly discuss knowledge brokers, boundary spanners or other intermediaries (Meyer
2010), yet this analysis can improve our understanding of the work done by actors who
view themselves in such terms. How such actors come to successfully establish a
problem approach that transcends the received view in their home-practice is analysed
here by distinguishing betweenintermediaries and moderators. It is a distinction that pro-
vides an appropriate focus point for recommendations on how to make research relevant
to policymaking.

We return to the workshops. Being satisﬁed with an answer to a question they didn’t
know they had – as we’ve seen in the planning workshop– illustrates that actors do
not just look for compatibility of a new problem structure with their home-practice in
terms of the latter’s standard criteria. For the researchers and policy makers involved it
is about coming to an understanding of issues that are of interest to them in terms of
their own academic or administrative practices. In interacting, processing the feedback
from the problem under investigation and the response from each other and their
related practices, their joint practice could come to incorporate a diversity of criteria
and discourses for establishing congruency. Congruency refers to a problem structure
that makes sense in terms of the practices of those involved (Grin and Van de Graaf1996).
The establishment of“elusive eﬀects” illustrates this point. By acknowledging the exist-
ence of elusive eﬀects as a phenomenon that is relevant for a good CBA but cannot be
monetized, a problem design is accepted by the economist-researchers and – policy
makers, that does not comply with problem structures or validity criteria common in
(or compatible with) their home-practices. The lesson is that for a Translation to
succeed, actors require a new problem approach to enables successful action in their
home-practice. To establish this, the actors might commonly draw on the problem-struc-
ture and criteria from their home-practice. The case study however also showed actors can
defer this“drawing on” when it does not contribute to realizing their aims; the desired new
actions. How does this come about? In judging whether a proposed restructuring of a
problem is acceptable, actors can check whether a redesigned problem is compatible
with their home-practice, i.e. asking colleagues or a superior; drafting a memo. An alterna-
tive route is for an actor not to check for compatibility but to assess whether a redesign
leads to a restructuring of the problem that can bring about closure (Wagenaar and
Cook 2011) within or with regard to their home-practice.
The municipal actors collaborated on restructuring the problem in a manner that did
not comply with their home-practice. This might be related to them being frustrated by a
policy instrument which is important for judging the outcome of their project but remains
unresponsive to locally valued costs and beneﬁts. As we have seen the economics research-
ers and policymakers seemed less inclined to deviate from problem structures embedded
in their home-practices. A phenomenon which we ascribed to the coupling between
researchers maintaining speciﬁc epistemological standards of rigour and policy makers
who depend on these standards for the authority of their policy instrument. In their rec-
ognition of elusive eﬀects, however, we see that these actors made an exception. From this
instance we can tentatively outline two situations within a knowledge practice within
which actors collaborate on restructuring a problem in a manner that deviates from
their home-practice:
. being oﬀered a more productive route to realize one’s interests in a situation where
one’s routine approach does deliver the desired outcome
. being oﬀered an alternative approach to a recognized problem that does not (seem) to
conﬂict with established interests or approaches
The distinction between actors who do and who do not deviate is conceptualized in
terms ofintermediaries and moderators (Latour 1987). An intermediary is an actor struc-
turing a problem by only cooperating on actions that address the formal problem as it is
POLICY STUDIES 35
<<<PAGE=15>>>
established in their home-practice. An actor is labelled amoderator if and when a proposal
for an alternative approach leads to a reﬂection upon employed preferences and occasions
a restructuring of the original situation, potentially opening up new actions and decisions.
Both types are seen to be present in the case study. Distinguishing one from the other con-
tributes to pinpointing where problems common to certain home-practices will be repro-
duced or can be transformed and which situations contribute or detract from this
happening.
Making research relevant
The consortium in the case study provided anavant le lettreillustration of how currently
debated recommendations for improving the relevance of research (Mead2015; Newman
and Head 2015) actually work out. This case study contributes to this discussion by
suggesting that making research relevant does not result from organizing it“inside” gov-
ernment (as suggested by Mead2015). First of all, because (urban) policymaking and
implementation is increasingly developed outside of, and between, institutions. Second,
because the value of research for the policy does not result from their integration as
such, but by organizing them in such a way that they can complement, enlighten,
conﬂict with, and inspire each other. In short, by connecting practices in a manner that
acknowledges the need for Translation. The case study provides some insights on how
this can be organized. These can be drawn out best in reference to the contribution by
Daviter (2015) to the debate listed above.
In his paper, Daviter (2015) emphasizes the distinction between the political and sub-
stantive use of knowledge and relates this to a policy system’s susceptibility to knowl-
edge creeps and shifts: where new knowledge is at odds with an organizations ’
epistemology, it cannot always enter the policy-making process through learning, veriﬁ-
cation or experimentation. In those cases, Daviter argues, knowledge take-up results
from contestation.
The case study indeed showed actors drawing on home-practices to judge the relevance
and validity of problem structure and decide on their worth. As interdependent (govern-
mental) actors in a problemﬁeld each maintain connections to a particular disciplinary
research community – with its own particular knowledge practices – analysing how
these interact, is key to understanding how research contributes to addressing unstruc-
tured problems. As noted in the case study, the stalemate in the economists’workshop
is related to the researchers limited freedom in redesigning the problem without compro-
mising widely accepted criteria for scientiﬁc rigour within their discipline. Urban Planning
as a science has a broader epistemological scope of what is considered good science; these
researchers can suggest redesigning the problem by applying diﬀerent rationalities and
opening up new venues for actionable options without compromising scientiﬁc validity.
Clearly, the home-practices in which the participating actors are embedded are sources
for motivating, informing or legitimizing decisions in a process of collaborative problem
structuring. However, the characteristics of this practice diﬀer in the extent to which they
allow for synthesis with those of others.
Beyond sites for problem structuring, the embedded knowledge practices have also
been shown to be a source for motivating, informing and legitimizing (re-)structuring
of a problem in home-practices. Think of the municipal actors who embrace the multiple
36 R. DUIVEMAN
<<<PAGE=16>>>
rationalities that the urban planning researchers provide to legitimately criticize CBA in a
constructive manner; without denouncing the value of economics yet not supporting or
investing in it. Embedded practices as such are both sites of, and sources for problem
structuring. They can be drawn upon to do both. This means that they can be instrumental
to institutionalized problem structuring through “learning, veriﬁcation or experimen-
tation” but can also be enacted to contest, disrupt or change them in unexpected ways.
In the case study, we saw adversaries willing to participate in an embedded knowledge
practice. This was due to the problem deﬁnition being left open and acknowledging both
urban planning and economics as relevant knowledge practices to draw upon. It is by
acknowledging the relevance of multiple knowledge and practices that a dialogue situ-
ation is provided where contestation used to prevail; by simultaneously tinkering with
problem structure and relations between practices, the conditions are (re-) established
for knowledge development through experimentation, veri ﬁcation and deliberation.
These observations contribute to our understanding of the role of oﬃcials and research-
ers involved in the governance of problems (Hoppe2011). Hoppe (2011) states that
where established relations betweenpower (governing) and puzzling (researching) lead
to routine reproduction of problem-solution couplings, a shift inparticipation is key
to enabling a transition in the governance of a problem. By studying actors drawing
on practices for structuring problems, this paper shows how exactly (re-)designing par-
ticipation is made more or less successful inﬁnding new ways forward in situations
where power and puzzling maintain a dead-lock. It is through the rethinking of the
design and the sorts of embeddedness of a shared knowledge practice that it can
provide conditions for moderators (instead of intermediaries) to collaboratively work
on making research relevant.
Conclusions
This paper inquired into the question how actors collaboratively generate knowledge that
is relevant to both science and policymaking. To this end, we analysed the interactions
between researchers and policymakers developing knowledge to better address an unstruc-
tured urban problem. Interactions were portrayed as problem structuring in an embedded
knowledge practice, in which actors draw on their home-practices for establishing, chan-
ging or amending the content and outcome of research on urban problems. We analysed
such embedded practices as performing Translations; moments where knowledge, values
and interests intertwine and reproduce or transform the relations within and between the
practices of the policymakers and researchers involved.
This paper has shown how exactly actors are enabled and constrained by the problem
structures embedded in their home-practices. Looking at moments of Translation contrib-
utes to clarifying how epistemologies are tied to speciﬁc practices and the collaborations
between them. In addition, it points out that an“organisational” conﬂict over which
knowledge to apply can, at least partially, be opened-up: an embedded knowledge practice
can (re-) enable learning instead of contestation to inform policymaking. In the case study
this was enabled by starting out with emphasizing problem manifestation (instead of
deﬁnitions); involving both the practitioners and the scholars involved in a policy contro-
versy; organizing situated deliberations where actors could draw equally on the presented
disciplinary insights and the situation at hand; proposing translations which provide an
POLICY STUDIES 37
<<<PAGE=17>>>
alternative route to realize the interests of one group without compromising those of the
other. The point here being that while organizational characteristics help distinguish
between sites more likely to experience knowledge creep or shift (Daviter2015), embedded
practices can provide a niche outside them; allowing for diﬀerent modalities to develop
relevant, transformative knowledge.
The performative approach applied in this paper led to reﬂections on and reﬁnements
of recently made recommendations that were aimed at intensifying interactions between
researchers and policymakers (Newman and Head2015); translating researchﬁndings to
everyday policymaking (Mead 2015) and grasping both the substantive and political
dimension of knowledge use (Daviter2015). Additionally, we drew lessons on how to
organize research which is relevant for society and suﬃciently rigourous for science
(Evans, Karvonen, and Raven2016). Following up on Stone (2012) we found that analys-
ing Translations indeed allows us to address previously noted deﬁciencies in the transfer
model with regard to analysing knowledge sharing between practices (Dolowitz and
Marsh 1996; Benson and Jordan2011).
Interestingly, the approach presented in this paper also allows for a pragmatist con-
tribution to be made to a dilemma recently revived by Biegelbauer (2016, 129) who
stated that “analytical limitations” force researchers to focus on either learning as
“problem-solving oriented form of political activity” or “a more interest-oriented under-
standings of policy-making”; although these types of learning are acknowledged to co-
occur and interact. (2016, 142) The dilemma relates to a will versus cognition approach
to comprehending the establishment of authoritative expertise in policy settings (Hufen
and Koppenjan2014). Stone (2012) touched upon this issue when reviewing the knowl-
edge transfer literature which she saw moving its focus“… from the idea as the main
source of explanation, one inevitably propelling change, to an explanatory position that
highlights uncertainty, where the acceptance of the idea is more politically relevant than
the idea itself” (2011, 489). Now, the performative approach as employed in this article
does not only allow researchers to simultaneously describe and analyse multiple forms
and modalities of knowledge and power, but also how they interact and transform each
other. This enables policy analysts to take a third position relative to the two above con-
trasting rationality and power or cognition and politics, et cetera. Following Mol (2013,
380) studying knowledge (governance) practices is not about spreading the rationally
best idea, nor is it about the agency or structure legitimizing or willing what counts
as such. The challenge for the policy analyst lies in describing how actors in new,
shared hybrid practices enact their own version of a problem by drawing on their
home-practices, while being challenged by others and the situation that talks back
(Schön 1983).
Following up on the performative approach employed in this article it is suggested that
further research be aimed at answering these questions:
. How do the characteristics of surrounding practices enable and constrain Translations
in an institutionally embedded knowledge practice?
. How do actors drawing on an institutionally embedded knowledge practice coordinate
the governance of a problem within and between home-practices?
. How do actors structuring problems in knowledge practices enable and constrain their
home-practices in governing real-world problems?
