COMMENT
Transforming evidence for policy and practice:
creating space for new conversations
Kathryn Oliver 1 & Annette Boaz2
ABSTRACT
For decades, the question of how evidence inﬂuences policy and practice has
captured our attention, cutting across disciplines and policy/practice domains.
All academics, funders, and publics have a stake in this conversation. There are
pockets of great expertise about evidence production and use, which all too
often remains siloed. Practical and empirical lessons are not shared across
disciplinary boundaries and theoretical and conceptual leaps remain contained.
This means that we are not making the most of vast and increasing investment
in knowledge production. Because existing lessons about how todo and use
research well are not shared, funders and researchers are poorly equipped to
realise the potential utility of research, and waste resources on— for example—
ineffective strategies to create research impact. It also means that the scarce
resources available tostudy evidence production and use are misspent on overly-
narrow or already-answered questions. Patchy and intermittent funding has
failed to build broadly relevant empirical or theoretical knowledge about how to
make better use of evidence, or to build the communities required to act on this
knowledge. To transform how we as a community think about what evidence is,
how to generate it, and how to use it well, we must better capture lessons being
learned in our different research and practice communities. We mustﬁnd ways
to share this knowledge, to embed it in the design of our research systems and
practices, and work jointly to establishgenuine knowledge gaps about evidence
production and use. This comment sets out one vision of how that might be
accomplished, and what might result.

Are we investing wisely in research for society?
F
or decades, conversations between research funders, users,
and producers have focused on different aspects of what
evidence is, the roles it plays in policy and practice, and the
different ways in which roles can be enhanced and supported.
Most researchers feel unequivocally that‘more research’is always
better— and funders and governments seem to agree (Sarewitz,
2018). Governments are increasingly using investments explicitly
to help create the evidence base for better decision-making. For
example, funding has been explicitly focused on the United
Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UKRI-UNDP, 2018).
The UK government has made several targeted investments,
including the £1.5 billion Global Challenges Research Fund to
address substantive social problems, (Gov. UK, 2016; UKRI,
2017), and in health, the thirteen (up from nine) Collaborations
for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care, which
received £232 million 2008–2019 (NIHR,2009). This investment
looks set to continue with a further £150 million allocated to the
Applied Research Collaborations (NIHR, 2018). In the US, the
Trump administration recently signed into law $176.8 billion for
research and development, of which $543 million is speciﬁcally
for translational health research (Science,2018). These funds are
made available to researchers with an effective proviso that the
research is targeted towards questions of direct interest to pol-
icymakers and practitioners.
There has also been an increase in the infrastructure govern-
ments provide, such as scientiﬁc advisory posts and professionals
(Doubleday and Wilsdon,2012; Gluckman,2014), and a range of
secondments and fellowship opportunities designed to‘solve’the
problem of limited academic-policy engagement (Cairney and
Oliver, 2018). The UK Government recently asked departments
to produce research priority areas (Areas of Research Interest
(ARIs)), to guide future academic-policy collaboration (Nurse,
2015). Yet, there has been almost no evaluation of these activities.
There is limited evidence about how to build the infrastructure to
use evidence in impactful ways and limited evidence about the
impact of this investment (Kislov et al.,2018). We simply do not
know whether the growth of funding, infrastructure, or initiatives
has actually improved research quality, or led to improvements
for populations, practice or policy.
Thus, despite our ever-growing knowledge about our world,
physical and social, it is not easy toﬁnd answers to the challenges
facing us and our governments. Spending ever-increasing
amounts on producing research evidence is not likely to help, if
we do not understand how to make the most of these invest-
ments. Discussions about wastage within the research system
often focus on valid concerns about reproducibility and quality
(Bishop, 2019), but until we also understand the broader political
and societal pressure shaping what evidence is produced and
how, we will not be able to reduce this waste (Sarewitz,2018). In
short, our research systems are not guided by current theory
about what types of knowledge are most valuable to help address
societal problems, orhow to produce useful evidence, or how to
use this knowledge in policy and practice setting.
Who knows about how to improve evidence production and
use?
Fortunately, even if under-used, there is a signiﬁcant body of
academic and practical knowledge about how evidence is pro-
duced and used. Several disciplines take the question of evidence
production and use as a core concern, and this inherently
transdisciplinary space has become populated by research evi-
dence from different academic and professional traditions, jur-
isdictions and contexts.
Much of the funded research into knowledge production and
use has been conducted in health and health care, and other
applied disciplines. Although there are perennial inquiries about
the ‘best’ research methods which should inform policy and
practice (Haynes et al., 2016), this ﬁeld has offered some very
practical insights, from identifying factors which inﬂuence evi-
dence use (Innvaer et al.,2002; Oliver et al.,2014; Orton et al.,
2011), to identifying types of evidence used in different contexts
(Dobrow et al.,2004; Oliver and de Vocht,2015; Whitehead et al.,
2004). Researchers have explored strategies to increase evidence
use (Dobbins et al.,2009; Haynes et al.,2012; Lavis et al.,2003),
and developed structures to support knowledge production and
use— in the UK, see, for example, the What Works Centres,
Policy Research Units, Health Research Networks and so forth
(Ferlie, 2019; Gough et al.,2018). Similar examples can be found
in the US (Tseng et al.,2018; Nutley and Tseng,2014) and the
Netherlands (Wehrens et al., 2010). Alongside these practical
tools, critical research has helped us to understand the impor-
tance of diverse evidence bases (e.g., Brett et al.,2014; Goodyear-
Smith et al., 2015), of including patients and stakeholders in
decision-making (Boaz et al.,2016; Liabo and Stewart,2012), and
to contextualise the drive for increased impact outcomes (Boaz
et al., 2019; Locock and Boaz,2004; Nutley et al.,2000).
The social sciences have provided research methods to inves-
tigate the various interfaces between different disciplines and
their potential audiences. Acknowledging insights from philoso-
phy, critical theory and many otherﬁeld (see, e.g., Douglas,2009),
we highlight two particular perspectives. Firstly, policy studies has
helped us to understand the processes of decision-making and the
(political) role of evidence within it (Dye,1975; Lindblom, 1990;
Weiss, 1979). A subﬁeld of ‘the politics of evidence-based pol-
icymaking’has grown up, using an explicitly political-science lens
to examine questions of evidence production and use (Cairney,
2016b; Hawkins and Ettelt,2018; Parkhurst, 2017). Political sci-
entists have commented on the ways in which political debate has
been leveraged by scientiﬁc knowledge, with particular focuses on
social justice, and the uses of evidence to support racist and sexist
oppression (Chrisler, 2015; Emejulu, 2018; Lopez and Gadsden,
2018; Malbon et al.,2018; Scott, 2011).
Secondly, the ﬁeld of Science and Technology studies (STS)
treats the practice and purpose science itself as an object of study.
Drawing on philosophies of science and sociologies of knowledge
and practice, early theorists described science as an esoteric
activity creating knowledge through waves of experimentation
(Kuhn, 1970; Popper, 1963). This was heavily critiqued by social
constructivists, who argue that all knowledge was inherently
bound to cultural context and practices (Berger and Luckmann,
1966; Collins and Evans, 2002; Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1993).
Although some took this to mean that science was just another
way of interpreting reality of equal status with other belief sys-
tems, most see these insights as demonstrating the importance of
understanding the social context within which scientiﬁc practices
and objects were conducted and described (Latour and Woolgar,
2013; Shapin, 1995). Similarly, Wynne showed how social and
cultural factors determine what we consider‘good’ evidence or
expertise (Wynne,1992). More recently, scholars have focused on
how science and expertise is politicised through funding and
assessment environments (Hartley et al., 2017; Jasanoff, 2005;
Jasanoff and Polsby, 1991; Prainsack, 2018), the cultures and
practices of research (Fransman, 2018; Hartley, 2016), through
the modes of communication with audiences, and on the role for
scientiﬁc advice around emerging technologies and challenges
(Lee et al.,2005; Owen et al.,2012; Pearce et al.,2018; Smallman,
2018; Stilgoe et al.,2013).
Are we acting on these lessons?
However, funders and researchers rarely draw on the learning
from these different ﬁelds; nor is learning shared between

disciplines and professions (Oliver and Boaz, 2018). Thus, we
have sociologists of knowledge producing helpful theory about
the complex and messy nature of decision-making and the poli-
tical nature of knowledge (e.g., Lancaster,2014); but this is not
drawn on by designers of research partnerships or evaluators of
research impact (Chapman et al., 2015; Reed and Evely, 2016;
Ward, 2017). This leaves individual researchers with the
imperative to do high quality research and to demonstrate
impact, but with little useful advice about how as individuals or
institutions they might achieve or measure impact (Oliver and
Cairney, 2019), leading to enormous frustration, duplicated and
wasted effort. Even more damagingly, researchers produce poor
policy recommendations, or naively engage in political debates
with no thought about the possible costs and consequences for
themselves, the wider sector, or publics.
We recognise that engaging meaningfully with literatures from
multiple disciplines is too challenging a labour for many. The
personal and institutional investment required to engage with
the practical and scholarly knowledge about evidence production
and use is— on top of other duties— beyond most of us. Gen-
erating consensus about the main lessons is itself challenging,
although initial attempts have been made (Oliver and Pearce,
2017). Across the diverse literature on evidence use, terms are
deﬁned and mobilised differently. Working out what the terms
are implying and what is at stake in the alternative mobilisation
of these terms is a huge task. Many researchers are only brieﬂy
able to enter this broader debate, through tacked-on projects
attached to larger grants. There is no obvious career pathway for
those who want to remain at this higher level. There are simply
too many threads pulling researchers and practitioners back into
their ‘home’ disciplines and domains, which prevents people
undertaking the labour of learning the key lessons from multiple
ﬁelds.
Yet the history of research in this area, scattered and patchy
though it is, shows us how necessary this labour is if useful,
meaningful research is to be done and used (DuMont,2019). Too
much time and energy has been spent investigating questions
which have been long-since answered— such as whether RCTs
should be used to investigate policy issues, whether we need a
pluralistic approach to research design; whether to invest in
relationships as well as data production. But governments and
universities have also failed to create environments where
knowledge producers are welcome and useful in decision-making
environments; where their own staff feel able to freely discuss and
experiment with ideas; and universities consistently fail to reward
or support those who want to create social change or work at the
interfaces between knowledge production and use.
This failure to draw together key lessons also means that the
scarce resources allocated to thestudy of evidence production and
use have been misspent. There has been no sustained inter-
disciplinary funding for empirical research studies into evidence
production and use in the UK, and in the US only over the last 15
years (DuMont, 2019). This has led to a dearth of shared
empirical and theoretical evidence, but also a lack of community,
which has had a detrimental effect on the scholarship in this
space. All too often, research funding goes towards already-
answered questions (such as whether bibliometrics are a good
way to capture impact). We must ensure thatnew research on
evidence production and use addresses genuine gaps. That can
only be done by making existing knowledge more widely available
and working together to generate collaborative research agendas.
An unfortunate side-effect of this lack of community is that
many who enter it do so with the sense that it is a new,‘
emerging’
ﬁeld, which will generate silver-bullet solutions for researchers
and funders. Because it is new to them, researchers feel it must be
new to all — not realising that their own journey has been
undertaken by many others before them. For instance, there are
many initiatives which claim to be‘newly addressing’ the pro-
blem of ‘evidence use’, ‘research on research’,t h e‘science of
science’, ‘meta-science’, or some other variant. Whether they
explore the allocation and impact of research funding and eva-
luation, the infrastructure of policy research units or the practice
of collaborative research, they all make vital contributions. But to
claim as many do that it is an‘emerging ﬁeld’illustrates how easy
it is, even with the best of intentions, to ignore existing expertise
on the production and use of evidence. We must better articulate
the difference between these pieces of the puzzle, and the dif-
ference those differences make. Too many are claiming that their
piece provides the whole picture. In turn, funders feel they have
done their part by funding this small piece of research, but
remain ignorant of the existing knowledge, and indeed of the
real gaps.
Research on evidence production and use is often therefore not
as useful as it should be. Failing to draw on existing literature, the
solutions proposed by most commentators on the evidence-pol-
icy/practice ‘gap’ often do not take into account the realities of
complex and messy decision-making, or the contested and poli-
tical nature of knowledge construction— leading to a situation
where an author synthesising lessons from across theﬁeld can
end up sharing a set of normative statements that might imply
that there has been no conceptual leap in 20 years (see e.g.,
French, 2018; Gamoran, 2018).
Evidence and policy/practice studies: our tasks
There are therefore two key tasks for those primarily engaged in
researching and teaching evidence production and use for policy
and practice, which are to (1) identify and share key lessons more
effectively and (2) to build a community enabling transdisci-
plinary evidence to be produced and used, which addresses real
gaps in the evidence base and helps decision-makers transform
society for the better. We close with some suggestions about
possible steps we can take towards these goals.
Firstly, we must better communicate our key lessons. We
would like to help people articulate the hard-won, often
disciplinary-speciﬁc lessons from their own work for others— and
to work with partners to embed them into the design, practice
and evaluation of research. For instance, critical perspectives on
power can describe the lines of authority and the institutional
governance surrounding decision-making (Bachrach and Baratz,
1962; Crenson,1971; Debnam,1975); the interpersonal dynamics
which determine everything from the credibility of evidence to
the placement of topics on policy agendas (Oliver and Faul,2018;
Tchilingirian, 2018; White, 2008); to the practice of research
itself, and the ways in which assumed and enacted power leads to
the favouring of certain methodologies and narratives (Hall and
Tandon, 2017; Pearce and Raman, 2014). How might this
translate into infrastructure and funding to support equitable
research partnerships (Fransman et al.,2018)? What other shared
theory and practical insights might help us transform how we do
and use research?
Secondly, we must generate research agendas collaboratively.
In our view, the only way to avoid squandering resources on
ineffective research on research is to work together to share
emerging ideas, and to produce genuinely transdisciplinary
questions. We made a start on this task at recent meetings. A
2018 Nufﬁeld Foundation-funded symposium brought together
leading scholars, practitioners and policymakers, and funders, to
share learning about evidence use and to identify key gaps. We
followed this meeting with a broader discussion at the William T.
Grant Use of Research Evidence meeting in March 2019 which
has also contributed to our thinking.

We initiated the conversation with a Delphi exercise to identify
key research questions prior to the meeting. We reﬁned the list,
and during the meeting we asked participants to prioritise these.
This was a surprisingly challenging process, which revealed that
even to reach common understanding about the meaning of a
research question, let alone the importance, discussants had to
wade through decades-worth of assumptions, biases, preferences,
language nuances and habits.
Based on this analysis, we identify three main areas of work
which are required to transform how we think about to create and
use evidence (Table1):
1. Transforming knowledge production
2. Transforming translation and mobilisation
3. Transforming decision-making
The topics below were selected to indicate the broad range of
empirical and normative questions which need broader discus-
sion, and are by no means deﬁnitive. Of course, much research on
some topics has already been done, but we have included them—
because even if research already exists, it is not widely enough
known to routinely inform research users, funders or practi-
tioners about how to better produce or use evidence. We observe
that much of the very limited funding to investigate evidence
production and use has gone to either developing metrics
(responsible or otherwise, Row 2 column 4) or tools to increase
uptake (Row 2, column 4), to the relative neglect of everything
else. There are signiﬁcant gaps which can only be addressed
jointly across disciplines and sectors, and we welcome debates,
additions, and critiques about how to do this better.
A shared research agenda
As we note above, these topics are drawn from proposed ques-
tions and discussions by an interdisciplinary group of scholars,
practitioners, funders and other stakeholders. It became clear
during this process that many were unaware of relevant research
which had already been undertaken under these headings. These
topics reﬂect our own networks and knowledge of theﬁeld, so
cannot be regarded as deﬁnitive. We need and welcome part-
nership with others working in this space to attempt to broaden
the conversation as much as possible. We have selected a pro-
portion of the selected topics to illustrate a number of points.
First, that no one discipline or researcher could possibly have
the skills or knowledge to answer all of these questions. Inter-
disciplinary teams can be dif ﬁcult to assemble, but clearly
required. We need leadership in this space to help spot oppor-
tunities to foster interdisciplinary research and learning.
Second that all of these topics could be framed and addressed
in multiple ways, and many have been. Many are discussed, but
there is little consensus; or there is consensus within disciplines
but not between them. Some topics have been funded and others
have not. We feel there is an urgent need to identify where
research investment is required, where conversations need to be
supported, and where and how to draw out the value of existing
knowledge. Again, we need leadership to help us generate colla-
borative research agendas.
Third, that while we all have our own interests, the overall
picture is far more diverse, and that there is a need for all working
in this area to clearly deﬁne what their contributions are in
relation to the existing evidence and communities. A shared space
to convene and learn from one another would help us all
understand the huge and exciting space within which we are
working.
Finally, this is an illustrative set of topics, and not an exhaustive
one. We would not claim to be setting the deﬁnitive research
agenda in this paper. Rather, we are setting out the need to learn
from one another and to work together in the future. Below, we
describe some examples of the type of initial discussions which

might help us to move forward, using our three themes of
knowledge production, knowledge mobilisation, and decision-
making. We have cited relevant studies which set out research
questions or provide insights. By doing so, we hope to demon-
strate the breadth of disciplines and approaches which are being
used to explore these questions; and the potential value of
bringing these insights together.
Transforming knowledge production. Firstly, we must under-
stand who is involved in shaping and producing the evidence
base. Much has been written about the need to produce more
robust, meaningful research which minimises research waste
through improving quality and reporting (Chalmers et al.,2014;
Glasziou and Chalmers, 2018; Ioannidis, 2005), and the infra-
structure, funding and training which surround knowledge pro-
duction and evaluation have attracted critical perspectives (Bayley
and Phipps, 2017; Gonzalez Hernando and Williams, 2018;
Katherine Smith and Stewart,2017). Current discourses around
‘improving’ research focus on making evidence more rigorous,
certain, and relevant; but how are these terms interpreted locally
in different policy and practice contexts? How are different forms
of knowledge and evidence assessed, and how do these criteria
shape the activities of researchers?
Enabling researchers to re ﬂect on their own role in the
‘knowledge economy ’— that is, the production and services
attached to knowledge-intensive activities (usually but not
exclusively referring to technological innovation (Powell and
Snellman, 2004))— requires engagement with this history.
This might mean asking questions about who is able to
participate in the practice and evaluation of research. Who is able
to ask and answer questions? What questions are asked and why?
Who gets to inﬂuence research agendas? We know that there are
barriers to participation in research for minority groups, and for
many research users (Chrisler,2015; Duncan and Oliver,2017;
Scott et al.,2009). At a global level, how are research priorities set
by, for example, international funders and philanthropists? How
can we ensure that local and indigenous interests and priorities
are not ignored by predominantly Western research practices?
How are knowledge ‘gaps’ or areas of ‘non-knowledge’ con-
structed, and what are the power relationships underpinning that
process (Nielsen and Sørensen, 2017)? There are important
questions about what it means to do ethical research in the global
society, with honesty about normative stances and values (Callard
and Fitzgerald2015), which apply to the practices we engage in as
much as the substantive topics we focus on (Prainsack et al.,2010;
Shefner et al.,2014).
It might also mean asking abouthow we do research. Many
argue that research (particularly funded through responsive-
mode arrangements) progresses in an incremental way, with
questions often driven by ease, rather than public need
(Parkhurst, 2017). Is this the most ef
ﬁcient way to generate
new knowledge? How does this compare with, for example,
random research funding (Shepherd et al., 2018)? Stakeholder
engagement is said to be required for impact, yet we know it is
costly and time-consuming (Oliver et al.,2019, 2019a). How can
universities and funders support researchers and users to work
together long-term, with career progression and performance
management untethered from simplistic (or perhapsany) metrics
of impact? Is coproduced research truly more holistic, useful, and
relevant? Or does inviting in different interests to deliberate on
research ﬁndings, even processes, distort agendas and politicise
research (Parkhurst and Abeysinghe,2016)? What are the costs
and beneﬁts to these different systems and practices? We know
little about whether (and if so how well) each of these modes of
evidence production leads to novel, useful, meaningful
knowledge; nor how these modes in ﬂuence the practice or
outputs of research.
Transforming evidence translation and mobilisation . Sig-
niﬁcant resources are put into increasing ‘use’ of evidence,
through interventions (Boaz et al.,2011) or research partnerships
(Farrell et al., 2019; Tseng et al., 2018). Yet ‘use’ is not a
straightforward concept. Using research well implies the existence
of a diverse and robust evidence base; a range of pathways for
evidence to reach decision-makers; both users and producers of
knowledge having the capacity and willingness to engage in
relationship-building and deliberation about policy and practice
issues; research systems supporting individuals and teams to
develop and share expertise.
More attention should be paid to how evidence is discussed,
made sense of, negotiated and communicated — and the con-
sequences of different approaches. This includes examining the
roles of people involved in the funding of research, through to the
ways in which decision-makers access and discuss evidence of
different kinds. How can funders and universities create
infrastructure and incentives to support researchers to do
impactful research, and to inhabit boundary spaces between
knowledge production and use? We know that potential users of
research may sit within or outside government, with different
levels and types of agency, making different types of decisions in
different contexts (Cairney,2018; Sanderson, 2000). Yet beyond
‘tailoring your messages’, existing advice to academics does not
help them navigate this complex system (Cairney and Oliver,
2018). To takethis lesson seriously, we might want to think about
the emergence of boundary spanning- organisations and
individuals which help to interface between research producers
(primarily universities, but also civil society) and users (Bednarek
et al.,2016; Cvitanovic et al.,2016; Stevenson,2019). What types
of interfacing are effective, and how— and how do interactions
between evidence producers and users shape both evidence and
policy? How might policies on data sharing and open science
inﬂuence innovation and knowledge mobilisation practices?
Should individual academics engage in advocacy for policy
issues (Cairney, 2016a; Smith et al.,2015), using emotive stories
or messaging to best communicate (Jones and Crow, 2017;
Yanovitzky and Weber, 2018), or rather be ‘honest brokers’
representing without favour a body of work (Pielke,2007)? Or
should this type of dissemination work be undertaken by
boundary organisations or individuals who develop speciﬁc skills
and networks? There is little empirical evidence about how best to
make these choices (Oliver and Cairney, 2019), or how these
consequences affect the impact or credibility of evidence (Smith
and Stewart, 2017); nor is there good quality evidence about the
most effective strategies and interventions to increase engagement
or research uptake by decision-makers or between researchers
and their audiences (Boaz et al.,2011). It seems likely that some
researchers may get involved and others stay in the hinterlands
(Locock and Boaz, 2004), depending on skills and preference.
However, it is not clear how existing studies can help individuals
navigate these complex and normative choices.
Communities (of practice, within policy, amongst diverse
networks) develop their own languages and rationalities. This will
affect how evidence is perceived and discussed (Smallman,2018).
Russell and Greenhalgh have shown how competing rationalities
affect the reasoning and argumentation deployed in decision-
making contexts (Greenhalgh and Russell, 2006; Russell and
Greenhalgh, 2014); how can we interpret local meanings and
sense-making in order to better communicate about evidence?
Much has been written about the different formats and tailored
outputs which can be used to‘increase uptake’by decision-makers

(Lavis et al., 2003; Makkar et al., 2016; Traynor et al., 2014)—
although not with conclusiveﬁndings— yet we know so little about
how these messages are received. Researchers may be commu-
nicating particularly messages, but how can we be sure that
decision-makers are comprehending and interpreting those
messages in the same way? Theories of communication (e.g.,
Levinson, 2000; Neale, 1992) must be applied to this problem.
Similarly, drawing on psychological theories of behaviour
change, commentators have argued for greater use of emotion,
narrative and story-telling by researchers in an attempt to
inﬂuence decision-making (Cairney, 2016b; Davidson, 2017;
Jones and Crow,2017). Are these effective at persuading people
and if so how do they work? What are the ethical questions
surrounding such activities and how does this affect researcher
identity? Should researchers be aiming to communicate simple
messages about which there is broad consensus?
Discussions of consensus often ask whether agreement is a
laudable aim for researchers, or how far consensus is achievable (De
Kerckhove et al.,2015; Lidskog and Sundqvist,2004; Rescher,1993).
We are also interested in the tension between scienti ﬁca n d
politician consensus, and how differences in interpretations of
knowledge can be leveraged to inﬂuence political consensus (Beem,
2012;M o n t a n a ,2017; Pearce et al.,2017). What tools can be used to
generate credibility? Is evidence persuasive of itself; can it survive
the translation process; and is it reasonable to expect individual
researchers to broadcast simple messages about which there is
broad consensus, if that is in tension with their own ethical practices
and knowledge (even if the most effective way to inﬂuence policy?
Is consensus required for the credibility of science and scientists, or
can am emphasis on similarity in fact reduce the value of research
and the esteem of the sector? Is it the task of scientists to surface
conﬂicts and disagreements, and how far does this duty extend into
the political sphere (Smith and Stewart,2017)?
Transforming decision-making, and the role of evidence within
it. Finally, we need to understand how research and researchers
can support decision-making given what we know about the
decision-making context or culture, and how this inﬂuences evi-
dence use (Lin,2008). This means better understanding the roles
of professional and local cultures of evidence use, governance
arrangements, and roles of public dialogues so that we can we start
to investigate empirically-informed strategies to increase impact
(Locock and Boaz,2004; Oliver et al.,2014). This would include
empirical examination of individual strategies to inﬂuence deci-
sion-making, as well as more institutional infrastructures and
roles; case studies of different types of policymaking and the
evidence diets consumed in these contexts; and how different
people embody different imperatives of the evidence/policy nexus.
We need to bring together examples of the policy and practice
lifecycles, and examine the roles of different types of evidence
throughout those processes (Boaz et al.,2011, 2016).
We want to know what shapes the credibility afforded to
different experts and forms of expertise, and how to cultivate
credibility to enable better decision-making (Grundmann,2017;
Jacobson and Goering, 2006; Mullen, 2016; Williams, 2018).
What does credibility enable (greater attention or in ﬂuence;
greater participation by researchers in policy processes; a more
diverse debate)? What is the purpose of increasing credibility?
What is the ultimate aim of attempting to become credible actors
in policy spaces? How far should universities and researchers go
— should we be always aiming for more inﬂuence? Or should we
recognise and explore the diversity of roles research and
researchers can play in decision-making spaces?
Ultimately, methods must be found to evaluate the impact of
evidence on policy and practice change, and on populations—
including unintended or unwanted consequences (Lorenc and
Oliver, 2013; Oliver et al.,2019, 2019a). Some have argued that
the primary role for researchers is to demonstrate the
consequences of decisions and to enable debate. This requires
the development and application of methods to evaluate changes,
understand mechanisms, and develop theory and substantive and
normative debates, as well as engage in the translation and
mobilisation of evidence. It also requires increased transparency
to enable researchers to understand evidence use (Nesta,2012),
while also allowing others like Sense about Science to check the
validity of evidence claims on behalf of the public (Sense about
Science, 2016).
Next steps and concrete outputs
These illustrative examples demonstrate the vast range of dis-
cussions which are happening, and need to happen to help us
transform how we produce and use evidence. We are not theﬁrst
to identify the problems of research wastage (Glasziou and
Chalmers, 2018) or to emphasise the need to maximise the value
of research for society (Duncan and Oliver,2017). Nor are we the
ﬁrst to note that all the parts of the research system play a role
achieving this, from funding (Geuna and Martin, 2003), to
research practices (Bishop, 2019; Fransman, 2018), to transla-
tional activities (Boaz et al.2019; Nutley and Tseng,2014), pro-
fessional science advice (Doubleday and Wilsdon, 2012) and
public and professional engagement (Holliman and Warren,
2017). There have been sustained attempts to build communities
and networks to attempt ways to improve parts of this system
1.
However, most of these initiatives are rooted in particular dis-
ciplines or professional activities. We see a need for a network
which bridges these initiatives, helping each other articulate their
key lessons for one another, and progressing our conversations
about how to do better research about evidence production
and use.
Researchers, funders, decision-makers and publics will
approach and inhabit this space from different, sometimes very
different directions. We do not claim to be writing the deﬁnitive
account. But we would like to open the door to more critical
accounts of evidence production and use which are speciﬁcally
aimed at multi-disciplinary and sectoral audiences. Our aim is to
welcome and support debate, to introduce parts of our diverse
community to each other, and to enable our individual perspec-
tives and knowledge to be more widely valued.
We anticipate disagreement and discussion, and support a
multitude of ways of approaching the issues we identify above.
Some may feel that our energies should be directed to demo-
cratising knowledge for all and ensuring that this is mobilised to
maximise equality and fairness (Stewart et al.,2018). Others may
feel that our task is to observe, problematise and critique these
processes, rather than engage in them directly (Fuller,1997). Our
view is that both normative and critical approaches are vital; as
are empirical and theoretical contributions to our understanding
of high-level research systems, down to micro-interactions in
evidence production and use. Our contention is that we must
keep this space vibrant and busy, producing new knowledge
together, and learning from each other. This requires investment
in research on evidence production and use, in virtual and literal
spaces to hold conversations, as well as in capacity and capability.
There are signiﬁcant and important gaps in what we know about
evidence production and use, but identifying the particular and
speciﬁc research agendas for each of these gaps must be a colla-
borative process.
We also see a need to support those who are new to this space.
Many come to the problem of evidence use without any training
in the history of research in this space. We see a need to provide

an accessible route into these debates, and welcome opportunities
to collaborate on textbooks or learning resources to support new
students, non-academics and those new to theﬁeld.
The Nufﬁeld Foundation meeting which led to this paper
demonstrated how valuable these opportunities are to enable
learning and relationship-building through face-to-face interac-
tions. We will continue to create opportunities for greater
transdisciplinary and academic-partner conversations, to share
learning across spheres of activity and to build capacity, and to
use these new perspectives to generate fresh avenues of enquiry,
through the new Transforming Evidence2 collaboration.
Finally, we argue for increased investment to maximise the
learning we already have, and to support more effective knowl-
edge production and use. Too much money and expertise has
been wasted, and too many opportunities to build on existing
expertise have been squandered. We must ﬁnd better ways to
make this learning accessible, and to identify true knowledge
gaps. Indeed, we believe that collaboration across disciplinary and
sectoral boundaries is the only way in which this space will both
progress and demonstrate its true value. We must prevent the
waste of limited resources to understand how to transform evi-
dence production and use for the beneﬁt of society. Putting what
we already know into practice would be an excellent place to start.
