Monitoring and Evaluation Reform 
under Changing Aid Modalities 
 
Seeking the Middle Ground

Abstract 
This paper grew out of our bewilderment with  the insouciance with which some in the donor 
community seem ready to abandon accounting for the use of aid. If one listens to the rhetoric 
surrounding the new approach to aid, one gets the impression that most of the crucial accounting 
tasks must be swiftly abandoned by donors and left to recipient governments. This paper does 
not question the underlying rationale for shifting towards recipient-led priority setting and 
control over implementation of aid resources, but  argues that donors cannot let themselves off 
the hook so easily with respect to the accountability part of the equation. We argue that in most 
low-income countries such trust in recipient systems may be dubbed as over-alignment, and that 
it is neither necessary nor useful. Our argument is however not that old style donor-managed 
monitoring and evaluation is the only or the best  solution. For we are equally puzzled by the 
stubbornness with which some other donors stick to  their old monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
in ways that contradict the new insights in  aid effectiveness and hamper the emergence of 
…/.

national M&E systems. Why are positions so pol arized and why is hardly anyone arguing in 
favour of intermediate positions? This is what this paper sets out to do: we argue against a 
radical and rapid implementation of the new rhetoric in low-income countries, but also against a 
continuation of present accountability practices. D onors have a large and lasting responsibility 
in accounting for the use of aid funds, both towards the taxpayers in donor countries and 
towards the targeted beneficiaries in the at best pseudo-democratic and poorly governed low-
income recipient countries. They should find ne w ways to remain firmly involved in M&E, 
ways that allow, at the same time, embryoni c national M&E systems in low-income recipient 
countries to grow and flourish.

Introduction 
The shift in aid modalities characterized by a move towards more programme-based 
approaches (PBAs),1 demands considerable behavioural  changes of both recipients and 
donors. In the era of poverty re duction strategy papers (PRSP) 2 and sector wide 
approaches (SWAPS), donors are moving away  from micro-management and full 
control over all stages of earmarked aid in terventions, towards arm-length control and 
supervision over recipient policies and impl ementation procedures. In practice, this 
involves more emphasis on policy dialogue; when possible full alignment with a 
recipient country’s national system of planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring 
and evaluation, and where this is not ‘yet ’ deemed ‘appropriate’, harmonization with 
other donors and minimizing para llel structures for aid deliv ery; and investment in 
recipient-driven capacity-build ing. It is expected that recipients elaborate sound 
policies; strengthen (results-oriented) institutions for pl anning, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation; and take leadership in the identification of weaknesses in 
policy and institutional apparatus and ela boration of plans for improvement and 
capacity-building.  
This paper focuses on the consequences in the area of mon itoring and evaluation 
(M&E). The salient features of the new approach—such as the decrease in donor 
earmarking, the increase in recipient re sponsibility for implementation, and the 
imposition by donors of a string of new pro cess conditionalities that constrain the 
latitude of the recipients in their use of ai d monies—all point to the need for a restyling 
and upgrading of M&E tasks. As explained in section 2, national M&E systems need be 
strengthened in their twin functions of accountability and lessons-learning, and likewise, 
the role of donors in M&E needs to be reca st. With time, as re cipient M&E systems 
become stronger, their output should be able to satisfy a major part of the accountability 
needs of donors, and this should provide a powerful impetus to wind down parallel 
donor M&E activities in a country. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the new appr oach to aid has such a well-recognized 
incidence on M&E, section 3 claims that until recently, M&E issues have not figured 
highly on the recipients’ reform agendas. Section 4 looks at progress on the donor side, 
and the picture that emerges is  not much better. Effective realizations on the ground in 
general have been disappointing. Scant atte ntion has been paid, for instance, by donors 
to M&E in assessing country -produced PRSP documents, which excel in ‘indicatorism’ 
                                                
 
1  The OECD-DAC (2005a: 37) document uses the no tion of ‘programme-based approaches’ to refer to 
‘a way of engaging in development cooperation based on the principles of co-ordinated support for a 
locally owned programme of development’. The approach includes four key elements: (i) leadership 
by the host country or organization; (ii) a single programme budget framework; (iii) donor 
coordination and harmonization of procedures; and (iv) efforts to increase the use of local procedures 
over time with regard to programme design and implementation, financial management, monitoring 
and evaluation. 
2  Literally the PRSP is a policy document that is pr oduced by the recipient country and replaces similar 
documents such as the policy framework paper that used to be imposed by the IMF and the World 
Bank on low-income aid-dependent countries for the purpose of adjustment lending. More 
fundamentally, it constitutes the linchpin of a new comprehensive aid approach that concentrates on 
four basic principles: (i) long-term and holistic vision,  (ii) country ownership, (iii) results orientation 
and (iv) country-led partnership. Nowadays, donors increasingly use the PRSP as the framework for 
their aid activities, accompanying the shift from projects to sectoral and general budget support.

and in general remain obscure regarding the overall M&E policy, its institutional 
translation or the roles and re sponsibilities of the various parties involved. In recent 
years, several surveys and i ndependent reviews have been conducted that confirm that 
progress towards results-orientation, and pa rticularly a reinforced M&E, has been 
disappointing. The World Bank’s 2004 PRSP eval uation study includes the results of a 
survey among almost 800 stakeholders in ten PRSP countries, which reveals that out of 
39 questions the one on M&E received the most negative response (World Bank 2004: 
66). In fact, to the question ‘An effective st ructure to monitor and evaluate results has 
been established’, 41 per cent of the respondents ‘disagreed’, or ‘disagreed completely’, 
whereas a further 21 per cent answered ‘don’t know or unsure’.  
If attention to the effective elaboration of recipient M&E systems has been meagre, the 
donor part of the reform agenda has not been squarely addressed. While one could argue 
that PRSP documents are not the primary s ource of information on donor behaviour, 
one would expect at least that the involve ment of donors in M&E activities would be 
acknowledged and the need for reforms explic itly addressed. Yet th is is not the case. 
Similarly, issues of harmonization and alignment are hardly touched upon, 
notwithstanding the fact  that the integration of pa rallel donor-driven project M&E 
systems is highly relevant for the elabor ation and strengtheni ng of national M&E. 
Surveys on donors’ harmonization and alignment have in the meantime confirmed that 
this silence is testimony to  the fact that not much is being done on the ground. Among 
others, the 2003 World Bank evaluation of the comprehensive development framework 
(CDF) highlights that M&E is one of the areas where donors have made least progress 
in harmonizing practices and where conseque ntly the burdens on recipient government 
are enormous (World Bank 2003a).  
Section 4 concludes that donors seem caught in a chicken-and-egg dilemma: most still 
overwhelmingly rely on their own institutional apparatus for aid delivery, are beginning 
to harmonize only slowly with other donors an d hardly align with national apparatus 
they rightly consider weak. However, adhere nce to one’s own parallel structures at the 
same time burdens national systems.  
Recently, international pressure for harm onization and alignment has moved these 
topics up on the agenda: th e 2003 Harmonization and Alignm ent (H&A) Conference in 
Rome; the Marrakech Memora ndum as well as the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness testify to this.
3 Conferences and peer pressure seem to pay off, swaying 
some of the laggards among aid agencies. Belgium, a small donor with which the 
authors have extensive personal experience, may well be illustrative of what is going on 
in some other agencies. Over a period of five years, the mood has moved from a 
stubborn unwillingness by a vast majority of staff to even discuss the negative effects of 
old type project aid, through to a period of almost ‘religious war’ among irreconcilable 
factions (the wording was suggested to one of the authors by a senior staff describing 
the mood in another small European donor agency going through a similar process) to 
the victorious adoption of a very simplisti c ‘alignment’ mantra by a growing number of 
leading aid officials, to the point of denying the considerable political, institutional and 
technical weaknesses of partner countries. As argued in section 4, this tendency may 
possibly grow stronger if future accountabi lity to parliament and public opinion would 
be reduced to showing how much effort is spent on adopting the new H&A agenda

rather than a thorough argumentation on how it will lead to sustainable poverty 
reduction on the ground.  
With the limitations of the old-style isolated project approach now widely accepted, and 
the importance of harmonization and ali gnment generally acknowledged, we see the 
danger of some donors going overboard on th e other side. Donor bureaucracies may 
well be tempted by a version of M&E alignmen t that is shortsighted and capable of 
undermining the new aid paradigm. The diabol izing of the project aid paradigm has 
partly been achieved by making a caricatur e of what are genui ne constraints and 
problems facing most of the recipient system s in low-income countries. This may well 
explain to some extent the donor’s neglect of recipients’ M&E systems. Alignment to 
embryonic, and in many respects dysfuncti onal, national M&E systems in low-income 
countries, believing that these will someho w live up to the complex demands set by 
programme-based approaches may eventu ally be as counterproductive as bypassing 
these arrangements and keep ing uncoordinated donor systems intact. Exemplary of the 
donor’s underestimation of the huge challenges  posed is the paucity of systematic 
diagnostic tools to assess recipient M&E systems. Such assessments should look at both 
supply- and demand-side components of M&E products, iden tify strengths and 
weaknesses, and assess alignment risks and wa ys of counterbalancing those risks in the 
short and long run. Recently, donors have been engaging timidly in fragmentary M&E 
assessments, but these are mainly limited towards data quality diagnosis. 4 This is in 
stark contrast with the diagnostic ‘bombard ment’ recipients suffered in the area of 
public expenditure management (PEM). 5 This imbalance leads to an undue focus on 
financial inputs, at the expens e of monitoring the overall ca usal chain and of evaluating 
cause-effect linkages, as well as to a bias in favour of expedient technical solutions that 
do not address the underlying institutional problems. All this, to our mind, is 
symptomatic of the lack of donor ambition a nd resolve in the field of M&E (see also 
Bamberger 1989, 2000; Picciotto 2003 and Wo rld Bank 2002). We do not mean to 
belittle the recent emphasis on poverty and monitoring of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDG), which shifts the attention from  inputs to the final outcomes/impact at the 
other extreme of the chain, or the growi ng donor engagement in poverty and social 
impact analysis (PSIA). But it is often done in a haphazard, disintegrated manner, and a 
coherent overall approach to M&E is mostly  lacking. We believe that several of the 
weaknesses currently identified with program me-based approaches can, in fact, be 
traced back to M&E

4  To assess statistical capacity and to engage in capacity-building, several (diagnostic) frameworks 
exist. Bedi et al. (2006) describe the data-qua lity assessment framework (DOAF), the general data 
dissemination system (GDDS), the guide to designing a national strategy for the development of 
statistics (NSDS) and the statistical capacity-build ing indicators (SCBI). The WB Country Statistical 
Information Database contains information for 143 developing countries on some of the above-
mentioned indicators and frameworks (see www.worldbank.org/data/countrydata/aboutcsidb.html and 
IMF-WB 2005). 
5  The 2004 SPA Budget Support Alignment Survey  indicated that public finance management (PFM) 
diagnostic exercises were an important area of uncoordinated donor revi ew that imposed large 
burdens on recipient countries. See for more details SPA (2004: 15-18). In order to cope with this the 
public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) initiative has been initiated.  
6  This is particularly true if you adopt an expa nded definition of M&E. Boyle, Lemairre and Rist. 
(1999: 4-5) refer in this respect to Rist (1990: 4-5) who notes that ‘the development of programme 
evaluation, both in terms of its methodologies as well as the kinds of questions it could address, has 
resulted in a clear expansion of what comes under  its umbrella. … But the most recent thinking

inconclusive reviews of nationa l or sector programme-based approaches, as well as the 
conclusion that in many countries an action- oriented approach is  lacking may all be 
linked to the absence of an underlying progr amme theory. As will be highlighted in 
section 5, applying the general insights from M&E theory can significantly contribute to 
understanding the observed weaknesses and point towards possible remedying 
interventions that would stimulate the im plementation of genuine programme-based 
approaches and add to their sustainability. 
Moving beyond the false dichotomy between  a principled handing over of M&E 
responsibilities to the recipi ent country without any compre hensive prior assessment of 
the capacity of national M&E systems to take on such tasks on the one hand, and a 
continuation of non-harmonized and non-a ligned donor M&E practices on the other 
hand, section 5 further proposes a pragmatic twin-track process approach to get out the 
present deadlock. Balancing between the need  to align as much as possible to the 
recipient’s M&E while filling existing M&E gaps and satisfying accountability needs 
towards citizens both in donor and recipient countries, we suggest an approach that 
focuses on strengthening both the demand and supply sides of recipient M&E, 
combined with complementary donor-steered M&E.  
2 The M&E reform agenda 
Programme-based approaches, compared to traditional projects, reduce the level of 
earmarking and intentionally blend donor resour ces with those of th e recipient. This 
leaves recipients more in charge, and thei r responsibility in im plementing policies is 
thereby enhanced. Donors, through proce ss conditionalities, request a convincing 
national planning-budgeting-implementation cy cle in return. They however do not 
believe in the top-down, blueprint planning that was practiced in the 1960s and 1970s in 
many low-income countries. Instead, they push for a policy cycle that relies on 
continued feedback from monitoring and eval uating progress. In doing so, they have 
also their own accountability needs in mind. Th ey are fully aware that the final results 
that will hopefully validate their trust in recipient governments can only be gauged 
through proper evaluation, and that much of the data for this can  only be provided by 
recipients. A well-functioning national M&E system that devotes considerable attention 
to the twin functions of feedback (lesson learning) and accountability is thus a linchpin 
of the new aid paradigm. That is why M& E should be high on donors’ and recipients’ 
lists of priorities. Conversely, without convincing recipient M&E, the willingness of the 
more reluctant donors to fully embrace the ne w approach will remain in doubt, as they 
will not be able to assess how their aid resources are being handled in the long lead time 
between the transfer of aid resources and outcomes/impact, and as it will be impossible 
to establish ex post what the impact has been of their aid, or why eventually things went 
wrong.  
                                                                                                                                              
 
suggests that programme evaluation can encompass the various st ages of life cycles of a programme 
or policy—from conception through execution through impact’. 
7 Recently, this been acknowledged in the IMF-WB 2005 PRSP evaluatio n study that stresses the need 
for making M&E a central issue in PRSP as this may lead to more action-oriented PRSP.
<<<PAGE=7>>>

The construction of a convincing PRSP as a prior condition that low-income countries 
must meet before they receive enhanced HIPC  debt relief/budget support illustrates this 
donor concern. Significantly, this  conditionality also illu strates the rediscovery by 
donors of the importance of good macro planning. What donors have in mind when they 
think about a good PRSP—and they make sure that this is cl early spelled out to partner 
countries—is a policy cycle approach towa rds poverty reduction whereby diagnosis, 
priority and strategy selection, resour ce allocation and budgeting, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation are all logically linked. A lot of emphasis is put, for instance, 
on ‘diagnosis’ as the basis for selection of priorities and on the ground this has led to an 
effective upsurge in data collection, es pecially on poverty. Throughout every PRSP 
cycle, lasting typically 3-4 y ears, and even more so when moving from one PRSP to a 
new one, priorities and strategies are expected to be adjusted on the basis of information 
from monitoring and evaluation. At the same  time, and with the same M&E effort, 
accounting needs must be addressed, both with in the recipient country, and towards the 
donor community. This explains the importan ce of the yearly a nnual progress report 
(APR), whose objective is to summari ze progress on target s identified, analyse 
underlying reasons for lack of achievement, and adjust targets where deemed necessary.  
One of the major principles of new aid instruments is to shift attention away from inputs 
to results (defined in terms of outcomes a nd impact) and to the link between the two. If 
resource allocation and planning are to be done increasingly on the basis of results 
generated, then one needs information about results and how they derive from, or fail to 
derive from, inputs. Results-based manage ment (RBM) thus generates a demand for 
M&E. In order to ensure the reliability of data and their analysis, M&E services must be 
sufficiently autonomous from those that are responsible for implementation.  
Programme-based approaches, and the PRSP which serves as an overall framework, 
also foster participation of a broad range of  stakeholders at the macro-level, basically 
because this is what donors want. The idea is that non-state stakeholders, and in 
particular those that directly represent be neficiaries and users of  public services, can 
play key roles in producing ‘independent ’ assessments of the implementation and 
impact of service delivery and policy processe s. As local organizations and associations 
they have ‘grassroots’ contacts and are th erefore well placed to channel and represent 
the voices of the beneficiaries, and to supply information for the M&E system. The 
implicit assumption is that such civil societ y actors are sufficiently ‘representative’ and 
sufficiently close to the poor to act on thei r behalf. These non-state actors will exert 
pressure for better and timely information, and strengthen the demand side of M&E.  
That most donors now recognize that traditio nal project aid is an inappropriate aid 
delivery mechanism to aid-dependent countri es has also influen ced the M&E reform 
agenda. Several studies (see e.g., Eriksson 2001)  have highlighted the havoc caused by 
donors imposing their separate and uncoordina ted rules for aid management, and how 
this has severely undermined the inst itutional capacity of the aid-dependent 
governments to plan, budget and implement their own development. Concerted aid to 
government, respecting the latter’s own po licy priorities, using national budgeting and 
allocation mechanisms, national implementation, supervision and control systems is the 
answer of the new approach to aid. In the field of M&E this  means winding down 
parallel donor systems and replacing these by national M&E systems, whose 
reorganization and strengthening are the focus of yet another set of process 
conditionalities.

In practice, the reform agenda, including th e one in M&E, has been shaped through 
various international conferences and related documents, such as the First International 
Roundtable on Managing for Results (2002); the Second Internati onal Roundtable on 
Managing for Results (2004), 8 the Marrakech Memorandum (featuring five core 
principles); the Paris Harm onization, Alignment and Results High Level Forum (2005: 
see the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiv eness including twelve indicators for 
monitoring the donor and recipient reform agendas).  
In summary, the expectations are that: 
partner countries endeavour to esta blish results-oriented reporting and 
assessment frameworks that monitor pr ogress against key dimensions of the 
national and sector development strate gies and that these frameworks should 
track a manageable number of indicator s for which data are cost-effectively 
available (Paris Declaration: indicator 11).  
Additionally, partner countries should: 
reinforce participatory approaches by systematically involving a broad range of 
development partners when formul ating and assessing progress in 
implementing national development strategies (Paris Declaration: 9).  
It is expected that donors ‘work with partner countries to rely, as far as possible, on 
partner countries’ results-oriented reporting and monitoring frameworks’ and that they: 
harmonize their monitoring and reporting requirements, and, until they can rely 
more extensively on partner countries’ statistical, monitoring and evaluation 
systems, [work] with partner countries to the maximum extent possible on joint 
formats for periodic reporting (ibid.: 8).  
From both partners it is expected that they ‘work together in a participatory approach to 
strengthen country capacities and demand for results based management’ (ibid.: 8). 
The DAC guidelines (OECD-DAC 2003) make the M&E reform agendas of the donors 
operational by identifying good-practice indicators for reporting and monitoring, broken 
down according to the following five guiding principles: relying and building on 
country systems; coordinati ng reporting and monitoring sy stems; simplifying reporting 
and monitoring systems; making information more transparent; and rationalizing review 
missions. 
3 Limited and unequal progress on the recipient side 
If the M&E reform agenda is so crucial for the success and sustainability of the new aid 
paradigm, what can we learn from the act ual practice in recipient countries? The

analysis in this section 9 draws on a review of academic literature and practitioners’ 
documents10 as well as our own mid-2004 desk study assessing on the basis of PRSP 
and APR the quality of recipient M&E systems in eleven Sub-Saharan Africa 
countries.11 We also draw on the insights from our own fieldwork, with respect in 
particular to a field study in Ethiopia in July 2005 which completely focused on this 
issue. In general, we were puzzled by the relative lack of attention to M&E issues, both 
in country-produced PRSP documents a nd in joint staff assessments (JSA) 12 by IMF 
and WB staffs. For instance, most of th e time, JSA made only a few bland general 
comments, of the variety: ‘some progress has been made but much remains to be done’.  
In what follows we will structure our di scussion along the following headings: policy, 
institutional and organizational issues; me thodology; participati on of non-state actors 
and quality and capacity.  
3.1 Policy, institutional and organizational issues  
Independent reviews (see footnote 10 for an  overview) as well as our own desk study 
underscore that there is a very fragmentary approach towards M&E, and that the focus 
is overwhelmingly on technical and methodol ogical issues, to th e detriment of the 
overall policy and the institutional and orga nizational set-up. Of the eleven countries 
reviewed in the desk study, most had some elements of an M&E plan, heavily skewed 
towards data collection issues, but hardly  any country had a comprehensive ‘grand 
design’ or provided details about the overarching institutional structure.  
One of the most glaring weaknesses in  the M&E policy and design of recipient 
countries is the ‘conflation’ of monitoring a nd evaluation. The fact that they are often 
referred to as twin concepts is fine, but not  when both functions are confused with each 
                                                 
9  We would like to stress that the results of the analysis hold only for low-in come recipient countries, 
and in particular for the eleven SSA countries of our own desk study (see footnote 11). While some of 
the weaknesses (such as the defective linkage among M&E, budgeting and policy-making) pointed at 
in the analysis also hold for middle (and even high)-income countries, M&E systems of the latter are 
in many cases much more advanced. See, for instance May et al. (2006) for an overview of M&E 
systems in Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Peru as well as several country studies on the website 
of the Evaluation Capacity Development group within the Independent Evaluation Group (see 
www.worldbank.org/ieg.ecd). 
10  See, among others, Bedi et al. (2006); Booth and Lucas (2002); Evans and Ngalwea (2001); Evans 
and van Diesen (2002); GTZ/BMZ (2004); Hauge (2001, 2003); IMF and IDA (2003); IMF (2004); 
IMF and World Bank (2005); Lucas et al. (2004); Prennushi, Rubio and Subbarao (2003); McGee and 
Norton (2000); ODI (2003); Robb (1999); World Bank (2003a, 2003b, 2004, 2005). 
11  The desk study assesses the quality of PRSP M&E systems in eleven SSA countries: Burkina Faso, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. The 
elaborated assessment framework (in the Appendix) captures issues of policy, methodology, 
organization, capacity, participation and quality. See Holvoet and Renard (2005, 2007) for a more 
detailed discussion of the methodology and the findings. 
12  JSAs are prepared by IMF and WB staff member s and are submitted together  with a country’s PRSP 
to the Board of Directors. Initially, the JSAs had both a feedback and a signalling function: it 
highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of a country’s PRSP and how it might be improved while it 
also indicated whether the PRSP was a sound basis for concessional assistance from the WB and the 
IMF. Since late 2004 the signalling function has been dropped and JSAs have been renamed as joint

other, or one is subsumed in the other. Frequently the impression given is that 
monitoring somehow also constitutes evaluation. Evaluation, if mentioned as a separate 
issue at all, seems almost an afterthought . We acknowledge that in iterative planning, 
monitoring is of the utmost im portance, and even that more energy is devoted to it than 
to evaluation, but there remains a persistent n eed for the latter. One of the consequences 
of this leaning towards monitoring at the expense of evaluation is that the focus is much 
more on pure stocktaking of performance (‘were the targets met?’) than on probing into 
underlying reasons for (non)performance (‘w hy were the targets not met?’) or on 
questioning the relevance and usefulness of so me of the targets themselves and/or of 
specific interventions designed to arrive at them. Particularly neglected is the role 
‘programme theory evaluation’ or ‘theory-based evaluation’ could play in the numerous 
cases where the causal chain behind an interv ention is seemingly abse nt or at least not 
made explicit in the PRSP documents. Extractin g, on the basis of relevant stakeholders’ 
views, the underlying programme theory  may help identifying the causes for 
(non)performance, differentiating between failures in implementation and underlying 
programme theory (on this, see, e.g., Kuse k and Rist 2004; Rossi, Freeman and Lipsey 
2004). Given that the role of evaluation theo ry is downplayed to such an extent, it 
comes as no surprise that annual progres s and sectoral progres s reports, the most 
important outputs of national and sectoral M&E systems, are often sloppy at best. In our 
view, donors have a major responsibility in  this neglect of evaluation. They are 
generally more concerned with performan ce management and input monitoring than 
with higher-order policy-relevant questions. We find some support for our view in the 
2002 Annual Report on Evaluation Capacity Development: ‘PRSPs and Bank/Fund JSA 
often use the term M&E as shorthand for financial tracking and national development 
indicators. And the recent Bank/Fund review of the PRSP approach also interpreted 
M&E as being synonymous with monitoring’ (World Bank 2002: 20).  
The neglect of evaluation also implies that there is hardly any attention to the linkages 
between monitoring and evaluation. The disint egrated way in which PSIA is currently 
dealt with is an illustration. While one may applaud the increasing appeal of PSIA, it is 
usually conceived outside the national M&E system, mostly performed by donors, with 
hardly any participation of national stakehol ders. Information from national monitoring 
does not seem to feed into PSIA, neither are there guarantees that information from 
PSIA feeds into policymaking.  
Somewhat related to this is the absence of  a thorough discussion in national M&E plans 
of the different functions of  M&E and basic guiding principl es, and in particular the 
possible trade-offs among these. In fact, hardly any document indicates how M&E will 
fulfil both its basic but potenti ally conflicting functions of accountability and feedback 
and how related principles of impartiality, independence and utility will be guaranteed. 
Institutional arrangements do not seem to be driven by these questions of how to keep a 
balance between such functions and needs. For instance, it is quite difficult to get a clear 
perception of how independent M&E units, at either national or sector level, are from 
senior management and government minist ers. Admittedly, learning, feedback and 
integration of M&E findings into management  and policy call for close linkages and by 
the same token militate against too much independence of M&E. But on the other hand, 
the accountability function cries out for suffi cient independence. What is worrisome is 
that such trade-offs between independence and feedback are not explicitly addressed. 
Issues of independence and cred ibility of M&E are sensitive issues in all countries, and 
particularly so in low-income recipient c ountries that have almost no tradition in 
transparency in public affairs. Independe nt M&E may disclose not only positive news,
<<<PAGE=11>>>
9 
but also negative findings and in particular unveil politically sensitive information about 
corruption, economic rent-seeking by the polit ical elite, poor management by senior 
political appointees, etcetera. Most of the PRSP also remain remarkably vague about the 
location of the oversight function in M&E. In a similar vein, Bamberger (1991), in a 
case study of national M&E systems in South Asia, discovers that because of severe 
competition among various central ministries over the  control of M&E, no institutional 
arrangement remained in place for longer than three years. The major reason for the 
constant changes was the fact that the agenci es in charge of M&E were perceived to be 
becoming far too powerful and threatening.  
What is also striking is the lack of clarity  about roles and respons ibilities of the actors 
involved in data collection, an alysis and feedback, includin g statistical agencies, line 
ministries, decentralized levels and central  ministries. In most countries, sector 
monitoring systems existed before the PRSP, and in a lot of cases they have been 
strengthened in the context of SWAPs. While one could logically conceive these 
sectoral systems as importan t pillars of a national coordi nated M&E system, obscurity 
surrounding roles and responsibilities, and the absence of even rudimentary 
coordination and alignment mechanisms can easily lead to institutional competition and 
to dysfunction. In fact, one may consider th e balance between independence and quality 
of sectoral and decentralized programmes and M&E on the one hand and their degree of 
integration with the national level crucial i ssues for the sustainability of the new aid 
paradigm. Obviously, moving towards resu lts-based management and budgeting can 
only work where there is a minimal degree of  horizontal and vertic al integration. This 
involves line ministries and decen tralized levels that supply central ministries with the 
necessary information on intermediate and fi nal outcomes, and central ministries that 
provide line ministries and decentralized le vels with realistic projections on future 
budgets. At the same time, however, too much  focus on integration and centralization 
may put undue stress on sectoral and decentral ized M&E systems if it means that they 
are forced to emphasize functions of account ability and feedback towards the central 
level to the detriment of fee dback and management at sectoral and decentralized levels 
themselves (see also Valadez and Bamberger 1994).  
3.2 Methodology  
Methodological issues in general and ‘targe ts and indicators’ in  particular receive 
considerable attention in PRSP, APR and, not surprisingly, also in independent reviews. 
While there are differences in quality and coverage, in our own case study of eleven 
countries, elaborate lists of indicators and targets were produced everywhere. Even 
more encouragingly, in countries that alr eady produced more than one APR, lists get 
more refined from progress report to pr ogress report. PRSP has obviously led to an 
upsurge in data collection, especially on poverty, and to a renewed interest in household 
surveys. The growing attention to qualitative,  difficult-to-measure issues has also given 
a new impetus to methodological approaches  seeking to combine qualitative and 
quantitative methodologies, while participator y techniques are incr easingly propagated 
to make the conclusions more informed by the poor.  
Booth and Lucas (2002) make the important point  that, in setting indicators and targets, 
there is a strong tendency to emphasize the tw o extremes of the lo gic chain, inputs and 
final poverty outcomes, leaving a ‘missing middle’ in between. This constitutes a 
serious criticism with far-reaching implica tions for the quality of programmes and
<<<PAGE=12>>>
10 
M&E. The fact that different levels of indicators mentioned in PRSP or sectoral 
programmes are often not integrated into one causal chain similarly illustrates the 
absence of an underlying programme theor y. Programme theory or logic models, 
including a process and impact theory, are powerful tools in conceptualizing 
interventions, monitoring and evaluation. No t surprisingly, if no prior theory can be 
referred to that makes clear which actions were expected to produce which results and 
why, it becomes extremely difficult at the time of reporting to make much sense of the 
findings generated (see also GTZ-BMZ 2004).  
3.3 Participation of non-state actors  
The overall impression from independent reviews (see, e.g., World Bank 2003b; McGee 
and Norton 2000; Robb 1999) is that in many countries civil society actors (CSOs) have 
been involved in participatory poverty assess ments at the moment of preparing PRSP, 
but much less during subsequent phases of  implementation, monitoring and evaluation. 
Generally, participation of CSOs  is conceived of as instrumental, as a way of gathering 
data and insights, but within a process that  is strongly government controlled. There is 
not much discussion in PRSP about the role that CSOs could play as an independent 
source of supply of M&E, nor about their capacity as actors on the M&E demand side, 
and this despite the participation rhetoric of the new aid paradigm. This holds even 
more for other  actors outside the executive branch of government, such as parliament, 
the auditor general’s office, universities, inde pendent research inst itutes or national 
evaluation societies. While the importance of an independent general auditor’s office is 
often stressed with respect to financial auditing, the role  this office could play in 
performance auditing goes largely unnoticed. A similar observation can be made with 
respect to universities and research institutes who can add value in terms of independent 
and high quality data collectio n and particularly analysis. 13 Some tepid progress is 
being made, but, ominously, the genuinely in dependent non-state actors that do get 
invited to play a role in M&E often pay for it by having their autonomy curtailed.   
3.4 Quality and capacity  
A good way to test for quality is to assess the annual progress and performance reports 
shared with donors, arguably the most tangible outputs of  the national M&E systems. 
The superficiality of APR, particularly in term s of analytical depth, is one of the issues 
donors seem to agree on. APR do manage to fill in some of the gaps in baseline data 
that existed at the time the PRSP was firs t produced, and, in some cases, register 
changes in actual performance with baseline data, but only in exceptional cases is there 
an analysis of the reasons for non-achievement. While donors seem to have been taken  
by surprise by the sloppy quality of APR, even  a superficial prior diagnosis should have 
alerted them to the problems that presaged  such poor reporting: absence of programme 
theory, strong focus on monitoring to th e detriment of evaluation, vaguely defined 
overall M&E design and unclear coordinati on among different actor s of the system. 
Unpromisingly, current assessments of M&E capacity constraints and remedial action 
plans, both by recipient countries and donors, overwhelmingly focus on human and 
                                                 
13  Bamberger (1991) similarly notes that, given the capacities national research institutes and 
universities often have, it is surprising that they are so little involved in national M&E activities.

financial resources and technical issues, to the detriment of the broader institutional and 
policy-related issues.  
4 The donor reform agenda that isn’t 
The hugely expanded role of recipient M&E systems under the new aid approach, even 
if insufficiently acknowledged in PRSP documents and the literature, is plain to anyone 
taking a closer look at the literature on new aid modalities. The future role for donors in 
M&E is, however, less clearly articulated, and some sensitive issues are not being 
addressed as frankly as their importance would warrant . Notwithstanding the fact that 
donors are setting the agenda for whatever M& E reforms are taking place in the public 
sector, PRSPs and APRs are fairly silent on the precise  role donors ar e supposed to 
play. Similarly, even if donors probably spe nd more resources and energy in parallel 
M&E exercises than the government is able or willing to spend on national M&E, little 
reference is made to how such donor M&E outputs feed into the national effort. There is 
a major issue of ownership, or rather, l ack of ownership, surrounding M&E. Donors see 
reform in this area clearly as an important corollary to their reduced micro-management 
of aid resources, and they do not hesitate to impose process conditionalities to this 
effect, even if sometimes in an haphazard fashion. At the same time, some are obviously 
uncomfortable with abandoning their own parallel M&E activities. Recipient 
governments on the other hand probably most ly lack a serious commitment to reform 
their M&E systems. They do what is expected of them, reluctantly, but they are seldom 
proactive, and do not correct for donor biases . An indirect proof of donor’s setting of 
the reform agenda, and doing so badly, is  the marked parallelism between the 
fragmentary approach they themselves adopt  and similarly unbalanced development of 
recipient systems. In fact, donors’ empha ses on monitoring inputs (PEM), recently 
combined with a focus on monitoring final poverty outcomes and MDGs, as well as 
their general preference for da ta collection and quality, are all echoed in the particular 
pace and scope of recipient M&E systems reform.
14  
Findings summarized in the OECD-DAC harm onization and alignment survey (2005b) 
suggest that not much has happened on the ground. In fact, by the end of 2004, on 
average 30 per cent of the donor project port folio was managed by national procedures. 
Desaggregation over different phases of the project cycle reveals some differences: 
donors seem to trust national systems slightly  more when it comes to procurement (34 
per cent) and are more distrustful of reci pient’s M&E and financial audit (both 28 per 
cent). Larger differences were noted among  individual donors and in donor assessments 
of different partner countries. Similar di fferences among donors may be observed when 
it comes to engagement in new aid instruments. Donor enthusiasm for general or sector 
budget support and related handing over of resp onsibility for M&E to recipients remain 
very uneven: some, like Japan, France and the US have remained sceptical while others, 
the like-minded ‘progressive’ donors, including UK, the Nordics and the Netherlands, 
are wary of parallel donor M&E and trust as much as possible the recipient’s M&E. The 
World Bank and the EC are also major supporters of the new aid instruments.  
                                                
 
14  Interestingly, in its assessment of the actual state of M&E recipients’ systems on the ground, the 2005 
CDF evaluation contrasts improvements in sub-components as statistical data capacity with those in 
developing ‘coordinated’ monitoring systems (World Bank 2005).
<<<PAGE=14>>>
12 
For their accountability needs towards their own constituencies, budget support donors 
increasingly rely on the out puts, APR or sector report s now routinely produced by 
recipient M&E systems. This is partly a matter of principle. It may indeed be an act of 
good donorship on their part to give national sy stems time to develop, and to base their 
assessment more on the progress being made than on the objective quality of present 
monitoring and evaluation outputs. But on the other hand, they do not have much choice 
in this respect. These donors just cannot affo rd to be too openly critical of the overall 
quality of the national M&E systems that constitute a growing source for their own 
reporting without by the same token undermini ng the credibility of the latter. When 
selecting indicators for reporti ng, they are in a fairly comfortable position as they can 
stick to policy matrices they themselves had a considerable hand in negotiating. The 
budget support donors are, for obvious reasons,  the most influential in setting the 
process conditionalities for national M&E reform. They tend to put most emphasis on 
the quality of financial reporting and on the generation of statistical data. However, after 
several annual rounds of APRs, donors are for ced to face the fact that the analytical 
quality is often unacceptably low. The 2005 SPA Budget Support Alignment Survey  
(p. 51) has indicated, for instance, that about 71 per cent of the budget support donors 
consider APR unsatisfactory for their own reporting (accountability) needs.  
Obviously, donors and recipient reform agenda s are not independent  of each other and 
the donors, as drivers of the reforms, are ca ught in a chicken-egg dilemma: as long as a 
minimum institutional capacity in terms of design, implementation and evaluation 
apparatus is not installed a nd functioning in a partner c ountry, the move towards new 
aid instruments which shifts more responsibilit ies to the recipient, tends to be resisted 
by the more traditional donors, whose reluct ance to embrace the new aid approach may 
be due to the fact that they face tougher th an average accountability questions at home, 
or simply because of bureaucratic or politic al inertia. Whatever the reason may be, the 
reluctance to abandon parallel  donor M&E systems is a part  of the problem in that it 
draws attention and resources away from th e institutional strengthening of recipient 
systems. Up to this moment in time, nobody has come up with a satisfactory solution 
that takes into account the differentiated donor attitudes towards the new approach to 
aid.  
One of the issues that is not fully addre ssed in this respect is the question whether 
harmonization and alignment should be pushed as  far in the field of M&E as in other 
fields. Handing over responsibility for the use of aid resources to the recipient, provided 
that a number of prior conditions are met and provided that certain process 
conditionalities are respected, is an approach that is di fficult to fault in theory. Handing 
over the responsibility for providing the data and analysis that ju stify the use of the 
same resources to the same recipient is much less evident, and seems to violate the 
principle of independence. Recipients will always have a considerable interest to be less 
than frank in their assessments, to hide data that would reveal misuse of funds or lack of 
progress in achieving the results that were agreed upon, etcete ra. Recipients thus have a 
strong vested interest in not  setting up a transparent and competent, independent M&E 
system. The Paris Declaration is fairly naïve in this respect, when it repeatedly says 
‘until donors can rely’. This, in fact, suggests that donor-controlled M&E may be just a 
temporary inconvenience, an infringeme nt of the harmonization and alignment 
principles that should be corrected as soon as possible. If one agrees that donors and 
recipient governments do not have identical agendas and interests, the donors have no 
other option but to insist on strong and inde pendent monitoring and evaluation of their 
aid resources. National M&E systems are intrinsically unsuited for this task.
<<<PAGE=15>>>
13 
5 Which way forward?  
5.1 Flying (too) high  
The new approach to aid is very ambitious an d it will take consider able time before it 
yields substantial results. This creates genuine problems for donors whose time horizons 
—or more precisely, those of their constituents —are much shorter. Confronted with the 
tension between the harmonization and alignm ent agenda they have endorsed, and the 
need to account to their own parliament , public opinion, or executive boards, donor 
reactions may lean in one or the other direction, but few find a middle ground. One 
attitude is for the donor to stick to its ow n parallel M&E system. The other is for the 
donor to become excessively lenient in assessing  recipients and to see something that is 
in fact not there: a decent recipient M&E system in the making, just about to perform 
the functions of feedback and accountability in  an adequate fashion and starting to live 
up to minimum international standards so as to also fulfil the accountability needs of 
donors. Donors leaning on the side of harm onization and alignment and wanting to 
‘give recipient M&E a fair try’ may decide to take the interpretation of their own 
accountability just one step fu rther. The new aid paradigm, with its preference for the 
pooling of donor resources and th eir blending with the recipien ts’ own fiscal resources, 
to be spent using recipient priorities a nd implementation systems, away from donor 
earmarking and micromanaging, already forced  them to water down the definition of 
individual donor accountability. In fact, programme-based approaches make it 
increasingly difficult, if not  impossible, to ‘assign’ fi nal development impact to 
individual donor contributions, and the logical alternative is to replace it by joint donor 
accountability for results. Going just one step  further, the donor may decide that he 
himself should not be assessed on final resu lts—which are mainly the responsibility of 
the recipient anyway—but rather on the basis of his ‘organizational effectiveness’ in 
applying the principles of good donorship. While there is  not yet a standardized 
definition for ‘organizational effectiveness’, some agencies have made efforts to render 
the concept more concrete (see e.g., Lehtin en 2002). Suggestions include looking at 
internal policies, strategies, processes, relations to partne rs, resource use and adaptive 
capability. So far, there has not been much independent research on this and not many 
efforts have been invested in identifying cr iteria or targets, except for harmonization 
and alignment. The Paris Declaration includes ‘harmonization and alignment’ as criteria 
for a donor’s aid effectiveness. This suggest s that a ‘donor’s accountability towards its 
own constituencies’ could be defined in terms of a donor’s realization of ‘harmonization 
and alignment’.  
The same logic is used to exercise pressu re on other donors who take the other path and 
stick to their own M&E, donors who presumab ly also insist on a higher degree of 
earmarking and who insist on being more closely involve d in implementation. Some 
studies (see, e.g., de Renzio et al. 2005) pr opose incentives to en tice such reluctant 
donor agencies to implement the harmonizatio n and alignment agenda, including peer 
control and stigmatization. The DAC Worki ng Party on Aid Effectiveness has been 
urged to provide guidance on definitions an d define criteria. Looking at earlier 
harmonization and alignment surveys, one ma y think about easy-to-grasp quantitative 
indicators including ‘number of donors missi ons done jointly’, ‘number of diagnostic 
reviews done jointly’, … . While one may applaud tendencies to make vague concepts 
operational, and monitor and assess a donor’s performance, the way in which this is 
done is of critical importance. The point we wish to make is that there is, in our opinion, 
insufficient evidence to believe that more harmonization and alignment will produce the
<<<PAGE=16>>>
14 
sought after beneficial effects in terms of  poverty reduction. Until there is better 
evidence about the underlying explicit and implicit assumptions of the new paradigm, 
donors should probably err on the conservative side, and regard harmonization and 
alignment as the best available but, as yet,  unproven means towards an end, rather than 
as an operational objective by which their effectiveness can be measured.  
It is indeed important that donors address the reform agenda  squarely, and that they do 
so in a concerted manner, but they should al so accept that in the manner of M&E there 
can be too much alignment. There are too many glaring deficiencies at both the supply 
and demand side of national M&E that wi ll not go away by putting the government in 
charge and by the occasiona l methodological and technica l prodding, or by haphazard 
process conditionalities that  fail to address the fundame ntal weaknesses. In the 
following section, we propose that donors ad opt a more hands-on approach towards 
recipient’s M&E, and get activ ely involved in the developmen t of the so-far neglected 
components of the M&E system. This, we believ e, will help realizi ng both functions of 
accountability and learning and benefit all stakeholders involved. Importantly, we argue 
that such an approach is not contradictory to the elaboration of programme-based 
approaches or the new aid paradigm, including alignment, on the contrary.   
5.2 Seeking the middle ground  
In what follows we propose a pragmatic pr ocess approach that seeks a middle position 
in the current debate among opposing donor  camps. Between over-alignment on a 
recipient’s M&E system that has not even been properly diagnosed on the one hand and 
a multitude of donor-driven parallel systems that ignore the need for institutional 
strengthening of national systems on the other hand, there is space for fruitful 
intermediate solutions.  
The approach proposed here starts from  the same preoccupation as the new aid 
paradigm: that the institutional capacity of  low-income recipient countries, and in 
particular their M&E system s, have been undermined by uncoordinated and parallel 
donor-imposed rules and arrangements. Only by using the recipient ‘systems’, no matter 
their actual state, can they improve. Howeve r, given the present weaknesses on several 
fronts, including deep-rooted policy and instit utional aspects, we believe that it is 
unrealistic and naïve to surmise that a co mbination of spontaneous dynamics from 
within and appropriate proce ss conditionalities from outside will be enough to generate 
these improvements within a reasonable sp ace of time (see also Booth 2005). We also 
feel, as argued before, that donors cannot es cape their own responsibility of closely 
supervising national data generation and analysis. We propose a dual-track process 
approach emphasizing the effective build ing and strengthening of both supply and 
demand sides of recipient M&E systems th rough coordinated and holistic diagnosis, 
capacity-building, independent follow-up an d process conditionality, coupled with 
complementary donor-managed M&E that, in stead of duplicating national efforts, 
strives at bridging existing gaps in the national M&E system. Complementary M&E 
will obviously be driven by external acto rs, and should exclude those departments 
within donor agencies that are too closely involved from the M&E tasks which would 
require independent assessment. Importan tly, the complementary M&E should be 
conceived and implemented in such a way th at it simultaneously serves existing actual 
M&E needs as well as capacity-building of na tional demand- and/or supply-side actors. 
The latter may be reali zed by involving to the ma ximum degree possible—and
<<<PAGE=17>>>
15 
depending on the particular M&E functi on one wants to emphasize—demand- and 
supply-side actors in a learning-by-doing exerci se. Additionally, there is an urgent need 
to focus on in-depth evaluations of the new ai d paradigm itself. Particularly useful will 
be coordinated (joint) donor undertakings th at do not necessarily result in unified 
responses, but that are nonetheless in line with the narrow definition of 
‘harmonization’.15  
5.3 Focus on the recipient’s system: diagnosis and capacity building  
The starting point of the first track is a di agnosis of the actual state of a recipient’s 
M&E supply and demand. This diagnosis, identifying strengths and weaknesses, should 
preferably be done by a team consis ting of independent M&E experts and 
representatives of al l stakeholders involved, incl uding donors, government and non-
government actors. It serves multiple purposes:  
i) it guides donors in  applying the Addis Ababa principle
16 by assessing the 
degree to which a recipient’s M&E system can satisfy their own accountability 
needs and determine what complementary M&E if any is needed (see track 2);  
ii) it lays the basis for a coherent approach to capacity-building; and  
iii) it forms the basis for realistic targets to strengthen individual M&E demand 
and supply components, and for periodi c independent assessments within a 
framework of process conditionality.  
In order to avoid past mistakes with PEM diagnostic ‘bombardments’, a multiple 
stakeholder-coordinated approach, similar to the PEFA-initiative, 17 should be favoured. 
It is worth emphasizing that a shared diagnos is need not necessari ly trigger identical 
donor responses. The degree to which a r ecipient’s M&E will be considered 
satisfactory, for instance, will depend not only on the intrinsic quality of its supply and 
demand side, but also on the donor’s accountability needs towards its own 
constituencies, which in turn depend on the accountability approach adopted in different 
donor country or agency settings. This has implications for the degree and form of 
complementary M&E different donors will find  necessary and appropriate. Different 
donors need not set identical targets, as long as targets are not contradictory.  
                                                
 
15  With ‘harmonization’ is meant that donors increasingly coordinate and streamline their activities as to 
reduce the high transaction costs their own aid procedures inflict upon recipient governments. The 
OECD/DAC (2005) includes (i) establishing common arrangements, (ii) simplifying procedures and 
(iii) sharing of information. de Renzio (2005: 3) in dicates that the concept of ‘harmonization’ is often 
used in a broader sense to encompass both harmonization in the narrow sense as well as alignment and 
ownership. 
16  The Addis Ababa principle fav ours the use of government systems whenever possible. It reads as 
follows: ‘all donor assistance should be deliver ed through government systems unless there are 
compelling reasons to the contrary; where this is  not possible, any alternative mechanisms or 
safeguards must be time-limited, and develop and build, rather than undermine or bypass, government 
systems’ (SPA 2001: 2). 
17  The PEFA programme aims at strengthening recipient and donor ability to (i) diagnose the quality of 
country public expenditure, procurement and financ ial accountability systems and to (ii) develop a 
practical sequence of reform and capacity-building actions. See www.pefa.org for more information.

The choice of an appropriate diagnostic inst rument will be no easy task. At this 
moment, donors do not really us e diagnostic instruments that  pass the test. Most still 
adopt a fairly narrow approach towards M& E, characterized by a focus on the supply 
side, in particular on technical and methodological issues, and not even the most crucial 
ones. Existing diagnostic tool s and related capacity-build ing concentrate on input 
monitoring (PEM)—most donors would not even cl assify these as being an integral part 
of the M&E system—and statistical data qual ity, particularly that  of outcome data 
related to the MDGs. This approach may well be understood from  within donor’s own 
accountability needs. Recipient govern ment accountability towards donors has 
traditionally been defined in terms of i nput management (see also Bamberger 1989, 
2000; Picciotto 2003 and World Bank 2002). Driv en by pressures of results-based 
management18 and the MDGs, a layer of ‘outcome’ accountability has been added on 
top. This focus on the two extremes of the cau sal chain has certainly  not been inspired 
by evaluation theory, which almost unani mously emphasizes the importance of 
programme theory and identification of the full causal chain. Bringing this whole chain 
into focus would assist both learning and accountability functions, as it would allow 
accountabilities of the different actors to be identified at the appropriate level in the 
chain. Recipient government accountability shoul d mostly be defined at the level of 
outputs and intermediate outcomes, as these are the issues that they have fully, or at 
least to a large extent, unde r control. Whereas one may expect from a recipient 
government more than just good input management, it is not realistic and 
counterproductive to keep recipient gove rnments accountable for final outcomes 
(MDGs and poverty reduction), which are influenced by factors outside their control.  
Donor diagnostics further tend to neglect policy and institutional M&E issues, and, by 
downplaying the principle of independence, in particular tend to overlook the M&E

demand side. Obviously, a more holistic appr oach towards M&E necessitates a holistic 
diagnostic instrument. Whereas, to the best of our knowledge, no tailor-made 
instruments are currently systematically us ed, there are some interesting donor-led and 
independent assessments and studies that might provide some inspiration for the 
elaboration of such a diagnostic instrume nt. The box on the preceding page gives an 
overview of possible inputs. Table A1 in  the Appendix gives in more detail the 
framework that we elaborated in our desk review study.  
5.4 Complementary donor-instigated M&E  
Even donors that try to put the harmonization and alignment principles in practice often 
engage in additional M&E exercises, with  diverging degrees of coordination among 
themselves and/or with recipient systems. Rather than regarding these as temporary 
aberrations on the road to true alignment, we prefer to look upon them as interesting 
experiments from which a lot may be learned for the sec ond tier of th e twin-track 
approach that we advocate. We  think in particular about some performance assessment 
frameworks (with varying de grees of alignment to the PRSP APR and policy matrix), 
(joint) sector reviews, and even some is olated donor M&E of programmes. What is 
crucial is that such complementary M&E be well coordinated, tailored to the results of 
the diagnostic assessment of the recipien t M&E (see track 1), and adaptive to the 
changing quality of the latter. Again, it is not necessary that all donors equally 
participate in these complementary M&E exer cises; different donors,  confronted with 
different accountability needs imposed by their own constituencies, will engage in such 
complementary M&E to varying degrees. What is important is that there is proper 
coordination among donors and with the reci pient M&E system. This starts with 
appropriate information sharing, but it can go much beyond.  
We believe that these complementary M& E exercises should go beyond delivering 
particular products that satisfy actual M& E needs. By involving national M&E supply- 
and demand-side actors where possible and a ppropriate, these exercises will function as 
learning-by-doing, a useful form of capac ity-building. The invol vement of national 
actors also increases the probability that information generated from complementary 
M&E feeds into the recipient’s M&E. Which actors should be involved in which kind of 
exercises depends upon the function, account ability or learning, being emphasized. A 
quick look at some of the complementary M& E exercises that are currently performed 
on the ground suggests that donors indeed in volve national actors , albeit, without 
always respecting basic M&E principles. Joint sector review missions (JRM) and 
related annual review meetings (ARM), which may be conceived as periodic assessment 
exercises during implementati on, are currently often used as complementary M&E to 
annual sector progress reports. Positively, th ese missions are joint donor and heavily 
involve national stakeholders, including the implementing departments, central 
ministries (finance, planning) and to a le sser extent CSOs. While it is not explicitly 
stated in those terms, the aim of the JRM and ARM is mostly twofold, at the same time 
satisfying accountability and feedback needs. While there ar e some recent contributions 
(see e.g., Lehtonen 2005) to evalua tion literature that indicate  that there might be some 
ways to reconcile both functions, the tension and the need to explicitly address this issue 
is widely acknowledged. Standard evaluation theory and practice suggest that more 
often than not different functions necessitate the involvement of different actors and the 
use of different methodologies. In the absen ce of such precautions, single JRMs strive 
to satisfy an odd mixture of accountability and learning purposes, and typically involve
<<<PAGE=20>>>
18 
a wide range of government and non-governme nt actors. It might be worth splitting 
these into two separate exercises that expl icitly address one of the functions. If one 
wants to do a reality check on government’s performance, for instance, then there is 
obviously a need to respect as much as possible the principle of autonomy which 
implies the involvement of i ndependent actors on the dema nd side, such as the auditor 
general’s office, independent policy research  institutes, evaluati on associations and 
independent CSOs. One could even argue that  donors (or at least some departments in 
donor agencies) are themselves not indepe ndent enough to be involved in these 
accountability exercises.
19 Additionally, accountability exercises demand careful 
scientific preparation. In order to be able to extrapolate findings from a limited sample, 
for instance, one needs to increase the exte rnal validity of the assessment as much as 
possible. Concretely, this implies that samp les need to be representative. Failing to 
respect this weakens the credibility of the assessment and gives the implementing 
agency under scrutiny every excuse to downplay or flatly ignore ‘negative’ findings. On 
the other hand, learning necessitates zoomi ng into and analysing unexpected results, 
success stories, failures or specific experiment s, in the way services are delivered, for 
instance. Here external validity is obviously not such a major concer n; on the contrary, 
internal validity should be optimized, so as to make credible conclusions about cause-
effect linkages of the underl ying programme theory. In orde r to identify issues under 
study and to ensure that fee dback for future policymaking and management is optimal, 
one obviously needs to involve  those responsible for polic y and programme design and 
implementation. The fact that the usefulness of these ‘learning’ exercises potentially 
extends beyond the particular programme, sector, or even country setting, while the 
costs of such ‘impact evaluation’ exercises are high, justifies heavy donor involvement, 
at least in terms of financial and technical inputs. In order to en sure that findings from 
such exercises are disseminated and used in ternationally, one might also think about 
joint donor responsibility in the elaboration of internat ional databases and in doing 
prospective evaluation and meta-analysis su mmarizing what has been learned about a 
particular problem or policy, what has not b een learned and needs further research (see 
also Center for Global Development 2006).  
Finally, there is a need for independent ev aluation of the new aid paradigm itself, 
preferably led by independent  (joint donor) evaluation depa rtments, policy research 
institutes or universities, so as to ensu re the necessary independence and to lend 
credibility to the findings. 20 T o  i n c r e a s e  f e e d b a c k  t o  national policies, it makes good 
sense to also involve representatives of differe nt stakeholders. In order to be useful for 
future policymaking, such evaluation shoul d distinguish between process and impact 
evaluation. The former aims to assess whether all necessary i ngredients that have been 
identified as necessary in the new aid paradi gm have been implemented as foreseen and 
whether they are functioning as foreseen. Only when one is satisfied that the necessary 
ingredients of the new aid para digm have been implemented, is it possible to test the 
new aid paradigm itself and its underlying programme theory, by checking whether the 
predicted final outcomes on pove rty reduction are realized. Sk ipping the fi rst essential 
phase of process evaluation mortgages any conclusion about the new aid paradigm.  
                                                 
19  In one revealing interview, an auditor general conf ided that in his view donors did not really support 
him in his goal to undertake independent performance auditing, because they feared that what might 
come out would not please them. 
20  One of the most ambitious efforts aiming at assessing the new aid pa radigm has been the recent Joint 
Evaluation of General Budget Support. See IDD (2006) for an overview of results.

6 Conclusion 
The present shift towards programme-based  approaches requires that both donors and 
recipients review their M&E policies. It is expected that recipients expand and improve 
their presently embryonic M&E arrangements; donors are expected to harmonize and to 
wind down their own burdensome M&E mechan ism and rely instead on recipient M&E 
systems. This implies a series of reforms that are technically daunting and politically 
sensitive, and maybe it is not so surprising that progress so far has been mitigated. 
Changes in recipient systems are slow a nd concentrated on specific components of 
M&E systems, biased towards the more technical and methodological components, 
including statistical capacities, data collection on poverty and MDGs. At the same time, 
there is a worrisome vagueness surrounding the overall M&E pol icy, particularly 
regarding the way the two basic principles of M&E, i.e., autonomy (or impartiality) and 
feedback, are guiding the institutional and organizational set-up of  M&E in countries 
that do not necessarily excel in transp arency or accountability towards the own 
constituencies. Donors may be partly blamed fo r this sorry state of affairs. If anything, 
they have pushed reforms that conform to their own slimmed-down and biased vision of 
M&E, skewed towards public finance manage ment (input level), recently combined 
with a vivid interest in sophisticated data collections systems to capture the other end of 
the causal chain, i.e., poverty and MDG fo llow-up. Regarding some of the more 
sensitive and difficult-to-manage issues they are remarkably silent.  
Nor is there reason to c ongratulate donors for basing thei r own reforms on concerted 
sound analysis and assorted action. In fact, most of them seem unable to escape the 
chicken-and-egg dilemma they are in. As long as a minimum recipient institutional 
capacity in terms of design, implementation and evaluation apparatu s is not installed 
and functioning, alignment from a donor persp ective is far from straightforward, and 
most feel compelled to duplicate recipien t M&E activities, with related demands on 
recipient systems that go a long way to unde rmine the whole approach. Donor reactions 
are, however, far from uniform. Another group of donors fervently believes in the new 
aid paradigm, but gets entangled in the web of its own radical discourse. They all too 
readily adopt a version of ‘alignment’ that puts almost all the responsibility for M&E on 
the recipient side, notwithstanding the gl aring political, institutional and technical 
weaknesses of partner countries . In fact, we are witnessing an unhelpful polarization of 
the positions on how to proceed with M&E reform. Is there, then, no intermediary 
position, on the one hand, between a principled  handling over of M&E responsibilities 
to partner countries without even a prior assessment of the national system and the 
demand and supply pressures that shape it, and on the other hand, a continuation of non-
harmonized and non-aligned donor M&E practices? This paper has sought to contribute 
to filling this gap and has argued that there is  room for fruitful intermediate solutions. It 
has proposed what we believe to be a pragmatic twin-track process approach, based on a 
combination of effective strengthening of  both demand and supply sides of recipient 
M&E systems through coordinated and holis tic diagnosis, capacity development, 
independent follow-up and process conditi onality, coupled with complementary 
externally-steered M&E that rather than dup licating national effort s strived at bridging 
existing gaps in the national M&E system . While it will undoubted ly take much time 
and energy, we believe that it is possi ble to move towards broad-based national 
ownership of M&E, without ever fully eliminating the need for donor involvement.
