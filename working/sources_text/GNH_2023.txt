Foreword by His Excellency Achim Steiner Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Vice-Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group, which unites 40 entities of the UN system that work to support sustainable development  It is an immense honour to join you the launch of the 2022 Gross National Happiness Index Results by the Kingdom of Bhutan.  The GNH Index is a unique approach that includes both traditional areas of socio-economic concern such as living standards, health, and education and less traditional aspects including culture and psychological wellbeing.  The latest results provide a range of new insights into Bhutan’s development progress between 2015 and 2022.  That includes an increase in the GNH Index value from 0.75 to 0.78.  Remarkably, 93.6% of the population enjoy sufﬁciency in at least 50% of the GNH enabling conditions.  This new data is vital to inform efforts to drive progress across the Sustainable Development Goals in Bhutan.  The Gross National Happiness Index has always had a worldwide resonance.  Yet never more so.  More and more countries are coming to the recognition that GDP growth alone does not capture real progress and prosperity.   As our natural world is pushed to the brink and climate change accelerates, it is perhaps no wonder that 6 in 7 people feel insecure worldwide.

We need to design the ‘metrics of the future’.  That means shaping a world deﬁned by decarbonisation, climate action, environmental restoration and new opportunities for all - the central tenet of the human development approach.  Indeed, the UN Secretary-General has elevated ‘Beyond GDP’ as one of the central reform agenda items for the Summit of the Future in 2024.  Bhutan’s GNH approach serves as a key example of alternative approaches as the UN works to advance the global conversation in this vital area.  Bhutan is also inspiring countries across the world to show much greater ambition when it comes to the rights of future generations.  While many countries aim to be carbon-neutral, Bhutan is in fact a carbon sink - remarkably absorbing close to three times more carbon dioxide than it emits.1  This policy choice clearly demonstrates how it is possible to slow the steady march of climate through brave decisions that will beneﬁt our global community.    The GNH ﬁndings very much correlate with the United Nations Development Programme’s latest Human Development Report.  It focuses on improving the lives people lead rather than assuming that economic growth will lead, automatically, to greater wellbeing for all.  While the Human Development Index, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, has declined globally for the ﬁrst time ever in the wake of multiple crises like COVID-19 - Bhutan has bucked that trend.   1 Kingdom of Bhutan Second Nationally Determined Contributions

It has improved its rank by two places, now sitting at 127 out of 191 countries and territories.    Notably, Bhutan is the highest ranked ‘Least Developed Country’.  This is a category that the country aims to graduate from this year, another unambiguous indicator of its rapid development progress.  As part of the UN family, UNDP has been privileged to have been part of Bhutan’s development story over the past ﬁve decades and will continue to help bring tangible beneﬁts to the daily lives of communities.  Inspired by the Gross National Happiness, we also have a duty to push new boundaries as we reimagine the future of development together.  For instance, there has been a widely circulated fact that 50% of global economic output is moderately or highly dependent on nature.2   Perhaps we need to recognise the fact that 100% of true prosperity is dependent on our natural world - an approach that Bhutan is pioneering in spirit.  In short, as humanity pushes past the limits that can sustain life on this planet, all countries must now radically re-design their economies and paths to progress.

Foreword by His Excellency Mathias Cormann OECD Secretary-General  Thank you for the opportunity to share a few thoughts with you on this launch of the 2022 update of the Gross National Happiness Index. This is a topic of growing interest across the OECD membership. About 70% of our members now have national wellbeing frameworks and just last week, G7 Finance Ministers agreed on the need to use multi-dimensional indicators to measure welfare and integrate those indicators into the policy making process, helping to deliver better policies for better lives.  Bhutan has been a global pioneer in the holistic assessment of citizen wellbeing ever since His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck introduced the idea of Gross National Happiness in 1972, some 51 years ago. This idea was later enshrined in Bhutan’s 2008 Democratic Constitution and endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 2011. That same year, OECD relaunched the OECD wellbeing framework to better capture the determinants of societal wellbeing. It is built around three key components: ﬁrst, current wellbeing in dimensions ranging from work and job quality to housing, health, social connections, and civic engagement; the second, inequalities in wellbeing outcomes between different groups and between top and bottom performers; and third, resources for future wellbeing, speciﬁcally, natural, economic, human, and social capital. To continue supporting these efforts, the OECD will be launching a knowledge exchange platform on wellbeing matrix and policy best practices. We hope to be able to include Bhutan’s perspective and insight in this initiative. We very much look forward to hearing about this year’s Gross National Happiness Index.

Foreword by James E. Foster Oliver T. Carr Professor of International Affairs and Professor of Economics at the George Washington University  There are times in history when concepts and tools swirling around in public discourse come into sharp focus and bring global change. The 2022 Gross National Happiness Index of Bhutan is being launched in such a time. Ever since Robert Kennedy’s famed complaints about Gross National Product, criticisms of national or domestic product have been ﬂoated by leaders and academics in many lands. The wave of dissatisfaction with GDP per capita churned more visibly after the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis and crested with the formal decision by the United Nations to produce well-being metrics going “Beyond GDP”. And now new measures that will bring change are coming into focus. One such metric, in my view, is Bhutan’s GNH Index.  As an academic who has worked on measurement all my academic life, and who writes on measurement as leadership, I ﬁnd ﬁve reasons that Bhutan’s GNH index is relevant not just for Bhutan but also the international stage. The ﬁrst is multidimensionality. Whatever replaces GDP cannot measure economic outcomes in isolation from social, political, or environmental considerations. Yet most measurement proposals coming forward are collections of essentially separate, unidimensional indicators. Bhutan’s GNH Index, in contrast, is built from proﬁles of multiple indicators in which each person has or has not achieved sufﬁciency. It can be studied indicator by indicator, yes – yet it gives a headline GNH ﬁgure, so we know if GNH has grown in the past period.  The second is plurality. Well-being metrics must recognize and afﬁrm the diversity of ways of ﬂourishing as human beings in community with one another and the planet. One size does not ﬁt all. Bhutan’s GNH Index recognizes success if any person enjoys sufﬁcient attainments in two-thirds of the dimensions or weighted indicators. You don’t need 100% to be happy - because personal preferences or life circumstances might intervene in different ways.

The third is disaggregation. Going forward, the work of expanding quality of life and well-being must be advanced by actors at national and subnational level, and by groups. But for most countries, GDP is only available at the national level. Bhutan’s GNH Index is disaggregated – by districts, by age groups, by occupational categories and gender. It gives a crystal-clear proﬁle of well-being – identifying which groups might require which kinds of extra supports. So we know what to do to improve matters. The fourth is rigor. Gone are the days when the black box of GDP was accepted without question. New statistics require precision, transparency, clear documentation and robustness – so students can learn and critique them, statisticians can replicate and improve them, and policy makers can interpret and use them. Bhutan’s 2022 GNH Index is a very professional exercise in measurement, which fulﬁlls the requirements of cutting-edge statistics in an information age.  The ﬁfth is vision. Many of us have heard vaguely about Bhutan’s aim to advance Gross National Happiness, and imagined it to be a rather romantic idea. But when we look at the richness of the measure’s nine domains, we ﬁnd it to be a step ahead of similar discussions in the west. And when we examine the measure as a whole, we realize it is more profound and potentially useful than many metrics that are far better known.  At present, it would be impossible to create a global GNH index because of current data limitations. But we live on the cusp of a true revolution of data, and so this is a solvable problem if many put their minds to it. And if a GNH Index were taken up outside Bhutan, then others would naturally come to learn of its use in policy and its ﬁnal effects as well. I have never been to Bhutan, but am one of those who are now very keen to do so.   For these reasons, I wish to commend the Centre for Bhutan and GNH Studies for issuing a technically rigorous, and hope-inspiring 2022 Gross National Happiness Report.

Glossary GNH survey: Survey carried out to collect information on the 33 indicators with a nationally and regionally representative sample.  Indicators: The 33 indicators used to compute the GNH Index.  Domains: The nine domains under which the 33 indicators have been categorised.   Sufﬁciency cutoff: The corresponding thresholds set for the 33 indicators. Sufﬁciency cutoffs determine if a person has achieved sufﬁciency in each indicator. For example, a person has achieved sufﬁciency in the schooling indicator if he or she has completed at least six years of schooling. A person is considered deprived in the schooling indicator if he or she has not completed six years of schooling.   Sufﬁciency score: The sufﬁciency status of each person in each indicator is added up to form a sufﬁciency score, which is the sum of the weights of all indicators in which he or she has achieved sufﬁciency. The sufﬁciency score ranges from 0% to 100%, and a higher number indicates sufﬁciency in a greater proportion of the nine domains or 33 indicators.   Happiness cutoff: This is the cross cutoff applied on the weighted indicators. It determines if an individual is happy based on the sufﬁciency score. It is the proportion of weighted indicators in which an individual needs to be sufﬁcient in order to be identiﬁed as happy. Three happiness cutoffs (50%, 66%, 77%) are applied to the sufﬁciency score to create a happiness gradient. The middle threshold of 66% is used to identify whether a person is happy or not-yet-happy.   Indicator weight: The weight assigned to each of the 33 indicators. Weights sum to 100%.   Domain weight: The weight assigned to each of the nine domains. Each domain is equally weighted at 11.11%.

Deeply happy: Share of people who have achieved a sufﬁciency score of at least 77%.   Extensively happy: Share of people who have a sufﬁciency score of 66% to 76.9%.  Narrowly happy: Share of people who have a sufﬁciency score of 50% to 65.9%.   Unhappy: Share of people who have a sufﬁciency score from 0% to 49.9%.  GNH Index: The GNH Index represents the share of people who are happy plus the share of people who are not-yet-happy, adjusted with the average sufﬁciency among not-yet-happy people. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 reﬂecting zero happiness and insufﬁciency in all the 33 indicators, and 1 universal happiness (every person is happy, according to the 66% happiness cutoff).   Incidence of happy people: The share of people who are happy because their sufﬁciency score is 66% or higher. Value ranges from 0 to 1 and reﬂects the percentage of the population who are happy.   Incidence of not-yet-happy people: The share of people who are not-yet-happy. The value ranges from 0 to 1. Note that if you subtract the headcount of happy people from 1 then you will get the headcount of not-yet-happy people, which reﬂects the percentage of the population who are not-yet-happy.   Average sufﬁciency among happy people: The average level of sufﬁciency among happy people is the average sufﬁciency score of happy people. The value ranges from 0% to 100%.   Average insufﬁciency among not-yet-happy people: The average level of insufﬁciency in weighted indicators among not-yet-happy people is the average sufﬁciency score of not-yet-happy people. The value ranges from 0% to 100%.

Censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio: Share of the population who are happy and sufﬁcient in the indicator. Each headcount ratio represents the percentage of the population who are happy and sufﬁcient in the indicator.  Raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratio: Share of the population who are sufﬁcient in the indicator. Each headcount ratio represents the percentage of population who are sufﬁcient in that indicator, irrespective of whether they are happy or not-yet-happy.  Censored deprivation headcount ratio: Share of people who are not-yet-happy and deprived in the indicator. This shows the percentage of the population who are not yet happy and are insufﬁcient in the indicator.  Raw/uncensored deprivation headcount ratio: Share of the population who are deprived in the indicator. Each bar represents the percentage of population who are deprived in that indicator, irrespective of whether they are happy or not yet happy.  Indicator contribution to proﬁles of happy people: The contribution of an indicator is determined by dividing the weighted censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio for each indicator by the average sufﬁciency score among happy people. This is multiplied by 100 to give the percentage contribution. An indicator’s contribution gives us the percentage contribution of an indicator to the overall sufﬁciency proﬁle of happy people, considering the weights attached to each indicator.  Domain contribution to average sufﬁciency among happy people: To compare the ways that happy people experience sufﬁciency across groups in each of the nine domains, we produce the percentage contribution by domain to average sufﬁciency among happy people. The domain contribution among happy people provides an insight into the relative sufﬁciency in a particular domain, based on the weight attached to the domain.

Overview  Bhutan’s proactive and decisive public health interventions have been effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. The government moved quickly to implement social relief payments to safeguard vulnerable households and mitigate the impact of job and livelihood losses. This was a direct initiative of the extraordinary leadership of His Revered Majesty, who made unequivocal commitment to the people that he would provide Kidu to all business and jobs affected by the covid pandemic. Druk Gyalpo’s Relief Kidu (DGRK) made a profound difference to the security and wellbeing of the people during the pandemic. While these initiatives have been effective in addressing immediate problems and concerns, the pandemic-induced shocks have resulted in a deeper economic crisis, with non-hydropower income dropping signiﬁcantly, increasing the budget deﬁcit and non-hydropower debt.  Given the conditions, the concept note for Bhutan’s 13th Five Year Plan (FYP) consciously pivots towards an ambitious economic agenda. The 13th FYP will be primarily concerned with economic recovery, with the goal of transforming Bhutan into a high-income country within the next 10 years. The memo advises institutions and organisations to focus their spending on critical economic development drivers in the post-COVID future. Among the highlighted focus areas are innovation and technology, human capital, and governance. It also emphasises the signiﬁcance of adopting a strong economic strategy to overcome the problems that the country may encounter after graduating from the LDC category.  So, where should GNH stand in this context?  The country’s current economic condition provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to explore measures that not only boost the economy's long-term potential but also successfully invest in areas that we may have taken for granted over the years. It opens up the possibility of centralising a wellbeing economy by putting people’s quality of life at the centre of economic recovery. It encourages governmental entities to

develop concrete strategies to keep social investment at the forefront of the policy agenda. In a nutshell, it advocates refocusing on GNH.  The epidemic served as a wake-up call for us to assess what has happened to social and natural capital, both of which contribute to and determine living conditions. The pandemic affected every aspect of life, especially our mental health and livelihood. The pandemic’s impact is exacerbated by inequalities in other dimensions of life, including health and social care. GNH evidence can be critical in assisting governments’ pandemic recovery efforts. Using a GNH lens can push decision makers to reconsider the outcomes that are most important to people and help improve policy content from a multidimensional standpoint. Above all, it will assist in realigning policy options and reconnecting people with public institutions.  It has become common knowledge that investing in wellbeing policies has broader societal, economic, and environmental advantages. Nicolas Sarkozy, then-French President, established the Sarkozy Commission in 2008, also known as the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. The group was responsible for creating new measurements of human development that went beyond established indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Nobel laureate economists Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen co-chaired the panel, with Jean-Paul Fitoussi. The commission’s report and summary, ‘Mismeasuring Our Lives: Why GDP Doesn't Add Up,’ was published in 2009 and offered several proposals for building alternative metrics of success that consider aspects such as wellbeing, social inclusiveness, and environmental sustainability. The report stressed that GDP is a faulty measure since it fails to account for crucial components of human wellbeing and social advancement, such as inequality, health, and education. The group advocated the creation of new measurements that would account for these elements, as well as a more complete approach to gauging success that went beyond GDP to include environmental aspects. The report was enormously inﬂuential and fuelled a push for alternative measurements of developments.  In 2021 the UN Secretary General submitted a proposal to advance on the conceptual framework and recommendations to advance Beyond

GDP by the UN Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) in response to the High Level Committee on Programmes (HLCP). The proposal includes suggestions on data, policy coherence, and capacity building to assist Member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, SDG goal 17.19. The workplan on going Beyond GDP aims to ‘build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries’ by 2030.   Here in Bhutan, for many decades GNH has provided a developmental pathway to prioritise what is genuinely important in the quest of a satisfying and meaningful life. The GNH framework seeks to place multidimensional wellbeing at the centre of all economic, ﬁscal, and development decisions, thereby assisting in the creation of conditions that improve people's lives.  The GNH Index was created to facilitate decision making. It is a measurement instrument that seeks to extensively and systematically assess how people in the country are doing as individuals, communities, and as a nation. The GNH Index aspires to implement an inclusive wellbeing metric that goes beyond standard monetary indicators, incorporating non-traditional criteria such as spiritual values, communal strength, and environmental protections, among others. The GNH Index has served as a strategic framework for national planning in previous years as the foundation for National Key Result Areas (NKRAs), and we continue to rely on it to help lead us in the post-pandemic environment.  This is the third GNH Index; the ﬁrst was released in 2010, and the second in 2015. As in previous years, this Index incorporates data from the GNH survey conducted by the Centre for Bhutan & GNH Studies (CBS). The 2022 GNH Survey and Index like 2015 beneﬁtted from ﬁnancial assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Bhutan ofﬁce. In 2010 the International Development Research Centre of Canada offered vital support. These partnerships clearly demonstrate the value of cross-collaboration.

The GNH Index is made up of 33 indicators organised across nine GNH domains. The survey gathered insights through face-to-face conversations with people utilising a questionnaire, allowing for a more in-depth and personal understanding of a person's experiences and viewpoints, including on the 33 indicators. CBS conducted 11,052 individual interviews.   The ﬁndings of the 2022 GNH Index, trends, and potential programming interventions are highlighted in this book. It comprises ﬁve chapters plus a background section. The background section introduces the concept of GNH. It also outlines the methods used to develop the index, including the indicators, domains, and computational features required to calculate GNH Index.  Chapter 1 analyses the 2022 GNH Index ﬁndings, providing a summary of the data and highlighting notable patterns. It also contains a comparison of GNH among people and areas, as well as descriptions of any discrepancies or inequities found. The 2022 GNH Index value is 0.781 and 48.1% of the population were classiﬁed as either ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy. This means 48.1% of those aged 15 years and above enjoy sufﬁciency in two-thirds of the weighted indicators.  From a policy perspective they enjoy the causes and conditions of happiness.  Overall, 9.5% of Bhutanese people were deeply happy, 38.6% were extensively happy, 45.5% were narrowly happy, and 6.4% were unhappy. While those in urban regions are much happier than those in rural areas, although the distinction between rural and urban is often administrative rather than economic, there are more happy people in rural areas. Bumthang, Haa, Dagana, Paro, and Lhuentse are examples of high-performing districts. Tashi Yangtse, Tashigang, Samtse, and Samdrup Jongkhar are among the districts having poor GNH Index values.   Chapter 2 discusses how the GNH Index has changed over time and what causes may have contributed to these changes. This entails investigating the links between these factors and changes in wellbeing and happiness. The GNH Index has grown signiﬁcantly in each period

since 2010. The GNH Index value was 0.743 in 2010, 0.756 in 2015 and 0.781 in 2022.  GNH growth was faster in 2015–22 than it had been in 2010–15. In each year of 2015–22, GNH grew by 0.0036 vs. 0.0027 in the previous period. The percentage of ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy people has increased over time, from 40.9% in 2010 to 48.1% in 2022. Its growth was faster in the recent period (0.67% increase per year for 2015–22 vs. 0.52% increase for 2010–15).   The average sufﬁciency among happy people has stayed consistent (73% in 2010, 72.8% in both 2015 and 2022), implying that ‘newly happy’ people have acquired the same level of adequacy as previous years. There have been considerable advances in the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios of positive emotions, housing, asset ownership, household per capita income, schooling, literacy, and knowledge, among other things, between 2015 and 2022.  Chapter 3 contrasts GDP statistics with the GNH Index. It discusses theoretical contrasts, such as GDP focusing on economic production versus GNH focusing on non-monetary components of wellbeing. The chapter also analyses household per capita income quintile in relation to the GNH Index. It ﬁnds that 41.4% of people belonging to the richest quintile are in the not-yet-happy group, while 29.2% of people in the poorest quintile are in the happy group. So having income does not necessarily assure GNH.   Chapter 4 sketches nine GNH proﬁles and typologies of happy people, asking who they are and what their demographic characteristics look like. These different typologies of happy people deepen our understanding of the nature and causes of wellbeing and happiness. They show the plural and diverse ways that Bhutanese experience sufﬁciency across GNH indicators.   Chapter 5 explores the policy signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings, as well as some programmatic implications for improving the GNH indicators. It outlines a step-by-step process for assessing programme status and alignment with GNH indicators and domains, identifying key priorities

based on index results, and engaging stakeholders such as community members, policy makers, experts, and other relevant groups to identify speciﬁc actions that can be undertaken to further promote wellbeing and happiness in Bhutan.  The book concludes by summarising the important GNH Index ﬁndings and emphasising the necessity of tracking GNH changes over time in order to foster a better understanding of holistic progress and to support GNH evidence-based policy and practice. As we recover from COVID-19’s devastation and strive to rebuild better, it is critical that we invest strategically in those who need it the most. The GNH Index insights are envisaged to help provide policy direction for focusing programmatic actions to those who require the most attention. We also hope that the general public will be able to engage in this movement as a result of this book.

Background What is Gross National Happiness? Gross National Happiness (GNH) is a concept established in the 1970s by the Fourth King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, as a measure of a nation’s prosperity and progress. It advocates a governing ideology that prioritises citizens’ happiness and wellbeing above all else, implying that the ultimate purpose of development should be to raise the population's happiness and wellbeing.   GNH asserts the belief that happiness comes from a holistic approach to life, when monetary development is balanced with non-monetary aspects of life, including spiritual and emotional wellbeing. Balancing monetary and non-monetary domains of life therefore becomes crucial for maintaining overall wellbeing. Money and material wealth can bring a sense of security and provide access to resources and experiences that improve our lives. However, relying solely on money and material possessions for happiness can lead to dissatisfaction and feelings of emptiness.   In order to achieve a healthy balance, it is important to focus on the non-monetary aspects of life, such as physical vitality, relationship with the natural environment, family and community, work-life balance, and other meaningful experiences. These non-monetary aspects can bring a sense of purpose, fulﬁlment, and satisfaction that cannot be bought with money. GNH emphasises the signiﬁcance of striving for a balance between monetary and non-monetary aspects of life that can help nations and communities lead a more fulﬁlling and well-rounded life.  GNH aims to provide a meaningful way of measuring progress and success that goes beyond just economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), making it a valuable tool for nations and societies in creating happier and more wellbeing-focused and sustainable communities. There is growing interest in incorporating GNH principles into decision-making processes. The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) has been proactively advocating and promoting GNH

in the international arena, in efforts to inﬂuence countries, organisations and communities to track comprehensive progress and identify areas for improvement in happiness and wellbeing from a more holistic and sustainable approach. What is the Gross National Happiness Index? The Gross National Happiness Index (GNH Index) is a measure of the Bhutanese population’s overall wellbeing and happiness, the value of which ranges from 0 to 1. A higher GNH Index value represents greater wellbeing and happiness and one is a ‘perfect score’. The GNH Index is based on 33 indicators that measure nine GNH domains.   The GNH Index aggregates the proportion of happy people, plus the proportion of not-yet-happy people multiplied by the average sufﬁciency levels of not-yet-happy people. So the Index captures the rate of improvement across both happy as well as not-yet-happy people. The GNH Index can be analysed by each of its 33 component indicators to explore different proﬁles of happiness. Each indicator has a deﬁned sufﬁciency cutoff and weight. The sufﬁciency cutoffs and weights, as explained in previous GNH reports3 are based on objective evidence, international standards and societal preferences, among other inputs.   The GNH Index views happiness and wellbeing from a multidimensional perspective, so it collects information from multiple aspects of a person’s life, such as physical health, emotional wellbeing, social relationships, ﬁnancial stability, environment, and culture, to name a few, and then aggregates it into an index. These factors are grouped into nine GNH domains: psychological wellbeing, health, education, time use, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living  3 Ura, K., Alkire, S., and Zangmo, T.

standards. Individuals may place varying weights on any of these factors, but from a GNH viewpoint they are all equally important in contributing to an overall sense of wellbeing and happiness.  These areas are meant to provide a complete picture of wellbeing that goes beyond standard markers of progress. The GNH framework provides a holistic and sustainable approach to measuring progress and evaluating impact on the ground by taking these nine domains into account, in comparison to GDP, which solely evaluates economic activity and ignores the impact on quality of life and the environment. There are 33 markers of wellbeing and happiness across the nine GNH domains (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Domain and indicators of GNH Index 
 How is data collected for the GNH Index? The GNH national surveys are conducted frequently to collect data on the nine domains and the 33 indicators of GNH. Every three to ﬁve years, these nationwide GNH surveys collect insights from a nationally and

regionally (rural and urban) representative sample. Surveys are carried out with a standardised GNH questionnaire using Pen-and-Paper Personal Interviewing (PAPI) or Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).   The GNH questionnaire covers a wide range of questions about life satisfaction, emotional experience, physical and mental health, access to services, and health behaviours, how individuals spend their time, educational attainment, access to education, and the quality of education, questions about cultural identity, connection to culture, and cultural values, trust in institutions, social connections, community involvement, environmental protection, income, and housing, among others. The responses to the GNH questionnaire are intended to present a comprehensive picture of Bhutan’s happiness and wellbeing, as well as to guide policies and activities targeted at enhancing wellbeing and happiness. So far, there have been three rounds of national GNH surveys: in 2010, 2015, and most recently in 2022. A pilot survey was also carried out in 2006 and 2007.   The questionnaire for the 2022 GNH survey was created in Survey Solutions software for CAPI. It took four months to complete the in-person interviews (April to July 2022). CBS conducted the 2022 survey using a rigorous data gathering, entry, and cleaning method. A survey manual guide was also created to assist with data gathering. How many people did the GNH survey 2022 cover? The GNH survey in 2022 had a sample size of 11,440 people aged 15 and above. To match with national proportions, 73% (8,400) were identiﬁed from rural areas, while the remaining 27% (3,040) were identiﬁed from urban areas. The response rate was high at 96.6% (11,052).

What kind of sampling design was used for the 2022 GNH survey? A multi-stage stratiﬁed sampling methodology was used to ensure that the sample was representative at the national, regional and district levels. Similar to the previous surveys, rural and urban areas were used as the main sampling strata. The areas were further classiﬁed into Enumeration Areas (EA). The Primary Sampling Units (PSU) were identiﬁed as chiwog for rural and enumeration block for urban. A sampling frame was created based on the 2017 Population and

Housing Census of Bhutan (PHCB). A CBS team revised household listings in the selected PSUs to incorporate migration considerations. How is the GNH Index computed? The GNH Index is estimated using the Alkire-Foster method, which is a multidimensional poverty measurement tool that provides a comprehensive and robust assessment of poverty.   To develop a measure of poverty, the technique captures deprivations across multiple dimensions of poverty, such as health, education, and living standards. The Alkire-Foster technique counts the simultaneous deprivations that a person or household experiences in multiple indicators of poverty to identify the poor. The indicators might be weighted similarly or differently. People are classiﬁed as multidimensionally poor if the weighted sum of their deprivations exceeds or equals a poverty cutoffs, such as 20%, 30%, or 50% of total deprivation. It is a ﬂexible approach that can be tailored to a variety of contexts by choosing different dimensions (for example, living standards), poverty indicators within each dimension (for example, housing conditions), and poverty cutoffs.   The same approach is used for the GNH Index. In this case, the Alkire-Foster technique combines people's levels of sufﬁciency in 33 indicators. Applying indicator-level sufﬁciency cutoffs, people are assessed if they are deprived or have achieved sufﬁciency in each of the 33 indicators. The method computes the number of people who are GNH happy by keeping track of average sufﬁciency scores across the GNH indicators. After weighting these indicators to reﬂect their relative importance, a GNH Index is constructed by summing the incidence of sufﬁciency with incidence of deprivation multiplied by the intensity of deprivation (average deprivation score).

Identiﬁcation:  I. Identify whether the individual is adequate in each of the 33 indicators. This is accomplished by using an indicator-level sufﬁciency cutoffs. There are 33 sufﬁciency levels for the 33 indicators. Based on their achievement level in the indicator, an individual is labelled as sufﬁcient (denoted by 1) or insufﬁcient (denoted by 0). II. Identify whether the individual is happy or in the not-yet-happy group. This is accomplished by employing a second-order cutoff, which is used to identify happy people. Happy people have an average sufﬁciency level of at least 66% of the weighted 33 indicators. If their average sufﬁciency level across the 33 indicators is less than 66%, then people are classiﬁed as not-yet-happy. 2. Aggregation: Estimates such as the share of happy people, the share of not-yet-happy people, the average sufﬁciency of happy people, and the average sufﬁciency of not-yet-happy people are derived from the identiﬁcation stage. The GNH Index reﬂects both the incidence of happy people and the intensity of sufﬁciency experienced by people who are not-yet-happy.   The index is the summation of the headcount ratio of happy people and the product of the two partial indices, the headcount ratio of not-yet-happy people and intensity, that is average sufﬁciency among not-yet-happy people. This can also be deﬁned as the share of the population that is happy, adjusted by the intensity of sufﬁciency among the not-yet-happy group.

 4 In 2022, the Bhutan Living Standards Survey Report changed the monetary poverty lines, in ways that are no longer comparable with the poverty lines used in GNH 2010 and 2015. The previous poverty lines, according to the 2022 BLSS report, were updated using the CPI. Therefore, to create comparability between the 2022 GNH Index and previous versions (2010 and 2015), we have estimated the comparable poverty line using the evolution of the CPI since 2015. Some background notes on how the previous GNH income thresholds were computed: • Formula used for 2010 income threshold of 15, 000: 1.5 * most recent income poverty line (2007)* median income ratio which corresponds to 13856.96 which was then rounded off to 15,000. • Formula used for 2015 income threshold of 23,127: 15,000 (2010 GNH income threshold) * (1 + 0.5418) (0.5418 corresponds to inflation rate of 2009 to 2014)  Based on the past notes and using 2010 GNH income threshold as our baseline and to allow comparability across time, we worked on the ﬁnalised 2022 GNH income threshold as follows: First 2022 poverty line in real terms was computed using the same formula as done in the past which is GNH income threshold of 2015 multiplied by 1.369309755 (this is the inﬂation rate 2015-2022) = 31668.0267  or we could say GNH income threshold of 2010 multiplied by (1 + 0.5418) further multiplied by 1.369309755 (this is the inﬂation rate 2015-2022) = 31668.0267. For the ﬁnal 2022 GNH income threshold estimate was then further adjusted by ratio of median income of GNH and BLSSR= 34201.66427.

Where and how is the GNH Index used? The GNH Index is being used for the several purposes, including:  1. Measuring and tracking holistic progress: The GNH Index provides a comprehensive measure of progress in terms of wellbeing and happiness, allowing the nation to track the quality of life of Bhutanese population over time and assess the impact of policies and interventions.   2. Informing decision making: By providing a comprehensive and robust measure of wellbeing, the GNH Index informs decision making at all levels of government, from local to national, and helps policy makers prioritise interventions to improve wellbeing. It can be used to compare wellbeing across different regions, providing insights into the distribution of wellbeing and helping to identify disparities and inequalities, and guide resource allocation by governments and organisations.   3. Promoting transparency and accountability: The index promotes transparency by providing an objective and easily accessible measure of GNH, which can help to hold public institutions accountable for improving conditions for wellbeing. The GNH Index provides valuable insights and information about how subgroups are faring across indicators and domains as well as across time.

 Overall, the GNH Index provides a useful tool for understanding the wellbeing and happiness of the Bhutanese population, in a way that prioritises wellbeing and happiness over economic growth alone. It encourages a shift from traditional economic indicators towards a more holistic view of progress and success.

Chapter 1: The GNH Index in 2022  Since 2010, progress across the Bhutanese population has been tracked and evaluated through a single Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index, the value of which ranges from 0 to 1. A higher value represents greater wellbeing and happiness. The index is based on 33 indicators that measure nine GNH domains.   This chapter introduces the GNH Index and presents preliminary ﬁndings for 2022. It also deﬁnes the key terms used for constructing and analysing the GNH Index. The national GNH results are explained and then disaggregated to compare GNH across rural-urban areas, districts, age, gender, and other characteristics. The results are summarised below.   
Key highlights • The 2022 GNH Index value is 0.781. • Overall, in 2022 48.1% of the population were classiﬁed as either ‘deeply happy’ or ‘extensively’ happy. This means 48.1% of those aged 15 years and above enjoy sufﬁciency in two-thirds of the weighted indicators. • In total, 9.5% of the Bhutanese population were deeply happy, 38.6% were extensively happy, 45.5% were narrowly happy and 6.4% were classiﬁed as unhappy. The narrowly happy and unhappy are called ‘not-yet-happy’. • While people living in urban areas are signiﬁcantly happier than rural dwellers, there are more happy people living in rural regions than in urban: 56.8% of happy people live in rural areas, and 43.2% live in urban areas. • High-performing districts include Bumthang, Haa, Dagana, Paro, and Lhuentse. Districts with low GNH Index values include Tashi Yangtse, Tashigang, Samtse, and Samdrup Jongkhar.  • Happy people enjoy the highest levels of sufﬁciency in the living standards and health domains.  • Across the population in 2022, people enjoyed the most sufﬁciency (raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios) in safety (96.2%) and value indicators (95%). People achieved the least sufﬁciency in the knowledge indicator (14.3%), that measures knowledge on local legends, the constitution, local festivals, and HIV/AIDS. The next lowest sufﬁciency (31%) was in the Driglam Namzha indicator, which measures people's views on the signiﬁcance and decline of the traditional etiquette of courtesy.

The GNH Index in 2022

How is the GNH Index computed? The GNH Index is computed by adding together two measures. The ﬁrst is the proportion of happy people. The second is the proportion of not-yet-happy people, adjusted by their average sufﬁciency levels. So, the GNH Index captures vital information for both happy as well as not-yet-happy people.   The method of construction is fairly simple. In the ﬁrst stage, a sufﬁciency cutoff is applied to each of the 33 indicators for each person. Each indicator has a deﬁned sufﬁciency cutoff and weight. The sufﬁciency cutoffs and weights are based on objective evidence, international standards and societal preferences, among other inputs. The method starts by assessing whether each person has achieved sufﬁciency or not in each of the 33 indicators.   Next, the overall sufﬁciency scores (across all 33 indicators) for each person are calculated by multiplying their sufﬁciency level by each indicator’s respective weight, then adding them all up. The sufﬁciency score shows the percentage of weighted indicators in which each person has sufﬁcient conditions for GNH.   A happiness cutoff of 66% is then applied to the sufﬁciency scores to generate two categories of people: happy people and not-yet-happy people. The happiness cutoff of 66% means that for a person to be categorised as happy, she or he needs to have achieved sufﬁciency in either six of the nine weighted domains, or in 66% of the 33 weighted indicators. The cutoff was set on normative grounds based on extensive consultations with a range of state, non-state, and local actors.5   To further analyse results across various levels of sufﬁciency scores, three happiness thresholds were applied at 50%, 66% (the GNH Index happiness threshold) and 77%, giving us insights into a happiness gradient across four groups (the unhappy, narrowly happy, extensively  5 Alkire, S., Ura, K., Zangmo, T., and Wangdi, K.

happy, and deeply happy people) with varying intensities of sufﬁciency on the upper as well as lower end of the 66% happiness cutoff.

The GNH Index in 2022 
 25 
How are Bhutanese people doing in 2022? National results  Progress across the population is tracked and evaluated through a single GNH Index, the value of which ranges from 0 to 1. A higher GNH Index value represents greater wellbeing and happiness and vice versa. The GNH Index is based on 33 indicators that measure nine GNH domains.   The GNH Index aggregates the proportion of happy people, plus the proportion of not-yet-happy people multiplied by the average sufﬁciency levels of not-yet-happy people. So the Index captures the rate of improvement across both happy as well as not-yet-happy people. The GNH Index can be analysed by each of its 33 component indicators to explore different proﬁles of happiness. Each indicator has a deﬁned sufﬁciency cutoff and weight. The sufﬁciency cutoffs and weights, as explained in previous GNH reports6 are based on objective evidence, international standards and societal preferences, among other inputs.   For the GNH Index, the overall happiness threshold was set at 66%, meaning that for a person to be classiﬁed as happy, she or he should have sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the weighted indicators or domains. Using the cutoff of 66%, the GNH Index for 2022 has a value of 0.781.   48.1+(51.9*57.9) = 0.781  GNH Index is composed of three measures: share of happy people, share of not-yet-happy people, and average share of sufﬁciency among the not-yet-happy group of people. In 2022, 48.1% of Bhutanese people were classiﬁed as either ‘deeply happy’ or ‘extensively’ happy; in  6 Ura, K., Alkire, S., and Zangmo, T. (2012). A Short Guide to Gross National Happiness Index..

other words, 48.1% of the population7 have achieved sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the 33 weighted indicators (Table 3).   Furthermore, 51.9% of Bhutanese people were not-yet-happy (which we get by simply subtracting the share of happy people from 100%). For policy and programmatic purposes, its vital that we understand the deprivations of those in the not-yet-happy group so future policies can accelerate GNH growth. To improve the GNH Index value, we would need to understand who they are, what indicators they lack sufﬁciency in, and most importantly, what kind of interventions could improve their conditions. Subsequent chapters provide more information on this.   Looking at the average share of sufﬁciency among not-yet-happy people, Table 3 shows that the not-yet-happy group experienced an average sufﬁciency in more than half (57.9%) of the 33 weighted indicators. It was not yet 66% for any of them – but it was not too far away either.   Returning to the GNH Index value of 0.781, what does this number mean? We can explain this number also by looking at the shortfalls among not-yet-happy people. It means that not-yet-happy people in Bhutan experience just over one-ﬁfth (1-0.781=0.219 (21.9%)) of all possible deprivations. Note that if everyone was happy, the GNH Index value would be 100% or 1. Likewise, if everyone was deprived in all indicators, then everyone would be classiﬁed as not-yet-happy and the GNH Index would have a value of 0.

Around 9.5% of the Bhutanese population are considered deeply happy because they enjoy sufﬁciency in at least 77% of the indicators. Similarly, people in the extensively happy group (38.6%) correspond to those who achieved sufﬁciency in 66% to 76% of the indicators. One can also see that the sum of these two headcount ratios produces the share of ‘deeply happy’ or ‘extensively’ happy (48.1%), as estimated

using the GNH Index happiness threshold of 66%. Overall, 93.6% of the population enjoy sufﬁciency in 50% of indicators or more. Likewise, the total of 45.5% of narrowly happy people and the 6.4% unhappy people represents the group of not-yet-happy people (51.9%).

 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2022 GNH Survey Rural and urban results Before we deep dive into disaggregated analyses of the GNH Index, one must note that the sample is only representative at the regional (rural and urban) and district levels. For this reason, the ﬁndings may only be considered for these two groups. For the rest, including sex, age groups and occupational status, the results are only indicative.  Table 5 outlines how rural and urban regions are performing. The classiﬁcation of urban and rural areas follows the deﬁnitions adopted by the National Statistics Bureau (NSB). Results show that people living in urban areas are signiﬁcantly happier.8 Yet the average sufﬁciency level among the happy groups do not vary across regions – so each happy person in rural and urban areas has the same sufﬁciency score on  8 The index value for urban areas is statistically significantly higher than its rural counterparts’.

average. For those in the not-yet-happy group, the average sufﬁciency is slightly higher in urban areas (58.8%) – so not-yet-happy people in urban areas are closer to graduating into the happy category. The difference in average sufﬁciency across not-yet-happy people is not statistically signiﬁcant.   While investing in rural areas is essential to improving happiness in the country, it is important to note that 58.7% of the population live in rural areas. That means that overall, nearly 57% of happy people in Bhutan live in rural areas – there are more happy people living in rural than in urban areas.

According to the 2015 GNH survey statistics, approximately 41.4% of respondents are male and 58.6% are female. According to the NSB Population Projection Report (2005–30), in 2015, 50.7% of the population aged 15 and above (532,305) were men, while 49.3% were women. In the 2022 GNH survey, 37.3% were male while 62.7% were female. The
<<<PAGE=62>>>

Index value is signiﬁcantly higher for males than females.11 More than 55% of males are classiﬁed as happy, compared to 44% of females. The need for targeted interventions to improve the GNH conditions of girls and women may be reinforced by these ﬁndings.  Table 6: GNH Index by sex, 2022 Estimates National  Male Female GNH Index 0.781 0.814 0.762 Incidence of ‘deeply happy’ or ‘extensively’ happy 48.1% 55.3% 43.8% Incidence of not-yet-happy people  51.9% 44.7% 56.2% Average sufﬁciency among ‘deeply happy’ or ‘extensively’ happy 72.8% 73.3% 72.4% Average sufﬁciency among not-yet-happy people  57.9% 58.4% 57.7% Population share  100% 52.5% 47.5% Source: Authors’ computations based on 2022 GNH Survey  It is also possible to disaggregate the GNH Index and its associated statistics by age group.12 The analysis shows that 15–39 age group is the happiest (Table 7). The comparisons here are simply indicative since the survey sample is not representative by age.      Population Projection of Bhutan Report (2017–2047) by NSB reveals that in 2022, out of the 583,936 people aged 15 and above, 52.5% were men and 47.5% were women. As we can see, there are slight variances in gender proportions in 2015, but there are significant differences in 2022. 11 p-value of 0.000.  12 In 2015 GNH survey data, after applying sampling weights, there were about 54.6% in the 15–39 age group, 37% in the 40–64 category and the remaining 8% were in the 65 and above group. According to the NSB Population Projections of Bhutan (2005–30), roughly 45% of the 2015 population were aged 15 to 39, around 19.9% were aged 40 to 64 and 4.8% were 65 and above. As observed, the sample does not accurately represent the age group population sizes. The outcomes for 2015 therefore, must be interpreted with caution. As per the 2022 GNH survey, 53.3% were aged 15 to 39, 37% were 40 to 64 and around 10% were 65 and above. As per the National Population Projection Report (2017–47), in 2022, 60.6% were aged 15 to 39, 30.7% were 40 to 64, and 8.7% were aged 65 and above. While the discrepancies between the two are not extreme, we still need to exercise caution when interpreting results.

As indicated in Table 8, those who are single report the highest GNH Index (0.803) followed by married individuals (0.784). This translates to around 52% of single people being happy and 48% of those who are married. The least-happy people are widowed individuals, with a GNH Index value of 0.731.   It is important to note that the sample is not representative by marital status, and these general trends may not apply across populations. The conﬁdence intervals are largely affected by the subgroup sample sizes, which at times are too low to allow signiﬁcant comparisons. There are also many other factors that can impact an individual's wellbeing beyond their marital status, such as income, health, and social support networks.     
 13 CI refers to 95% confidence intervals based on standard errors.  14 With the application of sampling weights, 72% are married, 13.8% are never married and 6.7% are divorced; 6.4% are widowed, followed by the ‘separated’ and ‘living together’ categories (0.5% and 0.6%, respectively). Without applying weights, 11.6% are classified as never married, 0.3% as living together, 74% as married, 6.4% as divorced, 0.6 as separated and 7% as widowed. For this analysis, married is combined with living together and divorced is combined with separated. This results in 11.6% as never married, 74.4% as married, 7% as divorced/separated and 7% as widowed, without the application of sampling weights.

Again, the analysis is simply indicative.16 As Table 9 shows, monks and anims (nuns) were the happiest compared to other employment categories. This was followed, interestingly, by those in the ‘looking for work’ (unemployed) category. Intuitively, individuals who are unemployed are expected to experience lower levels of GNH compared to those who are employed; however, here the opposite seems to be happening. This may be due to strong social cohesion and connectedness with family and community. In Bhutan, unemployed people are seldom on their own and culturally have a support system. Overall, farmers show relatively low GNH and those living with a disability have the lowest GNH.   Since the Population Projection of Bhutan Report (2017–47) by NSB does not provide occupation group projections, population shares for the various occupational groups could not be provided.      15 The population share provided here is based on the 2017 Population & Housing Census of Bhutan published by NSB for the entire population. Hence, the projections are not accurate and interpretations should be made with caution. There are no projections on marital status for 2022. 16 Note that without sampling weights, 43.9% were farmers; 30% were working in civil service, private/business, corporate, freelancing and self-employed; 2% were studying; and 17.7% were homemakers (taking care of children, elderly people, carrying out household chores). Only 0.4% were monks/nuns and 0.9% were gomchen; 2% were retired or a pensioner; 0.6% had a long-term illness or disability; 1.6% were unemployed and looking for work.

Domain and indicator contributions17 To answer this, we need to look into the roles that the 33 indicators play in the makeup of the GNH Index. This can be done in two ways. First, we can incorporate indicator weights and assess the weighted contributions of each indicator or each of the nine domains to the average sufﬁciency among the happy people. Note that this contributions is not to GNH Index but rather the contribution to the average sufﬁciency among the happy. Second, by looking at the proportion of happy people we can evaluate, in absolute terms, how many people in the population have enjoyed sufﬁciency and are happy in each indicator (censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio), or explore how many individuals in the total population are sufﬁcient in an indicator (raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios).   
 17 Please note that the formula employed for the contributions are different from those administered during 2015. So, they are not comparable.

Domain contribution to average sufficiency among happy people18  To compare the ways that happy people experience sufficiency in each of the nine domains, we produce the percentage contribution by domain to average sufficiency among the happy. The domain contribution among happy people provides an insight into the relative sufficiency in a particular domain, based on the weight attached to the domain.   We must also keep in mind the indicator and domain weights since indicators with higher weight will contribute more to average sufﬁciency among the happy people. While each domain has been equally weighted, indicators have been assigned with different weights depending on the reliability and validity. The background section shares detailed information on weights applied to both indicators and domains.   As seen in Figure 3, happy people enjoy relatively more sufﬁciency in living standards and health domains. Given the pandemic situation, one might expect the opposite. Following the ﬁrst COVID-19 case in early March 2020, the National Resilience Fund (NRF) was set up to provide economic relief and substantive support to individuals and businesses, and to help implement comprehensive health responses. One immediate response initiated to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on livelihoods was cash transfers and the rollout of monthly rations to the needy through the Druk Gyalpo’s Relief Kidu (DGRK) project. Other initiatives included loan interest waivers providing relief to all borrowers.   On health, Bhutan was quick to invest in preparedness, strengthening capacities and infrastructure such as screening procedures and mechanisms to respond to COVID-19. The government has recorded 21 COVID deaths so far and, compared to other countries, Bhutan had very low death rates or infections among health workers, and high patient recovery and vaccination coverage.19 Bhutan’s success stemmed from  18 This is not the domain contributions assessed in a typical or standardized Multidimensional Poverty Index measures. The contributions do not imply those made to GNH Index but to the average sufficiency among the happy people.  19 According to the government website (https://www.gov.bt/covid19), 59,614 people were infected, of whom 59,564 were recovered while 29 are still active.

the rapid, coordinated and well-led response. It is perhaps due to the impact of these measures that the health domain did not falter. Other high-contributing domains are ecology and community vitality. The lowest contributor to the average sufﬁciency at the national level is the time use domain, followed by good governance.   Figure 3: Domain contribution to average sufﬁciency among happy people, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2022 GNH Survey  The domain contributions vary across population groups (Figure 4). For instance, for rural residents, the highest domain contributor is health, followed by living standards, while the lowest is education. In urban areas, living standards contributes most, followed by ecological diversity and health, while good governance and cultural diversity and

 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2022 GNH Survey  These domain contributions highlight the sufﬁciency level that happy people enjoy. Domains in which people enjoy the highest censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios have the largest contributions. These contributions can be further disaggregated to show the indicator-level contributions. Figure 5 presents the indicator-level contributions to the average sufﬁciency among happy people. Note that domains do not have the same number of indicators and therefore, as previously stated, higher-weighted indicators with higher share of happiness will contribute more to the GNH Index value.

Nationally, some of the highest-contributing domains are services, urban issues and sleep indicators (greater than 5%). These are followed by housing, income, assets, wildlife damage, safety, mental health, disability and healthy days (4% to 4.9%). Considering these indicators are mostly related to government services, we can conclude that government services were performing comparatively well in 2022.  Figure 5 depicts the contribution at indicator level to average sufﬁciency among happy population. It is critical to highlight that indicators are not equally weighted, therefore conclusions must be drawn with caution. Indicators with a higher weight will contribute more. As a result, it is not advised that the indicator level contributions be utilised to make policy recommendations.  Indicator contribution to average sufficiency among happy people   The contribution of an indicator is determined by dividing the weighted censored sufficiency headcount ratio for each indicator by the average sufficiency score among the happy people. This is multiplied by 100 to arrive at the percentage contribution. The contribution of an indicator gives us the percentage contribution of an indicator to the overall sufficiency profile of happy people, considering the weights attached to each indicator.  The same analysis can be extended to each of the subgroups (Figure 6). The regional trends follow national trends. The top-performing indicators for both rural and urban areas include those from health and living standards. Services also perform well in both areas. But these insights may need to be considered with an understanding of the weighted system as stated earlier. Higher weighted indicators result in greater percentage contributions and hence, policy recommendations should not be based on these insights.

Censored and uncensored headcount ratios For policy makers, a more signiﬁcant insight would be from the assessment of sufﬁciency levels in each of the 33 indicators. Hence, in seeking to identify interventions aimed at improving sufﬁciency, it is helpful to look at sufﬁciency levels, ﬁrst by assessing the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio. This measures the share of the population who satisfy two conditions: they are happy and have achieved sufﬁciency in each indicator. Second, it is useful to evaluate the share of population who enjoy sufﬁciency regardless of whether they are happy or not-yet-happy. This is called the raw/uncensored headcount ratio. Furthermore, for policy it is more beneﬁcial to zoom in on the not-yet-happy group and measure their level of deprivation (lack of sufﬁciency) in each of the 33 indicators. This will be explored in detail in Chapter 5, which focuses on identifying the policy implications of the 2022 GNH Index.  Censored sufficiency headcount ratio: Share of the population who are happy and sufficient in the indicator. Each headcount ratio represents the percentage of the population who are happy and sufficient in the indicator.  Raw/uncensored sufficiency headcount ratio: Share of the population who are sufficient in the indicator. Each headcount ratio represents the percentage of population who are sufficient in that indicator, irrespective of whether they are happy or not-yet-happy.  Figure 7 depicts the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios for each of the 33 indicators in 2022. The maximum value of any of these censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios would be 48.1% - the percentage of ‘deeply’ and ‘extensively’ happy people. Looking at indicators with high levels of sufﬁciency, we see that 45% are happy and have attained sufﬁciency in the life satisfaction indicator of the psychological wellbeing domain. The lowest sufﬁciency level in that domain is with the spirituality indicator, where 23.4% are happy and classiﬁed as sufﬁcient.   Within the health domain, the highest censored sufﬁciency is achieved in the disability indicator (47.3%). Under time use, sufﬁciency for sleep is higher than work. The indicator of values within the education domain

also has the highest sufﬁciency: 46.5% are happy and sufﬁcient. With culture, Bhutanese people have achieved the highest sufﬁciency in native language. For the domain of good governance, the services indicator performs well (39.8%). Family and safety indicators under the community vitality domain also enjoy among the highest levels of sufﬁciency at 46.5% and 46.9%, respectively. Similar interpretations may be made for the rest of the domain indicators.

A deeper dive into the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios across regions reveals that urban areas have signiﬁcantly higher levels in psychological wellbeing, health, time use, education and living standards (Figure 8). For example, 47% of those living in urban regions are happy and sufﬁcient in life satisfaction, while for rural areas this is 43.6%. Note that the error bars represents 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI).   Similarly, 47.9% of urban dwellers are happy and sufﬁcient in mental health, compared to 44.7% in rural regions. Around 49% of those located in urban areas are happy and sufﬁcient in the housing indicator, compared to 42.9% in rural areas. On the other hand, some indicators are doing far better in rural regions. Under the domain of good governance, 29.9% of rural residents are happy and sufﬁcient in the political participation indicator, while this ﬁgure drops to 5.9% among urban dwellers. Donation (29.1% vs. 21.7%) and community relationship (29.8% vs. 17.7%) are also strikingly higher in rural areas, as are Driglam Namzha (way of harmony) (17.8% vs. 11.6%) and cultural participation (21.1% vs. 17.1%) under the culture domain.

Figure 9 shows raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios – the percentage of the population who have achieved sufﬁciency in each indicator. These range from a low of 14.3% to a high of 96.2%.   All the indicators in living standards domain have sufﬁciency above 71% – a strong showing. Another domain that is doing well is ecological diversity and resilience, with people achieving a sufﬁciency level of at least 68% in all the four indicators. People also enjoy a high rate of sufﬁciency in most health indicators. As mentioned earlier, Bhutan has been exemplary in effectively implementing action plans in both the health and livelihood sectors as a response to the pandemic.   High levels of sufﬁciency are found in the indicators of value and disability, but a few indicators show far lower rates of sufﬁciency. The raw headcount ratios are the lowest for the indicators of knowledge (14.3%) and Driglam Namzha (31%). Cultural participation is another indicator which has low sufﬁciency (31.4%) among Bhutanese people. People seem to spend fewer days attending community activities such as festivals and rimdros. Sufﬁciency in government performance is also not high, indicating weak perceptions on public service performance on issues such as job creation, reducing inequality, ﬁghting corruption among others.

From the GNH Index formula, we can help to improve the Index by increasing the level of sufﬁciency adequately enough for all Bhutanese people to gain sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the weighted indicators. In other words, the GNH Index improves if any not-yet-happy people achieve sufﬁciency in any of the 33 indicators. So advancing GNH requires programmes that enable a conducive environment for progress in most of the 33 indicators, as Chapter 5 will propose. Where do happy people live? The GNH Index varies signiﬁcantly across districts, with values as low as 0.708 and as high as 0.869. This corresponds to the incidence of ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy people ranging from 34.1% to 66.8%.   Bumthang Haa, Dagana, Paro and Lhuentse are among the top-performing districts. The small black lines on Figure 10 represent the 95% conﬁdence intervals for GNH Index in each district. If the conﬁdence intervals of two districts overlap then the index values are not signiﬁcantly different from one another.  Figure 10 indicates that Bumthang is signiﬁcantly happier than Tashi Yangtse, Tashigang, Samtse, Samdrup Jongkhar, Pema Gatshel, Zhemgang, Wangdue Phodrang, Punakha, Trongsa, Thimphu, Tsirang, Chukha, Gasa and Mongar. There is no signiﬁcant difference in GNH Index value between Bumthang, Paro, Dagana and Haa.   As another example, Thimphu is signiﬁcantly happier than Tashigang and signiﬁcantly less happy than Haa and Dagana, but there is no signiﬁcant difference between Thimphu, Tsirang or Trongsa. Overall, therefore, while there is difference in GNH Index values, some district values are not statistically signiﬁcantly different from each other.   Analyses of the GNH Index by districts also enables us to highlight areas that have the lowest GNH values within the country and, by implication, those most in need of intervention with obvious beneﬁts for targeting policies and programmes. Tashi Yangtse, Tashigang and Samtse have the lowest GNH Index values. We will return to this in Chapter 5.

Seven districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Thimphu, Trongsa, Punakha, Wangdue Phodrang, and Sarpang) belong to the medium category. The remaining six districts are classiﬁed in the high category of the GNH Index: Gasa, Mongar, Lhuentse, Paro, Dagana, Haa, and Bumthang. As districts differ in terms of population, happiest districts may not have the highest number of happy people. For instance, Bumthang has the highest index value, but it does not have the highest number of people who are happy – Thimphu does, followed by Chukha.   Figure 12 provides a map of district-level GNH Indices. Higher index values are geographically dispersed. Districts with higher GNH values are found in all regions of the country. However, low GNH values are concentrated in the eastern parts of the country, except Samtse in the south-west, and medium GNH values in the central parts of the country.

 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2022 GNH Survey  Figure 13 shows the proportion of happy people in each of the districts, using the population projections for 2022 in the Population Projections 2017-47 Report published by NSB. Gasa, which is one of the least-populous districts despite being in a high-category GNH Index, has a low number of happy people (1%). Thimphu (22%) and Chukha (10%) have the highest numbers of people who are happy and are the most populous districts.   Despite their high GNH Index values, Dagana and Haa districts together account for only 6% of the country’s population who are happy. The largest number of happy people – over one in ﬁve – are in the most populous district (Thimphu) with a comparatively low incidence of happy people (49.7%). The ﬁgure is crucial for district-level budgeting purposes as it allows decision makers to consider both the level of GNH Index as well as the number of happy people or not-yet-happy people.

Figure 14 illustrates the percentage contribution of each indicator to dzongkhag-level sufﬁciency among happy people. The contribution of indicators varies between 0.5% to 6.7%. There is some variation across the districts, but what is more striking are the commonalities.   For instance, indicators under the living standards domain have the largest contributions in almost all the 20 districts. Housing and income contributions are over 4% in all the districts. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic having had a severe impact on countries worldwide, including Bhutan, the country has made considerable progress in terms of income and housing. The government's proactive response may have been one aspect that has aided Bhutan during the pandemic. Bhutan established strong lockdown measures early on, which aided in slowing the spread of the virus. In addition, the government gave ﬁnancial assistance to companies and individuals impacted by the pandemic through interest waivers and unconditional cash transfers. The housing indicator covers variables such as room ratio and quality of rooﬁng and toilets.

Recognising the importance of access to proper sanitation for public health, there have been continuous efforts by the government and its partners to achieve universal sanitation and hygiene.   Likewise, the healthy days indicator, which has a higher weight in the GNH Index, is also one of the high-performing indicators, with contributions above 4% in most of the districts. While the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly caused problems to public health in Bhutan, the country's systematic preparatory response towards the pandemic and robust healthcare system may have contributed to Bhutan's trend of increasing healthy days. Another aspect that may have contributed is the publics' willingness to follow public health norms. Bhutan has a strong sense of community, and citizens have shown a willingness to prioritise societal wellbeing over individual liberties. This may have aided in ensuring that public health measures, such as wearing masks, exercising social distance, and remaining at home while unwell, were followed, thereby reducing the public health impact.  In all districts, the service indicator under good governance shows strong contributions (over 4%). It includes, among other things, distance to the nearest healthcare facility, quality of the water, and availability of electricity. The safety indicator also exhibits high contributions. Early on during the pandemic, the government imposed strict nationwide lockdown measures such as closing borders, restricting travel, and suspending public gatherings. This may have decreased the potential for criminal behaviour.   By examining each of the indicator contributions to the average sufﬁciency among happy people, comparisons can be carried out between districts.

Similar to the indicator contributions, we can also analyse the state of the 33 indicators using the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios, which indicate the proportion of population who are not only happy but have also achieved sufﬁciency in the indicator. Figure 15 demonstrates this.   Looking at one of the happy districts, Bumthang, the highest censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio is seen in the family relationship indicator under community vitality, and in native language indicator from the culture domain. In 2022, 66.4% of people living in Bumthang were happy and enjoy sufﬁciency in family relationships, while 66.6% were happy and sufﬁcient in their native language.  In contrast, Tashi Yangtse is one of the least-happy districts based on the 2022 GNH Index. The highest levels of sufﬁciency are shown across ecological issue, safety, family and speak native language indicators (above 40%). Knowledge (6.8%) is the indicator with the lowest censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio.   We can see that districts do differ signiﬁcantly in terms of proportions of happy people and those who have achieved sufﬁciency across indicators. While there are certain similarities in the ﬁndings across districts, rather than allowing policy makers to apply blanket strategies, tailored district-level interventions may be desirable to increase the GNH Index values.

Chapter 2: Trends in the GNH Index  This chapter shows how the GNH Index has changed over time since 2010, nationally as well as by dzongkhag and other groups such as age group and sex. For each group, the chapter investigates the indicator and domain trends.   The goal of GNH is to create sustainable and balanced development by giving equal priority to the key domains of wellbeing and happiness. To help monitor and provide strategic directions towards this goal, the GNH domain framework focuses on a range of domains, including education, health, living standards, ecological diversity and resilience, good governance, psychological wellbeing, cultural diversity and resilience, and community vitality. Some of the components are also unconventional – for example, in community vitality the indicators reﬂect the networks, relationships, and norms of trust and reciprocity that facilitate cooperation and collaboration among people and institutions.  As a balanced yardstick, the GNH Index provides an avenue for policy makers in Bhutan to monitor and track holistic progress towards both economic and social goals. So far there have been three rounds of GNH data collection: in 2010, 2015, and most recently in 2022. All three surveys were based on a common sampling frame, questionnaire and survey design. The data were combined into a high-resolution GNH Index in all three rounds, using the Alkire-Foster method to aggregate the 33 indicators into the Index. The indicator and domain weights, along with the sufﬁciency and happiness thresholds, have remained unchanged since 2010. This common GNH Index structure and computation method has allowed for robust comparisons across time.

Key highlights • The GNH Index has grown significantly in each period since 2010. The GNH Index value was 0.743 in 2010, 0.756 in 2015 and 0.781 in 2022. • GNH growth was faster in 2015–22 than it had been in 2010–15. In each year of 2015–22, GNH grew by 0.0036 vs. 0.0027 in the previous period.  • The percentage of ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy people has increased over time, from 40.9% in 2010 to 48.1% in 2022. Its growth was faster in the recent period (0.67% increase per year for 2015–22 vs. 0.52% increase for 2010–15).  • The average sufficiency among happy people remained stable (73% in 2010, 72.8% in both 2015 and 2022), which means ‘newly happy’ people reached equivalent sufficiency as in prior years.  • Between 2015 and 2022, there have been significant improvements in the censored sufficiency headcount ratios of positive emotions, housing, assets ownership, household per capita income, schooling, literacy, and knowledge, among others.  • Since 2015, the largest decrease in censored sufficiency headcount ratios is seen in cultural participation (-14.3%). • The GNH Index for urban regions is consistently higher than for rural regions in all time periods (urban values at 0.786, 0.811 and 0.796 for 2010, 2015 and 2022, respectively, vs. 0.715, 0.731 and 0.771, respectively, for rural areas), meaning that there is a need to increase GNH in rural areas.  • However, there is a very encouraging and significant increase in rural GNH since 2010. For example, from 2015–22 the rural GNH Index increased by an absolute value of 0.04 – from 0.731 to 0.771. There are also a higher number of happy people living in rural than in urban areas. • People living in rural areas perform better than their urban counterparts in some indicators, including values, speaking their native language, donations of time and money, and community relationships. • Over the past three time periods, the Bhutanese population has enjoyed the highest level of sufficiency (more than 90% uncensored/raw sufficiency headcount ratios) in value, native language proficiency, family and safety indicators. • Across all the periods, Bhutanese people have the lowest level of sufficiency (less than 15% uncensored sufficiency headcount ratio) in the knowledge indicator.

Changes in the national GNH Index  The GNH Index is a valuable tool for decision makers as well as the general public because it provides an easy-to-understand headline of trends across the nine domains and 33 indicators. At the same time, shortfalls in GNH can be broken down by its component indicators in order to inform policy responses to improve GNH, as Chapter 5 will show.   So, what important changes have been observed? Between 2010 and 2022, GNH increased through the GNH Index and its two components: share of happy people, and average sufﬁciency among the not-yet-happy group. The GNH Index combines the percentage of happy people plus the percentage of not-yet-happy people, multiplied by the average sufﬁciency of the not-yet-happy group. Comparing the values of these estimates reveals how the GNH Index has improved or deteriorated over time and across subgroups.  As Figure 16 shows, the share of ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy people increased by 7.2 percentage points from 2010 to 2022 (40.9% in 2010 to 48.1% in 2022). There was also a signiﬁcant increase in the average sufﬁciency of not-yet-happy people (56.6% in 2010 to 57.9% in 2022).

Comparing the GNH Index value in 2022 with its value in 2015, the GNH Index rose from 0.756 in 2015 to 0.781 in 2022, with the increase being highly signiﬁcant (at the 99% conﬁdence level) and faster than 2010–15. The incidence also rose by 4.7 percentage points – in annualised terms, both the increase of the GNH Index and incidence of happy people was faster in 2015–22 than in 2010–15.  The average sufﬁciency of those in the not-yet-happy group was stable, having an insigniﬁcant increase from 56.6% in 2015 to 57.9% in 2022. Recall that if some not-yet-happy people (who presumably have higher sufﬁciency than other not-yet-happy people) cross the happiness threshold to become happy then, barring other changes, average sufﬁciency among those who are still not-yet-happy would fall. A stable or rising trend indicates that Bhutanese people who are not-yet-happy are not being left behind but have had marginal increases. In terms of average sufﬁciency among happy people, all have sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the weighted domains, meaning that a person can opt to have sufﬁciency in any of the weighted domains or indicators so long as their sufﬁciency reaches 66%. For policy purposes, in Chapter 5 we focus on the average sufﬁciency among not-yet-happy people, in order to increase the GNH Index. This chapter, in contrast, investigates trends and focuses on how the proﬁle of happy people has evolved.   Overall, as indicated in Table 12, across a 12-year period, 7.2% of the population moved into the happy group (the incidence of ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy people increased from 40.9% in 2010 to 48.1% in 2022).

Changes in censored and uncensored sufficiency headcount ratios One way of analysing sufﬁciency levels is to look at two key measures: (1) the share of the population who have achieved sufﬁciency in an indicator, irrespective of whether they are happy or not yet happy (the technical term for this is the raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratio); and (2) share of people who are happy and also have achieved sufﬁciency in the indicator (the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio). These two measures will be investigated on two levels: ﬁrst across indicators, and then across the three time periods.  Note that for the GNH Index, the happiness cutoff is set at 66%, which means that an individual needs to gain sufﬁciency in roughly two-thirds of the 33 weighted indicators to be classiﬁed as happy.

Definition of terms   Raw/uncensored sufficiency headcount ratio: Share of the population who are sufficient in the indicator. Each headcount ratio represents the percentage of population who are sufficient in that indicator, irrespective of whether they are happy or not-yet-happy. The uncensored headcount gives us the absolute number of individuals who are sufficient in an indicator: the status of sufficiency among the entire population.  Censored sufficiency headcount ratio: Share of the population who are happy and sufficient in the indicator. Each headcount ratio represents the percentage of the population who are happy and are sufficient in the indicator. The censored sufficiency headcount ratio gives us the proportion of individuals who are happy and sufficient in an indicator: the composition of sufficiency among happy people.  The 33 indicators have corresponding thresholds indicating the minimal level of achievements required for individuals or groups to enjoy sufﬁciency in that indicator. Based on these thresholds, Figure 17 presents the raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios over time.

A follow-up analysis across three time periods (2010–15, 2015–22, and 2010–22) provides answers to key trend questions across time (Table 13). These questions include: how many indicators had substantial increases/growth between 2010 and 2022? How many indicators had major declines between 2010 and 2022? How many indicators increased or decreased signiﬁcantly each period? How many churned - grew in one time and reduced in the next? Note that the green bar shows ‘signiﬁcant improvement’, the yellow bar represents ‘no signiﬁcant improvement or deterioration’, and the red bar means ‘signiﬁcant deterioration’.   Five indicators improved in both periods (green bars across all three time periods; 2010–15, 2015–22 and 2010–22). These indicators are literacy, services, housing, assets, and household per capita income. What about indicators that deteriorated across time (red bars across all time periods)? We observe that sufﬁciency levels (uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios) in only three indicators, negative emotions, Driglam Namzha and political participation, decreased over time. Finally, there are indicators such as positive emotions that decreased from 2010 to 2015 (red bar), but overall from 2010 to 2022 (green bar) sufﬁciency has increased.

While assessing trends across time is interesting, the most recent period is of greater interest. We therefore focus on the absolute changes in the uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios between 2015 and 2022. Figure 18 shows the absolute changes in sufﬁciency levels in indicators across the population for this time period.   The living standards indicators saw signiﬁcant improvement, with a 31% increase in sufﬁciency of housing, 12.6% increase in income, and 7.3% increase in asset ownership. There may be number of reasons for the improvement in the housing index, which includes rooﬁng material, sanitation facility, and room ratio. For instance, sanitation facilities have improved signiﬁcantly in Bhutan. According to a 19 November 2022 press release from the Ministry of Health (MoH),22 Bhutan has become open defecation-free (ODF). The article applauded the success of the government initiative under which every household now has access to improved sanitation. This comes following the nationwide coverage of access to improved sanitation facilities, with the recognition of the last 76 gewogs (blocks) from 12 dzongkhags (districts) achieving ODF status and 100% improved sanitation. Likewise, there was a general boost in local agriculture, including vegetables, due to pandemic-induced import restrictions, which would have increased the disposable incomes of rural farmers. The Druk Gyalpo’s Relief Kidu (DGRK) (the unconditional cash transfer) for pandemic-related income losses, may have provided relief in terms of overcoming rental expenditures. Household per capita income may have also increased largely due to this cash transfer.   Between 2015 and 2022 there was also signiﬁcant improvement in positive emotions (13.4%). The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly been a challenging time for Bhutanese people, but it may have provided many lessons. It has brought people together, with many communities coming together to support each other. This may have led to increased empathy, compassion, and gratitude, which can help to foster positive emotions. It may have reminded people of impermanence and led to an  22 N. Wangdi.

increased appreciation for life. Despite the challenges, Bhutanese people have shown remarkable resilience during the pandemic. This resilience may lead to a sense of pride and accomplishment, as well as increased conﬁdence in one's ability to overcome future challenges.   The services indicator under good governance has also shown signiﬁcant improvement (11.2%). It indicates progress in infrastructure such as distance to health care centre, access to electricity, household waste management, and source and quality of drinking water. Bhutan continues to invest in improving its healthcare infrastructure, expanding access to primary care in remote communities. Bhutan has also made progress in improving access to clean drinking water, with more people gaining access to piped water, water treatment facilities, and improved sources of water. The successful Desuung National Service Projects23 aimed at improving and expanding water sources and supply may also have contributed to the improvement in the service indicator.   The fundamental rights indicator has also improved by 4.2%, with a signiﬁcance level at 99.9%. Fundamental rights refer to the people’s perception of the availability of the seven rights enshrined in the Constitution. With the increase in sufﬁciency level of schooling and literacy indicators (11.2% in schooling and 11% in literacy), the population of Bhutan may have greater knowledge of their rights compared to previous generations. There are also other factors such as the availability of information, and advocacy efforts by civil society organisations.

In terms of the government performance indicator, there is a signiﬁcant increase in sufﬁciency level by two percentage points. The indicator assesses people’s perception of the government performance in seven aspects (creating jobs, reducing inequality, ﬁghting corruption, preserving culture, protecting environment, providing education and health services). The adoption of digital public service delivery that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a key contributor. With lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, many governments and public service organisations have had to ﬁnd new ways of delivering services to citizens.   For instance, the Ministry of Health initiated telemedicine, allowing patients to consult with doctors remotely. With schools and universities closed, many institutions implemented online learning platforms, allowing students to continue their education. Most of the common services, such as applications for clearances and permits, moved online, allowing citizens with an internet connection to access these services from home. This may have brought in signiﬁcant changes in the way that services are delivered to citizens. It is essential to remember that these analyses apply to the whole population because they use the uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratio.  Looking at what has deteriorated, the largest signiﬁcant drop is seen in cultural participation (by 14.3%) which may have been due to the pandemic, as measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and quarantine were implemented to reduce the spread of the virus. These measures led to signiﬁcant disruptions in people's daily lives, including their ability to socialise and interact with others.   Among those who were employed, many switched to remote work and remote learning during the pandemic, which reduced opportunities for social interaction with colleagues and classmates. This may also explain the signiﬁcant decline in the mental health indicator (by 2.5%). The reduction in socialisation during the pandemic - and also on the positive side the increasing social acceptability of discussing mental health challenges openly - might have resulted in increased reports of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, particularly among vulnerable populations

such as elderly people, people living alone, and those with pre-existing mental health conditions.   Overall, the reduction in socialisation during the pandemic has had a signiﬁcant impact on people's lives and wellbeing. With Bhutan achieving a high vaccination coverage and with restrictions being lifted, it is hoped that socialisation will gradually return to pre-pandemic levels, allowing people to reconnect with friends and family and resume social activities that are important for their mental and emotional health.  Driglam Namzha (Way of Harmony) refers to traditional norms for public conduct and behaviour. Driglam Namzha is also a technique of promoting Bhutan’s distinct cultural heritage and preserving its traditional way of life. It showed a signiﬁcant reduction (by 12.2%). More Bhutanese in 2022 felt that the practice of Driglam Namzha was not important or becoming weaker, compared to 2015.   There may be many reasons why people feel that it has deteriorated. For instance, Western inﬂuence and technological advancements have made it easier for people to connect with others around the world, but may have also contributed to the erosion of traditional cultural habits of courtesy. Likewise, as people become more educated, they may be more likely to adopt modern ways of life and reject traditional practices. It is important to promote and preserve traditional cultural practices such as Driglam Namzha, as well as to refresh how it is explained to the next generations. Such dedicated investment can ensure that future generations have access to their cultural heritage. This can be done through education, cultural preservation programmes, and community-based initiatives that aim to promote traditional cultural practices and values and appreciate their relevance anew in a digital age.  Healthy days (-11.5%) also witnessed a signiﬁcant decrease in the level of sufﬁciency. A combination of factors may explain this, including the pandemic as well as changes in diet, lifestyle, and the environment in the country.  The pandemic-induced lockdowns and other initiatives aimed at reducing the virus's spread may have restricted many people to their

homes, with limited access to physical exercise alternatives such as gyms or sports facilities. As a result, many people have lowered their physical activity levels and increased their sedentary habits, which can contribute to negative health consequences such as weight gain, decreased cardiovascular ﬁtness, and an increased risk of chronic illnesses. Dietary modiﬁcations may have also contributed. For example, many people may have turned to comfort foods or snacking to cope with stress or boredom as their time at home increased, while others have had to change their diets owing to supply chain interruptions or budgetary limitations.  Overall, Bhutan’s disease proﬁle has gradually transitioned over time from communicable diseases to lifestyle-related diseases.24 Bhutanese people in general lead sedentary lifestyles and have poor dietary diversity.25 The consumption of unhealthy foods, such as those that are high in sugar, salt, and fat, has increased. According to the Noncommunicable Disease Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (NCD STEP) 2019 survey,26 noncommunicable diseases are responsible for 69% of all deaths in Bhutan. This may have contributed to an increase in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other diet-related health problems.   The decline in the mental health indicator may also have contributed to the drop in sufﬁciency levels of healthy days. Overall, the trend towards  24 Tamang, M., Dahal, B.P., Dorji, T., et al.

unhealthier lifestyles and environments is a growing concern for public health ofﬁcials. To address this issue, efforts need to be continued to promote healthier lifestyles, such as through education campaigns, policy interventions, and community-based programmes.  Political participation also declined signiﬁcantly (by 11.4%). It comprises two sub-indicators; people’s willingness to vote and the frequency of zomdue attendance (village or town-level meetings). The decline may be due to a variety of factors, including disillusionment with politics, a perception that individual participation does not make a difference, and a limited trust in political institutions. It is important to note, however, that political participation can take many different forms, and some types of participation may be on the rise even as others decline. For example, Bhutan witnessed a record turnout during the local government elections in 2022. The Election Commission of Bhutan received 126,304 postal ballots, nearly four times more than the 35,051 recorded during the 2016 local government elections. The election broke all previous records on voter turnouts. Similarly, the use of social media and online activism has become more common in recent years, and may be a new form of political participation for younger generations. It is nevertheless vital to implement measures to increase participation, such as making voting and civic engagement easier.  Let us now look at the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios presented in Figure 19 for 2015 and 2022. The censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios represent the share of people who are happy and sufﬁcient in the indicator.   We observe that under the psychological wellbeing domain the share of people who are happy and enjoy sufﬁciency has signiﬁcantly increased for life satisfaction and positive emotions, but has decreased for spirituality and negative emotions. However, the decrease is not signiﬁcant as the conﬁdence intervals overlap. Under the health domain, signiﬁcant improvements in censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios are seen in the disability and mental health indictors.   Nationally, there are no signiﬁcant improvements in the work and sleep indicators under the time use domain.

All the education domain indicators witnessed signiﬁcant improvements in the share of population who are happy and achieved sufﬁciency. For instance, 11.2% were happy and had achieved sufﬁciency in the knowledge indicator in 2022, compared to 6.4% in 2015.   The culture domain has both positive and negative news. Cultural participation and Driglam Namzha deteriorated signiﬁcantly over time. In 2015, 25% were happy and had achieved sufﬁciency in the cultural participation indicator, which declined in 2022 to 19.5%. The etiquette indicator dropped from 19.1% in 2015 to 15.3% in 2022. Nevertheless, the share of people happy and sufﬁcient in native language improved signiﬁcantly.  In the good governance domain, there have been signiﬁcant improvements except for the political participation indicator. In 2015, 16.6% were happy and sufﬁcient in the government performance indicator, which rose to 19.6% in 2022. Fundamental rights (24.2% in 2015 to 30.9% in 2022) and services (33.1% in 2015 to 39.8% in 2022) also saw substantial increases; 22% were happy and sufﬁcient in political participation in 2015, but this dropped to 20.3% in 2022.   The donation, community relationship, family and safety indicators under the community vitality domain also improved signiﬁcantly. The indicators of ecology and living standards also saw a signiﬁcant increase in the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios since 2015.   It is important to emphasise that these insights focus on changes among happy people, and while it is fascinating to record these ﬁndings and patterns over time, in order to accelerate GNH growth and for policy-making purposes, it is vital to focus on the sufﬁciency or deprivation levels among not-yet-happy people. This will be explored in Chapter 5.

Changes across region (rural and urban) We now turn to the regional trends. Over the course of the two periods, urban GNH was consistently higher than rural GNH (urban GNH Index values at 0.790, 0.811 and 0.796 for 2010, 2015 and 2022, respectively, compared to rural values at 0.726, 0.731 and 0.771 for 2010, 2015 and 2022, respectively). But, since 2010, there has been a sharp improvement in rural GNH with, for example, a very strong improvement in 2022 compared to 2015 (by a value of 0.041). The same cannot be stated for urban areas, where there was no signiﬁcant change in GNH from 2010 to 2022.   Relatedly, the incidence of happy people in rural regions rose signiﬁcantly by 8.3 percentage points between 2015 and 2022, from 38.1% to 46.4%. In contrast, the incidence in urban regions decreased by 4 percentage points – from 54.6 to 50.5%.   Among not-yet-happy people, average sufﬁciency increased for rural dwellers (0.8% percentage points) while no signiﬁcant change was seen in urban regions. While urban areas often have better access to resources and services, and higher economic output compared to rural areas, it is not necessarily true that GNH is improving for urban dwellers when analysed across time.   Overall, GNH is better in urban areas, but evaluation over time gives a different picture. GNH in rural regions is improving while its counterpart does not seem to catch up. Urban stagnation is likely to be affected in part by rural-urban migration during this period, and in part due to the far harsher impact of pandemic measures on urban populations. However, it still signals a policy priority.   A regional comparison based on population shares was not possible because there are no regional population projections for 2010 and 2015. However, to unpack this further, we look at indicator patterns and sufﬁciency levels in the later sections.

Source: Authors’ computations based on 2010, 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  The results in Table 15 also demonstrate that wellbeing and happiness are complex ideas that can be inﬂuenced by a variety of indicators other than those related to resources and the economy. For instance, rural regions may provide a deeper sense of social support and community, which will lead to higher wellbeing levels. Additionally, living close to nature and having access to green spaces can also have a positive impact on wellbeing, and these are often more readily available in rural areas. Furthermore, urban areas can also have negative impacts on wellbeing, such as higher levels of pollution, noise, and stress. In some cases, these factors may outweigh the beneﬁts of living in an urban area. Hence, it is essential to consider multiple factors and indicators when assessing wellbeing in rural and urban areas, something that the GNH Index is structured to do, rather than relying solely on economic and resource-based measures such as GDP.  We now look at the changes in indicator sufﬁciency levels (Table 15). Here, we focus on the raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios, which represents the population’s overall level of sufﬁciency for each of  27 The Population Projections Report 2005–30 did not reflect regional projections (by rural and urban).

the 33 indicators. For example, in 2010, 81.7% of rural people were sufﬁcient in the life satisfaction indicator under the psychological wellbeing domain. This percentage dropped to 79.1% in 2015 before rising to 80.9% in 2022. The 33 indicators are not weighted equally and hence are not given equal importance in the makeup of GNH Index. Some of the unconventional indicators will be the starting point of our discussion.  Bhutanese people had the highest level of sufﬁciency in the value indicator, as mentioned in Chapter 1. Rural residents continuously demonstrated somewhat greater levels of sufﬁciency than urban residents: 94.6% in 2010, 98.4% in 2015, and 92.1% in 2022 for rural residents, compared to 98.3% in 2010, 98.6% in 2015, and 97.6% in 2022 for urban residents.  This may be because values tend to be more prevalent in rural areas as the communities often have a stronger sense of cultural continuity and heritage. In many cases, rural communities may raise children with support from elder family members and thereby have a closer connection to traditional values, often passed from one generation to the next. However, it is important to note that in 2015, only a marginal difference is observed.  There are also some regional differences in the sleep indicator, with rural people repeatedly reporting higher level of sufﬁciency across time (70.3% in rural areas, compared to 57.3% in urban areas in 2010; 70.2% in rural vs. 65.7% in urban in 2022). One reason for this may be that rural areas tend to be quieter and less congested than urban areas, which can lead to less noise and pollution that may disturb sleep. Additionally, people in rural areas may have more access to natural environments and green spaces, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress levels, leading to better sleep.   Rural people also tend to have higher sufﬁciency in the native language indicator (95% in 2010, 2015 and 2022). Urban people have a lower than 95% sufﬁciency level for all three time periods. It is difﬁcult to generalise about the language skills of rural people compared to urban
<<<PAGE=113>>>

people, as language proﬁciency can vary widely based on individual factors and regional dialects.   However, it is possible that some rural populations may have a stronger command of their native language, especially if their community has preserved their linguistic heritage and cultural traditions over time. Rural communities may also have less exposure to foreign languages and may be less likely to adopt them as their primary language, which can contribute to a stronger connection to their native tongue.   It is also interesting to note that rural areas appear to have higher rates of the donation indicator. In contrast to just 24.6% in urban areas, 53.4% of the rural population was sufﬁcient in 2010. Both 2015 (49.8% in rural areas and 29% in urban areas) and 2022 (54.5% in rural areas and 34.4% in urban areas) show a similar pattern. One possible explanation is that rural communities often have a stronger sense of community and social responsibility, and may feel a greater obligation to support their neighbours. It is common to see rural households frequently assist one another in times of annual rituals, illness, death, and other connected problems.   Indicators of community relationships show signiﬁcant regional variation, with rural areas having higher sufﬁciency than urban areas. In 2022, rural residents have nearly twice as much sufﬁciency as urban residents (55.5% vs. 26%). This is a continuation of the previous trend (72.1% in rural areas and 36.6% in urban areas in 2010). The family relationship indicator does not show any notable regional variations.

Spirituality has declined over time in both rural and urban regions. The spirituality indicator has four sub-indicators: spirituality level, consideration of karma, prayer recitation and frequency of meditation.    Let us now dive into the conventional economic indicators. Sufﬁciency is higher among urban people in all three metrics of living standards. Household per capita income is steadily increasing in both regions, but more clearly in rural areas (40% in 2010 to 61% in 2022 in rural areas; 87.3% to 88.2% in urban areas). Housing sufﬁciency has also signiﬁcantly improved in rural areas (from 33.6% in 2010, to 46.9% in 2015, and 61% in 2022).  The ecological issues indicator, comprising eight sub-indicators, assesses people’s perception of various issues including river pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, waste disposal, littering, landslide, soil erosion and ﬂood. As expected, urban areas have lower levels of sufﬁciency. It is worth noting that the Bhutanese population, regardless of residence, exhibits lower levels of concern about environmental issues. Sufﬁciency is steadily increasing in both regions (73.2% in 2010 to 94.9% in 2022 in rural areas; and 58.4% in 2010 to 79.4% in 2022 in urban areas).  This ﬁnding may be surprising given that pollution is still a growing issue of concern, especially in urban parts of Bhutan. There are many reasons why people may show less concern over ecological issues, including limited awareness or understanding of the impacts of ecological issues or the importance of protecting the environment. Without this knowledge, they may not recognise the signiﬁcance of environmental problems or feel compelled to act. Some people may feel overwhelmed by ecological issues or experience a sense of helplessness, leading them to feel that individual actions cannot make a difference.   Additionally, the slow and gradual nature of impacts that interventions can make on ecological issues may make it difﬁcult for some people to feel motivated to act. Addressing ecological issues requires a multifaceted approach that considers the complex factors that inﬂuence attitudes and behaviours towards the environment. Education, outreach,
<<<PAGE=116>>>

and policy interventions can all play a role in promoting greater awareness and action on ecological issues.   Sufﬁciency in the service indicator is increasing in rural areas, but decreasing in urban areas (85.3% in 2015 to 79.2% in 2022).   In terms of the government performance indicator, since 2015 estimates have increased for both regions. It may be common for people's perceptions of government performance to ﬂuctuate over time, as factors such as economic conditions, political events, and social trends can all inﬂuence perceptions. For example, when the economy is doing well and people feel ﬁnancially secure, they may be more likely to view the government favourably and credit it with creating a strong economic environment.   Conversely, during times of economic hardship or recession, people may become more critical of the government's economic policies and performance. People’s perception on government performance may also be inﬂuenced by their own knowledge and awareness of government functions. These can sometimes trigger signiﬁcant shifts in public opinion.  With the literacy and schooling indicators, while sufﬁciency levels are improving over time in both regions, they are greater in urban areas than rural areas, as is the global trend. This may be largely due to the greater availability of educational institutions and resources in urban areas. Urban areas also tend to have more highly educated and skilled professionals, who are often better able to provide educational support to their children and communities. In contrast, rural areas may have fewer schools and educational resources, which can make it more difﬁcult for residents to access quality education. Investment to expand access to online learning resources, mobile libraries, and other innovative approaches to education should continue, to overcome geographic barriers and support educational attainment in rural communities.

the same as or different from the uncensored national trends. Similar to the national trends, both regions have a decrease in sufﬁciency levels in the cultural participation and Driglam Namzha indicators. The impact is higher in urban areas.   Knowledge remains one of indicators with the lowest sufﬁciency in both regions, but has nevertheless improved over time in both areas. For instance, in 2015, 5.6% of happy rural residents were sufﬁcient in the knowledge indicator, and this rose to 9.4% in 2022. Among those living in urban areas, this ﬁgure increased from 8.3% in 2015 to 14% in 2022. It is also worth noting that the values indicator deteriorated in urban regions. In 2015, 53.7% of urban people were happy and sufﬁcient in the values indicators, but this declined to 47.9% in 2022. However, in the rural regions, this improved from 37.7% in 2015 to 45.6% in 2022.  Indicators under the living standards domain have improved for both regions. In 2015, 26.8% of rural residents were happy and had sufﬁciency in housing indicator, which increased to 42.9% in 2022. Likewise, 25.5% were happy and sufﬁcient in the income indicator; in 2022 this rose to 34.8%. The share of those who are happy and enjoy sufﬁciency in assets also increased, from 32.9% in 2015 to 42.8% in 2022. Overall, many indicators reveal signiﬁcant progress over time.  However, not all the regional trends are positive. For example, the share of individuals who are happy and sufﬁcient in mental health improved for rural areas but deteriorated among urban residents. Similarly, under the psychological wellbeing domain, the negative emotion share decreased among urban residents, from 32.9% in 2015 to 27.7% in 2022. Furthermore, in urban areas, the share of people who are happy and have a positive attitude towards environmental conservation also deteriorated, from 47% in 2015 to 43.6% in 2022. Indicators under good governance also offer useful insights. Political participation and services worsened in urban areas but improved in rural areas. Interventions would need to be targeted based on GNH Index regional patterns.

Changes across districts Another important aspect is to break down the GNH Index and its associated estimates by district. We can conduct a detailed analysis of what has changed over time and across districts because the sample is district representative. Changes in the GNH Index at the district level can provide valuable insights into the wellbeing of local communities and assist policy makers in identifying areas in the country that appear to be doing well.  Moreover, district-level analysis can help identify happiness hotspots or speciﬁc areas or regions that are most happy. This information can be used by policy makers to replicate the success stories in these areas to improve the wellbeing and happiness of other districts that lag behind. By tracking changes in happiness rates at the district level, decision makers can evaluate the effectiveness of happiness improvement policies and programmes and make adjustments as necessary.   However, it is important to note that the insights presented here are from the happy groups. To improve the GNH Index, we must equally focus on the deprivations of the not-yet-happy group and implement interventions to address these. Such analysis will inﬂuence resource allocation decisions, such as the equitable and effective distribution of resources to regions with greatest need. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile investigating the positive patterns across districts. Figure 20 presents index values for the three years, sorted by 2022 district ranking. Though the district rankings have changed over time, Paro (0.800 in 2010, 0.792 in 2015, and 0.849 in 2022) is consistently one of the most-happy districts, while Tashigang (0.693 in 2010, 0.716 in 2015 and 0.720 in 2022) is consistently one of the least-happy districts.

As Figure 20 shows, since 2010 the GNH Index has improved in most districts. For instance, there is a massive improvement in Bumthang, from 0.721 in 2010 to 0.869 in 2022, as well as in Haa (0.761 in 2010 to 0.857 in 2022), Dagana (0.769 in 2010 to 0.851 in 2022) and Mongar (0.717 in 2010 to 0.834), among others. Improvements in Trongsa (0.667 in 2010 to 0.768 in 2022), Lhuentse (0.692 in 2010 to 0.840) and Thimphu (0.687 in 2010 to 0.803 in 2022) are more pronounced in absolute terms.   In Sarpang (0.779 in 2010 to 0.760 in 2022) and Tashi Yangtse (0.756 in 2010 to 0.708 in 2022) there has been a reduction in GNH since 2010. Punakha (0.760 in 2010, 0.758 in 2015 and 0.764 in 2022) and Zhemgang (0.743 in 2010, 0.745 in 2015 and 0.749 in 2022) did not have signiﬁcant progress over time. So merely looking at the GNH trends since 2010, higher investments would be recommended in low-performing districts, including Zhemgang, Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, Samtse, Tashigang and Tashi Yangtse.   Figure 21 illustrates the absolute change in the GNH Index value from 2010 to 2022, with the vertical axis showing the absolute change. Such analysis can provide important insights on the long-term trend in a district's wellbeing. Positive absolute changes suggest that the district is progressing and that its citizens are happier. Negative absolute changes, on the other hand, indicate that the district is encountering difﬁculties and that its GNH is deteriorating.

Recent trends are more useful for policy considerations. Therefore, Figure 22 depicts changes in GNH Index values at the district level, looking at index value changes in each district expressed in absolute terms from 2015 to 2022.   At a 99.9% conﬁdence level, Dagana, Mongar, Trongsa, Haa, Lhuentse, Paro, and Bumthang experienced improvements in 2022. Wangdue Phodrang (up by 0.043 units) and Chukha (up by 0.029 units) also show increases at 99% and 95% conﬁdence levels, respectively. Although Gasa, Pema Gatshel, Samtse, Thimphu, and Samdrup Jongkhar appear to show deterioration, none of the estimations were found to be signiﬁcant.  Let us recollect that comparative analysis with 2010 had recommended Zhemgang, Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, Samtse, Tashigang and Tashi Yangtse as focus areas for improving GNH. Based on the 2015 comparisons, we note that there was no signiﬁcant improvement in Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar and Samtse between 2015 and 2022. These remain among the low-GNH ranking districts. Perhaps, we may then conclude that these three districts require attention in terms of GNH-enhancing programmatic interventions.   Yet, it is vital to remember that we can go beyond the district rankings and the absolute changes to consider the indicator composition of GNH, which provides a thorough picture of a district's overall wellbeing. We explore these in the subsequent sections.

To assess the changes in the distribution of happy people across districts, Figure 23 shows the incidence of happy people, that is the percentage of people who have been able to achieve sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the weighted indicators or domains. High-GNH Index ranking districts will have a higher share of happy people.   The top ﬁve-performing districts from 2022 seemed to have increased their incidence of happy people since 2010; Bumthang (39.6% in 2010 to 66.8% in 2022), Haa (46.8% in 2010 to 65.5% in 2022), Dagana (48.2% in 2010 to 63.4% in 2022), Paro (53.7% in 2010 to 63.1% in 2022) and Lhuentse (32.2% in 2010 to 61.9% in 2022). Other signiﬁcant improvements in the proportion of happy people were observed among people living in Mongar (37.9% in 2010 to 58.9% in 2022) and Trongsa (28.7% in 2010 to 44.5% in 2022).

For the purposes of policy decisions, its critical to assess how those in the not-yet-happy group, in particular, are progressing with their sufﬁciency. To increase district GNH, public ofﬁcials need to improve sufﬁciency levels of residents adequately enough to fulﬁl the 66% happiness threshold.   As illustrated in Figure 24, there is limited improvement in the sufﬁciency level of those in lower GNH Index-ranking districts, compared to those in the higher-ranking category. For instance, achievements among the not-yet-happy groups remain roughly the same over the three time periods in Tashi Yangtse (55.8% in 2010, 55.7% in 2015 and 55.7% in 2022) and Samtse (56.6% in 2010, 56.5% in 2015 and 56% in 2022). Similarly, there has been a signiﬁcant increase in sufﬁciency in not-yet-happy residents of Bumthang (56% in 2010, 58.25 in 2015 and 60.6% in 2022), Chukha and Mongar.   More analysis among not-yet-happy people is provided in the policy section (Chapter 5).

Analysis of both the share of happy people and average sufﬁciency among not-yet-happy people directs our attention to Tashi Yangtse district. This district merits GNH-enhancing programmes since it has not only suffered a sharp decline in its share of happy people since 2010, but has also experienced limited progress on the sufﬁciency level of those in the not-yet-happy category.   To get a sense of trends, Figure 25 displays the raw or uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios of the 33 indicators across the lowest ﬁve-ranking districts according to the GNH Index (Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, Samtse, Tashigang and Tashi Yangtse).   In Tashi Yangtse, under the psychological wellbeing domain, residents have experienced most deterioration in the positive emotion indicator. Compared to 2015, on average people may have felt less calm, compassionate, generous, forgiving and content. All the health indicators have worsened, with the greatest impact on healthy days followed by mental health. Under the time use domain, a marginal decline in sufﬁciency in sleep hours can be seen. Cultural participation has reduced, along with a notable decline in political participation. Wildlife damage has experienced the most signiﬁcant deterioration of all the indicators, indicating that residents experienced more wildlife damage to their crops and livestock in 2022 than in 2015. The wildlife damage indicator may have possibly contributed to the overall decline in the GNH Index. When wildlife damages property, such as crops or livestock, it leads to ﬁnancial losses and disrupts people's livelihoods. This can cause stress and anxiety, particularly for those who rely on their property for their income. This might explain the deterioration in mental health.   In Tashigang, Driglam Namzha has seen a signiﬁcant drop, followed by artisan skills under the culture domain. The healthy days indicator has also deteriorated since 2015. There has been a slight decrease in negative emotions, mental health, community relationship, ecological issues, wildlife damage and urban issues.  In Samtse, people have experienced a notable decline in cultural participation under the culture domain, followed by work and sleep
<<<PAGE=130>>>

under the time use domain. Sufﬁciency levels have also decreased in self-reported health status and mental health. Wildlife damage and urban issues also decreased, although only marginally.   In Samdrup Jongkhar, wildlife damage and negative emotions have seen a prominent drop. People have also experienced a signiﬁcant deterioration in cultural participation. They also participate less in elections and zomdues (political participation) and feel that the practice of Driglam Namzha is getting weaker. Across the ﬁve low-ranking districts, Samdrup Jongkhar has the most decline in the sleep indicator.   In Pema Gatshel, the most notable decrease has been in Driglam Namzha and participation in socio-cultural festivals. Similar to the residents of Tashi Yangtse, in comparison to 2015, people tend to participate lesser in elections and meetings. People also feel less healthy, with a decrease in healthy days compared to 2015. Community relationship has also declined slightly along with donation, spirituality and urban issues.   Overall, it is noteworthy that all the living standards indicators have improved in the ﬁve districts. The service indicator has also improved, although the increase is marginal for Tashigang and Samdrup Jongkhar. Education domain indicators have enjoyed progress, with none of them declining when compared to 2015. The ﬁve districts are also doing relatively well in the disability indicator. Responsibility towards the environment is mostly a positive change.   These insights are useful in understanding the patterns across the country's happy citizens. In order to bring about impact and enhance the GNH Index, we must increase the level of sufﬁciency or decrease the level of deprivations among not-yet-happy people. Therefore, analysis of the sufﬁciency and deprivations of not-yet-happy people becomes pertinent.

Table 17 provides the district-level absolute changes in censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios across the 33 indicators since 2015. The changes have been colour-coded from green (improvement) to red (deterioration).  Looking at Bumthang, except for the political participation, spirituality, work and cultural participation indicators, there has been an improvement in the other 29 indicators with regard to the share of people who are happy and sufﬁcient. The share of people who are happy and sufﬁcient in spiritualty decreased by 3%. Cultural participation dropped by 3.3% in 2022. The highest declines was observed in political participation, where share of those who are happy and sufﬁcient dropped by 12.2%. Among Bumthang residents, the proportion of people who are happy and sufﬁcient in work decreased by 1.4%. The highest increases have been seen in fundamental rights (23.5%) and housing (23.3%).   Looking at Haa, the second-most happy district based on 2022 GNH Index, cultural participation, Driglam Namzha and Zorig Chusum has declined since 2015. The share of Haa residents who are happy and sufﬁcient in Driglam Namzha declined by 9.2%. There was around an 8.3% drop among the share of Haa residents who are happy and gained sufﬁciency in cultural participation. Likewise, the share of people who are happy and enjoyed sufﬁciency in artisan skills also reduced, by 4.8%.   The capital, on the other hand, offered a different tale. In contrast to Bumthang, numerous indicators lagged behind in 2022. All the health indicators have declined. For example, the proportion of those classed as happy and sufﬁcient in mental health fell by 5.3%. The proportion of people who are happy and sufﬁcient in healthy days has decreased by 11%. Thimphu is also struggling with time management: for both work and sleep indicators, where the proportion of people who are happy and sufﬁcient has decreased. Similar patterns are seen in the domains of culture, community, and good governance. The environment domain has also worsened. In the urban issues indicator, there is a 4.8% decrease in the percentage of people who are happy and gained sufﬁciency.

Finally, looking at one of the least-happy districts, Zhemgang, indicates that it is doing worst in the work indicator. The share of people who are happy and sufﬁcient in work decreased by 9.5% in 2022. Zorig Chusum decreased by 4.6% and political participation decreased by 7.3%.  Note that the largest decline in the percentage of happy and sufﬁcient people is highlighted in red. The red ﬁgures do not all come from the same district, demonstrating that progress varies from indicator to indicator over time.

Changes by gender and age groups As seen in Table 18, women have consistently reported lower GNH Index values than men since 2010 (0.783 for males and 0.704 for females in 2010; 0.814 for males and 0.762 for females in 2022), and gender differences are highly signiﬁcant (99% conﬁdence level). A higher percentage of males are also classiﬁed as happy, compared to females. In 2010, for example, only one-third (33.1%) of females were happy, whereas close to half (48.5%) of males were happy.   In 2015, the disparities widened (37.9% of happy females vs. 51.1% of happy males). In 2022, a large discrepancy remained between men and women (43.8% of happy females vs. 55.3% of happy males), although on a positive note, the gender gap had shrunk slightly.  Males in the happy group have a slightly higher average sufﬁciency level, and the same is the case in the not-yet-happy group when compared to females.28     
 28 According to the 2015 GNH survey statistics, approximately 41.4% of respondents were male and 58.6% were female. According to the NSB Population Projection Report (2005–30), in 2015, there were 532,814 people aged 15 and above; 52.6% (280,510) were men, while the remaining 47.4% (252,340) were women. In the 2022 GNH survey, 37.3% were male while 62.7% were female. The Population Projection of Bhutan Report (2017–47) reveals that in 2022, 58.7% were men and 41.3% were women. As we can see, there are slight variances in gender proportions in 2015, but there are signiﬁcant differences in 2022. In 2010, as per the projections there were 482,750 people aged 15 and above, of which 53% (255,922) were males.

Figure 26 depicts the absolute changes observed in males and females. While the data suggest that men are happier, it is worth noting that improvements across all index estimations are more pronounced for women.

 Source: Authors’ computations using 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  While these ﬁndings reveal disparities between men and women, they have to be further explored to determine the factors driving happiness and wellbeing. We investigated sufﬁciency levels across 33 variables using the uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios and determined whether trends have been consistent over time. Uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios refer to the share of population who have achieved sufﬁciency in each indicator. Figure 27 illustrates the absolute changes in uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios across men and women. It should be noted that these ﬁndings are being presented in order to better understand the trends over time. For policy suggestions, insights from examining deprivation among not-yet-happy people would be more relevant (see Chapter 5).  In 2022, women reported a signiﬁcant decrease in the sufﬁciency level of the healthy days indicator under the health domain (13.4 percentage points). There were also more women reporting that the practice of Driglam Namzha was becoming weaker compared to 2015. Sufﬁciency in cultural participation has plummeted for females by 12.8 percentage points. In 2022, one-in-eight fewer women participated in socio-cultural events and gatherings. Sufﬁciency in political participation decreased by 8 percentage points, with a decline in women’s

participation in elections and zomdues. Women are also facing issues with sleep and work hours, as sufﬁciency dropped by 6.8 and 6 percentage points, respectively, in 2022. On the positive side, females’ sufﬁciency increased more than males’ in the education domain indicators.   Men experienced the highest drop in cultural participation (16.4 percentage points), followed by political participation (15.7 percentage points). Compared to 2015, fewer men plan to vote and have actively participated in zomdues. According to them, Driglam Namzha is also weakening in the country, as sufﬁciency decreased by 11.1 percentage points. Men also reported a lower number of healthy days (sufﬁciency dropped by 8.1 percentage points) and displayed greater concern over pedestrian-friendly streets (sufﬁciency in urban issues declined by 7 percentage points).   To improve the GNH Index, it is vital to recognise that programmes require gender targeting due to the varied nature of insufﬁciency levels across males and females.

With regard to the illustrative30 age group analysis, GNH has improved across all age groups since 2015 (Table 19). The 2022 GNH Index is highest for those aged 15 to 39. Yet the proportion of happy people has increased throughout the three age groups, with the 15-39 age group having the largest increase. The average sufﬁciency for people who are not yet happy follows the same age group trends. It is important to highlight that, even with age group representative samples,31 it would still be challenging to assess happiness levels, since life circumstances, social support and health as well as personality traits can factor in and contribute to wellbeing outcomes.     
 30 Technically, the sample design is not representative of age groups, so results are illustrative. 31 In the 2015 GNH survey data, after applying sampling weights, about 54.6% of people were aged 15 to 39, 37% aged 40 to 64, and the remaining 8% were 65 and above. The Population Projections of Bhutan (2005–30) report shows that roughly 64.9% of the 2015 population were aged 15 to 39 years, around 28.3% were aged 40 to 64, and 4.4% were aged 65 and above. As per the 2022 GNH survey, 53.3% were aged 15 to 39, 37% were aged 40 to 64, and around 10% were aged 65 and above. As per the National Population Projection Report (2017–47), in 2022, 60.6% were aged 15 to 39, 30.7% were aged 40 to 64, and 8.7% were aged 65 and above. While the discrepancies between the two are not extreme, we still need to exercise some caution when interpreting results. Table 19 also displays the population projection population shares for 2010, extracted from the Population Projections of Bhutan (2005–30).

Let us examine how the sufﬁciency levels fare across the 33 indicators using the raw/uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios by age groups (Table 20). Under the psychological wellbeing domain, sufﬁciency in spirituality and negative emotion indicators improve with age in both years. For example, in 2022, 30% of those aged 15 to 39 have sufﬁciency in the spirituality indicator, compared to 42.7% of those aged 40 to 64 and 57.5% of 65-year-olds and above. A similar trend is depicted in 2015. Sufﬁciency decreases with age for all indicators in the health domain (mental health, healthy days, self-reported health status and disability).   Sufﬁciency in cultural participation peaks for the 40-64 age group, compared to their younger (15 to 39) and older counterparts (65 and above). Donations of time and money, another indicator under community vitality, also follows the same trend. Sufﬁciency in community relationship also increases with age in both years. For example, in 2022, approximately 34.6% of people aged 15 to 39 attained sufﬁciency in community relationships, compared to 52.5% of those aged 40 to 64, and 60.4% of those aged 65 and above. The disparity across age groups had increased since 2015, when 37.4% of those aged 15 to 39 reached sufﬁciency in community relationships, 49.9% of those aged 40 to 64, and 52.7% of those aged 65 and above.

All three age groups had the largest improvements in housing. Positive emotions have increased for all age groups in the psychological wellbeing category. While spirituality has declined across the board, rather surprisingly, those aged 65 and up experienced the greatest decline. However, the oldest age group had the biggest improvement in services.   The younger population, aged 15 to 39, experienced the largest deterioration of work and sleep hours, mental health, and negative emotions. Compared to their senior counterparts, the younger age group improved the most in formal education measures such as schooling, reading, and knowledge, as expected, and also in positive emotions and income. Yet, it is worth noting that this group has seen the largest deterioration in the value indicator since 2015. Other metrics that have declined include cultural participation, healthy days, and the Driglam Namzha indicators, while strong improvements were seen in fundamental rights, services, wildlife damage to crops, safety, assets, and disabilities.

Changes in happiness gradients  Happiness thresholds are used to categorise people as happy or not-yet-happy. To investigate the degree of happiness over different gradients of happiness threshold, three cutoffs were used, as shown in Table 21, with Bhutanese people distributed into four categories.  Those with at least 77% sufﬁciency were assigned to the ‘deeply happy’ category. Those with sufﬁciency scores ranging from 66% to 77% were classiﬁed as ‘extensively happy’. Those who had sufﬁciency in just 50% to 65% of the weighted indicators were grouped under ‘narrowly happy’ and those who experienced the least sufﬁciency, from 0% to 49%, were classiﬁed as 'unhappy'.  Table 21: Changes in percentage of people across happiness gradients, 2010–22   Happiness threshold 2010 2015 2022 Deeply Happy 77-100% 8.3% 8.4% 9.5% Extensively Happy 66-76% 32.6% 35.0% 38.6% Narrowly Happy 50-65% 48.7% 47.9% 45.5% Unhappy 0-49% 10.4% 8.8% 6.4%  Note that when a happiness threshold of 66% is used in 2022, we get a headcount ratio of 48.1%, which is the sum of those in the extensively happy and deeply happy groups. There is an increase in the percentage of happy people in the deeply and extensively happy groups from 2015 to 2022. The increase from 2010 to 2015 is only marginal – most of the increase occurred in the recent period. The share of people in the narrowly happy group has decreased marginally (47.9% in 2015 and 45.5% in 2022). The share of unhappy group fell from 10.4% in 2010 to 6.4% in 2022.

 Comparing results across regions, rural residents improved the most (Figure 30). Since 2015, the share of rural people who are 'deeply happy' and 'extensively happy' increased, rising from 7.6% to 9.2% and 30.5% to 37.2%, respectively. As a result, rural proportions in the lowest happiness gradients have declined. However, since 2015, the share of people in the upper happiness gradients actually declined in urban areas – a worrying trend.

Chapter 3: Understanding the GNH Index and its Relationship with GDP and Income Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has become an integral part of measuring the economic growth and development of a nation. While GDP is useful in assessing economic activity, it is not an appropriate measure of wellbeing or happiness. The GNH Index on the other hand provides a more comprehensive picture of an individual’s or community's happiness and wellbeing, beyond just economic growth. It is therefore worth noting that GDP and GNH are neither interchangeable nor mutually exclusive.   When Bhutan ﬁrst promulgated GNH as the ﬁnal objective of government, most countries preferred to focus only GDP growth. But over the past 15 years, this has changed dramatically. In 2009, Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi released their Commission report Mismeasuring our Lives32. This study was commissioned by President Sarkozy as many people in France felt GDP per capita did not reﬂect their wellbeing. It proposed several interventions such as improvements to GDP, the creation of green GDP, and development of quality of life measures. They also outlined eight domains – all similar to those in GNH, except for culture. OECD continues to follow up on this work. Princeton University also gathered over 250 academics in an International Panel on Social Progress, which published three volumes on different domains and measures beyond GDP33. In 2021, the UN Secretary General set up a ‘Beyond GDP’ Core Group co-led by DESA, UNDP and UNCTAD. The Secretary General wrote, [N]ow is the time to correct a glaring blind spot in how we measure economic prosperity and progress. When proﬁts come at the expense of people and our planet, we are left

with an incomplete picture of the true cost of economic growth.34  The concept paper, Valuing What Counts: United Nations System-wide Contribution on Beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP), was approved by the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) in August 2022, and work is underway to develop new global measures of wellbeing.35 Thus the launch of the 2022 GNH Index coincides with a ripple of international consternation about the shortcomings of GDP growth, and efforts to bring social and environmental variables into view in other countries – much as Bhutan’s GNH Index does already.   GDP, GDP per capita, and similar measures are not based on surveys nor on administrative data such as tax records, but on System of National Accounts36. The GNH Survey also has some basic questions to establish the band of income the person and their household enjoy. This chapter uses the GNH data to answer few basic questions. Is the GNH Index identifying as happy mainly those who are well off in terms of their income? Or does it add something to a monetary measure?   The chapter delves into the GNH Index and monetary measures, in particular, the strengths and weaknesses of both measures are explored, allowing readers to gain a deeper understanding of their limitations as well as their potential. It explains how both measures can be used to improve economic and social outcomes, and how they can be used to guide policy decisions. This is an important consideration, as policy makers need to be able to measure the effectiveness of their policies and programmes in achieving desired outcomes. Understanding the differences between the GNH Index and monetary measures, as well as GDP, is crucial, as it allows policy makers to choose the most appropriate measure for their speciﬁc needs.   34 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Our Common Agenda: Report of the Secretary-General. 35 See documents linked from https://unsceb.org/topics/beyond-gdp#:~:text=[N]ow%20is%20the%20time,true%20cost%20of%20economic%20growth 36 https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp

We also examine how the GNH Index functions across various income levels using the 2022 GNH survey data. In particular, we compare it across household per capita income quintiles and how they have changed over time. We generate a household per capita income37 quintile in order to gain a rough measure of the distribution of relative economic wellbeing within Bhutan. By looking at income quintiles, we assess the association of income with GNH Index both in terms of its distribution as well as on how it varies across time and different population subgroups. The results provide insights into how income distribution impact happiness and wellbeing.   Key highlights • The GNH Index and GDP have different conceptual underpinnings, as well as distinct priorities and goals.  • The GNH Index is quantitative measure of citizen’s wellbeing and happiness and focuses on a wide range of economic and non-economic factors contributing to people's happiness over a certain period. In contrast, GDP is a standard quantitative measure of total market value created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period.  • Unlike GDP, the GNH Index assesses quality of life, prioritises sustainability, incorporates non-market activities, and considers negative externalities on health and the environment. It can be disaggregated by gender and district and other characteristics.  • The GNH indicators directly shows what requires improvement and the GNH Index shows where imbalances occur, to inform different actors and, if necessary, spark action.   • The monetary poorest have the largest proportions of unhappy people and the lowest proportions of deeply happy people. In 2022, the richest (top 20% of income quintile) had the highest share of 
 37 Household per capita income was generated by combining the total household income from varied sources and dividing it by the household size. No further transformation was applied to this variable.

deeply happy people (15.3%) and the lowest proportion of unhappy people (2.3%).  • Yet 41.4% of people belonging to the richest quintile are in the not-yet-happy group (narrowly happy plus unhappy – 39.1+2.3). And 29.2% of people in the poorest quintile are in the happy group. So it is clear that income is not highly correlated with GNH.   • The average degree of sufficiency in the happy group does not differ significantly across the household per capita quintile income levels. Monetary poor happy people enjoy the same sufficiency in GNH as rich happy people.  
Conceptual and methodological differences GDP has been traditionally used as a measure of economic performance and is often used as a proxy for measuring overall wellbeing and happiness in a country. However, building on Amartya Sen’s pivotal work on the capability approach, there has been increasing recognition that GDP has limitations as a wellbeing measure. The UNDP’s Human Development Approach aimed to shift the objective of economic activity from focusing on growth as the end and human beings as the means, to focusing on human beings and freedoms as the end. In 2013, after noting the environmental damage that accompanied India’s growth, Drèze and Sen argue that ‘the achievement of high growth…must ultimately be judged in terms of the impact of that economic growth on the lives and freedoms of the people’ (2013)38. Shortfalls are evident in many countries: ‘It is not only that the new income generated by economic growth has been very unequally shared, but also that the resources newly created have not been utilised adequately to relieve the gigantic deprivations of the underdogs of society’ (p. 9).  Turning to other authors, according to the Easterlin Paradox, although economic growth and growing income levels can increase wellbeing in low-income countries or for those who are living in poverty, this beneﬁt usually levels off once fundamental necessities are addressed  38 Drèze, Jean (2013). An uncertain glory: India and its contradictions. Princeton, New Jersey : Princeton University Press.

(Easterlin, 197439). This implies that subsequent gains in wealth may not result in a proportionate improvement in wellbeing, especially after people have enough money to cover their fundamental needs for food, shelter, and security.  Prosperity appears to rise in developing countries together with GDP, but in highly developed nations, minor or small improvements in wellbeing that are essentially invisible at times, tend to be connected with growth in per capita wealth (Giovannini et al., 200740). This is because national income rises in industrialised countries have a smaller impact on wellbeing since the utility of the consumption beneﬁt is declining and relative status is a zero-sum game at the society level (Clark et al., 200841; McBride, 200142).   The GNH Index is based on the GNH concept that was introduced in Bhutan in the early 1970s as an alternative approach to measuring the country's progress and wellbeing. The sole goal of GNH Index is improve the causes and conditions of wellbeing for people and households, rather than simply focusing on economic growth as measured by GDP per capita or economic growth. The GNH Index and GDP therefore are conceptually different with distinct foci and objectives.   We examine how GNH and GDP differ further below.  GDP is a conventional economic statistic that calculates the monetary worth of all products and services produced inside a nation’s borders over a certain time period. No matter who makes it or where it is  39 Easterlin, R.A. (1974). Does economic growth improve the human lot? Some empirical evidence.  David, P.A. and M.W.

consumed, it all falls within what is generated in a nation. It was created by the economist Simon Kuznets, who was given the task of creating a national accounting system to gauge the United States’ economic activity during the Great Depression.43   Since its creation, economists and statisticians from all around the world have enhanced and modiﬁed this system. Governments, companies, and international organisations use GDP, one of the most popular indicators of economic activity, to compare the economic performance of various nations. But GDP does not take into account non-monetary transactions such as social capital, voluntary work or donations or the distribution of wealth and income. Many economists44 have drawn attention to the shortcomings of GDP even to measure its intended economic topics, and have proposed modiﬁcations.   In contrast, the GNH Index takes into consideration non-economic elements, including social connectedness, environmental preservation, cultural diversity, psychological wellbeing, and good governance, among others. It is a comprehensive strategy for development that aims to strike a balance between environmental and societal wellbeing and economic progress.  While GDP evaluates a nation's economic production, the GNH Index places a greater emphasis on inclusive growth and sustainable development that beneﬁts all parties involved rather than just a select few. Since a country’s success goes beyond its economic performance, the Index tries to present a more complete and balanced view of such progress. This is accomplished through a domain-based framework that addresses key wellbeing themes. In doing so, the GNH Index promotes policies and programmes that can have equal impacts on all of these aspects of wellbeing.  The methodologies used to calculate the GNH Index and GDP are also dissimilar. GDP measures the monetary value of all ﬁnal goods and services produced within a country's borders over a given period of time,  43 J.S. Landefeld, E.P. Seskin, and B.M. Fraumeni (2008) 44 https://www.bu.edu/pardee/files/documents/PP-004-GDP.pdf

typically a year. By adding up the value of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports, the formula reﬂects the total demand for goods and services in the economy.45 It is important to note that there are many ways of calculating GDP, and there are other methods that can be used depending on the availability of data and the context.   The GNH Index is based on the Alkire-Foster method, which is a multidimensional poverty measurement approach aimed to provide a comprehensive and robust way of measuring poverty that goes beyond income-based measures. The method combines different indicators of GNH into a single index that reﬂects the extent of happiness in a given population. The approach takes into account the intensity and depth of happiness, as well as the overlap and interaction between different GNH domains and indicators. The Alkire-Foster method has been widely used by international organisations, governments, and researchers to monitor and evaluate poverty reduction policies and programmes.   Table 22 provides some comparisons between the GNH Index and GDP.  
 45 The formula for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is: C + I + G + (X - M) where: C represents private consumption, which includes all spending by households on goods and services.  I represents gross investment, which includes spending by businesses on capital equipment, structures, and inventories. G represents government spending, which includes all government expenditures on goods and services. X represents exports, which are goods and services produced domestically and sold to foreign countries. M represents imports, which are goods and services produced in foreign countries and consumed domestically.

What does it measure? 
It is a quantitative measure of citizen’s wellbeing and happiness in a country by focusing on wide range of economic and non-economic factors contributing to people's happiness during a certain period.  
It is a standard quantitative measure of total market value created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period.  
Who developed the underlying concept? The concept was introduced by the Fourth King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in the 1970s.  The concept was ﬁrst developed by the economist Simon Kuznets in the 1930s.  
How did the concept emerge? 
The concept emerged from the Fourth King’s belief that economic development alone is not enough to bring happiness to his people and that the sole pursuit of material wealth could lead to environmental degradation, cultural erosion, and social disintegration.  
Simon Kuznets an economist was commissioned to develop a national accounting system to measure a country's (USA) economic activity during the Great Depression.  
What thematic areas does it measure? 
It measures progress through nine thematic areas; psychological wellbeing, health, education, time use, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards. 
It measures progress through a single thematic area of economy by aggregating expenditures that is the amount spent or consumed by households on goods and services, through investments, government spending and net exports, among others. What computational method/formula does the measure use? 
It is computed using the Alkire-Foster method which is a multidimensional approach to measuring poverty and wellbeing. 
It is computed using either expenditure or income approach. The expenditure approach is based on the amount spend on consumption, government expenditures and investments. The income approach takes into account

  GNH Index GDP the total income generated by the goods and services produced.  What kind of data does the measure rely on? 
GNH Index uses data from nationwide GNH surveys, using personal interviews and a standardised survey instrument (questionnaire). 
The speciﬁc sources of data used to compute GDP can vary by country and depend on the availability and quality of data. They rely on data from surveys of households and businesses, administrative records including government spending, investments, taxation, and transfers. How frequently is it measured? The nationwide GNH survey is carried out every three to ﬁve years.  GDP is computed annually by nations. What is the measure mostly used for? It is mostly used to monitor and track holistic progress in GNH terms in Bhutan. It is mostly used to monitor and track economic progress in a country

What is in the GNH Index but missing in GDP and monetary income measures? The GNH Index values quality of life GDP is often used as a proxy for the overall health and wellbeing of a society. However, GDP does not measure the quality of life of people in a country. For example, a country with a high GDP may still have high levels of poverty, inequality, and social unrest. Similarly, a country with a low GDP may have a high quality of life, with good access to education, healthcare, and social support. GDP also does not capture the full range of human activities and contributions to overall quality of life.   The GNH Index, on the other hand, measures the quality of life in a country. The Index helps inform and inﬂuence policies needed to improve life quality by taking into account the nine domains that are designed to capture a wide range of factors contributing to societal wellbeing. For instance, the psychological wellbeing domain includes measures of life satisfaction and positive emotions, while the health domain includes measures of physical health and mental health. The time use domain includes measures of work-life balance and leisure time, and the cultural diversity and resilience domain includes measures of cultural heritage, diversity, and social cohesion. By measuring these and other factors, the GNH Index provides a more comprehensive and holistic picture of the quality of life in a country than GDP. The GNH Index values sustainability One of the drawbacks of using GDP as a measure of economic progress is that it does not indicate whether the country's rate of growth is sustainable. GDP does not consider whether this economic growth is being achieved in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable over the long term. For example, a country that achieves high GDP growth by depleting its natural resources, contributing to green gas emissions or exploiting its workers may be unsustainable in the long run, even if its GDP growth rate is high in the
<<<PAGE=159>>>
Understanding the GNH Index 
 127 
short term. Similarly, a country that achieves high GDP growth but where societal physical and mental health is deteriorating over time may be unsustainable in the long run, even if its GDP growth rate is high in the short term.  In contrast, the GNH Index values sustainability as one of its key principles. It is based on the principle that sustainable development and the wellbeing of people and the planet should be valued over economic growth. The nine domains of the GNH Index are designed to reﬂect a balance between material, social, and environmental wellbeing, all of which are considered important for achieving sustainable development. The ecological diversity and resilience and cultural diversity and resilience domains, for example, focus on environmental sustainability and the ability of communities to adapt to change. The community vitality domain focuses on social sustainability and the importance of social capital and community resilience. In addition, the GNH Index also recognises the importance of intergenerational equity and the need to balance the needs of current and future generations. The Index helps to identify areas where policies and investments may be needed to promote wellbeing in a more sustainable way. The GNH Index takes into account non-market transactions Another limitation of GDP is that it does not account for non-market transactions. Non-market transactions are activities that are not exchanged for money in the formal market, such as household chores, childcare, elderly care, and volunteer work. Since these activities are not recorded in the ofﬁcial economic statistics, they are not included in GDP. They can, nevertheless, make signiﬁcant contributions to a nation's prosperity and standard of living. For instance, home activities like cooking, cleaning, and childrearing, can have a large positive impact on individuals and families.  Moreover, certain non-market transactions might take the place of some market transactions, which could cause an overestimation of economic activity. The amount of money spent on food might decrease, for instance, if a person started a vegetable garden and growing their own food rather than buying it from the market, but this would not be
<<<PAGE=160>>>
GNH 2022 
 128 
reﬂected in GDP. Additionally, some activities that are not included in GDP may have signiﬁcant economic spill over effects. For instance, volunteering can increase a community's social capital, which over time can have favourable consequences on economic growth and development.  The GNH Index incorporates non-market transactions in the form of community vitality, time use and culture domains. In the time use domain, the work hours indicator typically includes all the time spent on activities related to employment or income-generating work, as well as time spent on unpaid household chores such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare. This is because household chores are considered essential work that contribute to the functioning of society and the economy, even though they are often not recognised as such or compensated monetarily. Therefore, the work hours indicator in the time use domain takes into account both formal work (e.g., paid employment) and informal work (e.g., household chores) to account for the total time spent on productive activities.   In the community vitality domain, the donation indicators, which comprise voluntary time and cash and in-kind donation, incorporate the concept of social capital as they reﬂect the willingness of individuals to contribute time, resources, and effort to support others in their community. Volunteering for a local charity or donating money to a community project can be seen as acts of social capital because they demonstrate a willingness to work together and support common goals.   By incorporating social capital into the indicator structure, we can gain a better understanding of the strength of community ties and the potential for collective action. This information can be useful for policy makers in promoting community development and building resilient, sustainable communities. It can also help to identify areas where social capital may be lacking and where targeted interventions may be needed to strengthen community connections and support social cohesion.

The GNH Index considers negative externalities on human health and the environment One of the main criticisms of using GDP as a measure of economic progress is that it fails to account for the costs imposed on human health and the environment by negative externalities arising from the production or consumption of the nation’s output. Negative externalities refer to costs that are not reﬂected in the market price of a good or service but are instead borne by society as a whole, such as pollution, resource depletion, and public health impacts. Because GDP only measures the value of goods and services produced and exchanged in the market, it does not account for these externalities and may therefore give a misleading picture of economic progress. For example, a country that experiences high levels of pollution from industrial activity may have a high GDP due to the value of the goods produced, but this economic growth may come at a high cost to public health and the environment.  GNH Index attempts to track pollution and ecological disasters, including air and river pollution, landslides, ﬂooding and soil erosion. These indicators are important measures under the environment domain as they help to assess the negative externalities associated with economic activity. By tracking pollution and ecological issues indicators, we can gain insight into the extent and severity of these negative externalities and inform policies aimed at promoting sustainable development and reducing negative externalities. This can also help to raise awareness among the public about the importance of environmental protection and the need to address the negative impacts of economic activity on the environment. The GNH Index and GDP can be used as complementary policy tools Despite the limitations of monetary measures, GDP is one of the most widely used indicators of societal progress. By comparing GDP per person over time, policy makers can assess whether the economy is growing, shrinking, or stagnant. It is also used to track the performance of different sectors within the economy, such as manufacturing, services,
<<<PAGE=162>>>
GNH 2022 
 130 
and agriculture. By looking at the contribution of each sector to overall GDP, policy makers can identify areas that are growing or declining and make decisions about where to allocate resources.   GDP is further used to assess the vulnerability of an economy to external shocks, such as a recession or a natural disaster. Countries with a high proportion of their GDP coming from a single sector or dependent on a single export commodity may be more vulnerable to economic shocks than countries with a more diversiﬁed economy.   The GNH Index helps establish an alternative development framework which is distinctively holistic in comparison to GDP. If certain dimensions contract or are pushed out by material progress, the GNH Index will explicitly convey this information as imbalances emerge, in order to catalyse public debate and, if appropriate, action. The GNH indicators help track outputs, and the GNH Index incentivises ministries to deliver services by demonstrating how their efforts will contribute to higher GNH the next time the Index is updated. Methodologically, this necessitates an index that can be disaggregated into its component indicators, which is exactly what the Index offers.  GNH Index also helps in directing resources depending on the indicator achievements and shortfalls over time. In terms of targeting, the GNH Index can show which Dzongkhags are lacking in which indicators, as well as identify and target the least happy people by age, district, gender, and so on. In terms of screening tools, the GNH indicators can be used as a checklist to convey the types of activities and achievements that constitute GNH in concrete terms.  The GNH component indicators are sensitive to changes over time. Some indicators must be directly responsive to policy changes. Holistic progress can be observed over time and across different sections of populations. Similarly, inequalities between groups can be identiﬁed, as can populations that require special attention.   The GNH Index and GDP can be complementary because they offer different perspectives on development and wellbeing. Using both measures as complementary policy tools can help policymakers make

more informed decisions that prioritize the overall welfare of the population and promote sustainable and inclusive development. Are richer people happier? To answer this, we investigate the relationships between happiness levels and income per capita. In the absence of disaggregated GDP data, we use the quintile of household per capita income in this analysis. An income quintile divides the population into ﬁve income groups (from poorest to richest income earners). Quintiles are numbers in statistics that divide a dataset into ﬁve categories of equal frequency. The ﬁrst quintile denoted by ‘poorest’ here is the point at which 20% of all data values fall. The second quintile (‘next poorest’) represents the point at which 40% of all data values fall below it, and so on. To generate these income groups, household per capita income values were sorted and divided into ﬁve as follows:   1. ‘poorest’ refers to the 20% of the population who are earning the lowest 20% of the household per capita income.  2. ‘next poorest’ refers to the next 20 percentage of the population who are earning from 20% to 40% of the household per capita income. 3. ‘middle quintile’ refers to 20% of the population who are earning from 40% to 60% of the household per capita income. 4. ‘next richest’ refers to 20% of the population who are earning from 60% to 80% of the household per capita income. 5. ‘richest’ refers to the 20% of the population who are earning from 80% to 100% of the household per capita income.  Table 23 provides descriptive information on the sample sizes of each of the ﬁve income categories. Note that sampling weights have been applied to the results shared in this section, and when these are applied each quintile has 20% of the population even though the number of observations is slightly higher in the poorest quintiles.

This divides the population into two groups: happy and not-yet-happy.   Figure 31 shows the cross-tabulation between the incidence of happy and the household per capita income quintile over time. Comparisons across income quintiles show that the incidence of happy people is lowest in among the poorest group for both time periods (22.1% in 2015 and 29.2% in 2022) – so there is some relationship. But is it as strong as many imagine?  In 2015, the top-two income quintiles had the highest share of happy people (57.2% and 62.2%). In 2022, all three higher quintiles had roughly the same share of happy people (there is no signiﬁcant difference between them), which was higher than the bottom two quintiles. But the richest quintile was not ‘happier’ than the third or even the middle quintile. People in the top 60% of incomes have similar shares of happy people – the richer segments do not have more.   An additional ﬁnding is that, compared to 2015 data, GNH diverges further from income in 2022 than previously. In 2015, the richest income quintile had a higher proportion of happy people than in 2022 (62.2% vs. 58.6% were happy people). Yet even in 2015, despite being in the
<<<PAGE=165>>>
Understanding the GNH Index 
 133 
highest income quintile, over one-third of the richest group (37.8%) was not-yet-happy.   At the other end of the income spectrum, in the poorest income quintile, in 2022 over one-quarter of people (29.2%) are categorised as happy, while in the second poorest quintile more than two in ﬁve people (42.4%) are happy. By the third quintile this is over half of people (54.2%). So among the poorer 40% of society many more are in the happy group in 2022. In 2015, only 22.1% of the poorest quintile people were classiﬁed as happy and 26.1% of the next poorest quintile were happy.   Still, in 2022, roughly 30% of the happy population in Bhutan belong to the two poorest quintiles and over half (52.2%) to the poorest three quintiles. So over half of the people classiﬁed as ‘happy’ have incomes in the bottom 60% of the population – a clear and thought-provoking ﬁnding, especially given the income focus of present policy discourse.   Figure 31: Percentage of happy people across household per capita income quintile, 2015- 22 
 Source: Author’s computations from 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  Furthermore, the trend depicted in Figure 32 also indicates that that the not-yet-happy category includes a sizable proportion of the bottom-two income quintiles. Remember that incidence of happy people is a mirror image of the incidence of not-yet-happy people. This means that in

2022, 41.4% (100% - 58.6%) of richest income quintile are in the not-yet-happy group. In 2022, 43.6% of the ‘next richest’ quintile were not-yet-happy. Despite being in the top-two income quintiles, there are still considerable proportions of people who are not-yet-happy. Similar insights emerge from 2015, with 37.8% of the richest quintile classiﬁed as not-yet-happy.  Analysis of both the incidence of happy and not-yet-happy groups illustrates that there are people who earn less but are happy. And similarly there are people who are wealthy and yet are categorised as not-yet-happy. This is what distinguishes the GNH Index from income, and relatedly, from GDP. Income is not proportionate to the GNH Index. Both measures are needed as they provide interestingly different measures.   Figure 32: Percentage of not-yet-happy people across household per capita income quintile, 2015- 2022 
 Source: Author’s computations from 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  Next, we examine the distribution of happiness among the four happiness groups. People are classiﬁed into four groups based on their level of sufﬁciency across the 33 indicators: deeply happy, extensively happy, narrowly happy, and unhappy. Deeply happy people have adequacy in 77% to 100% of the 33 indicators; extensively happy

people have sufﬁciency in 66% to 76%; narrowly happy people have sufﬁcient in 50% to 65%; and unhappy people have the least sufﬁciency level (0% to 49%).   We ﬁnd that the poorest people, or the bottom 20% of the income quintile, have the largest proportions of unhappy people and the lowest proportions of deeply happy people – showing a clear relationship of extreme values. In 2022, the richest (top 20% of income quintile) had the highest share of deeply happy people (15.3%) and the lowest proportion of unhappy people (2.3%) (Figure 33).  Yet in 2022, the richest group of people (top quintile) do not have the highest percentage of people who are extensively happy: 43.3% of the top income quintile are extensively happy, then 45.3% in the second-richest income quintile, and 43.5% in the middle quintile.   In 2022, 39.1% of the richest group are narrowly happy, which indicates they have sufﬁciency in only 50% to 65.9% of the GNH indicators. As shared earlier, despite belonging to the richest segment, 41.4% (39.1+2.3) of the population is still in the not-yet-happy group (narrowly happy plus unhappy). So despite having some relationship in extreme values of GNH, income is not highly correlated with GNH.

A look at the 2015 survey data also depicts similar trends.   But has the distribution changed? Have the rich people become happier, and have the poorest people’s sufﬁciency decreased further?   If we look at top income quintile (richest), the proportion of deeply happy people has remained the same (15.3% in 2015 and 2022) but the proportion of extensively happy people has decreased (46.9% in 2015 to 43.3% in 2022). This ﬁnding reiterates that the GNH Index goes beyond income and that it considers many factors that equally contribute to happiness, such as relationships, health, environment, and culture. Money can certainly provide a certain level of comfort and security, but it does not guarantee sufﬁciency in the other GNH conditions that make a vital contribution to overall wellbeing and happiness.   If we shift our focus on the second-top income quintile, the ‘next richest’, the proportion of deeply happy people has deteriorated over time. However, share of extensively happy people has increased (44.3% in 2015 to 45.3% in 2022).   There has been the most progress among the poorest section in the extensively happy category, which has improved from 19.9% in 2015 to 26.3% in 2022.   Overall, we see that progress in income does not mirror progress in GNH. Thus, there is a weaker relationship between income quintile and GNH in 2022, compared to 2015. These ﬁndings demonstrate a weakly favourable association between income and the GNH Index. A favourable association is expected considering that the GNH Index includes living standards as one of its domains.   Yet, it is worth noting that the GNH Index and income are not the same thing. If we rated people solely based on their GNH Index and income, we would get different results. What would be interesting to see further is if this association strengthens or weakens as people become wealthier. Does having more money lead to increased happiness or life satisfaction over time?

Let us now examine the average sufﬁciency and insufﬁciency among various income quintiles in the happy (deeply plus extensively happy) and not-yet-happy (narrowly plus unhappy) categories.  The average degree of sufﬁciency in the happy group did not differ signiﬁcantly across the ﬁve household per capita income levels (Figure 34). The poorest happy people have an average sufﬁciency score of 71.2% during both years, whereas the richest happy people have an average sufﬁciency score of around 73.7%. The difference though marginal is found to be signiﬁcant.   Figure 34: Average sufﬁciency in the 33 indicators across household per capita income quintile among happy people, 2015–22 
 Note: Error bars represent 95% conﬁdence intervals.  Source: Author’s computations from 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  Looking at the sufﬁciency levels across the not-yet-happy group, across time, average sufﬁciency appears to be slightly higher in the richer groups than in the poorer ones. In 2022, the top income earners have sufﬁciency in 59.4% of the GNH indicators, while the bottom income earners have sufﬁciency in 55.7% (Figure 35). However, there is no statistically signiﬁcant difference between people in the middle and two richer quintiles.

 Note: Error bars represent 95% conﬁdence intervals. Source: Author’s computations from 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  Let us delve deeper into the deprivations because these are critical for policy considerations. Figure 36 compares deprivations (uncensored deprivation headcount ratios) in each indicator between the richest and poorest quintiles for 2022. The height of the bar shows the percentage of people in each quintile who lack sufﬁciency in each of the 33 indicators. So, are there any distinctions? Are the wealthiest always better off?  Looking ﬁrst at indicators under psychological wellbeing and health indicators, deprivations are higher for the poorest. Monetary poor people have more challenges in health and psychological wellbeing than wealthy people. Similarly, the poorest quintile have higher deprivations in three education indicators (knowledge, literacy and schooling). When it comes to the value indicator, however, the richest people have a higher level of deprivations. 8.7% of the richest people are value deprived, compared to 1.9% of the poorest people.  The wealthiest people have greater problems with sleep since their level of sleep deprivations is higher. In terms of cultural participation, the poorest people are doing better, possibly because they socialise more at community festivals and gatherings. More of the richest group believe that Driglam Namzha is less important or is declining than the

poorest group. The richest group has larger deprivations in political engagement, meaning that they participate less proactively in zomdues and may possibly plan not to vote.  The richest people have worse community relationships since higher levels of deprivation are reported (64% of the richest people compared to 47.2% of the poorest). The richest people also donate less (61.2% are insufﬁcient compared to 41.4 % of the poorest). This implies that people with higher incomes tend to donate a smaller percentage of their income or volunteer fewer days than people with far lower incomes.

So how do these patterns play out over time for the richest and poorest quintiles? Let us look at some absolute changes in censored deprivation headcount ratios across the 33 indicators (Figure 37).  The highest decrease in the share of deprivation and not-yet-happy among the poorest people is in the housing indicator under the domain of living standards (-39.9 percentage points). The next highest decrease is in the services indicator. There is an improvement in almost all the indicators of the poorest group. Censored deprivations have also increased for healthy days (+11.8 percentage points) and political participation (+7.9 percentage points). Deprivation in healthy days has increased for both the richest and poorest people. Yet, the deterioration in health is more pronounced among the poorest people.  Since 2015, the richest group has seen little improvement in the indicators. The highest increase has been observed in the positive emotions indicator. However, there is a decrease in the proportion of people in the richest quintile who are happy and have achieved sufﬁciency in the culture indicators. There is also a decrease in the share of censored deprivation headcount in political participation among the richest quintile (+7 percentage points).   Both income quintiles (poorest and richest) improved the family and safety indicators under the community vitality domain, meaning that their family relationships are better and the communities in which they live are safer. Since 2015, deprivations in environmental threats, which include pollution and disasters, have decreased for both rich and poor people. Mental health has also improved for both groups (richest and poorest).   Work and sleep hours have deteriorated within the top income quintile group as the level of deprivation for both measures has increased signiﬁcantly since 2015. As previously noted, the wealthiest also lag behind in the value indicator. The poorest quintile’s lack of political participation has also grown over time. This suggests that, compared to 2015, the poorest elements of society are less interested in zomdues and are less likely to vote in 2022 – although more than the richest quintile. The richest and poorest quintiles therefore clearly have different kinds of GNH challenges.

Another way of understanding the difference between GNH Index and income is by looking at each of the three indicators in living standards which includes asset ownership, housing, and household per capita income. As discussed previously, each of the 33 GNH indicators has a speciﬁc sufﬁciency cutoff that determines whether a person is sufﬁcient or insufﬁcient in the indicator.   For this particular analysis, we apply these indicator sufﬁciency cutoffs to get an overall indicator representing the count of sufﬁciency in the living standards domain.  For example, people are classiﬁed as '0' if they are deprived in none of the three living standards indicators, '1' if they are sufﬁcient in one but deprived in the other two indicators, '2' if they are sufﬁcient in any two but deprived in one, and '3' if they are not sufﬁcient in any of the three indicators.46   We observe that nearly 60% of people are not deprived in any of the three living standards indicators (59.5%); while 31.1% are deprived in one, 8.3% in two, and only 1.1% in all three indicators. We then compare the happy groups based on the number of sufﬁciency indicators in the three living standards indicators.   Figure 38 shows a positive connection, that is, when people achieve sufﬁciency in more of the living standard indicators, there are bigger proportions in the happy group (deeply happy and extensively happy). Nonetheless, approximately 6.7% of people who enjoy sufﬁciency in none of the living standards indicators are extensively happy, and one in six (15.8+0.7=16.5%) of those who are deprived in two of the three living standard indicators are deeply or extensively happy.     46 The 2022 GNH survey data estimations using sampling weights indicate that 59.5% have sufficiency in 3 living standards indicators (sample size (n) is 6,160), 31.1% have sufficiency in 2 (n is 3,600), 8.3% in any 1 indicator (n is 1,069), and finally 1.1% in none of the indicators (n is 158). Sample sizes given are actual, that is without the application of sampling weights.

 Source: Author’s computations from 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  Next, we analyse the perception on wealth status variable. This question, which is part of the GNH survey questionnaire, asks respondents how they feel in terms of their wealth status in their community. There are ﬁve response categories for this indicator; extremely poorer than most households, a little poorer than most households, about the same as most households, a little wealthier than most households and much wealthier than most households.47   This statistic represents the qualitative counterpart to the income quintile. It addresses people's perceptions of where they fall on the income scale. Slightly sharper trends to the objective income measure can be seen (Figure 39). Over 20% of people who feel extremely poor in the community are extensively happy (18.5%) or deeply happy (1.7%). Nearly 30% of those who believe they are a little poorer than  47 The 2022 GNH survey data found that around 1.2% said they feel extremely poorer than most households (sample size (n) is 154), 13% said they feel a little poorer (n is 1,515), 79% said about the same as most households (n is 8,729), 4.6% feel a little wealthier (n is 483), 0.2% said extremely wealthier than most households (n is 18). The sample sizes are actual, that is, before sampling weights are applied.

most households are classiﬁed as extensively happy (24.9%) or deeply happy (4.6%). So again, GNH and income often diverge.   When we zoom in on the group that feels considerably wealthier than most households, we discover that 29.1% are narrowly happy and 3.2% are unhappy, despite their self-assessment that they are richer than others. All these ﬁndings indicate that the GNH Index is somewhat related to wealth, but is a more precise and comprehensive measure. It takes into account other areas of life that are frequently overlooked in the pursuit of economic prosperity.  Figure 39: Percentage of people across happiness gradients and perception of wealth status, 2022  
Source: Author’s computations from 2015 and 2022 GNH Surveys  Looking at the GNH rankings of districts using data sources from the Bhutan Living Standard Survey Report (BLSSR) 2022, we might expect a correlation that is with high income districts tending to have high level of GNH. Strikingly, this relationship is not evident. Rather, Thimphu, which has the highest yearly family income per capita, falls in the middle when evaluated by the GNH Index (it ranks 10 out of 20). Bumthang ranks highest on the GNH Index in 2022, yet it is not a wealthy district. Tashi Yangtse, which ranks the lowest in terms of the GNH Index, is not the poorest district (Figure 40).

Similarly, districts with high levels of happiness and wellbeing may not have more money. A district with high levels of community engagement and environmental sustainability, for example, may have lower income levels but rank highly on the GNH Index. A district with high income but low levels of social cohesiveness and environmental sustainability, on the other hand, may rank lower on the GNH Index.

The results discussed in this chapter provide a deﬁnitive conclusion to our study that is the GNH Index and the monetary measures of income measure very different phenomena. Income measures cover one facet of wellbeing, namely economic prosperity, whereas GNH captures nine domains that contribute to total wellbeing. And they are not even highly correlated. This is vital to keep in mind when comparing income measures with the GNH Index. For instance, a nation with high income levels may experience difﬁculties in other GNH measures, which may have a detrimental impact on the welfare of its population. In contrast, a nation with a high GNH takes into account both income levels and living standards through its domain of living standards, as well as other equally important factors that support a high quality of life for its population.

Chapter 4: Exploring Happy Profiles in the GNH Index This chapter presents a range of proﬁles that GNH happy people experience. The GNH proﬁles show the different and various paths to ﬂourishing that people are already pursuing. As per the GNH Index, happy Bhutanese have pursued a wide variety of different vivid and creative ways of ﬂourishing. There is no ‘one size ﬁts all’ – and each person can shape and advance their own fulﬁlment and joy in life. Those who are happy according to the GNH Index will usually lack, or have chosen not to pursue, sufﬁciency in some indicators according to their circumstances or values.   The chapter provides anecdotes and narratives on people's lives. In particular, it highlights personas depicting various ﬂourishing patterns in GNH, typical of certain groups. Personas, in this context, are ﬁctional characters that represent common behaviours, motivations, and challenges people face across the 33 GNH indicators. By creating personas of happy people with different GNH proﬁles, policy makers can gain a deeper understanding of the diverse paths to happy lives in a pluralistic GNH society, which in turn can help recommend policies and programmatic action plans that afﬁrm diverse life plans. Methodology To create proﬁles, three levels of analysis were performed on 2022 GNH survey data, mainly involving the status of the GNH Index and 33 indicators. The aim was to examine the data for patterns that could help uncover common features and behaviours among happy Bhutanese people. Note that the happy people here refer to those who have achieved sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the weighted domains or indicators. In an attempt to develop more focused personalities and life conditions, proﬁle clustering was carried out on common indicators that happy people enjoyed sufﬁciency in.   Redundancy tests were carried out, and then censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios for a range of common demographic clusters of GNH

happy people were investigated. Narratives were developed for the various settings and conditions for the 33 indicators by integrating the patterns and trends that emerged from the investigation. Our proﬁles include sketches of the environmental conditions, attitudes, and behaviours across the nine GNH domains, and were further informed by a subsample of qualitative ﬁeld interviews carried out during the GNH survey period.  Lets look at the process in greater depth. Redundancy coefﬁcients were ﬁrst generated to assess the strengths of association across GNH indicators. Using the redundancy coefﬁcient we generate the proportion of happy people who are sufﬁcient in any of the two indicators.   Proportion of happy people who are sufficient in two indicators  Proportion of happy people who are sufficient in two indicators= (Redundancy coefficient*minimum value from the two censored sufficiency headcount ratios)/Share of happy people  Example: Redundancy coefficient is 52% between positive and negative emotions. Positive emotions’ censored sufficiency headcount ratio is 25% of the population and for negative emotion, it’s 27.5%. So the minimum of both numbers (which by definition is the denominator) is 25%. What this means is that 52% of 25% - so .52 x 25% = 13% of the population. We know that 48.1% of the population have been classified ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy people in 2022, hence this means that 13%/48.1% = 27% of all ‘deeply’ or ‘extensively’ happy people have sufficiency in both the indicators (positive emotion and negative emotion)  The estimate explained in the box show the percentage of the population that are both happy but have achieved sufﬁciency in both indicators. So, if the estimate is 100%, it means happy people who could have had sufﬁciency in both indicators actually have both. If the estimate is 0%, then none of the happy people are sufﬁcient in both indicators at the same time. The redundancy tests thus make visible the interactions and overlaps between indicators. and help us in understanding traits that are related. This helps us to identify indicators that appear to trend in the same direction. These observations are eventually integrated in the proﬁle narratives.

Second, subsamples were created based on the insights drawn from the redundancy analysis and using seven demographic features including gender (male and female); occupational status (farmers, public/private/self-employed/freelance working in non-farming sector, homemaker, student, monk/nun and pensioner); age (young referring to those aged 15 to 29, middle-aged for those from 30 to 59 and elderly for those who are 60 and above); educational level; region (urban and rural); marital status (never married or married); and household size (single household, small household of two to ﬁve members). Demographic clusters with an unweighted sample size with at least 50 people were selected. Table 25 depicts the 11 demographic combinations organised based on sex and occupation, which are further divided based on age, region, and education level.   Third, to enhance the construction of the proﬁles, we examine censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios (the share of population who are happy and sufﬁcient in each indicator) of the subsamples. This is further animated by qualitative interviews that were carried out by CBS researchers.  Redundancy analysis across GNH indicators The redundancy table for the censored sufﬁciency matrix for 2022 is shown in Table 24. Remember that the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios represent the proportion of people who are happy and experience sufﬁciency in each indicator. The redundancy coefﬁcient is the percentage of the population that experience censored sufﬁciency in both indicators divided by lower of the two censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios (which are presented in the lowest row).   Through the assessment of redundancy coefﬁcients, we ﬁnd common clusters and patterns of sufﬁciency levels that individuals experience. While analysis can be carried in multiple ways, we start by concentrating on the highest and lowest redundancy coefﬁcients between indicators.  Let us start by explaining the redundancy results by explaining with more examples. The life satisfaction trends well with the mental health indicator (96.7%) and native language indicator (96.2%). If we compute
<<<PAGE=185>>>
Exploring Happy Proﬁles in the GNH Index 
 153 
the joint distributions then we get that around 2.5% (0.967*2.62 where 2.6% is the lower censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio, in this case it belongs to mental health indicator). So, 2.5% of the population are sufﬁcient in life satisfaction and mental health indicator and of the happy people, 5.3% (2.5/48.1) have achieved sufﬁciency in both life satisfaction and mental health indicator.   Overall, we may deduce that if a proﬁle has high levels of life satisfaction, they may also have high levels of value and native language ﬂuency. Similarly, a proﬁle that has high life satisfaction may also have good mental health. The proﬁle may be expanded to add a story on how they have a high number of healthy days. This proﬁle may also include aspects such as a high safety index and good ecological conditions. Since life satisfaction has a high level of redundancy with all the indicators, this proﬁle would enjoy high level of sufﬁciency in the GNH indicators.  Looking at some more indicators, compared to the other indicators, positive emotions do not have a high redundancy with negative emotions. For example, we observe a redundancy coefﬁcient of 52% which would mean that 13% of the population (have sufﬁciency in both indicator and 27% of all happy people have sufﬁciency in both. This suggests that happy people who express strong positive feelings may express strong negative emotions. Happy people who are sufﬁcient in positive emotions does not imply that they will be sufﬁcient in negative emotions and vice versa.   The spirituality measure has the least overlap with schooling (49.7%). This suggests that among the population (0.497*22.6 (22.6% is the lower censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio. Here it belongs to spirituality) 11.2% have sufﬁciency in both spirituality and schooling. 23% (11.2/48.1) are happy and sufﬁcient in both the indicators.   Let look at mental health and work. Redundancy coefﬁcient is 57.5%. The lower censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio belongs to work (25.5%), hence 14.7% (0.575*25.5) of the population are sufﬁcient in both mental health and work, and among happy people the percentage
<<<PAGE=186>>>
GNH 2022 
 154 
is (14.7/48.1) 30.6%. This indicates the presence of happy people who have rated low on mental health and low on work.    In terms of the knowledge indicator under the education domain, the redundancy coefﬁcients indicate that people who have sufﬁciency in the knowledge indicator may not have sufﬁciency in the Driglam Namzha indicator since their joint distribution is the lowest. This means that people who have an understanding of the Constitution, local legends, local festivals and HIV/AIDs, perceive the practice of Driglam Namzha to be deteriorating.   Table 24 shows low redundancy coefﬁcients in red (indicating low redundancy), medium in yellow, and high redundancy coefﬁcients in green. The censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios are on the bottom line of the table. Note that to incur a conclusion, share of joint distributions need to be estimated based on the formula provided in the box above.

GNH profiles We now turn to expressing the variety of paths of GNH proﬁles using typologies based on combinations of different demographical characteristics. Table 25 presents 11 broad proﬁle clusters, each of which have an adequate sample size. Further subgroups are probed to create diverse proﬁles. Each of these proﬁles are built using the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios for indicators. A list of indicators with greater, medium, and low sufﬁciency headcounts are recorded to be incorporated into the proﬁle narratives. Additional insights were also drawn from redundancy test results to verify that the narratives capture GNH conditions that are associated with one another.

As cited earlier, each proﬁle has been chosen so that the sample size is at least 50 observations. The proﬁles were generated by assessing happy people’s life circumstances across the GNH 33 indicators. It should be noted that the characterisations were based on the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios, which means that if the ratios were high, the narratives would provide a good spin to the story, and if the ratio was low (deprivation), the narratives would offer a negative spin. Similarly, insights from redundancy coefﬁcients, that is sensing indicators that are associated (high joint distributions) were kept in mind so that they were well portrayed in the narratives. Table 26 shows the unweighted sample sizes of the proﬁles identiﬁed and Table 27 presents the censored sufﬁciency headcount ratios across the nine proﬁles.

1. A 28-year-old educated female farmer from rural Lhuentse  In the 2022 GNH survey, there were approximately 200 young females aged less than 30 years, literate farmers from small households, that is households with at least three to ﬁve members and living in rural areas.   Pema Choden, 28 years old, had ﬁnished lower-middle school but had to drop out to help her parents on the farm. She had two younger siblings to look after and has experience working on her family's farm since she was 8 years old. She enjoyed working on the farm and had become an expert in vegetable gardening. She has been classiﬁed deeply happy as she has achieved sufﬁciency in 79% of the weighted GNH indicators.   Psychological wellbeing: Generally, she is content with her existence in the village. She adores her village and experiences strong social connections. She feels content and joy when she is weaving. She also enjoys farming activities, but at times she is also worried as a result of farming obstacles such as wildlife damage and rising issues with irrigation sources. She fears that if these challenges worsen, her family’s livelihood may suffer. She considers herself a Buddhist and as spiritual person visits locations of spiritual signiﬁcance during holy days, but she has never meditated or recited prayers on a regular basis.  Health: Pema is in good health overall, but she does get fatigued when tasks get out of hand.   Time use: She frequently needs to travel to the village labour exchange because she is the eldest in the family and her parents are aging. That can be especially stressful for households like hers, where the majority of the members are females. Because they are perceived to have less strength, they frequently obtain fewer offers for labour exchange. She works an average of 14 hours every day. She gets up at 5.30 a.m. and goes to bed between 8 and 9 p.m. She is either weaving, working in the ﬁeld or cooking, cleaning, and performing other domestic duties. She also at times engages in paid labour to earn extra cash. In her village, she often needs to trade her labour for the labour of others, rather than relying on cash payments. For example, one farmer may need help with
<<<PAGE=194>>>
GNH 2022 
 162 
planting or harvesting crops, while another may need help repairing a fence or building a house. Farmers in her village often exchange their labour, with each providing the other with the assistance they need. She can, however, sleep undisturbed.  Education: She has completed middle school and is frequently depended on by locals to assist them in communicating with people via social media. While she learned most of her farming skills through informal channels such as family and neighbourhood networks, she attempts to learn more about farming through social media. She knows little about the Constitution or historical stories.  Cultural diversity and resilience: Kurtop, her mother tongue, is spoken by everyone in her household and in the neighbourhood. She also does a lot of weaving, which she acquired from her mother. She enjoys cultural activities such as festivals and rituals, which are frequently held at the community Lhakhang. However, due to pandemic-related restrictions, such gatherings have been drastically reduced in recent years. She believes that, as a result of modernisation, Driglam Namzha has deteriorated with time and is becoming weaker, as most adolescents are not interested in practicing it.  Good governance: She is often expected to attend most village-level meetings because she is one of the few educated members of the community. She also represents her family. Most of the time, she observes and listens in order to help those who are having difﬁculty comprehending developmental jargon. She voiced her suggestion on a wildlife issue once during a meeting. She believes that government performance has not improved signiﬁcantly, it has remained consistent throughout time. She is aware of her fundamental rights, but she frequently believes that individuals with more power and money have more say and beneﬁts. In terms of services, the distance to the nearest BHU is minimal, but she believes that the health service BHU should be upgraded. She is pleased with the gewog’s energy connection and the quality of drinking water.  Community vitality: She was born and raised in the village and hence has a strong sense of belonging to it. She adores her family, especially
<<<PAGE=195>>>
Exploring Happy Proﬁles in the GNH Index 
 163 
her parents and siblings, with whom she has a wonderful bond. Her neighbourhood is likewise quite safe; there is no crime in the hamlet. She could leave her house without locking it, and no one would steal anything. Members routinely donate one other's time during times of need due to the community's cohesiveness. For example, upon her neighbour's funeral, she volunteered for the rites for up to 14 days.   Ecological diversity and resilience: She has had a fascination with the forest since she was a child. She would frequently join her father to the forest in search of non-wood resources, which her father had trained her to collect in a sustainable manner. She is deeply grateful for the local environment and natural resources, which has helped bring in extra cash, and aims to use these resources responsibly for their livelihoods. She appreciates the pure air and water in the village and compares it to those in the capital, which are contaminated. She believes that everyone is accountable for environmental conservation. Her sole grievance is with the wildlife that has become a menace to the crops.  Living standards: Pema is satisﬁed with the dwelling quality in which she now resides. While her weaving and farm produce provide a good living, she believes the community has restricted access to resources and market prospects, which may limit the village’s export opportunities. Her family owns approximately three acres of property, which is plenty for the time being. She believes that if she had easy access to markets, she could earn better prices for her textiles and crops.  2. A 70-year-old illiterate female farmer from rural Pema Gatshel   The 2022 GNH survey included 531 elderly (60 and older) illiterate female farmers. The persona here was created by evaluating the conditions across the 33 indicators for this particular demographic proﬁle.   Categorised under the extensively happy group, Karma Lhadon, a 70-year-old Pema Gatshel woman, lives in a rural area. She enjoys sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the 33 GNH indicators. She has spent her entire life as a farmer. Pema is illiterate, having never had the opportunity to attend formal school. She is the mother of six children,
<<<PAGE=196>>>
GNH 2022 
 164 
three sons and three daughters. Her husband passed away a few years ago. Her youngest child is 18 years old, just ﬁnished grade 12, and is in the capital looking for work. Others work for the government in surrounding districts. The household is now headed by the eldest daughter and her husband.  Psychological wellbeing: Karma's life is marked by a strong sense of positivity. She enjoys and is satisﬁed with her career, and she takes pride in providing for her family. Her relationship with nature also gives her a sense of tranquillity and calm. Karma, on the other hand, has negative emotions, especially when her crops are devastated by wildlife. Despite the difﬁculties, being a highly spiritual person, she feels resilient. She believes in the power of the local deities to keep her and her family safe, and her harvests prosperous.  Health: Despite facing some challenges due to her age, such as joint pain, difﬁculty in walking and deteriorating eyesight, Karma remains optimistic and happy. Her active lifestyle and diet, which includes locally grown produce and free-range cattle, she credits for her otherwise good health. She has access to basic healthcare facilities in her community.   Time use: Karma devotes the most of her time to farming and caring for her family. She spends the majority of her days in her ﬁelds assisting her daughter and her son in law in growing a range of crops such as maize, and vegetables. She often spends the night in the ﬁeld to protect her crops from wild animals. Monkeys stole more than half of their harvest last year.   Education: Karma feels that she has limited access to opportunities since she never went to school. She is unfamiliar with HIV/AIDs and the Constitution, but she is familiar with tales of local legends. She has, nonetheless, obtained practical farming knowledge and skills. She does not have access to contemporary technology such as smartphones, so she must rely on word-of-mouth communication to keep up with current events. She cherishes education, though, and encourages her children and grandkids to pursue it. She believes that education can provide them with more options and improve their overall quality of life.

Cultural diversity and resilience: Like most Bhutanese, she is proud of her Bhutanese ancestry and culture. She speaks tshanglakha and is never seen in any other dress but kira. She believes that it is critical to preserve Bhutanese culture for future generations. She used to weave, but her eyesight no longer allows this. Likewise, she is not able to participate in cultural activities as she did when young. She also feels the traditional code of etiquette is deteriorating overall.   Good governance: She is aware of Bhutan's democratic system, but she does not actively participate in zomdues due to a lack of exposure. She also feels she has limited knowledge on how government is performing overall and whether services are being delivered effectively. However, she is aware of the government's agricultural programmes in the village and feels that they beneﬁt farmers like herself.  Community vitality: Karma's community is small but supportive. She has numerous friends and family who come to see her and assist her with her farming operations. She also takes part in community events like festivals and religious ceremonies, which give her a sense of belonging and connection.   Ecological diversity and resilience: Karma has a deep awareness of the environment around her, despite her lack of formal schooling. In the past the community encountered difﬁculties such as forest ﬁres, but they banded together to assist one another. Karma believes that overcoming misfortune requires community resilience.  Living standards: Karma and her family at times struggle to make ends meet despite working hard every day to tend to their crops and livestock. One of the most serious problems they confront is the loss of crops and animals due to wildlife. Karma lives in a region where wild animals such as monkeys and boars frequently assault their property, destroying crops and killing cattle. The dwelling also requires minor repairs.

3. A 45-year-old educated male farmer from Paro  The 2022 GNH survey included 83 middle-aged (30 to 59) educated farmers from rural regions.   Tenzin Dendup has been classiﬁed in the deeply happy group as he enjoys sufﬁciency in at least 77% of the nine domains of GNH. He has three children, all of whom are in school.  Psychological well-being: Tenzin is typically happy with his life, but is frequently concerned about the education of his children. One of them is not doing well in school. He is frequently frustrated when his children do not listen to him when it comes to studying. However, he ﬁnds peace due to his strong sense of spirituality, but he is unable to keep up with the practices, including prayer recitation and meditation. He tries to be as kind and forgiving as possible.  Health: Tenzin puts a great deal of importance on his health. His busy farm life keeps him ﬁt, and while he often feels agitated when his farm product does not fetch the right price, he relies on rental income to make ends meet. He rents out one room in his traditional house to a teacher.   Time use: Tenzin gets up early and spends the majority of his day working on his farm. He also has a Facebook page where he promotes agricultural products. He wished he could spend more time with his family, but farm labour keeps him busy and work typically ﬁnishes only by 8 p.m., leaving him little time for leisure. He also attends community meetings and events. He can, however, sleep well.  Education: Tenzin studied until middle secondary school in Paro. He often browses the internet to explore innovative farming methods and to learn more about seed varieties.   Cultural diversity and resilience: Tenzin is proud of his native tongue, but he is concerned that his children prefer to communicate in English rather than Dzongkha. He has some artisan talents, such as masonry, carpentry, and painting. He tries to attend as many community events
<<<PAGE=199>>>
Exploring Happy Proﬁles in the GNH Index 
 167 
as possible, although he is sometimes too busy. He believes that the younger generation is less interested in culture and Driglam Namzha.  Good governance: He is concerned about the performance of the government in providing services. He believes that health and education services may be improved further. He is completely informed of his rights and frequently attends village or town-level meetings. During such discussions, he expresses his thoughts. He also advocates for policies that support small-scale farmers and sustainable farming practices.  Community vitality: No crime has been reported in his village. He trusts almost all his community members and at times donates to initiatives for community development, such as the repair of village lhakhangs. He has a solid bond with his siblings and a happy marriage.  Ecological diversity and resilience: His village has not witnessed ecological disasters for a long time. Tenzin is dedicated to any environmental conservation efforts, no matter how minor. Despite the fact that there are fewer wild animals in his village compared to other villages in Bhutan, wild boars occasionally destroy his rice.  Living standards: Tenzin's income is largely dependent on his farm's productivity, which can be variable. He also owns an apple orchard and earns a rental income. He and his family live comfortably and have access to basic amenities, such as clean water and electricity.   4. A 38-year-old educated male working in corporate sector in Thimphu  In the 2022 survey, 193 educated married males aged 30 to 59 working in public/corporate/self-employed/freelance are captured.  Dorji Gyeltshen is a Bachelor of Business Management graduate who has worked for the Bank of Bhutan for 14 years. He is married and has two children. He has been classed as deeply happy since he has sufﬁciency in almost 80% of the 33 weighted indicators.
<<<PAGE=200>>>
GNH 2022 
 168 
Psychological wellbeing: Dorji is thankful for everything he has in life. Nonetheless, as a senior ofﬁcer, he frequently suffers from stress as a result of the demands of his position. He can occasionally get frustrated when he is not able to motivate his subordinates to work effectively. Dorji makes it a point to pray almost every day, but ﬁnds it difﬁcult to meditate. Even during stressful times, he ﬁnds that reciting prayers in the morning helps him stay focused and calm. He also believes in the value of compassion for oneself and others, while he admits that it can be difﬁcult at times to handle every issue at work with love and empathy. Generally, he is content with his life.  Health: He is not particularly health-conscious, but he does go for walks on occasion. He also tries to avoid processed foods and sugary drinks, preferring to consume fresh foods and vegetables. He is in good physical and mental health. He recognises the need of getting treatment or counselling when he requires mental assistance. He considers mental health to be just as vital as physical health.  Time use: He often feels overworked. While he understands the importance of a work-life balance as a corporate sector employee, work demands do not allow him to make time for leisure activities and personal fulﬁlment outside of work. At times he ends up working 12 hours a day, which also disturbs his sleep routines.   Education: Dorji believes in the value of lifelong learning and is constantly looking for methods to increase his knowledge and skills. If given the chance, he would like to pursue his master's degree. He reads largely about things related to his job and hence has been rated poor in knowledge indicator which covers the Constitution, local legends, and so on.   Cultural diversity and resilience: Dorji's rigorous job schedule has hampered his ability to participate in Bhutanese cultural activities such as traditional dances, festivals, and ceremonies. While he is familiar with the basic principles of Driglam Namzha he has not had the opportunity to practice it extensively in his daily life. He also believes that it is rapidly deteriorating in cities. He has also not had the opportunity to develop artisan skills such as weaving, painting, and woodwork, but he is
<<<PAGE=201>>>
Exploring Happy Proﬁles in the GNH Index 
 169 
proﬁcient in his mother tongue and communicates with family and friends in it on a regular basis.  Good governance: He has had negative experiences with government service delivery, such as delays and inefﬁciency in acquiring permissions and licenses. He is also dissatisﬁed with the health-care system. He believes that the political parties at times have failed to keep their promises and have been ineffective in meeting the demands of the population. He is concerned about the rising number of young competent Bhutanese emigrating to Australia. Dorji understands his fundamental rights as a citizen. Due to his hectic work schedule, he has not been actively participating in meetings or civic engagement.  Community vitality: Considering that he was born and brought up in Zhemgang, he does not feel a strong feeling of belonging to Thimphu. He may also be unable to trust everyone in Thimphu or the Pamtsho community where he is now residing. He has a close relationship with his family and appreciates their support and connection. Despite his lack of community connections, Dorji feels safe in his community and has had no safety concerns.

The persona presented here represents the life circumstances of a young single, extensively happy female who has sufﬁciency in 66% to 76% of the 33 weighted indicators.  Dechen Wangmo is a single woman who runs a modest retail clothing store in Phuntsholing. She moved from Chukha, where our parents are currently residing.

She frequently experiences negative feelings such as worry, anxiety, and annoyance, owing to the difﬁculties of running her retail business. Her retail shop has seen fewer clients as a result of the pandemic. She also experiences positive emotions, including contentment at times, but when her business is struggling, she becomes overwhelmed. Dechen is content with her life, yet she suffers from stress and worry relating to her business and personal life.  Health: In terms of health, she is in usually decent physical condition. But owning a business may be stressful at times, and she does face stress on occasion, particularly when she is unable to sell her products. She sometimes has to rely on her parents and siblings to pay her rent.  Time use: Though she has set her work hours to be acceptable, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., she occasionally opens the business till 11 p.m. She would not describe herself as overworked because she simply has to interact with consumers. But, there are occasions when the stress of ﬁnancial demands interferes with her ability to sleep. As the owner of a small business, she is responsible for paying rent, merchandise, and other expenses that can quickly add up. When business is slow or unforeseen expenses occur, this can cause a great deal of tension and anxiety.

<<<PAGE=208>>>
GNH 2022 
 176 
that its relevance is deteriorating as well as its practice. With his family, he speaks in his native dialect (tshanglakha).  Good governance: Tshering has never been to zomdues, but he is very curious about how the government functions and how it affects his day-to-day life.

Chapter 5: Policy Implications of the GNH Index The GNH Index has become a well-established measure of wellbeing and holistic progress that goes beyond typical GDP and economic growth. The GNH Index measures human ﬂourishing through nine domains and 33 indicators. So far, this book has looked at the 2022 GNH Index and changes over time, the GNH Index's relationship with income, and introduced multiple GNH proﬁles. What is most essential, however, is that all ﬁndings from the preceding chapters culminate in what it implies for policymaking. After all, the GNH Index was created to help guide policy decisions. It was designed to assist policymakers and programme administrators in not just tracking GNH but also in setting targets and centralising and reinforcing GNH evidence across various stages of policymaking, planning, and programming.  While it is interesting to learn about the trends among those who are happy, policy wise it is more beneﬁcial to study the not-yet-happy group.  The ultimate objective of the GNH Index measure is to create a society in which not-yet-happy people are not left behind, and where there is a continual improvement of their GNH circumstances, whether that be a good living standard or a vibrant community relationship or being able to get enough sleep. The 33 indicators provide a range of conditions that needs to be fulﬁlled for a person to be happy. Hence, to increase GNH in the country, we dive deeper into the circumstances of the not-yet-happy group. In other words, we analyse deprivations among the not-yet-happy since it is only by improving these conditions that we can enhance GNH in the country.  Therefore, the present chapter aims to provide us with insights on how deprivations among not-yet-happy people have changed over time. It has two parts. Part 1 uses two measures; the censored deprivation headcount ratios (share of population who are not-yet-happy and deprived in each indicator) and uncensored deprivation headcount ratios (share of population who is deprived in each indicator, regardless of whether they belong to the happy or not-yet-happy category). Based on this information, we identify areas and indicators that have not

improved over time, directing us towards potential intervention ideas that may help improve it.    Part 2 of provides some insight on past initiatives and their association to the GNH indicators. It maps policy initiatives outlined in the Annual Performance Agreements (APAs) signed at the ministerial level across the 33 GNH indicators. This is done by assessing if any of the policy initiatives highlighted in the 2021-22 APAs are related to the GNH indicators. Note that here, we are using policy initiatives and interventions outlined in ministerial-level APAs as a substitute for programmatic interventions.  Key highlights  • Psychological wellbeing: Spirituality and negative emotions have deteriorated among the not-yet-happy group. In terms of interventions to improve the domain, perhaps the role of individuals takes precedence over the role of government. For instance, either individual-led or community led initiatives on mindfulness may help to encourage meditation.  • Health: Healthy days and mental health has deteriorated. Interventions might include promoting mental health awareness and strengthening mental health services in the nation. • Education: Values indicator is the only indicator under education domain that has deteriorated slightly. For instance, in 2015 only 0.9% of the not-yet-happy group were deprived but in 2022, this rose to 3%.  • Cultural diversity and resilience: From 2015 to 2022, censored deprivation headcount ratios grew for all four cultural indicators. For example, the censored deprivations in native language has increased slightly with time (3.4% in 2015 to 4.1% in 2022). Given these results, all four indicators would necessitate interventions. • Good governance: Deprivations have fallen for services, fundamental rights and government performance, indicating progress in these three indicators over time. However, for the political participation indicator, deprivation has worsened. In 2015, 30.6% were deprived in political participation and in the not-yet-happy group, while in 2022 this increased to 35.6%. • Ecological diversity and resilience: The censored deprivations have decreased for wildlife damage and environmental conservation attitude. But for the urban issue and ecological issue indicators, deprivation has worsened.

Part 1: Insights from the GNH Index for policy and practice  Current applications of the GNH Index  The GNH Index is a useful instrument for policy making and planning because it provides a more comprehensive framework for assessing societal wellbeing and happiness. In the past, the erstwhile Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC)48 played a pivotal role in integrating the GNH framework into planning and policy making. There are ﬁve technically speciﬁc ways in which GNH indicators are being applied in the administration of the country.   Firstly, the GNH index and some of domain indicators and sub-indicators are directly used as a benchmark in the FYP on which to make further progress. At the overall national level, the FYP is guided by national targets and key results. In the current plan, 17 baselines or targets are drawn from GNH indicators such as sufﬁciency level in mental health, safety, community vitality, skills, political participation, fundamental rights, values, assets, income, housing, etc. The composite GNH index is used as an overall national baseline.  Secondly, GNH index is also used as weighted criterion in the allocation of budget among the local governments composed of 20 districts and four urban municipalities at the level of middle tier of administration, and 205 counties or gewogs at the lowest tier in the vertical organization of the country. Among these local governments’ weights of GNH index is 10% for gewogs and 15% for municipalities and districts. Some may wonder why the weights for GNH index of a local government is low when it comes to budget allocation. Eight of the 14 criteria are already included among the 277 variables that are aggregated in the GNH Index but the eight criteria are given prominence in the resource allocation formula to fund and mitigate deﬁcient  48 The GNHC is a former central coordination agency tasked with the overall planning of the country’s policies and programmes, including the facilitation and evaluation of Five-Year Plans (FYP). As part of the ongoing civil service reform, the commission was dissolved in 2022, with some of its divisions merged with the Cabinet Secretariat under the Ofﬁce of the Prime Minister (OPMC) and others with the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

conditions in a particular local government jurisdiction like water and sanitation, or costly freight transport.  Thirdly, policies in the central government are formulated by subjecting them to vetting with GNH screening tools, which consists of 22 criteria drawn from GNH and implemented according to a well-deﬁned process. So far, 15 out of 22 draft policies has been approved, with majority of them getting modiﬁed to some degree by the process of screening.  Fourthly, GNH index has been used to evaluate a large rural horticultural project after it was implemented. The project’s aim was to grow 40 different varieties of fruits and vegetables over 2,166 acres among 64 beneﬁciary households. The impact study used Propensity Score Matching method to evaluate the impact of the project on beneﬁciaries versus non-beneﬁciaries on all nine domains of GNH.   There is a ﬁfth instance where GNH application is underway. A GNH certiﬁcation for business has been designed as an assessment framework for business corporations. Furthermore, the national law institute of Bhutan is also grappling for the ﬁrst time with a novel question: what consequences there is in the legal principles if happiness is its main premise and what else they can do in the administration of justice if happiness is its cornerstone.  Some other ways in which the GNH Index was utilised by the government were to:  i. Complement existing measures of development: The GNH index complements GDP by providing a more comprehensive and holistic perspective of progress that considers aspects other than economic growth. While GDP provides information on economic growth and development, it does not capture the full picture of a country's wellbeing. The GNH index helps to fill this gap by providing a more comprehensive and holistic view of development that considers both material and non-material domains.
<<<PAGE=217>>>

ii. Prioritise policy areas in GNH: The GNH Index enables policy makers and planners to identify and prioritise domains and indicators that are lagging behind. For example, if the Index shows that the population has a low level of psychological wellbeing domain, policy makers can prioritise policies and activities to address this issue, and therefore direct investments to improve the domain circumstances.  iii. Track and monitor national progress in GNH terms: The GNH Index is a valuable instrument for tracking GNH progress. It has been used by policy makers to track holistic progress and changes across various GNH domains over time.   iv. Align planning/policies/programmes/projects with GNH: The GNH Index can assist in ensuring that programmes and projects are aligned with general aims of increasing happiness and wellbeing. For instance, to help ensure that there is a seamless inclusion of GNH domains and indicators, planners incorporated the GNH indicators into the results-based approach framework of the 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) in the form of the National Key Result Areas (NKRAs).   v. Set GNH targets and goals for sectors: The GNH Index has also paved its way as an alternative framework for setting sectoral targets and goals to help design GNH indicator relevant programmes. By setting goals that address many domains of the GNH Index, sectors can help enhance GNH in the country.   Despite these initiatives, there is a need to better integrate GNH Index into the policy making, planning and programming landscape. Such innovations are however largely beyond the scope of this book. Nonetheless, this chapter focuses on some of the recommended policy action areas based on the insights drawn from changes among the not-yet-happy across time.

Changes among the not-yet-happy over time  Initiatives aimed only at improving the conditions of happy people may also overlook the needs of the unhappy group, worsening existing disparities and leaving some people further behind. Therefore, the analysis here draws attention to the ﬁndings from those in the not-yet-happy category. Policy makers would prefer to invest already scarce resources in reducing the deprivations or, in other words, improving the 33 GNH conditions among not-yet-happy people. Unhappy people are more likely to be experiencing deprivation and suffering, and hence are in more need of policy support.   Recall that the identiﬁcation of happy people was done using a 66% overall happiness threshold, where those who have attained sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the 33 weighted GNH indicators were categorised as happy, and those remaining were not-yet-happy people. The preceding chapters also looked at the raw or uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratio, which shows the share of population who have gained sufﬁciency in an indicator regardless of whether they were in the happy or not-yet-happy category. It is worth noting that the uncensored sufﬁciency headcount ratios mirror the uncensored deprivation headcount ratios. We also examined the happy censored sufﬁciency headcount ratio, which shows the proportion of the population that are both happy and sufﬁcient in an indicator.  Overall, we have so far considered the sufﬁciency stories, that is we focused on who made it into the happy group. But we need to assess who is in the not-yet-happy category and, more importantly, what they are lacking. This section therefore looks at censored deprivation headcount ratios, which is the share of population who are not-yet-happy and deprived in an indicator. We will also look at the raw or uncensored deprivation headcount ratios.

Censored deprivation headcount ratio: Share of people who are not-yet-happy and deprived in the indicator. This shows the percentage of the population who are not-yet-happy and are deprived in the indicator.  Raw/uncensored deprivation headcount ratio: Share of the population who are deprived in the indicator. This represents the percentage of population who are deprived in that indicator, irrespective of whether they are happy or not-yet-happy.  In 2022, 45.5% are categorised as narrowly happy and 6.4% as unhappy, so together 51.9% are in the not-yet-happy group (Table 28). In 2015, 56.6% of people were classiﬁed in the not-yet-happy group.  Table 28: Changes in percentage of happy people across happiness gradients, 2015–22   Happiness threshold 2010 2015 2022 Deeply happy 77-100% 8.3% 8.4% 9.5% Extensively happy 66-76.9% 32.6% 35.0% 38.6% Narrowly happy 50-65.9% 48.7% 47.9% 45.5% Unhappy 0-49.9% 10.4% 8.8% 6.4% Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Let us now examine the censored and uncensored deprivation headcount ratios by domain. Based on the ﬁndings, we propose some intervention ideas to enhance the domains or indicators that are lagging behind. Psychological wellbeing  Figure 41 shows that deprivations among the not-yet-happy population have decreased for all four indicators. For example, the censored deprivations for the spirituality indicator dropped from 39.8% in 2015 to 37.8% in 2022. The positive emotions index also saw a signiﬁcant drop in censored deprivations (30.4% in 2015 to 21.5% in 2022). This is noteworthy as deprivations in all these indicators increased between 2010–15.
<<<PAGE=220>>>

However, an examination of the overall raw headcount ratios shows that deprivations have increased for the negative emotions (45.8% in 2015 and 50.8% in 2022) and spirituality indicators (60.6% in 2015 and 63.5% in 2022). This means that the proportion of happy Bhutanese people experiencing negative emotions increased in 2022. Likewise, the share of people reporting lower levels of spirituality has also risen. The ﬁndings call for interventions to improve the negative emotions and spirituality indicators.   Figure 41: Censored and uncensored deprivation headcount ratios, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Figure 42 depicts the trends in censored deprivation headcount ratios across the 20 districts. Changes in the censored deprivation headcount ratios vary by district. Focusing on areas where deprivation has worsened, in Gasa, for example, we see a 12.5 percentage point rise in negative emotions and a 9.9 percentage point increase in deprivations in spirituality. Similarly, censored deprivations for negative emotions and spirituality indicators increased by 9.4 percentage points and 2.4 percentage points, respectively, in Tsirang. Tashi Yangtse also saw a 7.6 percentage point spike in positive emotion deprivations and a 2.7 percentage point increase in spirituality deprivations.

Let us delve more into the indicators.   Life satisfaction  The life satisfaction indicator is composed of ﬁve variables that assess satisfaction in aspects of one's life: health, standard of living, major occupation, family relationship, and work-life balance. Censored deprivations are higher for females (17.4%, compared to 12% for males) and rural residents (16.3% in rural and 14.1% in urban regions), as depicted in Figure 43.   Let’s take a closer look at the ﬁve components. Bhutanese people appear to be mainly content with their family ties. For both years, about 43% said they were ‘very satisﬁed’ with their family relationships. However, for the rest of variables, percentage of people reporting ‘very satisﬁed’ decreased. For example, in 2015, 18.5% said they were ‘very satisﬁed’ with their major occupation, but by 2022, this had dropped to 14.3%. The work-life balance statistic fell signiﬁcantly as well. People's satisfaction with health fell in 2022 (61.3% in 2015 to 58.2% in 2022). This decline could have been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Positive emotions The positive emotion indicator measures the frequency of ﬁve positive emotion variables; calmness, compassion, forgiveness, contentment, and generosity. Positive emotion measures, though subjective, can provide useful insights into happiness and wellbeing. They can help develop interventions and policies by identifying the situations, activities, and experiences that are most likely to elicit positive emotions.  As can be seen from Figure 44, females report higher censored deprivations than males (17.4% of males and 24% of females), while 24.1% of those who are deprived and in the not-yet-happy group live in rural areas and 17.7% are in urban regions.

The share of people reporting at least ‘few times a week’ has increased for all ﬁve variables. The most drastic improvement is seen in compassion (0.6% reporting ‘few times a day’ in 2015 to 18.6% in 2022).   Figure 44: Percentage of people stating the frequency of positive emotions, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Positive emotions are subjective experiences that may vary considerably from person to person. What one person thinks to be ‘calmness’ may not be the same as what another person considers to be ‘calmness’. Due of this subjectivity, we must be cautious while adopting such standardised measurements. It can also introduce response bias. Hence, new techniques of measuring positive emotions may need to be explored.

Figure 45: Censored deprivation headcount ratios by sex and region, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Negative emotions The negative emotion indicator comprises of anger, fear, worry, selﬁshness and jealousy. A high level of negative emotions acts as a proxy indicator of low wellbeing in GNH. High frequency of negative emotions can be a sign of larger social and economic issues, such as poverty, inequality, and social isolation.   As Figure 46 shows, females report higher censored deprivations than males (22.3% in males and 33.6% in females); 30.3% of the urban residents are deprived in negative emotion (high frequency of negative emotion) and not yet happy, higher than rural dwellers (28.7%).   Looking at each of the ﬁve variables independently, the number of people who are angry once a day has declined, but the proportion of people who are angry few times a day has risen from 4.7% in 2015 to 10.6% in 2022 (Figure 46). We also see a considerable decrease in the frequency of fear, selﬁshness, and jealousy, but in terms of worry, the proportion of people reporting 'once a day' has risen from 11.5% in 2015 to 20.4% in 2022.

have decreased, making it difﬁcult to predict where the trend in negative emotions is heading.  The negative emotion indicator can be impacted by a variety of factors, such as individual characteristics, environmental inﬂuences, and cultural standards. Due to this variability, we must exercise caution while working with this data. Nevertheless, gathering data on negative emotions can assist policy makers in identifying vulnerable populations experiencing high levels of negative emotions, and help devise tailored initiatives aimed at reducing these negative emotions.

Spirituality The spirituality indicator comprises of four variables; level of spirituality, consideration of karma, prayer recitation and frequency of meditation. As cited earlier, deprivation in the spirituality indicator (raw deprivation headcount ratio) has increased from 60.6% in 2015 to 62.5% in 2022. Assessment of the four variables reveals that the share of people who reported being ‘very spiritual’ decreased, but on the other hand those who stated they were moderately spiritual increased (46.4% in 2015 to 51.9% in 2022) (Figure 47). The proportion of people considering karma on a regular basis increased by 2%. Frequency of prayer recitation has also improved signiﬁcantly. In 2015, 10.2% prayed several times a day but in 2022 this increased to 26.9%.   However, given the inﬂuences of the modern era, there is a risk that such indicators will deteriorate in the future. Furthermore, living in a social media world raises the risk of such indicators degrading. For instance, stress has become a prevalent and persistent concern in modern culture. Meditation has been proved to be an effective tool for stress and anxiety reduction, which can improve general health and wellbeing. As a result, all four variables appear to be important for the time being.  Figure 47: Percentage of people reporting level of spirituality and consideration of karma, 2015–22

Either individual-led or community led initiatives such as having gratitude journals, which involves frequently practicing gratitude by writing down things for which you are grateful each day, could help develop positive emotions. Likewise, mindfulness-based strategies entailing practicing mindfulness may help increase positive feelings while decreasing negative emotions like stress and anxiety. Here, activities such as organisation of advocacy and awareness on meditation, gratitude circles, or community art projects that generate pleasant feelings and develop a sense of connection and social support among participants can be organised by local organisations, community centres, and social groups. Government programmes can provide ﬁnancing and resources for such community-based interventions.

The curriculum is age-appropriate for students in kindergarten through grade 12 and can be customised to meet the needs of individual classrooms or schools. 2. Piloting a mindfulness class: Depending on the needs of individual schools or districts, the mindfulness can be implemented in a variety of ways. Some schools may choose to implement the curriculum across the board, while others may focus on specific classrooms or grade levels. The programme can also be used after school or as part of a summer school curriculum. 3. Mindfulness class evaluation: The Mindfulness class will need to be evaluated on an ongoing basis to verify that it is effective in meeting its objectives. This includes gathering feedback from students, instructors, and administrators, as well as tracking academic performance and other student wellbeing outcomes.

Health  The health domain comprises four indicators; the assessment of self-reported health status (whether its ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’), number of healthy days in the previous month (at least 26), disability that restricts their daily activities (‘all the time’ or ‘occasionally’), and mental health (score of at least 15 indicating normal mental wellbeing). As per the censored deprivation headcount ratio, deprivation has decreased for self-reported health status and disability indicators between 2015 and 2022. For example, in 2015, 31.6% claimed at least ‘very good' self-reported health status and were in the not-yet-happy group; by 2022, this had dropped to 30.8%. In 2015, 8.9% of people said their disability limited their everyday activities at least 'sometimes’, and were not in the not-yet-happy group. Censored deprivation counts increased for both healthy days and mental health over time. The uncensored deprivation headcount (raw insufﬁciency headcount) revealed the same trends (Figure 49).

Thimphu also saw an increase in healthy days deprivation by 14.8%. Tashigang and Tashi Yangtse also saw an increase in censored deprivations in healthy days, by 17.2% and 13.9%, respectively (Figure 50).   The percentage of the population who are not-yet-happy and deprived in disability shows progress in all districts except for Tashigang (censored deprivations increased by 1.7%). It is worth noting that Tashigang is the only district where censored deprivations for all the health indicators worsened.   Mental health has deteriorated in Paro, Wangdi Phodrang, Sarpang, Zhemgang, Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, Samtse, Tashigang and Thimphu.

Self-reported health status Females have a greater deprivation rate, according to the censored deprivation headcount (Figure 51). In comparison to 24.3% of the male population, 34.7% of the female population is deprived and lacks overall sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the weighted GNH indicator (not-yet-happy category). Similarly, rural areas have a higher percentage of deprived and unhappy people than urban areas. Although self-reported health status can be a useful indicator of overall health, it is not always the most accurate or reliable indicator. Self-reported health status is based on an individual's subjective evaluation of their own health and can be impacted by factors such as mood, social desirability bias, and cultural standards. On the other hand, self-reported health status can be a signiﬁcant tool for academics and healthcare professionals to study how people perceive their health and how that perception connects to other factors such as access to healthcare, lifestyle factors, and demographic features.   Overall, since the health domain comprises additional indicators of physical and mental health, this indicator may need to be revisited in the future, especially in terms of its usefulness given its subjective nature.

Disability The GNH survey assesses several types of disability, including those with vision, hearing, walking/climbing steps, remembering/concentrating, washing/dressing, communication, cardiovascular, respiratory, mental, and other impairments. In 2022, approximately 4.7% (raw deprivation headcount) face at least one of the difﬁculties, ﬁnding it 'sometimes' or 'all the time' difﬁcult to carry out their everyday functions (Figure 52). We can see from the censored deprivation headcount ratios in Figure 53 that females have greater deprivation rates, and the frequency is higher in rural areas: 5% of rural residents are disabled and not-yet-happy, compared to 2.4% in urban areas. Not-yet-happy people are those who lack sufﬁciency in at least 66% of the weighted variables.  According to the 2017 Population and Housing Census of Bhutan, 2.1% or approximately 16,567 Bhutanese people are living with disabilities (PLWDs), with 70% of these people living in rural areas. Rural areas lack the necessary facilities and services for PLWDs and children living with disabilities, and stigma is far more prevalent.  Bhutan, like many other countries, still has work to do to make its environment more accessible to people with disabilities. While Bhutan has made strides in recent years, particularly with the approval of the National Policy for People with Disabilities in 2019, people with disabilities continue to encounter several obstacles in accessing education, employment, healthcare, and public services.  To address these problems, the Bhutanese government and numerous civil society organisations have taken steps to increase disability inclusion and accessibility, such as developing accessible tourist programmes, establishing disability-focused NGOs, and advocating for inclusive education policy. Nonetheless, more work must be done to guarantee that people with disabilities in Bhutan have equitable access to all sectors of society. Given this, this indicator will be important both now and in the future.

Figure 52: Censored deprivation headcount ratios by sex and region, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey Healthy days  Healthy days is a vital health indicator because it attempts to quantify the picture of a person's general health and functional capacity. The indicator shows how frequently a person has felt both mentally and physically healthy throughout the last month. Based on self-reported information, this measurement considers both the existence of physical, mental symptoms and the capacity to perform everyday tasks. The average number of healthy days was reported to be 28.3 in 2015 and 26.7 in 2022. More males exhibit lower censored deprivation headcount than females (Figure 52). Rural areas have slightly higher censored deprivation headcount (proportion of people deprived in healthy days and are classiﬁed as not-yet-happy) than urban areas.   By keeping track of their healthy days, people and populations can be evaluated for their health status. This data can be used to assess the success of activities for health promotion, spot health disparities, and focus actions to improve health outcomes. Mental health The mental health indicator collects data on mental health through the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).49 The GHQ-12 is a  49 The GHQ-12 includes the following 12 questions: (1) Have you recently been able to concentrate on whatever you are doing?

shorter version of the GHQ that includes 12 Likert-scale items that assess the individual's level of psychological discomfort over the last few weeks. The 12 items are rated on a four-point Likert scale, with ‘less than usual’ being the lowest and ‘far more than usual’ being the highest. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) international standards, the GHQ-12 score (ranging from 0 to 36) can be effectively divided into three responses: normal mental wellbeing (0-15), some mental distress (15-20) and severe mental distress (above 20).  The percentage of Bhutanese people who reported experiencing severe psychological distress grew from 3% in 2015 to 4.3 % in 2022 (Table 31). Those who are severely distressed are more prevalent in rural than urban locations.

Nonetheless, the JDWNRH's Psychiatry Department offers specialist mental healthcare. Anxiety, depression, and mental and behavioural disorders brought on by alcohol and drug misuse are common and prevalent mental health diseases in the nation. According to the 2022 Annual Health Bulletin, mental disorders have steadily increased over the years. The number of anxiety patients has increased the most, from 1,354 cases in 2017 to 4,131 cases reported in 2021. Depression follows, with 2,410 cases documented in 2021.

Intervention ideas for the domain of health Table 32 summarises ﬁndings from the analysis of the censored deprivation headcount ratios. Improving health indicators demands a system-wide plan that addresses individual and cultural concerns that affect both physical and mental health, while also making Bhutan more accessible to people with disabilities. Such interventions should emphasise prevention and early diagnosis of physical and mental health problems, as well as targeted interventions to improve the life conditions of people with disabilities.   For instance, education initiatives can assist in raising awareness about the importance of mental health while also reducing stigma associated with mental health concerns. This can include spreading positive mental health messages through various media sources. It is also vital to establish infrastructure for mental health services. In 2022, The Pema Centre Secretariat was established to spearhead Bhutan’s national response to mental health. The centre will be creating and upgrading mental health services to provide critical assistance to people suffering from mental illnesses. This can include increasing mental health programme ﬁnancing, enhancing access to mental healthcare, and increasing the number of mental health specialists.

Time use  Based on the raw headcount ratios, deprivation has increased for both time-use domain indicators. Figure 54 shows that the proportion of people working more than eight hours per day (sufﬁciency threshold) has risen from 55.6% in 2015 to 59.8% in 2022. The proportion of people who are sleep deprived (get less than eight hours of sleep each night) has also risen (from 26% in 2015 to 31.6% in 2022). Approximately 36.6% were deprived and not yet happy in 2022, a reduction from 37.8% in 2015. But with regards to the sleep indicator, things were not positive: 18.4% of sleep deprived were unhappy in 2015, which further increased to 21.2% in 2022.

Looking at some more key measures can provide a clearer sense of the country's current situation.   Work hours  The indicator measures the daily work hours of individuals. Work hours unless the traditional deﬁnition, also incorporated hours dedicated to household chores involving a variety of tasks such as cleaning, cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, and caring for children, elderly people and pets. These tasks require time, effort, and skill, and they contribute to the smooth functioning of a household. From GNH point of view, household chores, though unpaid, are still work. In many cases, household chores are performed primarily by women, and the fact that they are not recognised as work can contribute to gender inequality. If household chores were recognised as work, it could help to raise awareness about the important role they play in maintaining a household and encourage a more equitable distribution of this work within families.  For work hours, a sufﬁciency threshold of 8 hours has been set, meaning that a person is classiﬁed as sufﬁcient if they have worked less than 8 hours. The 2022 GNH Index ﬁndings show signiﬁcant differences in the censored deprivations across sex and regional subgroups. As Figure 56 shows, 31.6% of the work deprived not-yet-happy group are males while 39.6% are females. Rural residents are more work deprived than those living in urban areas (38.7% of rural dwellers are sleep deprived and in the not-yet-happy group, while 33.4% of urban residents who are sleep deprived are in the not-yet-happy group).    The 2022 Labour Force Survey (LFS) report estimates that only 10.1% of working Bhutanese work less than 39 hours per week. This roughly translates to 7.8 hours daily for ﬁve workdays. This threshold may be the closest to the GNH work sufﬁciency threshold. However, this statistic is not directly comparable since the LFS questionnaire does not consider household work as work. Overall, 29.8% of employed people worked 40-49 hours per week (translating to 8 to 9.8 daily work hours for ﬁve days), 28.0% worked 50-59 hours per week (10 to 11.8 daily work hours for ﬁve days) , 11.4% worked 60-69 hours per week (12 to

13.8 daily work hours for ﬁve days) and 20.7% worked at least 70 hours per week (at least 14 daily work hours for ﬁve days).   More males (11.0%) than females (8.2%) work more than 80 hours a week. The proportion of those working 40-49 hours per week is higher in cities (37.9%) than in rural areas (25.5%). Yet, the proportion of people working 50-59 hours per week is larger in rural (30.5%) than in urban (23.1%) areas.   Figure 56: Censored deprivation headcount ratios by sex and region, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Sleep hours  Females also have higher sleep deprivation (19.7% of males are sleep deprived and not-yet-happy and 22.1% are females). Work deprivations are higher for rural regions while sleep deprivations are higher for urban areas (for example, 20.1% of people living in rural areas are in the sleep deprived, not-yet-happy group and 22.7% of urban residents are in the sleep deprived, not-yet-happy group.  The 2022 GNH survey found that around 3.8% of people are dissatisﬁed with their sleep quality (Figure 57). This may be due to a variety of factors, including increasing stress levels, and usage of electronic devices before bedtime disrupting the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

Figure 57: Percentage of people satisfied with their sleep, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Data collection on sleep patterns can provide useful insights into a population's general health. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep can have a detrimental inﬂuence on physical and mental health. Data on sleep patterns could be used by the health ministry, for instance, to identify regions where sleep health education and intervention programmes are needed. Likewise, if data shows that a speciﬁc demographic group frequently sleeps less than the recommended amount of time, focused education and outreach programmes could be designed to address the issue. For this reason, this indicator is still essential in GNH.  Intervention ideas for the domain of time use Workplace practices such as ﬂexible work schedules and telecommuting could help employees better balance their professional and personal life. Time management training can also assist people in better prioritising their responsibilities and activities, resulting in more efﬁcient use of working hours and more time for leisure activities and sleep. Sleep hygiene education, such as the signiﬁcance of maintaining a regular sleep schedule and avoiding gadgets before night, can enhance sleep hours and quality.

While government-driven interventions may be required to establish the correct conditions for people not to overwork or sleep less, these initiatives must be led by individuals. For instance, it is up to the individual to adopt a consistent sleep schedule, to prioritise and schedule leisure time, to utilise the ﬂexible work arrangements, to practice good time management and to take breaks during a work day. This is especially true for those who work outside of the typical ofﬁce environment, such as on farms.

Education  Analysis of the uncensored or raw headcount ratios in previous chapters revealed that deprivation across knowledge indicators is the highest, implying that sufﬁciency is the lowest for knowledge indicator. The uncensored deprivation headcount ratio (the share of people who are deprived in an indicator) highlights that Bhutanese people have signiﬁcantly improved their level of sufﬁciency for three indicators (literacy, schooling and knowledge) since deprivations have decreased for all accept for values indicator (Figure 58).   Figure 58: Uncensored/raw deprivation headcount ratios, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Furthermore, among not-yet-happy people, proportion of people suffering deprivation in literacy fell from 35% in 2015 to 24.7% in 2022. Likewise, deprivations in the not-yet-happy group in schooling and knowledge fell from 43% and 54.8% in 2015 to 32.5% and 48.8% in 2022, respectively. However, deprivations in values indicator have risen by 3% among the not-yet-happy people (Figure 59). It should be noted that knowledge and value indicators are given lower weights than literacy and schooling. Overall, interventions would have to be directed towards improving values (deterioration) and knowledge (high deprivation) indicators.

However, there are certain areas where censored deprivation has worsened. For instance, in Gasa, values and knowledge have deteriorated, while in Pema Gatshel, schooling, values and knowledge have deteriorated over time.

Literacy Females are more deprived in this GNH indicator than males (see Figure 61). The Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS) report for 2022 showed that literacy rates across all age groups for males were 77.1% and for females were 63.6%. Female youth literacy is 97.2%, while male youth literacy is 98.3%. These ﬁgures indicate that Bhutan has made tremendous progress in raising literacy rates, particularly among young people. However, despite a rise in overall literacy, female's literacy rates for both teenagers and adults are lower than their male counterparts. There are also discrepancies across region. The 2022 BLSS report also states that that literacy rates among those aged 5 and above are 70.2%; 82.1% in urban regions and 62.9% in rural areas. The proportion of people belonging to the not-yet-happy group and who are deprived in literacy is considerably higher for rural regions than urban areas (Figure 62).   The country’s emphasis on education as a priority has been a major factor to Bhutan's literacy improvement. Bhutan's government has made education available and free to all citizens, and has invested in facilities to facilitate education throughout the country. While, literacy rates may become less relevant as education becomes more widely available, they remain an essential indication of educational attainment as well as social and economic engagement in many circumstances. Furthermore, regardless of formal education level, literacy skills are required for involvement in modern society and businesses. Literacy rate can be a helpful measure of individuals' and communities' ability to participate effectively in economic, social, and political activities.   As the ﬁndings show, there are still obstacles to increasing literacy rates, particularly among women. Traditional gender roles and cultural conventions that limit women's access to school may be some of the factors for the lower female literacy rate. But, it is also important to remember that a generation of women who never were schooled may not have the opportunity to obtain literacy, and for some of the elderly, it might not be a priority. Furthermore, given the country's rising youth literacy rates, the metric's usefulness in GNH may need to be reconsidered in the near future.

Schooling The schooling indicator measures the number of years of schooling completed by respondents including monastic education for which a sufﬁciency threshold of six years had been set. The share of deprivation among the not-yet-happy group has decreased signiﬁcantly, from 43% in 2015 to 32.5% in 2022.   However, gender and regional discrepancies still exist. Around 54% of females belonging to the not-yet-happy group have been able to complete six years of schooling as opposed to 40% of males. Likewise, 50.9% of the not-yet-happy living in rural areas have not attained six years of schooling in comparison to 45.7% of urban residents.   Further validation is provided by the 2022 BLSS report, where approximately 36% of the population aged 5 and up were reported to have not attended any formal education (schooling from formal institutions, whether traditional school or institute). The living standard survey also collected information on whether people aged 5 and above who had never attended a traditional school or institute had gotten any other learning in the past or present. It found that 19% of those who have never attended formal education (6.8% of the population aged 5 and up) have obtained other types of learning, including monastic education (institutional), monastic education (non-institutional), and non-formal education. Non-formal education was received by nearly 4.3% of the population aged 5 and up, followed by monastic education (institutional) (1.3%) and monastic education (non-institutional) (1.1%). Almost 29.2% of those who have never attended a formal school or institute have never acquired any other sorts of schooling.  The 2022 BLSS report also highlighted that females and males have signiﬁcantly different educational attainment levels. Around 40.4% of females have no formal schooling, compared to only 30.3% of males. Similarly, approximately 6% of females have a bachelor's degree or more, compared to approximately 9% of males. The report, however, does not provide information on age groups to help assess whether this is a stock variable from the earlier time or actual gender disparities in educational attainment. Around 49% of household heads have no

formal education; in rural areas, the number is larger (63.5%) than in urban areas (27.5%).   As more people get access to education and as the current generation, which has a high percentage of school attendance, becomes older, education may eventually lose its relevance. The 2022 BLSS50 report stated that the current rate of school attendance is 85%. The proportion of people aged 2 and up who have never attended a formal school or institute is 37.7%, whereas 28.8% are currently going or have gone in the previous academic year, and 33.5% have previously attended. When comparing male and female school attendance, the proportion of males and girls now enrolled in formal school or institute is nearly equal.   In addition, there is no variation in school attendance rates between urban and rural locations. But for now, as the ﬁndings suggested, access to education may still be restricted or unequally distributed among subgroups, and even in communities where education is widely accessible, the quality and level of education attained can differ signiﬁcantly. While education remains a major indicator in GNH for the time being, it may need to be reconsidered in the future depending on the progress made in educational attainment.

these actions can either be ‘sometimes be justiﬁed’ or ‘always’ is also increasing marginally.   For instance, in 2015 only 0.9% of the not-yet-happy group were deprived but in 2022, this rose to 3%. It is also interesting to note that not-yet-happy females are less deprived in values than males (3.5% of not-yet-happy males deprived vs. 2.7% of not-yet-happy females). Perhaps this is also one of the indicators in which rural residents enjoy more sufﬁciency as deprivations among the not-yet-happy rural residents is lesser (1.5%) than not-yet-happy urban residents (5.3%).   While in general there is a large share of the population stating that these harmful actions can never be justiﬁed, there is an increase the proportion of people who stated that they can be sometimes justiﬁed. For example, Figure 64 shows that in 2015 only 4.8% reported that killing can sometimes be justiﬁed, but in 2022 this proportion increased to 11.3%. The biggest increase can be seen in lying, as an additional 5% perceive that it can sometimes be justiﬁed (24.4% in 2015 and 29% in 2022).   Now, what if this pattern continues and even increases in the future? Would it increase crime? Currently, the GNH Index uses the values indicator as a proxy for a society's preferred attitudes and behaviours, including what is considered acceptable and improper behaviour. When a strong emphasis is placed on values, it is expected that such principles will foster a culture of social order and legal conformity, which may reduce crime rates in the long run. While Bhutan remains one of the world's safest countries, in recent years, it has seen an increase in the number of crimes and thefts, particularly in urban areas. The Statistical Yearbook 202251 generated by the Royal Bhutan Policy (RBP), shows that 46 criminal occurrences happened per 10,000 people in 2022. The crime rate increased by 24.3% in 2022 compared to 2021 (37 criminal incidents).    51https://www.rbp.gov.bt/Forms/CRIME%20STATS%20YEARBOOK%202022%20FINAL.pdf

The values indicator is still relevant as it provides an insight into a society's cultural, social, and political dynamics and can aid in identifying areas of strength and concern. It can be used to identify places where social norms and values may be contributing to social problems such as crime, poverty, and discrimination. Policy makers can create interventions that seek to inﬂuence attitudes and beliefs in order to achieve positive social outcomes by identifying places where societal values are out of sync with desired social outcomes.  Figure 63: Changes in the percentage reporting of the five variables under values indicator, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Knowledge The knowledge indicator, which is the highest deprivation, comprises of ﬁve variables; knowledge on local legends, tshechus/festivals, zhungdra and boedra, the Constitution and HIV/AIDS. People’s perception on their knowledge level on these ﬁve topics are being captured. The censored headcount ratios show that deprivations have decreased signiﬁcantly: 54.8% of people were deprived and not-yet-happy in 2015, while in 2022 this fell to 48.8%. Not-yet-happy females have higher deprivation (54%) than their male counterparts (40%). Similarly, not-yet-happy rural residents are more deprived than urban residents.

In 2022, merely 19.8% had at least good knowledge of local legends, and 13% had at least good knowledge of the constitution (Figure 64). The share of people with ‘very good’ knowledge local festivals also fell signiﬁcantly (17.1% to 8.4%). There was also a drastic decrease in the proportion of people with ‘good’ knowledge of the Constitution (24.5% in 2015 to 10.85% in 2022). 23.3% had at least good understanding of traditional songs, and 46.8% had at least a good understanding of local festivals. 62.6% knew how HIV/AIDS was transmitted. On average, understanding of all ﬁve measures is mostly low; nevertheless, with the exception of knowledge of the Constitution, there has been signiﬁcant improvement.

 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  With modernisation, there is a risk that these traditional cultural components and knowledge would deteriorate, therefore these variables are crucial. Bhutan has a rich oral storytelling history, with many local legends passed down through centuries. These stories frequently include important moral lessons as well as insights into Bhutanese culture and history. Tshechus are annual celebrations that are an essential element of Bhutanese culture and history. Certain festivals convey ideals and establish societal norms over time. Zhungdra and Boedra are two traditional genres of Bhutanese music and dancing. These songs frequently depict societal morals.   Hence, knowledge on the ﬁrst three topics provide people with an opportunity to preserve and celebrate a community’s cultural traditions and history but also to connect with their cultural roots. It may bring people together fostering social cohesion and a sense of belonging which is vital of wellbeing and happiness. Many local festivals have a spiritual or religious signiﬁcance and allow people to reconnect with their beliefs and spirituality. They frequently include prayers, blessings, and other religious rites, and they allow people to develop their spiritual connection. In terms of the Constitution, understanding rights and

responsibilities, governance and democracy, the rule of law, national identity, and the promotion of peace and stability all require knowledge of the Constitution. It is a fundamental component of civic education and the operation of a democratic society. Hence, it is still relevant in GNH.  HIV/AIDS knowledge is being utilised as a proxy for reducing new cases as well as stigma and prejudice. Bhutan remains one of the few countries in the region with an HIV prevalence of less than 0.1%. Nonetheless, the 2022 Annual Health Bulletin52 reports that there is a high-risk behaviour among Bhutanese citizens, as well as the concentration of infection among the most productive age groups, increase the risk of HIV transmission. The overall number of cases has steadily climbed from 570 in 2017 to 795 in 2021, with males and those aged 24 and up having a higher prevalence rate. On average, 50 to 55 new cases are detected annually.   Unprotected intercourse with multiple partners, sharing of needles and syringes among people who inject drugs, and a lack of information about HIV prevention and transmission are some of the high-risk behaviours that contribute to the spread of HIV in Bhutan. Furthermore, stigma and prejudice towards people living with HIV/AIDS can create barriers to testing, treatment, and care, driving the virus's spread. Infection concentrations among the most productive age groups, such as young adults, can have serious economic and social consequences for the country. HIV can increase healthcare expenses, decrease workforce productivity, and place a strain on families and communities.  Intervention ideas for the domain of education Having reviewed the ﬁve education indicators, we look at some of the practical actions that can be implemented to assist improvement in these indicators over time. To address the challenges across these education indicators, interventions need to be tailored to those indicators that are showing the maximum lag, such as the knowledge

A mobile literacy programme for rural females is a programme that provides basic reading skills training to elder females who have limited access to formal schooling in rural locations. The initiative employs a mobile classroom or bus that visits remote villages to provide literacy training to the target population, making learning more convenient. The curriculum could be intended to be adaptable and responsive to the unique needs of rural females. It is critical that the programme is culturally appropriate and takes into account the unique obstacles and hurdles to education that rural females confront.

Cultural diversity and resilience Figure 65 depicts the censored deprivation headcount ratios and raw (uncensored) deprivation headcount ratios for the entire population. To redeﬁne, censored deprivation headcount ratio is the share of population that is not-yet-happy and deprived in each indicator while the uncensored deprivation headcount ratio refers to share of population that is deprived in each indicator irrespective of whether they are happy or not-yet-happy. From 2015 to 2022, deprivation grew for both the deprivation headcounts for all four cultural indicators. For example, the share of not-yet-happy people and deprived in Zorig Chusum skills increased from 23.8% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2022. This increase was not signiﬁcant.   While censored deprivations in native language seems to be comparatively low, it has increased nevertheless with time (3.4% in 2015 to 4.1% in 2022). Likewise, censored deprivations in Driglam Namzha increased from 32.5 in 2015 to 36.3% in 2022. Censored deprivations also increased for cultural participation from 35.8% in 2015 to 40% in 2022. Given these results, all four indicators would necessitate interventions.

Figure 67: Censored deprivation headcount ratios by sex and region, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Artisan skills (Zorig Chusum skills) The Zorig Chusum skills indicator categorises arts, crafts, and technology abilities into 13 distinct categories: (1) calligraphy or yigzo, (2) painting or lhazo, (3) carving or parzo, (4) clay sculpture or jinzo, (5) metal casting or lugzo , (6) silver and gold smithery or troezo, (7) needle work or tshemzo, (8) wood work/ carpentry or shingzo, (9) textile production or thagzo, (10) paper making or delzo, (11) bamboo craft or tsharzo, (12) black smithery or garzo, and (13) masonry or dozo. From Figure 68 we can deduce that deprivations are higher in rural regions and among females.   Zorig Chusum, or artisan skills, are traditional Bhutanese arts and crafts that have been passed down through generations. These skills are an important aspect of Bhutanese culture and heritage, and they are strongly linked to the country's identity. Possessing such artisan skills also has become a signiﬁcant source of income for many people. The government also established a National Institute for Zorig Chusum,

which teaches the 13 traditional arts and crafts to interested people in the country.  Weaving is the most frequent talent: approximately 33% of Bhutanese people are skilled in this area. Carpentry skill possession has dropped (15.8% in 2015 to 13.7% in 2022). There is also a drop in the proportion of people who know bamboo craft (12.5% in 2015 to 6.2% in 2022) and masonry (14.6% in 2015 to 11.2% in 2022).

Based on Figure 67 we might conclude that deprivation is higher in urban areas and among women. In 2015, on average Bhutanese people spend around 8.5 days a year, while this decreased to around 7 days in 2022. The median for 2015 was 5 while for 2022 it was 3 days.

The signiﬁcance of this indicator is in terms of how it brings people together and improves social cohesion, both of which are vital components of wellbeing. It also reﬂects the importance of preserving and promoting cultural values and traditions. Several cultural gatherings, including local festivals and annual chokus, have been cancelled or postponed for extended periods of time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we enter the post-COVID era, it is critical to revive cultural festivals.   Driglam Namzha (Way of Harmony) Driglam Namzha's relevance is anticipated to be greater as Bhutan modernises and integrates into the global community. While the speed of change may be accelerating, Bhutan's distinct cultural identity remains a vital component of the country's identity. Driglam Namzha provides a framework for preserving traditional values and habits while adapting to changing situations. Driglam Namzha is also an important part of the educational curriculum in Bhutan.   The etiquette indicator in GNH is made up of two variables: the level of signiﬁcance people consider traditional etiquette and whether it is getting weaker or stronger over time. Figure 67 shows that deprivations are higher among females and in urban areas. A closer look at the two variables reveals that the proportion of those who said Driglam Namzha was ‘very important’ fell marginally.

 252 
Figure 69: Percentage of people reporting the level of importance to Driglam Namzha, 2015–22 
Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  The second variable, which analyses Driglam Namzha practice and observance over time, reveals an increase in the percentage of people who believe it is ‘getting weaker’ and a reduction in the share of people who believe it is ‘getting stronger’ (Figure 70).   In Bhutan, there is a risk of Driglam Namzha degrading with time. Also, as societal norms develop, there may be a shift away from traditional structures and social roles, both of which are important in Driglam Namzha. Additionally, cultural inﬂuences from outside Bhutan may undermine traditional behaviors and beliefs. The increased availability of western media and the internet, for example, may expose Bhutanese adolescents to cultural norms and values that differ from those of Driglam Namzha. The government, civil society organisations and society in general will need to continue to take steps to promote and preserve the practice of Driglam Namzha, including through education, cultural festivals, and other activities.

The native language indicator in GNH attempts to assess a person’s level of ﬂuency in speaking their mother tongue. Each dialect has its own history, traditions, and values that are carried down from one generation to the next, fostering a sense of belonging and community among Bhutanese people, especially in rural areas where dialects predominate.   While the censored deprivation headcount ratios are generally low for this indicator (Figure 67), deprivations have increased over time. The share of people deprived in native language and not yet happy has increased from 3.4% in 2015 to 4.1% in 2022. Likewise, the proportion of people deprived (raw deprivation headcount ratio) has increased from 5% in 2015 to 6% in 2022.   Figure 71 shows that the proportion of people who reported high ﬂuency in their native language (very well) has fallen from 95% in 2015 to 93.7% in 2022.

It aids in the preservation of traditional knowledge, promotes cultural interaction, and promotes long-term growth.

Community vitality  The community vitality domain comprises four indicators of donation, community relationship, safety and family relationship. These indicators are meant to assess whether a community is thriving and fostering a sense of belonging, promoting cooperation and collaboration, and offering chances for communal progress. This is based on the assumption that communities with a high level of community vitality are more robust to adversity such as natural catastrophes, economic downturns, and social upheaval. They are better suited to deal with disasters and recover faster than communities lacking social capital and a sense of shared purpose.  Deprivation (both censored and raw headcount ratios) has declined over time for all four measures (Figure 72). In 2015, 36.8% of people were donation deprived and unhappy, but by 2022, this had dropped to 31.6%. The headcount of censored deprivation for community relationships dropped from 35.3% in 2015 to 33.1% in 2022. The safety and family relationship indicators exhibit low deprivations, indicating a high level of sufﬁciency being enjoyed by Bhutanese people in these indicators. In terms of interventions, the analysis proposes targeting improvements in the spirit of giving and community connections.

An examination of changes at the district level (Figure 73) reveals that Bumthang, Haa, Dagana, Mongar, Chukha, Tsirang, Samtse, and Tashigang all saw their censored deprivation headcount ratios decrease across all four community variables. The percentage of not-yet-happy people deprived in the donation indicator grew by 3.2% in Lhuentse and by 10.1% in Gasa. Sarpang had the highest rise (by 15.2%). Thimphu saw the biggest increase in terms of deprivations in the community relationship measure (14%). In Sarpang, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Tashi Yangtse, community relations have also worsened (increase in censored deprivation headcount ratios). The safety index has improved in all the districts, except for Thimphu, Punakha, and Pema Gatshel.

An examination of the regional and gender inequalities reveals that urban people face more deprivation across all four indicators. As a result, programmes targeted at strengthening community bonds and instilling a giving attitude in urban areas might improve this domain.   Figure 74: Censored deprivation headcount ratios by sex and region, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Donation (time and money) The donation indicator is made up of two variables: the amount of money donated and the number of days people volunteered in the previous year. As previously noted, donation has increased marginally (Figure 74). This is further supported by the results in Table 40. The average contribution amount (Nu. 10,250 in 2015 and Nu. 19,110 in 2022) increased with time, as did the median (Nu. 2,000 in 2015 and Nu. 4,000 in 2022).  Possible explanations for this development include the fact that numerous individuals and communities suffered severe economic and social hardship as a result of the pandemic. This could have raised public awareness about the need for donations. The pandemic brought people together to aid one another, as a result of which a sense of community and shared responsibility may have evolved. People may have felt more connected to their community and to help those in need.

Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Community relationship  Community relationships are measured using two variables: people's sense of belonging to their community and their level of trust in their neighbours. The country's overall community relations appear to have improved since deprivations for both censored and uncensored (raw deprivation headcount) have declined over time. However, even with this favourable outcome, we must keep in mind that deprivation is still high, particularly among urban dwellers. For example, in urban regions, around 41% are deprived in community relationships and are not yet happy (Figure 74). This would imply directing efforts to promote community relations towards urban areas.  Looking at the variables more closely, sense of belongingness to the community has stayed more or less the same. In 2015, 64.4% reported ‘very strong’ sense of belongingness, and in 2022 this was 63.2% (Figure 75). It is possible that people's sense of belonging may have improved during the pandemic, since it affected everyone in some manner, creating a shared experience that might bring people together. Due to this common experience, people may have felt more linked to one another. As a result of the pandemic, many people were compelled to rely on community members for goods and services. During the epidemic, many communities came together to help one other get

through the difﬁcult times. People may have felt more connected to their neighbours and neighbourhood as a result of this sense of community support. This may have allowed people to connect with people they might not have met otherwise, leading to a better sense of belonging.   Figure 75: Percentage of people who reported their sense of belongingness to the community, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  The proportion of people who ‘trust most of’ their neighbours improved in 2022 (25.5% in 2015 to 28.9% in 2022). On the other hand, the share of people reporting ‘trust none of them’ and ‘trust a few of them’ has declined over time. The share of people reporting ‘trust some of them’ has stayed the same (Figure 76). As stated earlier, the pandemic brought people together to assist one another in many ways. This reciprocal support could have improved neighbourly connections and increased trust.

Figure 76: Percentage of people who reported their level of trust in the neighbours, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Safety  The safety indicator evaluates individual events, attempting to determine whether a person has been a victim in the last 12 months. A person is considered deprived if they have been a victim at least once. Figure 74 shows that deprivation is low and has decreased with time (censored and uncensored deprivation headcount ratios).  Figure 74 demonstrates that 2.5% (raw deprivation headcount) are disadvantaged in rural areas and roughly 3% are deprived in urban areas. In general, it appears that communities are generally perceived as safe, and as having a low crime rate. While the indicator appears to show modest deprivation, it is still relevant. Bhutan may encounter new challenges and concerns as it develops and modernises, notably those related to crime.  Virtual crimes, such as cybercrime, may become more widespread in Bhutan as technology and the internet become more extensively used. As a result, it is vital to continue measuring safety across communities, as well as for Bhutan's government and law enforcement authorities to be vigilant and address any emerging issues related to crime and safety. People must also be aware of the potential hazards and take the necessary precautions.

Family relationship Bhutanese people, like with the safety indicator, have a high level of sufﬁciency (low deprivation) in the family relationship indicator. Since 2015, deprivation has decreased. In 2015, 7.1% of people were deprived in the family and not-yet-happy category, and this ratio fell to 5.1% by 2022 (Figure 72). Censored headcounts are greater in urban areas among people who are deprived in this indicator. As a result, any family relationship interventions would need to be targeted towards those residing in urban areas.  An examination of the six variables that deﬁne the family relationship indicator reveals that most people agreed with the positive statements while disagreeing with the negative ones.

Intervention ideas for the community vitality domain Given that three of the community vitality indicators have improved signiﬁcantly since 2015, interventions may be targeted to improve only the community relationship indicator, especially in urban areas where it seems to lag. Organising community activities, meetings, and initiatives to boost community involvement may be helpful. This may help foster a sense of belonging in the community.

Good governance  The good governance domain comprises four indicators: political participation, services, fundamental rights and government performance. Deprivations have fallen for services, fundamental rights and government performance, indicating progress in these three indicators over time. Services improved among the not-yet-happy group, with censored deprivations decreasing from 28.8% in 2015 to 19.6% in 2022 (Figure 78). Similarly, censored deprivations in government performance decreased from 39.5% in 2015 to 35.8% in 2022. However, for the indicator of political participation, deprivation has worsened. In 2015, 30.6% were deprived in political participation and in the not-yet-happy group, while in 2022 this increased to 35.6%. Since political participation is the only indicator for which deprivations have worsened over time, interventions directed towards improving the good governance domain might be aimed at increasing people's civic engagement.  It is important to note that while services, fundamental rights and government performance indicators improved, deprivations are still high. The government performance indicator has the highest share of deprivations under this domain. Therefore, interventions are still necessary, notwithstanding the improvements.

As indicated in Figure 80, in 2022 censored deprivations in political participation were signiﬁcantly higher in urban regions (46.3%) than in rural areas (28.6%). Females have higher deprivations. Overall, censored deprivations are high in rural areas except for political participation: 46.3% of political participation deprived and unhappy people live in urban areas. This calls for targeted interventions on improving political participation among urban residents.   Figure 80: Censored and raw/uncensored deprivation headcount ratios by sex and region, 2022 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Each of the indications are examined in greater depth below.  Political participation  As can be seen from preceding statistics, the political engagement index has slightly worsened over time, with interventions needing to be targeted towards women and those living in urban regions. In the GNH Index, political participation is measured through two variables: the frequency of attendance at zomdues (meetings) held at the village, gewog, or thromde levels and a person's intention to vote in the next general elections. Table 43 depicts how political engagement has changed over time.

In 2015, engagement at the village level was highest, with a median of 4 days as opposed to 4.5 days at the gewog level. Engagement at the thromde level was non-existent. A similar trend continued in 2022. However, there is a decrease in the median number of days at village (from 4 in 2015 to 1 in 2022) and gewog levels (from 3 in 2015 to 1 in 2022).

Most people intend to vote in the general election, and the percentage has grown over time (Table 45). However, rural communities have a little higher intention to engage.   The Election Commission of Bhutan (ECB) website states that a record-high 71.5% of eligible voters turned out for the Third Parliamentary National Assembly General Election held in 2018. This is a rise of more than 5% on the 66% voter turnout in the general election of 2013. Likewise, in the 2021 local government elections, around 126,304 postal votes were received, shattering all previous records. This is more than four times the 35,051 ballots received during the 2016 local government elections. The increased voter participation over time can be a sign that the ECB has diversiﬁed its voting services. This necessitates continuing efforts to simplify the voting process for citizens.

Figure 81 shows that the service indicator has signiﬁcantly improved for the group that is not yet happy, going from a censored headcount deprivation of 28.8% in 2015 to 19.6% in 2022.

Figure 81: Percentage of people reporting quality of drinking water, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  The quality of drinking water is deteriorating over time both in rural and urban areas, as shown in Figure 81. Given that there are no municipal garbage services in rural areas, burning is the predominant form of waste disposal there, whereas municipal pick-up is used in metropolitan areas. In 2015, 17.9% of rural residents managed their waste through compositing, but this fell to 7.5% in 2022. Interventions are required to encourage composting in both contexts.

Figure 82: Percentage of people reporting their waste disposal method, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Bhutan has almost complete coverage in terms of water and energy access. According to the 2022 BLSS report, the proportion of the population with improved drinking water has climbed from 99.5% in 2017 to 99.9% in 2022. Similarly, the proportion of people who have access to electricity has risen from 98.6% in 2017 to 99.6% in 2022. With such a high coverage rate, which is likely to improve further in the coming years, the importance of these two variables in the GNH Index may need to be reconsidered in the next survey. It could be better to replace it with more relevant indicators, such as internet or digital services. Table 46 shows that the challenges with distance to a healthcare centre are also a rural problem. However, the average and median distances are falling over time, indicating progress in terms of health services in rural areas.

Figure 83 demonstrates that, among the 10 variables, Bhutanese people are the most aware of their right to vote, with more than 90% stating that they have this right. There appears to be a need for many advocacy initiatives for citizens, since there is considerable room to improve education and awareness on these rights.  Government performance Government performance deprivation has improved since 2015, although it continues to have the highest rate of deprivation in the domain (Figure 84). Around 66.3% of people were deprived in this metric in 2015, and the proportion was still high in 2022 (64.3%). Seven variables are used to evaluate government performance. The proportion of people ranking the government's performance in delivering healthcare as ‘very good’ has improved from 24.7% in 2015 to 40.5% in 2022. However, there is room for improvement in the remaining variables.

Interventions ideas for the domain of good governance Based on the analysis, actions will mostly need to be directed toward enhancing political engagement, improving rural services, and increasing public knowledge of fundamental rights and freedoms. Investments in the creation of jobs, the reduction of inequality, and the ﬁght against corruption are necessary for raising the government performance indicator. Table 47 provides a summary of the ﬁndings on censored deprivation headcount ratios. Next, Table 48 shows some interventions to improve the domain indicators.

Ecological diversity and resilience The domain is evaluated using four indicators that assesses issues in urban areas, wildlife damage, environmental conservation attitude and ecological issues. As Figure 85 shows, the highest deprivations are among wildlife followed by urban issues. In 2022, 21.3% were wildlife damage indicator deprived and in not-yet-happy group and 14.3% were classiﬁed as urban issue indicator deprived and in not-yet-happy group. The share of the population who are deprived has decreased for wildlife damage, environmental conservation attitude and ecological issue. But for the urban issues indicator, deprivation has worsened (13.8% in 2015 to 19.8% in 2022).   Figure 85: Censored and uncensored/raw deprivation headcount ratios, 2015–22

Responsibility towards the environment Since 2015, Bhutanese people have reported more positive attitudes towards environmental conservation: 78.1% of rural residents stated ‘highly responsible’ for conserving environment in 2015, which in 2022 increased to 83.2% (Figure 88). However, the same cannot be said for the those living in urban areas, which saw only a marginal rise (81.6% in 2015 and 81.7% in 2022). This suggests that the decline in deprivation is mostly driven by people living in rural areas, and hence programmes to enhance conservation attitudes would need to target urban residents. Figure 88: Percentage of people reporting their level of attitude towards environmental conservation by region, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey Ecological issues Ecological issues are assessed through seven variables: noise pollution, air pollution, litter, river and stream pollution, soil erosion, ﬂood and waste disposal sites. People are asked the status of these issues in the past year. Figure 89 shows that the proportion of people stating ‘discontented’ has slightly decreased for noise, air, river pollution and litter for both the regions. In general, there is high level of sufﬁciency. For example, in 2015, 6% of rural residents were discontent with noise pollution, and in 2022 this dropped to around 4.6%. In urban areas, 24.8% were discontent in 2015 and in 2022, 21% were discontent. The share of population stating that they are ‘very discontented’ with noise pollution increased from 5% to 5.4% in 2022.

With regards to air pollution, discontentment fell from 16.6% in 2015 to 12% in 2022 in the urban areas. Likewise, discontentment with litter also decreased from 22.6% in 2015 to 17.4% in 2022. Overall, there are improvements in the indicator. The pandemic may have had some impact given that Bhutan was consistently under lockdown. For instance, the reduction in air pollution may have been a consequence of less trafﬁc and industrial activity leading to the quantity of pollutants discharged into the atmosphere decreasing.  Figure 90 shows that the proportion of people who reported soil erosion, ﬂooding, and waste disposal concerns has also decreased in 2022.  Figure 90: Percentage of people reporting soil erosion, flood and inadequate waste disposal sites, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Wildlife damage The wildlife damage indicator is only for farmers. It determines whether they have left uncultivated land due to wildlife damage. There is an increase in the proportion of respondents reporting that they have left their land uncultivated. In 2015, 9.9% of respondents said they had left their land fallow. In 2022, this rose to 12.2%. Wildlife crop damage is a severe issue in the country, endangering the lives of many farmers and

 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  Urban issues Urban issues are relevant to people who live in urban areas. The indicator measures people's contentment with the pedestrian pathway. Figure 92 shows that censored deprivations have grown since 2015. In 2015, 9.5% of the population was not-yet-happy and urban issue deprived, and this proportion rose to 14.3% by 2022. Discontentment with pedestrian paths grew from 7.6% in 2015 to 10.2% in 2022. The ﬁndings therefore suggest the need for more initiatives to enhance urban pedestrian pathways.

Living standards The living standards domain consists of three primary indicators: income, housing, and assets. These indicators are used to measures material wellbeing of individuals and households. The household income per capita indicator assesses the amount of income individuals and households have access to, and it is a key driver of their capacity to satisfy their basic requirements and engage in activities that contribute to their wellbeing. GNH understands that while income does not guarantee happiness, it is an essential element in determining access to resources and opportunities that lead to happiness. The housing indicator examines the quality and availability of housing. Access to appropriate and safe housing is essential for physical and mental health, as well as social and economic wellbeing. Finally, the asset indicator includes indicates the assets owned by individuals and households in terms of land, equipment, and livestock.   The censored and uncensored deprivation headcount ratios for the three indicators are shown in Figure 93. Looking ﬁrst at the censored deprivation headcount ratio, or the proportion of the people who are not-yet-happy and deprived in the indicator, in 2015, 30.8% of the population was unhappy and did not achieve sufﬁciency in the income indicator. In 2022, income improved, with the censored deprivation falling to 19.6%. In 2015, 31.4% of Bhutanese people were deprived in housing and not-yet-happy, which fell to 8.3% in 2022, demonstrating progress. Similarly, progress was also seen with the assets indicator, with censored deprivations falling from 14.9% in 2015 to 8.7% in 2022. Overall, there has been signiﬁcant progress in all three indicators of living standards.

Figure 93: Censored deprivation headcount ratio and uncensored deprivation headcount ratio, 2015–22 
 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  A subsequent regional examination ﬁnds that improvement has been more pronounced in housing indicator and in rural regions than in urban ones. For example, in 2015, 40.5% of the rural population was income deprived and not-yet-happy; by 2022, this had dropped to 27.3%. While the urban population saw a decline in censored deprivations (10.3% in 2015 to 8% in 2022), it was not as prominent as in rural regions. Furthermore, housing indicator improved in rural regions, with censored deprivations falling signiﬁcantly from 37.8% in 2015 to 9.1% in 2022. In urban areas, censored deprivations fell from 17.9% in 2015 to 7% in 2022. The same pattern was seen with the assets indicator.

 Source: Authors’ computations based on 2015 and 2022 GNH Survey  So, clearly there has been more progress in rural areas compared to urban areas. How does the progress in terms of living standards look like across districts? Has the percentage of not-yet-happy and indicator deprivation decreased or increased?   One positive ﬁnding, as seen in Figure 95, is that there is a drop in censored deprivations across almost all the districts. The highest reduction in censored deprivation has occurred across the housing indicator in all districts. Since 2015, Dagana has had the highest decrease in censored deprivation of the housing indicator, with a decline of 39.9%. In terms of income, Trongsa saw the biggest drop in censored deprivation, at 25.9%. With the assets indicator, Mongar has shown the highest decline in censored deprivation.   Thimphu and Gasa are the two districts with the least decrease in censored deprivations. It is also worth noting that the censored deprivation headcount ratio for assets indicator rose by 2.1% in Sarpang.

Housing Housing indicator comprises of three variables: room ratio, type of toilet and type of rooﬁng. Each of the variables has a cutoff based on which a person is classiﬁed as having achieved sufﬁciency in housing. Housing indicator aims to assess the quality of housing a person lives in. Poor living conditions can affect one's health, safety, and general wellbeing. Stress and other health issues can also be exacerbated by overcrowding and a lack of privacy.   Room ration refers to the ratio between the size of the household and the number of rooms in a household. When the median and mean are compared, the results do not show progress over time.

Assets The three variables that make up the assets indicator measure the ownership of three different asset types: livestock, land, and equipment (television, phones, etc.). Corresponding sufﬁciency cutoffs are then applied to each of these asset types to categorise a person as being in sufﬁciency or deprivation. Despite witnessing an improvement in sufﬁciency among the population who were not-yet-happy (a decrease in the censored deprivation headcount ratio of assets indicator), a closer examination at the three asset variables indicated a decrease in the average and median ownership of livestock and land (Table 52).

Remittances in the economy has also largely been increasing except for a drop in recent period53. Remittances provide a direct source of money for families and communities which is often used to pay for food, clothes, and other essentials, as well as education, healthcare, and housing. Both of these sources may have played an important role in improving the living standards domain.  While remittances provide an important source of income for families and communities, they may not be a sustainable solution to creating long-term economic growth and development in a country. We must implement policies and strategies that fosters entrepreneurship and innovation to create sustainable income and job opportunities. As per the 2022 National Labour Force Survey54, unemployment rate in the country increased from 3.1% in 2017 to 5.9% in 2022. Youth55 unemployment in the country has increased signiﬁcantly from 19.8% in 2017 to 28.6% in 2022.   Likewise, for many people and families, access to affordable housing may still be a crucial concern, especially in urban regions. Residents in  53 As per the Annual Report 2022 of Royal Monetary Authority, in 2020-2021 remittances were recorded at Nu 8,801.4 million. However, there was drop in net inward remittance in 2021-2022 at Nu 4,333.3 million (a decrease by 27.6 percent).  54 file:///Users/mac/Downloads/LFSReport-2022-WEB-version%20(1).pdf 55 Youth unemployment rate as per the Labour Force Survey Report 2022,  is deﬁned as the percentage of unemployed persons in the age group 15-24 years to the labour force (also known as economically active population) in the same age group.

Thimphu Thromde pay the greatest median rent burden, at 48% of the monthly family income of Nu 20,000. This indicates that households in the region with a median income of Nu 20,000 spend Nu 9,500 in rent per month as per the Housing and Market Demand Survey that was conducted in Thimphu Thromde in 2021. The National Housing Development Corporation Limited (NHDCL) has also made a change in policy to provide low-income people with affordable homes by opening up their housing colonies to those beyond civil servants.   Overall, we understand that creating jobs and improving housing conditions are complicated tasks that need a multifaceted strategy. This may involve addressing systemic barriers to economic growth and housing access, such as discrimination, lack of access to capital, and inadequate infrastructure.

Given the lack of publicly available information on earlier efforts, we rely on insights derived from Annual Performance Agreements (APAs)56. The APAs were drawn from the  56 The Annual Performance Agreement introduced by the Royal Government of Bhutan in 2013 is a mechanism to institutionalize and promote a performance-based culture in public sector agencies.

Initiatives listed under the APAs also includes information on other aspects, of which the following three were used to classify the level of contribution (highly likely, likely, lowly likely and unlikely) the initiative had on each of the GNH indicators;   1. Objective: Proxy for impact level data.  2. Action: Proxy for outcome level data.  3. Success indicator: Proxy for output level data.   If the concerned indicator under discussion has been reﬂected in ‘success indicator’ then it is said to be ‘highly likely’. Likewise, if it is reﬂected under ‘action’ or ‘objective’ then is it said to be a ‘likely’ contributor. If indicator is not reﬂected in ‘success indicator’ or ‘action’ or ‘objective’ but seems to have some indirect contribution, then it is said to ‘lowly likely’ contributor. However, if the initiative is neither reﬂected in the three and is thought to deteriorate the indicator then we assume it is an ‘unlikely’ contributor.  
 ensure responsibility and accountability for the results. Key objectives include establishing consensus on priorities, targets and for driving implementation efforts on ground. APA scores are also used to rate overall performance at the end of the Fiscal Year. 57 Note that the 10 ministries have been restructured.  Several departments have been merged and ministries renamed and their mandates reviewed. But for this exercise we use the previous structure since the APAs were from the financial year 2021-2022.

For the current exercise, we use nine ministerial-level APAs for the ﬁnancial year 2021-2022 which were available in the public domain. Contributions are examined58 based on a categorization framework, some of which were explained earlier. Table 55 illustrates in detail the classiﬁcation system adopted to assess the level of contributions.  For ease of explanation, we use the healthy days indicator under the health domain as an example.  Table 55: Classification system to assess the level of contribution made by an initiative59 to GNH indicator Is the programme/project contributing to the improvement of the GNH indicator? Description 
Highly likely  
An initiative is said to have a ‘highly likely’ contribution to the improvement of GNH indicator if the descriptions under the ‘success indicator’ has any direct mention of the concerned GNH indicator. For instance, if under the ‘success indicator’ states ‘number of healthy days increased among the population’ or ‘improve number of healthy days of the population’ then the initiative is assumed to directly contribute to the improvement of healthy days indicator. Essentially, any mention of the concerned indicator in the descriptions would be considered to have ‘highly likely’ contribution.  
 58 The mapping information excel sheet template was only limited to aggregate information on programme title, nature of intervention, output, outcome, impact, implementing agency, year and modality, among others, in relation to the GNH indicator and domain. Programmes were categorized across several components: capacity building, infrastructure, policy/strategy and service delivery, among others. Each interventions reﬂected in the APAs sheets was assessed against 33 GNH indicators to capture cross-indicator contributions.  59 Note that the APA reflect policies/programme/project either under ‘objective’, ‘action’ or ‘success indicator’.
<<<PAGE=338>>>
GNH 2022 
 306 
Likely  
An initiative assumed to have ‘likely’ contribution if descriptions under the ‘objective’ or ‘action’ areas mention the concerned GNH indicator. For instance, if either in the ‘objective’ or the ‘action’ area highlights ‘enhance health of the population’ then the contribution is assumed to be ‘likely’. 
Lowly likely  
An initiative is considered to be classified as ‘lowly likely’ if the GNH indicator does not reflect in all three (‘success indicator’, ‘objective’ and ‘action’) but it is felt that the listed initiative have some indirect contributions to the improvement of the GNH indicator under question. For instance, an initiative on increasing the number of health facilities or enhancing the health services is assumed to indirectly contribute to improving the healthy days indicator by ensuring better quality of healthcare. Note that while, there has been no direct mention of healthy days under ‘success indicator’, ‘objective’ and ‘action’, an association between the improvement of health services or increase in health facilities and healthy days indicator has been drawn and assigned ‘lowly likely’.  
Unlikely 
An initiative is classified as an ‘unlikely’ contributor, if the GNH indicator under question is neither featured in the descriptions of the outlined ‘success indicator’, ‘objective’, ‘action’ and is also perceived to have some adverse impact on the indicator. For instance, if the ‘success indicator’ of an initiative states as ‘construction of a state owned factory’ then this initiative would be considered to be an ‘unlikely’ contributor to the improvement of healthy days.

After the classiﬁcation process, analysis was carried out to compare and assess emerging patterns and trends of initiatives in relation to the 33 GNH indicators. We must note that the analysis did not involve assessing the level (intensity) of effectiveness of the interventions. In general, we reﬂected on the following questions during the analysis phase:  • Are there initiatives that directly/indirectly contribute to GNH indicator improvement?  • Which domains and indicators have the least or the most attention?  • Are there initiatives that have no alignment (those under ‘unlikely’) with the GNH domains and indicators?   In total, there were 105 ministerial-level APA entries made for the nine ministries for the ﬁnancial period 2021–2022 (Table 56).   Table 56: Ministerial-level APA entries, 2021–22 Implementing agency Number of initiatives Ministry of Health 15 Ministry of Finance 13 Ministry of Information and Communication 13 Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs 12 Ministry of Agriculture and Forests 11 Ministry of Labour and Human Resources 11 Ministry of Economic Affairs 10 Ministry of Education 10 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 10 Total 105 Source: Authors’ computations based on nine ministerial level APAs  The 105 initiatives were examined to assess the level of contribution towards the enhancement of the 33 GNH indicators. Under the psychological wellbeing domain, for example, an initiative were reviewed to determine if they were 'highly likely,' 'likely,' 'lowly likely,' or 'unlikely' to boost life satisfaction indicator. Such evaluations were repeated against rest of the 32 indicators. Despite our efforts to standardise and maximize objectiveness in the approach, one cannot

rule out the subjective biasness that may have occurred when the classiﬁcation system was being implemented.   Figure 89 shows that most of the 105 initiatives were deemed to be 'unlikely' to enhance the 33 indicators. The inﬂuence of the initiatives, however, varies from indicator to indicator. For example, only two of the 105 initiatives in the psychological wellbeing domain were ‘likely’ to lead to an increase in spirituality. Similarly, 14 of the 105 initiatives were ‘likely’ to enhance the frequency of positive feelings while 12 were ‘likely’ to decrease the frequency of negative emotions.  Let us concentrate on those that indicate 'highly likely', which correspond to the blue bars in Figure 98. Services have the most initiatives in 'highly likely' category. Fourteen of the 105 initiatives have been designated as 'highly likely' to improve services. Five initiatives were labelled as 'highly likely' to increase years of schooling among the population. Contributions to the safety indicator were next. Four initiatives were identiﬁed as having a high likelihood of contributing to increased community safety. Three initiatives were recognised as having a high likelihood to increase government performance.   It is worth noting that the contributions from the initiatives listed in the APAs are assessed across each of the 33 indicators to investigate if the same initiative is enhancing varied indicators.  Figure 98 also shows that around 14 initiatives contribute to service indicator under good governance.

Table 57 provide insights on the initiatives that were identiﬁed as ‘highly likely’ contributor to GNH indicator(s). We see that initiatives mostly caters to the improvement of conventional indicators such as services, schooling, safety, income and health.

Policy Implications of the GNH Index

So, what do these ﬁndings imply? It demonstrates that the majority of initiatives are focused on conventional development agenda such as education, health, and good governance. These indicators are already quite widespread and, for the most part, the focus of most government programmes. What is lacking is the existence of initiatives aimed at improving social indicators. There are limited initiatives that contribute to community vitality or time usage, for example. It advocates for more deliberate efforts to boost non-conventional domains of GNH.  However, we must note that this evaluation is based on a subset of the 2021–22 APAs. It only considered data from nine ministries (one of the ministerial level APA was not available). A complete assessment would essentially include reviewing the APAs of the 20 districts, thromdes, and autonomous agencies in addition to the 10 ministries.   The study was limited by availability of APA information in the public domain particularly during the assessment period of March to April 2023. The analysis here therefore is not complete.   The goal here was simply to demonstrate how similar analysis may be performed to align either performance agreements or any other programmatic interventions or projects or policy action areas with the 33 GNH indicators. Such insights can be administered to realign or reprioritise interventions or redirect resources towards GNH domains and indicators.

Conclusion  The GNH Index has become a well-established measure of wellbeing and holistic progress that goes beyond typical GDP and economic growth statistics. This book has looked at the 2022 GNH Index and the changes over time, the relationship between the GNH Index and income, the various GNH proﬁles and its policy implications.  Bhutan’s GNH Index grew from 0.743 in 2010, to 0.756 in 2015, and to 0.781 in 2022, suggesting signiﬁcant improvements in wellbeing and happiness. In 2022, the greatest gains were in the areas of living standards and community vitality, followed by good governance. However, other domains, including culture and time use, witnessed deteriorations.   The book also provided some understanding on the standard measurements of material advancement such as GDP and income. Comparison with GNH Index were made to show that the GNH Index delivers a more comprehensive, holistic and inclusive perspective of development compared to GDP.  The GNH Index has also been used to build GNH proﬁles for various areas of Bhutan, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of varied conditions experienced by people throughout the country. The proﬁles indicate differences in GNH across urban and rural areas, as well as different age groups, educational backgrounds, and employment position. The proﬁles also underline the importance of many aspects of GNH such as relationships, work-life balance, belongingness that must be met in order to be happy, rather than just focusing on income alone.   The GNH Index has far-reaching policy implications for governments and policy makers worldwide. It can assist policy makers in identifying areas of need and prioritising measures that promote wellbeing and long-term development.

Conclusion

The need to prioritise social and environmental elements in development programmes is one signiﬁcant policy conclusion of the 2022 GNH Index. This includes investing in unconventional indicators of GNH. It also entails fostering the preservation of culture and community relationships, both of which are essential aspects in generating happiness.  Another policy implication of the GNH Index is the need to address wellbeing inequities among subgroups. This entails directing policies and investments toward the regions and populations most in need of assistance. As previously stated, this requires indicator based targeting, since the target group changes from one indicator to another.   Efforts should be made to promote social ties and support networks. This may be accomplished through community-building activities, ﬁnancial support for social clubs and organisations, and programmes that promote social contact and engagement. It is also important to acknowledge the signiﬁcance of mental health and psychological wellbeing and prioritise measures that enhance emotional resilience and access to mental health services. This might involve ﬁnancing for mental health services, research into the causes and treatments of mental disease, and projects to encourage mindfulness, meditation, and other mental-wellbeing activities.  Efforts also may need to be made to encourage education on aspects such as the Constitution, local legends, festivals and HIV/AIDs. Accessibility policies may assist guarantee that all members of the community, including those with disabilities, have access to and enjoy pedestrian-friendly streets. This can involve things like adding curb ramps, making public transit more accessible, and making sure walkways are broad enough to accommodate wheelchairs and strollers.  In urban areas, political participation seems to be deteriorating hence, policies may pay attention to lowering voting barriers. This may be done by ensuring that eligible voters have access to the ballot box. This can involve things like extending early voting hours, permitting same-day voter registration, and offering mail-in voting choices. Policies that support political education can serve to boost civic awareness and

engagement. Similarly, interventions such as mandating civics education in schools, offering voter education materials are examples of such efforts.  In general, the 33 indicators appear to be relevant for the time being, but they may need to be revisited in the future to fully reﬂect societal challenges and circumstances associated with growing economic and social trends and causes of their time. With rising emigration to Australia, for example, one could want to include an employment indicator to capture information on job opportunities in the country. Similarly, as literacy rates rise, the literacy indicator may become obsolete. Therefore, for the GNH Index to successfully monitor the country's wellbeing and happiness, the normative relevance and validity of the indicators will need to be examined before the next update.  The publication of this book is an important ﬁrst step in increasing awareness and understanding of the GNH Index and the changes overtime. However, it is critical to acknowledge that additional efforts are required to successfully promote and use the GNH Index ﬁndings for the improvement of society.  Advocacy efforts, workshops, and awareness programmes aimed at policymakers, civil society organisations, and the general public are critical to increasing understanding of the GNH Index and the ﬁndings. These initiatives can educate stakeholders, allowing them to understand and appreciate its importance in gauging societal wellbeing.  By engaging policymakers, we can foster a deeper understanding of how the GNH Index can inform and shape policy decisions. It provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of considering holistic wellbeing and happiness as fundamental goals of governance. Policymakers need to be aware of the potential beneﬁts and policy applications of the GNH Index, encouraging them to incorporate its principles into their decision-making processes.  Engaging non-governmental organisations and civil society organisations, which play an essential role in enhancing societal wellbeing, is also critical. Giving these organisations knowledge about

the GNH Index ﬁndings allows them to effectively advocate for policies that prioritise citizens’ overall happiness and welfare.   A well-designed communication strategy in multiple languages and for different audiences is therefore, essential for ensuring effective communication and information dissemination.   The promotion of the GNH Index in international fora holds immense potential for developing international cooperation and collaboration on well-being-centered policy. By sharing Bhutan’s GNH Index for other countries to tailor to their contexts we can inspire a global movement towards going Beyond GDP by using a more holistic approach to development and well-being. It can drive governments to consider a broader set of elements that contribute to human ﬂourishing rather than a restricted focus on economic growth.  We have an opportunity to inﬂuence our own policy landscape by embracing the GNH Index at home. Its institutionalisation guarantees that politicians are urged to make decisions based on evidence rather than short-term political rewards. It will encourage them to think on the long-term effects of their policies on societal wellbeing, fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. In addition to providing a profound yet rigorous framework for measuring success and well-being – one which goes far beyond standard economic indicators - institutionalising the GNH Index promotes an evaluation and accountability culture, allowing politicians to measure the impact of their actions on population happiness and well-being. As a result, governance can become more responsive and people-centered.

Annexure I: Survey Methodology This section brieﬂy presents the methodology adopted for the 2022 GNH survey such as sampling design, survey instruments, data collection process, data cleaning and analysis approaches. Survey coverage The 2022 GNH survey, like past GNH surveys, is designed to cover the entire country which is divided into 20 dzongkhags. Each dzongkhag is divided into rural and urban areas and is further sub-divided into Enumeration Areas (EA). Chiwogs in rural and enumeration blocks in urban areas is used as a Primary Sampling Unit (PSU). The target population included those aged 15 years or older.  Sample design The sample for the 2022 GNH survey is designed to provide estimates of GNH-related indicators representative at national, rural and urban areas, and dzongkhag levels. A stratiﬁed three-stage sampling design is adopted. Two mutually exclusive sampling frames – rural and urban areas were used.60 Urban and rural areas within each dzongkhag have been identiﬁed as the main sampling strata.   The ﬁrst stage sample selection involved selection of PSUs which are chiwogs in rural and enumeration blocks in urban areas. The PSUs in both rural and urban areas are selected using Probability Proportional 
 60 All Thromdes (urban centres), Dzongkhag Headquarters, and satellite towns designated as ‘urban’ by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS) were considered as urban areas and all the rest as rural areas for this study. A place that meets four out of the following five criteria is considered ‘urban’ by the MoWHS: i) a minimum population of 1,500 people; ii) a population density of 1,000 people or more per square kilometre; iii) more than 50% of the population should depend on non-primary activities; iv) the area of the urban centre should not be less than 1.5 square kilometres; and v) potential for future growth of the urban centre particularly in terms of its revenue base.

to Size (PPS) method where number of households is used as measure of size (MOS) variable.  Households within the selected PSUs formed the Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). Therefore, the second stage sample selection involved selecting households as SSUs from within the selected PSUs. The required number of households from the selected PSUs were selected using Circular Systematic Sampling (CSS) approach.   Finally, the third stage sample selection involved the selection of individuals as Ultimate Sampling Units (USUs) from the selected households. Selection of a household member from the selected households was done using the Kish grid selection method.  Sampling frame The sampling frame for the survey is constructed using number of households reported by the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) based on the Population and Housing Census of Bhutan (PHCB) conducted in 2017. The household listing for the selected PSUs was updated before the selection of household samples. For effective implementation of area sampling, the ﬁeld supervisors and assistant supervisors were trained extensively on area sampling methods before leaving for the ﬁeld survey.  Sample size The required sample size for the 2022 GNH Survey was determined using the following sample size estimation formula. The required sample size for each dzongkhag was calculated based on the 2015 GNH Index value which is expressed as the average sufﬁciency rate across 33 weighted GNH indicators.

Considering that 10 households are selected from each urban PSUs and 1561 households from each rural PSUs, a total of 304 PSUs from urban and 560 from rural areas were selected. Therefore, the ﬁnal sample size was 11,440.  Sample allocation Within the dzongkhag, the estimated sample of respective dzongkhag is allocated proportional to the dzongkhag’s rural and urban household proportion. Therefore, at the national level, 8,400 (73%) of the total sample was selected from rural areas and the remaining 3,040 (27%) of the total sample was selected from urban areas.   The sample size and sample allocation to dzongkhags and area are provided in Table A58. 
 61 The number of samples to be drawn from each PSUs in urban and rural areas was discussed with the NSB officials on 10 November 2020. Based on NSB’s prior field survey experience, it is optimal to draw 10 samples per urban PSU and 15 per rural PSU.

In addition to the training provided to GNH survey ﬁeld supervisors and enumerators, they were also provided with a GNH survey manual to guide them in asking questions and conducting interviews. The manual contained detailed explanations on how each question should be asked or explained to respondents during the interview. It also included detailed instruction on randomisation in selecting respondents from selected households using Kish grid selection methods. Data collection and processing The data collection method adopted was face-to-face interviews using CAPI. The survey was conducted between April and July 2022.   The overall response rate is 96.6%. The response rate is slightly higher in rural areas (97.3%) than urban areas (94.8%).
