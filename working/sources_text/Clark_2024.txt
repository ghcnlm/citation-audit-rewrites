Strategies to implement evidence-informed 
decision making at the organizational level: 
a rapid systematic review

Abstract 
Background Achievement of evidence-informed decision making (EIDM) requires the integration of evidence 
into all practice decisions by identifying and synthesizing evidence, then developing and executing plans to imple-
ment and evaluate changes to practice. This rapid systematic review synthesizes evidence for strategies for the imple-
mentation of EIDM across organizations, mapping facilitators and barriers to the COM-B (capability, opportunity, 
motivation, behaviour) model for behaviour change. The review was conducted to support leadership at organi-
zations delivering public health services (health promotion, communicable disease prevention) to drive change 
toward evidence-informed public health.
Methods A systematic search was conducted in multiple databases and by reviewing publications of key authors. 
Articles that describe interventions to drive EIDM within teams, departments, or organizations were eligible for inclu-
sion. For each included article, quality was assessed, and details of the intervention, setting, outcomes, facilita-
tors and barriers were extracted. A convergent integrated approach was undertaken to analyze both quantitative 
and qualitative findings.
Results Thirty-seven articles are included. Studies were conducted in primary care, public health, social services, 
and occupational health settings. Strategies to implement EIDM included the establishment of Knowledge Broker-
type roles, building the EIDM capacity of staff, and research or academic partnerships. Facilitators and barriers align 
with the COM-B model for behaviour change. Facilitators for capability include the development of staff knowl-
edge and skill, establishing specialized roles, and knowledge sharing across the organization, though staff turnover 
and subsequent knowledge loss was a barrier to capability. For opportunity, facilitators include the development 
of processes or mechanisms to support new practices, forums for learning and skill development, and protected time, 
and barriers include competing priorities. Facilitators identified for motivation include supportive organizational cul-
ture, expectations for new practices to occur, recognition and positive reinforcement, and strong leadership support. 
Barriers include negative attitudes toward new practices, and lack of understanding and support from management.
Conclusion This review provides a comprehensive analysis of facilitators and barriers for the implementation of EIDM 
in organizations for public health, mapped to the COM-B model for behaviour change. The existing literature for strat-
egies to support EIDM in public health illustrates several facilitators and barriers linked to realizing EIDM. Knowledge 
of these factors will help senior leadership develop and implement EIDM strategies tailored to their organization, leading 
to increased likelihood of implementation success.

Background
There exist expectations that decisions and programs that 
affect public and population health are informed by the 
best available evidence from research, local context, and 
political will [1–3]. To achieve evidence-informed public 
health, it is important that public health organizations 
engage in and support evidence-informed decision mak -
ing (EIDM). For this review, “public health organizations” 
refers to organizations that implement public health pro -
grams, including health promotion, injury and disease 
prevention, population health monitoring, emergency 
preparedness and response, and other critical functions 
[4]. EIDM, at an organizational level, involves the integra-
tion of evidence into all practice decisions by identifying 
and synthesizing evidence, then developing and execut -
ing plans to implement and evaluate changes to practice 
[2, 5, 6]. EIDM considers research evidence along with 
other factors such as context, resources, experience, and 
patient/community input to influence decision making 
and program implementation [2, 3, 7, 8]. When imple -
mented, EIDM results in efficient use of scarce resources, 
encourages stakeholder involvement resulting in more 
effective programs and decisions, improves transparency 
and accountability of organizations, improves health out-
comes, and reduces harm [3, 7, 8]. Therefore, it is impor-
tant that EIDM is integrated into organizations serving 
public health.
Driving organizational change for EIDM is challenging 
due to the need for multifaceted interventions [9].While 
there are systematic reviews of the implementation of 
specific evidence-informed initiatives, reviews of imple -
mentation of organization-wide EIDM are lacking. For 
example, Mathieson et al. and Li et al. examined the bar -
riers and facilitators to the implementation of evidence-
informed interventions in community nursing and Paci 
et  al. examined barriers in physiotherapy [10–12]. Li 
et  al. found that implementation of evidence-informed 
practices is associated with an organizational culture 
for EIDM where staff at all levels value and contribute 
to EIDM [12]. Similarly, Mathieson et al. and Paci et al. 
found that organizational context plays an important 
role in evidence-informed practice implementation along 
with organizational support and resources [10, 11]. While 
these reviews identify organizational context, culture 
and support as crucial for the implementation of a par -
ticular evidence-informed practice, they do not identify 
and describe sufficiently what and how an organization 
evolves to consistently be evidence-informed for all deci -
sions and programs and services it delivers.
Primary studies have explored how building capac -
ity for staff to find, interpret and synthesize evidence to 
develop practice and program recommendations may 
contribute to EIDM [13–16]. In 2019, Saunders et  al. 
completed an overview of systematic reviews on primary 
health care professionals’ EIDM competencies and found 
that implementation of EIDM across studies was low [9]. 
Participants reported insufficient knowledge and skills to 
implement EIDM in daily practice despite positive EIDM 
beliefs and attitudes [9]. In 2014, Sadeghi-Bazargani et al. 
and in 2018, Barzkar et al. also explored the implemen -
tation of EIDM and found similar results, listing inad -
equate skills and lack of knowledge amongst the most 
common barriers to EIDM [17, 18].
An underlying current in research for organizational 
EIDM is a focus on organizational change [13, 14, 19, 20]. 
To achieve EIDM across an organization, significant organi-
zational change is usually necessary, resulting in substantial 
impact on the entire organization, as well as for individuals 
working there. However, while there are reviews of indi -
vidual capacity for EIDM, there is minimal synthesized evi-
dence describing EIDM capacity at the organizational level. 
This review seeks to address this research gap by identify-
ing, appraising, and synthesizing research evidence from 
studies seeking to understand the process of embedding 
EIDM across an organization, with a focus on public health 
organizations.
The COM-B model for behaviour change was used as 
a guide for contextualizing the findings across studies. 
By integrating causal components of behaviour change, 
the COM-B model supports the development of inter -
ventions that can sustain behaviour change in the long-
term. While there are numerous models available to 
support implementation and organizational change, the 
COM-B model was chosen, in part, for its simple visual 
representation of concepts, as well as its contributions 
to the sustainability of behaviours [21]. This model is 
designed to guide organizational change initiatives and 
distill complex systems that influence behaviour into 
simpler, visual representations. Specifically, this model 
looks at capability (C), opportunity (O) and motivation 
(M) as three key influencers of behaviour (B). The capa -
bility section of the COM-B model reflects whether the 
intended audience possess the knowledge and skills for 
a new behaviour. Opportunity reflects whether there is
<<<PAGE=3>>>
Page 3 of 35
Clark et al. BMC Health Services Research          (2024) 24:405 
 
opportunity for new behaviour to occur, while motiva -
tion reflects whether there is sufficient motivation for a 
new behaviour to occur. All three components interact 
to create behaviour and behaviours can, in turn, alter 
capability, motivation and opportunity [21]. Selection 
of the COM-B model was also driven by authors’ exten -
sive experience supporting public health organizations in 
implementing EIDM, which observed enablers for EIDM 
that align well with the COM-B model, such as team-
wide capacity-building for EIDM, integration of EIDM 
into processes, and support from senior leadership [20, 
22, 23]. The COM-B model has been used to map find -
ings from systematic reviews examining the barriers and 
facilitators of various health interventions including nico-
tine replacement, chlamydia testing and lifestyle manage-
ment of polycystic ovary syndrome [24–26]. This review 
has a broader focus and maps barriers and facilitators for 
organization-wide EIDM to the COM-B model.
Overall, EIDM is expected to be a foundation at pub -
lic health organizations to achieve optimal health of 
populations. However, the capacity of public health 
organizations to realize EIDM varies considerably from 
organization to organization [14, 22, 27–29]. This rapid 
review aims to examine the implementation of EIDM 
at the organizational level to inform change efforts at 
Canadian public health organizations. The findings of 
this review can be applied more broadly and will support 
public health organizations beyond Canada to implement 
change efforts to practice in an evidence-informed way.
Methods
Study design
The review protocol was registered with the International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; 
Registration CRD42022318994). The review was con -
ducted and reported following the Preferred Report -
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) statement for reporting systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses [30]. A rapid review approach was 
used, since the review was requested to be completed 
by the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and 
Tools’ Rapid Evidence Service within a specific timeline, 
in order to inform an organizational change initiative at 
a provincial public health organization in Canada [31]. 
Given the nature of the research question, a mixed meth-
ods rapid systematic review approach was taken, with 
guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual 
for Evidence Synthesis [32].
Information sources and search strategy
The search was conducted on March 18, 2022. The fol -
lowing databases were searched from 2012 onward: 
Medline, Embase, Emcare, Global Health Database, 
PsycINFO, Web of Science. Each database was searched 
using combinations and variations of the terms “imple -
ment*” , “knowledge broker*” , “transform*” , “organiza -
tional culture” , “change management” , “evidence-based” , 
“knowledge translation” , and “knowledge mobilization” . 
Additionally, publications by key contributors to the 
field were reviewed. The full search strategy is included 
in Appendix 1.
Studies were screened using DistillerSR software. Titles 
and abstracts of retrieved studies were screened by a sin -
gle reviewer. Full texts of included studies were screened 
by a second reviewer and reviewed by a third. Screening 
was not completed in duplicate, consistent with a rapid 
review protocol [31]. To minimize the risk of bias, a sub -
set of 100 retrieved articles were screened in duplicate at 
the title and abstract stage to ensure consistency across 
reviewers. Of this subset, there were four articles with 
conflicting decisions, which were discussed amongst 
screeners to clarify inclusion criteria.
Eligibility criteria
English-language, published primary studies with experi -
mental or observational designs were eligible for inclu -
sion. Review papers, such as literature and systematic 
reviews, were excluded to ensure that details regarding 
implementation of initiatives were captured without re-
interpretation or generalization by review authors. Grey 
literature was not included. Eligibility criteria are out -
lined below in terms of a PICO (Population, Intervention, 
Comparison, Outcome) structure [33].
Population
Studies conducted with public sector health-related ser -
vice-delivery organizations were eligible for inclusion. 
This included public health departments and authorities, 
health care settings and social services. Studies focused 
on departments or teams within an organization, or on 
entire organizations, were also eligible for inclusion. 
Studies conducted in private sectors or academic institu -
tions were excluded to narrow the focus of the review.
Intervention
Interventions designed and implemented to shift teams, 
departments, or organizations to EIDM in all decisions 
were eligible for inclusion. These can include initiatives 
where organizations establish roles or teams to drive 
organizational change for EIDM, or efforts to build and 
apply the knowledge and skill of staff for EIDM. These  
are distinct from implementation strategies for evidence-
informed interventions. Eligible interventions were applied 
to a team, department, or organization to drive change 
toward evidence use in decision making at all levels of 
the organizations.

Comparator
Studies that included any comparator or no comparator 
were included, recognizing that literature was likely to 
include case reports.
Outcomes
Outcomes measured either quantitatively or qualitatively 
were considered. These included behaviour change, con -
fidence and skills, patient-level data such as quality indi -
cators, evidence of EIDM embedded in organizational 
and decision-making processes, changes in organiza -
tional culture, and changes to budget allocation. Studies 
that reported primarily on implementation fidelity were 
excluded, since studies of implementation fidelity focus 
on whether an intervention is delivered as intended, 
rather than drivers for organizational change.
Setting
Studies conducted in the 38 member countries of the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Develop -
ment (OECD) were included in this review to best align 
with the Canadian context and to inform organizational 
change efforts in public health within Canada [34].
Quality assessment
The methodological rigour of included studies was eval -
uated using the JBI suite of critical appraisal tools [35]. 
Ratings of low, moderate, or high quality were assigned 
based on the critical appraisal results. Quality assessment 
was completed by one reviewer and verified by a second. 
Conflicts were resolved through discussion or by consult-
ing a third reviewer.
Data extraction
Data extraction was completed by a single reviewer and 
reviewed by a second. Data on the study design, set -
ting, sector (e.g., public health, primary care, etc.), par -
ticipants, intervention (e.g., description of learning 
initiatives, implementation strategies, etc.), outcome 
measures, and findings were extracted. To minimize the 
risk of bias, a subset of three included articles underwent 
data extraction in duplicate to ensure consistency across 
reviewers. There was good agreement between duplicate 
extraction, with variations in the format of extracted data 
but consistency in content.
Data analysis
Quantitative and qualitative data were synthesized simul-
taneously, using a convergent integrated approach [32]. 
Quantitative data underwent narrative synthesis, where 
findings that caused benefit were compared with those 
that caused harm or no effect [36]. Vote counting based 
on the direction of effect was used to determine whether 
most studies found a positive or negative effect [36]. For 
qualitative findings, studies were grouped according to 
common strategies. Within these common strategies, 
findings were reviewed for trends in reported facilitators 
and barriers. These trends were deductively mapped to 
the COM-B model for behaviour change [37].
Due to the heterogeneity in study outcomes, the Grad -
ing of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and 
Evaluations (GRADE) [38] approach was not used for 
this review. Overall certainty of evidence was determined 
based on the risk of bias of included study designs and 
study quality.
Results
Database searching retrieved 7067 records. After remov -
ing duplicates, 4174 records were screened by title and 
abstract, resulting in 1370 reports for full text review. Of 
those 1370 records, 35 articles were included. Scanning 
the publication lists of key authors retrieved 187 records, 
of which eight were retrieved for full text review and two 
were included, for a total of 37 articles included in this 
review. See Fig. 1 for a PRISMA flow chart illustrating the 
article search and selection process.
Study characteristics
The overall characteristics of included studies are sum -
marized in Table  1. Of 37 included studies, most were 
conducted in primary care settings (n = 16) and pub -
lic health settings (n = 16), with some in social services 
(n = 3), child and youth mental health (n = 1), and occu -
pational health (n = 1). Most studies were conducted in 
the USA (n = 17), followed by Canada (n = 12), Australia 
(n = 5), and Europe (n = 3).
Study designs included case reports (n = 18), single 
group pre-/post-test studies (n = 10), qualitative studies 
(n = 7), and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2). 
Both RCTs evaluated the implementation of organiza -
tional EIDM.
Studies reported quantitative (n = 11), qualitative 
(n = 20), or both quantitative and qualitative results 
(n = 6). For the studies that reported quantitative results, 
measures included EIDM implementation, EIDM-related 
beliefs and behaviours, organizational priorities for 
EIDM, and patient care quality indicators. Quantitative 
measures were heterogenous and did not allow meta-
analysis. Qualitative findings were generated through 
formal qualitative analysis (n = 19) or descriptive case 
reports (n = 7). Most qualitative results included facilita -
tors and barriers to implementation (n = 16).
Study quality
The critical appraisal checklist used to assess each study 
is indicated in Table  1. Single group, pre-/post-test
<<<PAGE=5>>>

studies were evaluated according to the JBI Checklist for 
Quasi-experimental Studies [35].
A lack of control groups contributed to the risk of bias. 
Most included studies were rated Moderate or High qual-
ity according to their respective quality assessment tools. 
Full quality assessments for each article are included in 
Appendix 2. Therefore, the overall methodological qual -
ity for this body of literature was rated as Moderate.
Strategies for implementing organization‑wide EIDM
Due to the heterogeneity of study designs, interventions, 
and outcomes, it was not possible to determine which 
EIDM implementation strategies are more effective com -
pared to others. Implementation strategies included the 
establishment of Knowledge Broker-type roles, building 
the EIDM capacity of staff, and research or academic 
partnerships. These strategies are listed in Table 2.
Evaluation of strategies implemented by studies in 
this review was often qualitative and described facili -
tators and barriers, rather than quantitatively meas -
uring effectiveness. However, it is possible to explore 
EIDM implementation strategies and factors that 
appear to contribute to or inhibit success. The most 
common strategy implemented in included stud -
ies was the establishment of Knowledge Broker-type 
roles [20, 41, 44, 47, 48, 51, 52, 54–57, 59, 60, 62–67, 
69, 71, 72]. Studies described roles differently (e.g., 
“Evidence-based Practice Facilitator” , “Evidence Facili -
tator” , “EIDM Mentor”). These roles all served to sup -
port EIDM across organizations through knowledge 
sharing, evidence synthesis, implementation, and 
other EIDM-related activities. In some studies, new 
staff were hired to Knowledge Broker roles, or devel -
oped among existing staff, while in others, Knowledge 
Brokers were contracted from external organizations. 
Knowledge Broker strategies were mostly imple -
mented in parallel with other EIDM implementation 
strategies, such as capacity building for staff, integrat -
ing EIDM into decision-making processes and devel -
opment of leadership to support EIDM. When these 
strategies were evaluated quantitatively for organiza -
tional capacity, culture and implementation of EIDM, 
most studies found positive results, such as increased 
scores for organizational climates supporting EIDM, 
improved attitudes toward EIDM, or the integration 
of EIDM into processes [44, 52, 54, 62, 66, 67, 71, 72], 
although some studies found no change [55, 60] follow -
ing implementation of Knowledge Broker roles. Quali -
tatively, most studies described facilitators and barriers 
to EIDM, either through formal qualitative analysis or 
case report [14, 20, 39–43, 45, 47, 48, 52, 55, 57, 59–61, 
64, 65, 68]. Facilitators included organizational culture

with supportive leadership and staff buy-in, expecta -
tions to use evidence to inform decisions, accessible 
knowledge, and integration of EIDM into processes and 
templates. Barriers included limited time and compet -
ing priorities, staff turnover, and lack of understanding 
and support from management.
Ten included studies focused primarily on building 
EIDM capacity of existing staff at the organization, often 
at multiple levels (e.g., front-line service providers, man -
agers, and leadership) [13, 14, 39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 49, 50, 
58, 61]. Capacity building was typically done through 
EIDM-focused workshops, often with ongoing follow up 
support from workshop facilitators. While studies often 
measured changes in individual knowledge and skill for 
EIDM for workshop participants, organizational change 
for EIDM was reported qualitatively, either through 
formal qualitative analysis or through a case report. 
Facilitators for EIDM in these ten studies included organ-
izational culture with supportive leadership and staff  
buy-in, dedicated staff roles to support EIDM, opportu -
nities to meet and discuss EIDM (e.g., communities of 
practice, journal clubs), knowledge sharing across the 
organization, expectations to use evidence to inform 
decisions, accessible knowledge, and integration of EIDM 
into processes and templates. Barriers included limited 
time and competing priorities, staff turnover, and nega -
tive attitudes toward EIDM.
Research or academic partnerships and networks 
were the main strategy described in three case reports 
[45, 53, 68]. These involved establishing collaborations, 
either through universities or non-governmental health 
organizations, that provided direct EIDM support. 
These strategies were not evaluated quantitatively but 
described facilitators and barriers to effective cross-
sector collaborations. Facilitators for EIDM included 
supportive leadership and management, dedicated 
staff roles to support EIDM, EIDM knowledge and 
skill development for staff, and regular communication 
between partners. Barriers included limited time and 
competing priorities, preference for experiential over 
research evidence, and negative attitudes toward EIDM.
Overall, studies described successes in implementing 
EIDM across organizations, citing several common key 
facilitators and barriers. To instigate behaviour change, 
strategies must address capability for change, which may 
be achieved by building staff capacity, establishing dedi -
cated support roles, improving access to evidence, and 
sharing knowledge across the organization. Strategies 
must also enable opportunities for change, which may be 
supported through forums for EIDM learning and prac -
tice, protecting time for EIDM, integrating EIDM into 
new or existing roles, and adding EIDM to processes and 
templates. Behaviour change also requires motivation, 
which may be built through a supportive organizational 
culture, expectations to use EIDM, recognition and posi -
tive reinforcement, and strong support from leadership.
Key considerations for implementing EIDM
Many of the facilitators and barriers to EIDM are com -
mon across strategies explored by the studies included 
in this review. To conceptualize these factors, they were 
mapped to the COM-B model for behaviour change [21] 
in Fig. 2.
Within the capability component of the COM-B 
model, staff knowledge and skill development were 
included as a facilitator. Studies included in this review 
demonstrated that knowledge and skill for EIDM sup -
ported the use of evidence in decision making [13, 14, 
39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 49, 50, 58, 61]. The establishment of 
specialized or dedicated roles for EIDM, such as Knowl -
edge Broker roles, was included in the capability com -
ponent of the COM-B model, since Knowledge Broker 
roles support the capacity of organizations and their 
staff to use evidence-informed approaches [20, 41, 44, 
47, 48, 51, 52, 54–57, 59, 60, 62–67, 69, 71, 72]. Finally, 
knowledge sharing across organizations was described 
as a facilitator for EIDM by several of the studies that 
built staff capacity for EIDM or established Knowledge 
Broker roles [13, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 56, 59, 61, 65]. Bar -
riers to the capability for EIDM behaviours include staff  
turnover and subsequent knowledge loss [14, 20, 56]. 
Staff turnover is especially challenging for interventions 
that involve staff in dedicated Knowledge Broker roles 
and interventions that build the knowledge and skill 
for staff to engage in evidence use [14, 20, 56]. In some 
cases, individuals who are trained in the Knowledge Bro -
ker role are then promoted to new roles or management 
and have fewer opportunities to apply their Knowledge 
Broker skills [20].
The opportunity portion of the COM-B model reflects 
whether there is opportunity for new behaviour to 
occur. The development of processes and mechanisms 
that support new practices can act as a reminder for 
staff, and may include re-design of planning or deci -
sion-making templates to capture supporting evidence,

or adding EIDM-related items to agendas for regular 
meetings [41, 47, 53, 60]. Forums for learning and skill 
development provide staff with opportunities to gain 
knowledge and practice newly acquired skills in group 
settings, such as communities of practice or journal 
clubs [48, 56, 61, 65]. Finally, protected time to apply 
EIDM was found to be a facilitator for opportunity in 
the COM-B model [20, 47, 57, 59, 65], while competing 
priorities were found to be a barrier [20, 39, 40, 52, 55, 
57, 60, 64, 65].
The final influencer in the COM-B model, motivation, 
reflects whether there is sufficient motivation for a new 
behaviour to occur. Facilitators include supportive organ-
izational culture [14, 20, 43, 47, 57, 59], expectations for 
new practices to occur [20, 40], recognition and posi -
tive reinforcement [52, 59, 60, 65], and strong leadership 
support [14, 20, 39, 40, 43, 47, 56, 59, 65, 68]. Barriers to 
motivation included a lack of understanding or support 
from management [20], and negative attitudes toward 
change [20, 52, 59, 68].
Discussion
Strategies to implement EIDM across organizations 
include establishing specialized roles, providing staff  
education and training, developing processes or mecha -
nisms to support new practices, and demonstrating 
leadership support. Facilitators and barriers for these 
strategies align with the COM-B model for behaviour 
change, which outlines capability, opportunity, and moti-
vation as influencers of behaviour (Fig.  2). The COM-B 
model provides a comprehensive framework for the fac -
tors that influence behaviour change and has provided a 
valuable structure for examining barriers and facilitators 
to behaviour change in public health and related fields 
[73–76].
The capability section of the COM-B model reflects 
whether the intended audience possess the knowledge 
and skill for a new behaviour. Findings from this review 
establish facilitators for EIDM implementation capabil -
ity, including the development of staff knowledge and 
skill, establishing specialized roles, and knowledge shar -
ing across the organization. The development of staff  
knowledge and skill for EIDM are a necessary compo -
nent to ensure EIDM in practice, however, literature has 
found that the organization-wide impact of conducting 
only individual-level knowledge and skill development 
is limited [77–79]. While knowledge and skill develop -
ment are a necessary component to EIDM practice, 
they must be supported by other components to have 
an impact beyond the individual. Other strategies that 
support the use of newly gained knowledge and skills 
include the establishment of specialized roles for EIDM. 
Another strategy to support the use of EIDM is the 
establishment of dedicated staff roles, such as Knowl -
edge Brokers. Knowledge Broker roles have been used 
across diverse contexts and show promise in supporting 
organization-wide EIDM implementation [20, 22, 23, 67, 
80–83]. One facilitator for Knowledge Broker roles was 
knowledge sharing across the organization. Factors that 
influence the success of staff in Knowledge Broker roles 
align with those mapped to opportunity and motivation 
in the COM-B model, including the integration of EIDM 
into processes, knowledge sharing, and supportive organ-
izational culture [20, 22, 47, 67, 84, 85]. Knowledge Bro -
kers can also help facilitate knowledge sharing across the 
organization, which was another facilitator mapped to

the capability level of the model [20, 47, 84, 85]. Knowl-
edge sharing refers to the shared learning, knowledge 
products and resources for EIDM. At large public health 
organizations, it can be challenging to facilitate knowl -
edge sharing between teams and departments [86, 87]. 
Integrating technology can help; there have been some 
advances driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the 
development of knowledge sharing platforms [88–91]. 
Public health organizations seeking to implement EIDM 
should invest in their knowledge sharing infrastructure.
At the capability level of the COM-B model, staff turn -
over was a barrier to EIDM implementation. Organiza -
tions that implement these strategies should be cognizant 
of the potential for knowledge loss due to staff turnover 
when selecting staff for Knowledge Broker roles or capac-
ity building opportunities.
Facilitators for organizational EIDM opportunity 
include the development of processes or mechanisms 
to support new practices, forums for learning and skill 
development, and protected time. The use of reminders 
for organizational behaviour change and implementation 
of clinical practice guidelines has been shown to be an 
effective strategy across many contexts [92–95]. Organi -
zations seeking to implement EIDM should consider 
revising current templates and processes to support their 
initiatives. Another facilitator included forums for shared 
learning and skill development. Other literature shows 
that these forums can be effective in developing knowl -
edge and skill and should foster an environment of learn -
ing without fear of reprisal [96, 97]. Finally, protected 
time for EIDM was a facilitator and competing priorities 
were a barrier. In public health practice, staff are often 
challenged with high workloads, so that EIDM may be 
viewed as an additional burden rather than a means to 
improve practice [98, 99]. For an EIDM approach to be 
practiced, staff must be provided with sufficient time to 
apply and practice skills. Organizations should consider 
involving middle management who oversee staff time 
allocations, rather than only senior leadership, to help 
ensure that staff are provided with the time they need 
and that expectations are adjusted accordingly [20, 23].
At the motivation level of the COM-B model, sup -
portive organizational culture was mapped as a facili -
tator. The influence of organizational culture on 
evidence-informed practice at health organizations has 
been explored in a previous systematic review by Li et al. 
[100]. This systematic review of organizational contextual 
factors that influence evidence-based practice included 
37 studies conducted in healthcare-related settings. Find-
ings align with facilitators identified above, especially 
leadership support, which was found to impact evidence-
based practice as well as all other factors that influence 
evidence-based practice [100]. The review also found that 
monitoring and feedback contributed to implementation 
of evidence-based practice, which aligns with recogni -
tion and positive reinforcement in the COM-B model 
above [100]. Notably, another factor that was mapped to 
the COM-B model was the expectation for new practices 
to occur, which was not explicitly identified as an influ -
ence on practice [100]. While Li et al. acknowledge that 
leadership that neglects to hold staff accountable are 
detrimental to implementation of EIDM, this account -
ability and clear expectations for change practice were a 
stronger finding in this current rapid systematic review.
The need for leadership support aligns with opportunity, 
since it is often management that determines the allocation 
of staff time for EIDM [20, 23]. Attitudes and the belief that 
EIDM is associated with positive outcomes is a key factor 
in overall competence for EIDM [101]. Efforts to address 
negative attitudes within staff, especially at the leadership 
level, may improve implementation of EIDM.
While this review provides a comprehensive overview 
of interventions to support EIDM in public health and 
related organizations, it does have some limitations. Given 
the heterogeneity of included studies, it was not possible 
to discern which implementation strategies for EIDM are 
more effective compared to others. Knowledge Broker 
roles, building capacity for EIDM, and research-academic 
partnerships were all shown to contribute to EIDM, but 
study findings do not support one strategy as superior to 
others. Given the highly contextual nature of these inter -
ventions, it is likely that the relative effectiveness of differ-
ent interventions depends on the organization’s unique set 
of characteristics. Evaluation is also critical to determine if 
change efforts are successful or need to be adjusted. It is 
possible that a combination of strategies would maximize 
the likelihood that diverse needs of staff are met. Rigorous 
studies to evaluate this hypothesis are needed.
Most studies included in this review are non-rand -
omized studies of interventions. Given the importance of 
context in organizational change, randomized controlled 
trial designs may not be well-suited to evaluate stud -
ies of EIDM implementation [102]. High-quality single-
group studies, such as prospective cohort analytic studies 
evaluated with validated measures or qualitative descrip -
tive analyses of case studies with thorough descriptions 
of interventions and context, may be more appropri -
ate designs for designing future initiatives in this field. 
However, arguments have been made for the use of ran -
domized trial designs in implementation research [103]. 
Foy et  al. advocate for overcoming contextual barriers 
by using innovative trial designs, such as the multiphase 
optimization strategy approach, where a series of trials 
identify the most promising single or combined interven-
tion components, or the sequential multiple assignment 
randomized trial approach, where early results inform

tailoring of adaptive interventions [103]. These designs 
may be a promising approach to conducting trials within 
highly contextual settings. Another viewpoint is that per -
haps it may not be essential to determine if one strategy 
is superior to another, but rather that strategies build a 
larger, multi-strategy approach to implementation [104]. 
There may be greater benefit to determining the condi -
tions under which various strategies are effective [104].
A limitation in this review’s methodology is that the 
review was completed following a rapid review protocol 
to ensure timely completion. Modifications of a system -
atic review approach included the use of a single reviewer 
for screening and using an unblinded reviewer to check 
quality assessment and data extraction. This may have 
contributed to some bias within the review, due to the 
reviewers’ interpretations of studies. To minimize this 
bias, there were efforts to calibrate screening, quality 
assessment and data extraction using a subset of studies.
This review provides a synthesis of strategies for the 
organization-wide implementation of EIDM, and an in-
depth analysis of their facilitators and barriers in public 
health organizations. Facilitators and barriers mapped to 
the COM-B model for behaviour change can be used by 
organizational leadership to drive organizational change 
toward EIDM.
Conclusion
This rapid systematic review explored the implementa -
tion of EIDM at the organizational level of public health 
and related organizations. Despite the similarity of these 
implementation challenges, studies used distinct strate -
gies for implementation, including the establishment of 
dedicated roles to support EIDM, building staff capaci -
ties, research or academic partnerships, and integrat -
ing evidence into processes or mechanisms. Facilitators 
and barriers mapped to the COM-B model provide key 
guidance for driving organizational change to evidence-
informed approaches for all decisions.
