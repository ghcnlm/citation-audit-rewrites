ABSTRACT
The paper describes a systematic review of literature published between January 2000 and October 2024 dealing 
with transfer of workplace e-learning. The review focused on theoretical frameworks, types of transfer being 
studied, and the types of transfer measurements employed to identify gaps in current knowledge and suggest 
directions for future research.
Following a discussion of transfer of training, the paper discusses how e-learning differs from traditional face- 
to-face training. The factors differentiating workplace learning from learning in institutes of education are also 
explored, thereby establishing workplace e-learning, and its transfer, as a distinct area of study.
The paper describes the search and filtering methodology used to identify relevant literature. The final corpus 
of thirty-one documents was studied to classify the type of transfer discussed in each document using six binary 
sub-categories of near and far transfer. In addition, transfer measurements were classified as self-reports, third- 
party reports, or objective measurements, and theoretical frameworks were recorded when the information was 
available. The information was examined to assess whether researchers used similar methodologies in 
approaching the topic of transfer of workplace e-learning.
The results of the study show that there is not yet a broadly agreed approach for conducting research into 
transfer of workplace e-learning. There is no common scale or methodology used to describe and classify transfer, 
and the most common approach to measuring transfer is self-reports, which are subject to bias. These factors 
point to a need for further research to develop a robust academic framework for the subject, ideally supported by 
empirical research.
1. Introduction
Skilled employees play an important role in productivity and inno -
vation, and organizations that invest in training can gain a competitive 
advantage ( Long & Smith, 2004 ). However, to benefit from training, the 
trained competence must be applied by the employee in the workplace. 
This application of a trained competence is known as “ transfer ” .
Baldwin and Ford (1988) described transfer as having two compo -
nents, generalisation and maintenance: i.e. what was learned in the 
specific context of training must be applied in a more general workplace 
context, and must continue over time. The so-called ‘transfer problem ’ 
refers to the fact that not all training is successfully transferred to the 
workplace.
E-learning is now an integral part of the training landscape. A 
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development survey indicated that 
just 9 percent of companies did not use any technology-based training in 
2023, down from 15 percent in 2020 ( Overton, 2023 ).
Given the importance of e-learning in workplace training, and the 
requirement for transfer for workplace e-learning to be effective, a 
synopsis of recent studies dealing with workplace e-learning transfer 
will be a useful foundation for future research. This paper therefore sets 
out to answer the following questions:
RQ1: Is there a common theoretical framework guiding research into 
the transfer of workplace e-learning?
RQ2: What types of transfer have been addressed in recent studies of 
workplace e-learning?
RQ3: What types of transfer measures have been used when exam -
ining the transfer of workplace e-learning?
Answering these questions will help identify gaps in current knowl -
edge about the transfer of workplace e-learning that can be addressed by 
future research.
The next section discusses the concept of transfer, followed by a 
section discussing workplace e-learning, differentiating it from other 
types of learning. Then, the research methodology is described, followed 
by results and findings. A discussion of the results is followed by a 
description of the research limitations, recommendations for future

research directions, and a brief conclusion.
1.1. What is transfer?
Transfer means applying a competence in a different situation than 
the one in which it was learned. However, transfer has many aspects. 
Lateral transfer occurs when the training is applied to similar tasks, 
whereas vertical transfer occurs when the training is applied to more 
complex tasks ( Barnett & Ceci, 2002 ; Ford et al. 2018 ). Gagn ´e (1965) , 
cited in Royer (1979) , alternatively describes vertical transfer as a 
process where a subordinate competence leads directly to the acquisi -
tion of a superordinate competence. Royer (1979) also differentiates 
between specific and non-specific transfer, with specific transfer 
involving a similarity between the learning and application tasks, and 
non-specific transfer showing no obvious connection between them. 
Additionally, Royer (1979 , p. 8) discusses literal and figural transfer, 
with literal transfer involving an exact transfer of a learned skill to a 
task, and figural transfer involving “ the use of some segment of our 
world knowledge as a tool for thinking about, or learning about, a 
particular problem or issue ” . Perkins and Salomon (1988) distinguish 
between “ low road ” transfer, where there is an almost automatic 
application of skills learned in one context to a similar, but different, 
context – they compare learning to drive a car and applying the skills 
driving a truck – and “ high road ” transfer where there is a deliberate 
abstraction of competence learned in one context so that it can be 
applied in another. Haskell (2001) described six levels of transfer based 
on the similarities between the learning and application situations, 
ranging from nonspecific transfer, where new learning is simply based 
on past learning, to displacement or creative transfer involving discov -
ering or creating a new concept based an insight gained from previous 
learning.
1.2. Near and far transfer
Researchers differentiate between near transfer, when the performed 
competence is similar to the training, and far transfer, when the trained 
competence is used in a situation not covered by the training (e.g. 
Barnett & Ceci, 2002 ; Royer, 1979 ; Sala et al. 2019 ). Thorndike and 
Woodworth (1901) found that transfer was more likely when the 
training material and the practice material were similar. This “ common 
elements theory ” , which has been supported by many scholars (e.g. 
Anderson & Singley, 1993 ; Detterman, 1993 ; Ritchie et al. 2015 ) in -
dicates that far transfer is infrequent and difficult to achieve. Indeed, 
there is a school of thought that far transfer does not exist (e.g. Mel -
by-Lervåg et al. 2016 ; Mosing et al. 2016 ; Sala & Gobet, 2017 ). In a 
recent second-order meta-analysis, Sala et al. (2019) found effectively 
zero evidence for the presence of far transfer.
However, Yelon and Ford (1999) point out that some tasks involve 
closed skills, where the task must be performed the same way each time, 
and others involve open skills, where the worker has freedom to decide 
how to use the skill. Additionally, some roles are highly supervised, with 
the worker always following defined instructions, while others are 
autonomous, with the worker free to decide how to complete their tasks. 
Training for a role that is autonomous and uses open skills will clearly be 
different than training for a highly supervised, closed skill role.
Haskell (2001 , p. 30) opined that “ there is no simple way to say if 
something is a case of near transfer or far transfer ” due to a lack of 
quantitative measurement. Barnett and Ceci (2002) suggested that the 
conflicting evidence regarding the existence or effectiveness of far 
transfer could be due to lack of consistency in the type of transfer being 
measured, leading to different types of transfer being incorrectly 
grouped together as though they were similar. They proposed a taxon -
omy based on the type of content that is transferred and the context of 
the learning and transfer. The type of content has three dimensions: the 
specificity or generality of the skill, the type of performance change, and 
the demands on memory. Each dimension has sub-categories as shown 
in Table 1 .
Likewise, Barnett and Ceci (2002) subdivided the transfer context 
into six categories: the knowledge domain, the physical context, the 
temporal context, the functional context, the social context, and the 
modality, each of which has a continuum from near to far transfer. 
Barnett and Ceci (2002) provided examples of points along these con -
tinua, shown in Table 2 , while pointing out that the examples are not 
evenly spaced, and that the scales are subjective.
1.3. Workplace e-learning
E-learning is “ instruction facilitated by technology, designed to 
enable a learner to achieve a specific learning goal without the 
requirement for the learner and the instructor to be in the same physical 
location ” ( O ’ Neill, 2024 ), and can be differentiated from traditional 
face-to-face learning in several respects. E-learning lets learners access 
the learning material at a time and at a pace that is convenient for them 
(e.g. Chen, 2008 ; Strother, 2002 ). E-learning is often unidirectional, in 
that the learner engages only with the learning material, and does not 
have direct communication with an instructor (e.g. Clark & Mayer, 
2016 ; Warner, 2019 ). In many cases, workplace e-learning is conducted 
at the learner ’ s own desk during working hours, rather than at a specific 
time dedicated to training in a location like a training room where 
training is the main focus (e.g. Baldwin-Evans, 2004 ; Eidson, 1999 ).
Workplace learning can be differentiated from learning in institutes 
of education. Schools, colleges, and universities exist to provide edu -
cation and expand the boundaries of knowledge, whereas the function of 
a workplace is to deliver a product or service ( Fuller & Unwin, 2004 ; 
Illeris, 2011 ). In workplaces, learning is of secondary importance to 
business objectives, with the function of training being to facilitate 
organisational performance ( Lewis & Thornhill, 1994 ). While learning 
in school or college follows a defined curriculum, learning in the 
workplace tends to be more informal, with individuals choosing what 
they learn based on their needs ( Eraut, 2004 ). Resnick (1987) observed 
that learning in school is generalised, focusing on principles, whereas in 
other learning situations the focus is on situation-specific competencies.
As e-learning grows in importance, researchers need to understand 
the factors that promote its transfer. Shukla et al. (2023) proposed a 
taxonomy of factors that affect the transfer of e-learning: learning design 
and planning, the learning environment and organisational support, 
individual learner characteristics, and computer literacy/attitudes. 
While the first three categories are relevant to both e-learning and to 
traditional learning (e.g. Baldwin & Ford, 1988 ; Ford et al. 2018 ), 
computer literacy and attitudes is unique to e-learning.
The next section outlines the methodology used to identify and 
classify the types of transfer studied in recent papers dealing with 
workplace e-learning.
2. Methodology
The standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re -
view and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) ( Page et al. 2021 ) were used for 
reporting this systematic literature review. While PRISMA was initially 
proposed for use with medical studies, the approach has also been used 
for studies in other fields, including workplace training and transfer (e.g. 
Carter et al. 2014 ; Shukla et al. 2023 ).

To identify the relevant literature, a database search was undertaken 
in November 2024. EBSCO (all databases), Scopus, and Web of Science 
were selected, as these databases provide broad coverage of the subject 
matter. In each database, the search focused on abstracts containing the 
words “ E-learning ” or “ Online learning ” or “ Web-based learning ” or 
“ Multimedia learning ” , and “ Transfer ” , and “ Workplace ” or “ Corporate ” 
or “ Company ” or “ Occupational ” . Additional searches included the 
terms: “ Digital education ” or “ Virtual learning ” or “ Distance education ” 
or “ Remote learning ” or “ Web-based training ” or “ Cyber learning ” or 
“ Internet-based education ” . The searches covered the period from 
January 2000 to October 2024, and identified 1118 results, 363 from 
EBSCO, 355 from Scopus, and 400 from Web of Science. The abstracts 
for each of the results were downloaded, along with other information 
such as authors, year of publication, journal name, and DOI, and im -
ported to an Excel spreadsheet which was used to summarise key in -
formation from the papers.
The inclusion criteria for the final analysis were: 1) the paper 
included information about transfer, 2) it focused on training for the 
workplace; 3) the training was delivered via e-learning; and 4) the paper 
was in English. Papers that did not satisfy all four criteria were excluded. 
Following identification and elimination of duplicates (304 papers) the 
remaining 814 papers were analysed in two stages. First, the abstracts 
were read to identify papers that clearly did not match the inclusion 
criteria. Some themes were evident in the exclusions at this stage: 189 
items did not deal with workplace learning (e.g. Emurian, 2006 ), 148 
dealt with various aspects of machine learning (e.g. Lin & Chang, 2022 ), 
71 items were proposals for or discussions of a methodology, technol -
ogy, or platform (e.g. Hamburg et al. 2007 ), and 29 were in languages 
other than English (e.g. Hochholdinger & Schaper, 2008 ). Many of the 
papers could have been excluded for multiple reasons, but when at least 
one inclusion criterion was absent, no further investigation was con -
ducted. In total, 642 papers were excluded at this stage. The remaining 
172 papers were read to assess if all inclusion criteria were satisfied. 
Papers excluded at this stage included 57 papers that did not deal with 
transfer of training (e.g. Lemaire & Greene, 2002 ), 21 papers that did not 
deal with workplace learning (e.g. Arif & Ahmad Tarmizi, 2023 ), and 16 
papers that were unavailable or only available for purchase (e.g. Burk 
et al. 2015 ). In total, 145 papers were excluded at this stage, leaving 27

papers for analysis. Four additional papers were added to the corpus 
based on citations in the papers that were reviewed ( Bertram et al., 
2015 ; Kirkman et al. 2006 ; Knott et al. 2024 ; Stein et al. 2015 ), leaving a 
total of 31 papers for review. Fig. 1 shows a graphical representation of 
the filtering process.
The purpose of the review was to collect data relevant to the research 
questions. The types of learned skill, performance change, and memory 
demands, described in Table 1 , were recorded in the Excel spreadsheet, 
along with the six transfer dimensions. The type of transfer under each 
dimension is classified as either Near or Far. Although this is a simpli -
fication, it nevertheless leads to 2
6 
= 64 different possibilities of detailed 
transfer.
Using Table 2 as a guide, near and far transfer were defined for each 
dimension as shown in Table 3 . This pragmatic binary view enables a 
process of differentiation and deeper analysis of published transfer 
studies.
Where available, the training topic and industry information were 
recorded, along with training duration, and the type of transfer mea -
surement. The number of trainees who completed the course and pro -
vided transfer information was also recorded. In addition, the 
theoretical framework used in each study was noted if the information 
was provided.
3. Findings
The number of papers published in any year ranged from zero to five, 
as shown in Fig. 2 . Three articles were published in the period 2001 to 
2006, nine in 2007 – 2012, eight articles in 2013 – 2018 and eleven in 
2019 – 2024, demonstrating a low but reasonably consistent interest in 
this topic over time.
Papers that provided the time commitment reported on training 
ranging from a 30 – 50 min Naloxone distribution course ( Ericson et al., 
2024 ) to 1500 h Master ’ s degree ( Navarro Martínez et al. 2022 ).
The healthcare industry was the focus of 12 of the 31 papers. This 
may be explained by the requirement for healthcare professionals to 
keep their knowledge current. According to Zeiger (2005 , p. 91): 
“ Perhaps more than any other professionals, physicians are expected to 
keep current with the latest developments in their field ” . Only two other 
industries, telecommunications and banking, were the focus of more 
than one study, with two papers for each. Highly regulated sectors 
(healthcare, telecoms, banking, health insurance, child welfare, 
policing, and pharmacy) account for 20 papers, most likely reflecting the 
training required to avoid the risks of non-compliance in these sectors. 
The number of trainees who completed their courses and provided in -
formation in relation to transfer ranged from 6 to 3900 (median 104). 
Table 4 summarises key information about the training courses and 
theoretical frameworks applied in the studies.
3.1. Theoretical frameworks
In examining RQ1, it is clear from the papers that there is not, as yet, 
a widely accepted and used theoretical framework for examining the 
transfer of workplace e-learning. Eight papers refer to the factors that 
have an influence on transfer as discussed by Baldwin and Ford (1988)
or Holton et al. (1996 , 2000) : individual differences like cognitive 
ability, self-efficacy, or motivation; organisational factors like peer 
support, supervisor support, or transfer climate; and instructional design 
factors like sequencing, or utility. Atack and Luke (2008) refer to a 
similar framework discussed by Cervero (1985) where the successful 
transfer is linked to educational quality, organisational climate, 
learners ’ openness to change, and perceived utility of the change. Jang 
(2024) refers to the Dynamic Transfer Model ( Blume et al. 2019 ) where 
transfer is an iterative process, with feedback and intention to transfer 
affecting what transitions from one phase to the next. However, these 
models refer to transfer in general, and not specifically transfer of 
e-learning. In their study, Park and Wentling (2008) focused on 
e-learning, and developed a transfer framework based on the number of 
separate tasks, the number of times the learned competence was used, 
and task difficulty, while also considering computer attitudes and us -
ability of the training material. Other theoretical frameworks adopted in 
the papers include a theory of supportive learning for distance education 
based on communication with peers and tutors ( Atack, 2003 ), Thorn -
dike and Woodworth ’ s (1901) theory of common elements ( Jordan, 
2016 ), transfer as an element of a knowledge management strategy 
( Tessier & Dalkir, 2016 ), and cognitive load theory as it relates to 
multitasking and the effects of design, contextual factors, and trainee 
characteristics on transfer ( Ronen, 2008 ).
3.2. Training content
Fig. 3 shows the analysis of training content based on the dimensions 
in Table 1 .
First, the Learned Skill ranges from specific (a procedure to follow in 
all circumstances), to general (a principle or heuristic applicable in 
many different situations). The training involved principles or heuristics 
in 19 of the studies. For example, Atack (2003) discussed a course where 
nurses were trained to consider patients ’ post-discharge home situation 
and access to support services. In Martins et al. (2018) , the training topic 
was Operational Efficiency, an unstructured task that involved applying 
general principles. Similarly, Kramer (2007) outlined IT security 
training where trainees had to apply general principles to identify se -
curity risks. Six papers in the review reported training in procedures. For 
example, Sloth et al. (2022) described training in surgical laparoscopic

techniques, where the expected outcome was technical proficiency.
Another procedural course involved training triage nurses in how to 
use the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale ( Rankin et al. 2013 ). One 
paper, Navarro Martínez et al. (2022) , fell into to the category of Rep -
resentation, because the training subject was “ digital skills ” , which are 
neither highly procedural nor solely principle-based. Five papers did not 
provide sufficient information to classify the learned skill.
Second, the expected performance change following training could 
relate to speed of task execution, accuracy of execution, or the selection 
of the most appropriate implementation approach. Nineteen papers 
dealt with topics where trainees would need to select a situationally 
appropriate implementation approach. For example, Kobulsky et al. 
(2020) described training for child welfare workers to improve out -
comes for adoption and guardianship. Macdonald et al. (2008) described

a course dealing with collaborative work and problem solving. Six pa -
pers described training where the desired outcome was accuracy. For 
example, Hinz (2018) examined a course about the accurate application 
of health insurance codes in an IT system, and Tessier and Dalkir (2016)
reported on a course teaching call centre employees how to provide 
accurate information to customers. No paper dealt with training where 
speed was the sole objective, although speed of execution of laparo -
scopic techniques formed part of assessment described by Sloth et al. 
(2022) . Six papers did not provide information about the expected 
post-training performance change.
The third dimension relates to demands on the trainee ’ s memory 
when executing the learned competence. For example, on-screen input 
tips in a computer system would limit a trainee ’ s memory requirements; 
conversely, remembering a detailed matrix of options, recognising 
which option is situationally appropriate without external prompts, and 
then executing it, involves higher memory demands. In total, 22 papers 
dealt with topics where trainees had to recall, recognise, and execute the 
appropriate skill. For example, Kerfoot et al. (2010) described a medical 
diagnosis course where trainees had to assess each case and make a 
decision based on its individual presentation. Similarly, 
Ad ´anez-Martínez et al. (2022) discussed a telephone consultation course 
for physicians. The physicians needed to adapt their approach to the 
specifics of each case using the learned procedure, rather than simply 
following a script. Three papers described situations where the expected 
training outcome was solely execution-based, and six papers did not 
provide sufficient information to assess the memory demands.
Most of the training discussed in the corpus involved relatively 
complex tasks: learned skills involving principles or heuristics, changes 
in approach rather than changes in speed or accuracy, and the 
requirement for trainees to recall, recognise, and execute based on their 
analysis of a situation. Table 5 shows an analysis of the learning content.
3.3. Type of transfer
To answer RQ2, the type of transfer assessed in each study was 
recorded according to the binary classifications of the transfer di -
mensions in Table 3 . Fig. 4 summarises the results.
In their meta-analysis of transfer research, Blume et al. (2010)
bemoaned the lack of detail provided by researchers about their oper -
ationalisation of transfer. It seems that little has changed. Just 6 of the 
31 papers provided sufficient information to assess all 6 dimensions of 
transfer. The physical context was unclear in 20 papers, the social 
context was unclear in 18 papers, the modality was unclear in 8 papers, 
the temporal context was unclear in 7 papers, and the functional context 
and knowledge domain transfer were unclear in 3 and 2 papers 
respectively.
The frequency of near transfer was highest for the knowledge domain 
and the functional context, with 29 and 26 studies respectively assessing 
near transfer on these dimensions. This is to be expected for two reasons. 
First, the topics of workplace training are generally chosen because they 
are relevant to the trainees ’ roles, with an expectation that the trained 
competencies will be used in the workplace. Second, when assessing 
training effectiveness, the measurement will focus on the use of the 
training in the expected context.
The dimension with the highest frequency of far transfer assessment 
was the temporal context, with 17 studies assessing use of the trained 
competencies more than 4 weeks after training. The modality, social 
context, and physical context formed part of the far transfer mix in 15, 7, 
and 7 studies respectively. These dimensions may be different in e- 
learning than in face-to-face training. While e-learning involves inter -
action with an electronic device, implementation of trained compe -
tencies could be quite different: for example, a child welfare meeting 
( Kobulsky et al. 2020 ), or interacting with patients and conducting 
blood transfusions ( Molina-Arrebola et al. 2020 ). The social context can 
also be different, as many e-learning courses involve individual learning, 
but applying the trained competencies is often in a group situation (e.g. 
Atack & Luke, 2008 ; Kirkman et al. 2006 ). Likewise, the physical context 
can be different, for example if e-learning is done at home but imple -
mentation is in a hospital (e.g. Atack, 2003 ; Macdonald et al. 2008 ).
3.4. Transfer measurement
To answer RQ3, the type of transfer measurement described in each 
paper was recorded ( Table 6 ) across three categories. First, self-reports 
where the trainee reported if they had transferred the trained compe -
tence to the workplace. Second, third-party reports where another per -
son, usually a supervisor, reported if trainees were using the trained 
competences. The third category is an objective measurement of 
transfer.
People tend to rate themselves differently than others rate them 
( Harris & Schaubroeck, 1988 ), suggesting that self-reports are an 
imperfect transfer measurement, particularly where using the trained 
competence is a socially desirable behaviour ( Podsakoff et al. 2003 ). 
Third-party reports may provide more objectivity, but without a defined 
scale there is a risk of inconsistency. An empirical objective measure 
provides the best assessment of transfer effectiveness.
Twenty-three of the 31 papers used self-reports for transfer mea -
surement. Of these, 17 collected information using surveys, and 5 used 
interviews. One study used both surveys and interviews.
Of the 17 studies using self-reports, 9 also had third-party reports (6 
surveys and 3 interviews). The triangulation afforded by combining self- 
reports with third-party reports enhances the reliability of results 
( Creswell & Creswell, 2018 ).
Just seven studies used objective measures of transfer. Each mea -
surement methodology was unique, ranging from an independent audit 
of post-training work product ( Rankin et al. 2013 ) to an automated page 
count of wiki use ( Tessier & Dalkir, 2016 ).
In evaluating the training results, eight of the studies referred to the 
4-level model of training outcomes ( Kirkpatrick, 1979 ). Level 1 refers to 
trainees ’ reactions to the training, Level 2 refers to the amount learned, 
Level 3 refers to behaviour changes, and Level 4 refers to tangible re -
sults. Level 3 on this framework represents training transfer, which is the 
measured outcome in 7 of the 8 papers using this framework. However, 
Kirkman et al. (2006) went further and measured a Level 4 outcome, 
improvement in customer satisfaction.
3.5. Summary
This review indicates that there is not yet a common theoretical 
framework for the study of workplace e-learning, although the models 
developed by Baldwin and Ford (1988) and Holton et al. (1996 , 2000)
appear more often than other approaches. The learning material 
addressed in the studies tended towards the more complex end of the 
scale in terms of learned skills, performance change, and memory de -
mands, indicating a willingness to use e-learning for complex topics. The

review also indicates that the type of transfer being measured is 
frequently unclear in published studies. Finally, most studies used 
self-reported transfer rather than an objective measurement.
4. Discussion
The variety of research frameworks adopted within the papers in -
dicates that the field of study has yet to reach maturity. However, e- 
learning is still a comparatively young field of research, and its wide -
spread adoption in workplaces is quite recent. It seems likely, therefore, 
that this topic will receive increased scholarly interest over time.
The description of transfer was quite limited in most of the corpus, 
with just 5 of the 31 papers providing enough information to fully 
classify the transfer using the framework in Table 3 . To some extent this 
is understandable: the authors were focused on describing their training 
programs, and their level of success or otherwise in delivering their 
training objectives. While transfer to the workplace was an objective, 
transfer was mainly regarded as a single outcome, with nuance and sub- 
classification not necessary for the objectives of their studies.
While it was not possible to classify the type of training content in

terms of learned skill, performance change, and memory demands for 5 
the studies, it was clear for the remaining papers that the training was 
mainly at the more complex end of the scale for all three factors, indi -
cating an acceptance of e-learning as a training tool that can be used for 
complex topics in addition to procedural training.
While the majority of the studies relied on self-reports to assess 
whether transfer had occurred, leading to a risk of measurement bias, 
not all researchers regard this as a negative. According to Talanti et al. 
(2010 , p. 217): “ Although there are many researchers who are against 
the use of learners ’ self-reports to measure the degree of transfer of 
training, learners are the most important and valid source as their per -
ceptions will affect their motivation and performance ” . Nevertheless, 
using a replicable empirical measurement for transfer will always pro -
vide a more solid foundation for conclusions, and for scholarly analysis, 
than basing those conclusions on subjective self-reports.
5. Limitations and recommendations for future research
In common with most systematic reviews, this paper has some lim -
itations that must be mentioned. First, the database search was limited 
to publications in English. It is possible that relevant publications in 
other languages were overlooked. Second, the searches were limited to 
the abstracts of articles and, although the search terms were carefully 
selected, it is possible that relevant articles did not include these terms in 
their abstracts resulting in their omission from the results. It is also 
possible that alternative search terms might have returned different 
results. Third, while this review analysed near and far transfer, it is 
possible that using a different aspect, like lateral and vertical transfer or 
literal and figural transfer, could have provided additional insights.
Compiling this literature review raised some questions that could be 
addressed in future studies. First, although the papers discussed the 
transfer of workplace e-learning, there is little discussion of the factors 
that promote the transfer of workplace e-learning, and how they might 
differ from the factors that promote the transfer of traditional learning. 
More research on this topic might lead to improvements in the design 
and delivery of workplace e-learning. Second, as the review revealed 
that a majority of the studies were conducted in highly regulated in -
dustries, future researchers might examine which industries are most 
likely to use e-learning, and for what specific purposes. Third, future 
researchers might consider including detail about the training content 
and the transfer context in their published results to allow for detailed 
cross-study analysis. Finally, the papers indicated that there is not yet a 
widely used theoretical framework for the topic. There has been some 
progress in this respect. For example, Park and Wentling (2008) and 
Shukla et al. (2023) have proposed theoretical frameworks including 
factors specific to e-learning including computer attitudes, learning 
design, and usability of the training material. Future research should 
aim to further develop this framework and develop a model for transfer 
of e-learning that can be empirically tested.
6. Conclusion
The reporting of studies relating to the transfer of workplace e- 
learning has not yet reached the level of maturity where researchers 
have a common understanding of what information should be included 
in papers to facilitate systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Further -
more, it seems that common research frameworks deal with transfer in a 
general sense, and do not focus on the specifics of e-learning. Gegen -
furtner et al. (2014 , p. 1110) noted that: “ This gap of theory frameworks 
is unfortunate because it deemphasizes the momentum of 
computer-supported training in organizations and companies world -
wide ” . As the use of workplace e-learning continues to grow, we need to 
develop a strong theoretical framework for the transfer of workplace 
e-learning that will, in turn, lead to practical improvements in the 
development and implementation of future training.
