ABSTRACT
Background Knowledge creation forms an integral part of the knowledge-to-action framework aimed at bridging the gap between research
and evidence-informed decision making. Although principles of science communication, data visualisation and user-centred design largely
impact the effectiveness of communication, their role in knowledge creation is still limited. Hence, this article aims to provide researchers a
systematic approach on how knowledge creation can be put into practice.
Methods A systematic two-phased approach towards knowledge creation was formulated and executed. First, during a preparation phase the
purpose and audience of the knowledge were deﬁned. Subsequently, a developmental phase facilitated how the content is‘said’ (language)
and communicated (channel). This developmental phase proceeded via two pathways: a translational cycle and design cycle, during which core
translational and design components were incorporated. The entire approach was demonstrated by a case study.
Results The case study demonstrated how the phases in this systematic approach can be operationalised. It furthermore illustrated how
created knowledge can be delivered.
Conclusion The proposed approach offers researchers a systematic, practical and easy-to-implement tool to facilitate effective knowledge
creation towards decision-makers in healthcare. Through the integration of core components of knowledge creation evidence-informed
decision making will ultimately be optimized.

Building upon a knowledge translation
framework
Knowledge translation (KT) aims to ﬁll the evidential gap
between knowledge and practice; a process that is con-
sidered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one
of the most important public health challenges of this cen-
tury.
1 The knowledge gap has often been referred to as the
knowledge-to-action (KtA) gap. This term implies a broader
application of knowledge, involving decision-makers, health
practitioners, patients and the public.
Using this broader deﬁnition of KT, Grahamet al.
2 devel-
oped a KtA framework that conceptualizes the process of
KT. This framework, comprises two distinct but related
components. The‘Action Cycle’represents the activities that
are needed to apply evidence-based knowledge to practice.
This includes tailoring interventions to the local context and
identifying and evaluating barriers and facilitators to imple-
mentation. The ‘Knowledge Creation funnel’, on the other
hand, refers to the simultaneous process of the generation
of the tools and key messages that aid in the Action Cycle.

These are created by distiling and tailoring core messages
from research knowledge to the needs of the knowledge
user. In its broadest de ﬁnition, knowledge users include,
policy-makers, health practitioners and the general public.
This article will focus on KT to decision-makers (In this art-
icle decision-makers include managerial decision-makers (e.g.
managers in hospital, community organisations and private
business.) as well as policy decision-makers at the national,
provincial, district and local levels.
7) as they are in the best
position to in ﬂuence health decisions and bene ﬁt public
health through evidence-informed decision making.
Even though the action process and the knowledge cre-
ation process must form part of any KT model, it remains
ambiguous how these processes should be executed. Large
inconsistencies can especially be identiﬁed in the knowledge
creation process due to a lacking systematic approach on
how to put the process into practice.3 This article strives to
provide a systematic approach on how the knowledge cre-
ation process can be put into practice. More speciﬁcally it
focuses on what, based on the literature, are the core com-
ponents of the knowledge creation process that every
researcher engaging with KT should consider. The use of a
case study will demonstrate how the systematic approach
can be used by researchers to effectively establish evidence-
informed decision making.
With the focus shifting from knowledge dissemination to
KT, the role of reciprocity between decision-makers and
researchers in facilitating evidence-informed decision making
has become widely acknowledged.
4 Whereas the traditional
and more linear model—‘ the science push model’— under-
lines the supply of evidence to inform evidence-informed
decision making, the interaction model reﬂects the need of
reciprocity and partnership building. The latter, suggests that
the more sustained the interaction between researchers and
policy-makers is, the larger the impact of evidence-informed
decision making becomes.
5–9 This interactive KT model is,
however, a complex, time-consuming step that is hampered
by political instability, high turn-over of policy-making staff6
and perceived cultural differences between researchers
and policy-makers.10,11 Consequently, the traditional, linear
approach remains the most common used approach.
Pitfalls in knowledge creation
Despite the less complex nature of the traditional science
push model, in practice, researchers and policy-makers rarely
speak the same language. Evidence provided to decision-
makers is generally considered to be too complex, too
detailed, too technical or lacking in timeliness.
6,12,13 Aside
from these substantive elements, inattentiveness to design
and structure of a research report can also trouble the com-
munication from researchers to decision-makers.14
Tailored communication: a conceptual
framework
In order to avoid these pitfalls, it is paramount to tailor
knowledge to the level of understanding, needs and
demands of the target audience. Guided by Lavis’extension
of Lasswell’s communication model effective communication
depends on tailoring what is being said (content), how it is
being said (language), how it is communicated (channel) to
whom (audience) and with what purpose (intended
effect).
7,15 Although the‘who’, the‘what’and the‘to whom’
are often taken into consideration, the‘how’ is often over-
looked in communication to decision-makers.7,16 Strikingly,
it is precisely this ‘how’ aspect of the communication pro-
cess that might be crucial in inﬂuencing evidence-informed
decision making. Drawn from the literature on theﬁeld of sci-
ence communication, visual communication and user-centred
design, we formulated a number of core components
approaching this‘how’aspect (Fig.
1). These components can
be divided in translational components and design compo-
nents, determining how the content is said, or how the con-
tent is communicated, respectively.
Core components on how the content is
said
The ﬁrst core component, the translational component,
entails that content should be target-audience appropriate
and packaged in a mode of communication that is familiar
to the target audience. Information should be concise and
understandable, adapted in terms of length and complexity
of grammar.
6,14 In addition, messages that are meant to
prompt action should be expressed as an actionable mes-
sage. This can be established by integrating concepts of
applicability (i.e. feasibility of an intervention), and transfer-
ability (i.e. likelihood that the intervention will equally beneﬁt
health in this speciﬁc setting).
17
Knowledge should moreover be represented in a form
that facilitates understanding.18 Representation forms include
common used textual statements, compelling narratives
(storytelling) or the visualisation of data into graphs or info-
graphics. Visualisation of data is an effective means of repre-
senting complex ideas of information in a format that is
quickly understood.
18–20 Storytelling, an increasingly used tool
in public health communication,21,22 provides context to the
situation by anchoring a problem in the real world.14,23 The
i4 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

<<<PAGE=3>>>
power of storytelling lies therefore, beside the transfer of
explicit knowledge, in the transfer of tacit knowledge.
Core components on how the content is
communicated
Apart from the choice on language and representation one
should tailor how content is being communicated to the
target audience. Simply communicating information in a
form and language tailored to the needs and demands of
decision-makers does not suf ﬁciently inﬂuence evidence-
informed decision making.
24,25 The majority of research
evidence is consumed by decision-makers via a written chan-
nel.
12,13 Therefore, elements of design, including navigation,
organisation,25,26 design aesthetics27 and semiotics should
also be taken into account.14,28
This means that navigation between information should be
intuitive and information should be presented in an orderly
way.28 Online repositories such as the ‘HealthCOMpass’29
and ‘Science for Environment Policy’30 are generally effective
in transferring knowledge by presenting information in separ-
ate self-contained‘chunks’of information, enabling decision-
makers to access the information in the order they choose.
Furthermore, it is important to create and incorporate design
aesthetics. An appealing exterior can be accomplished through
the use of complementing colours, a polished house style,
simple typography and the appropriate use of visual aids.
31,32
Ultimately, visual aids can become more meaningful via the
utilisation of semiotics. Semiotics refers to the interpretation
of a visual into the meaning that goes with it. Pictograms can
be ideal to communicate a subject as they derive their mean-
ing from an iconic relation with what they refer to and are
understood universally.
33,34
This article takes one approach in how researchers can
communicate knowledge to decision-makers with the pur-
pose of in ﬂuencing evidence-based decision making. It
should be noted that this article does not attempt to cover
all aspects of KT to decision-makers. Rather, takes a starting
point in how to create knowledge (tools and key messages)
in such a way that itﬁts the needs and demands of decision-
makers. In the following section, using a case study we pro-
vide an approach on how core components of knowledge
creation can be integrated in an easy-to-implement tool.
Methodology
A case study
The knowledge gap is apparent in all areas of public health.
However, it may be even more evident in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs).
35–37 LMICs are generally charac-
terized by suboptimal primary care standards, general poor
health and signiﬁcant challenges in implementing clinically
and cost-effective interventions.
35,36,38,39 There is a growing
recognition of the need to improve the translation of evi-
dence into practice in these LMICs and to adapt evidence-
based interventions proven to be effective in developed
settings to the local context.

non-communicable lung diseases (NCLDs) in LMICs is con-
sidered an ideal case study. Exploring barriers and facilita-
tors to the implementation of evidence-based interventions
in low-resources settings and tailoring them to the context
are key elements to reach the FRESH AIR aim. Due to this
implementation design, KT and creation were included as an
integral part of the FRESH AIR study. The protocol has
been published elsewhere.
42 This case study elucidates one
of the methods FRESH AIR is using to create knowledge
tailored to decision-makers.
A systematic approach to knowledge creation
The approach to knowledge creation was guided by
Lasswell’s adapted communication model and consisted of
two phases: a preparation and a developmental phase. Both
are schematically depicted in Fig. 2. Creating a knowledge
platform requires the developer to think and approach the
subject matter from multiple angles, making use of scientiﬁc
and analytical knowledge as well as editorial reasoning. Due
to the complexity of this iterative process, one should there-
fore keep in mind that Fig.
2 is a simpliﬁcation of the devel-
opmental process.
Preparation and developmental phase
During the preparation phase the purpose of the knowledge
platform was deﬁned through the formulation of the main
objectives. A main audience was deﬁned to specify the ‘to
whom’ aspect. Both the objective and the audience were
decisive in ‘what’ was to be communicated. Subsequently,
the ‘what’ led to the development of a framework of the
knowledge platform, comprising all topics the knowledge
platform should address.
The second phase, the developmental phase, provides an
approach towards the ‘how’ aspect of the communication
model. The approach to‘how it is said’and ‘how it is com-
municated’ were guided by two separate pathways, respect-
ively, the translational cycle and the design cycle. The
translational cycle involves the translation of scientiﬁc data
and information into tailored content. Whereas, the design
cycle is the incorporation of core components on navigation,
organisation, design aesthetics and semiotics. For conceptual
and illustrative purposes, we made a clear distinction
between the approaches. In practice however, the two
approaches are complex and intertwined with each other.
Translational cycle
During the translational cycle researchﬁndings (non-trans-
lated knowledge) generated during the FRESH AIR project
were passed through a number of consecutive steps. Through
the integration of the translational core components this
resulted in the generation of content tailored to decision-
makers (translated knowledge). As individual studies rarely
provide sufﬁcient evidence for decision making, evidence
was also synthesised from other sources.
43
Evidence acquired per topic (Step 1) was synthesised and
critically appraised (Step 2). Critical appraisal, deﬁned as the
examination of research evidence on the level of evidence
and relevance, is an important step within the translational
process.
44 Critical appraisal was performed using a ﬂow-
chart like tool. Theﬂow-chart integrated multiple appraisal
tools on grey literature with the Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network (SIGN) grading system on scienti ﬁc
evidence to create a tool that can be applied to all types of
evidence.
45,46 The level of evidence and relevance was cate-
gorized into ﬁve categories. Scienti ﬁc evidence that was
based on meta-analysis, rigorous systematic reviews or RCT
with very low risk of bias according to the SIGN grading
system (Grade A), was extracted (Step 3). In the case of dis-
putable evidence (Grade E or D) due to either a high risk of
bias, low level of evidence or evidence-based on non-
analytical studies such as expert opinion or a case report, an
annotation was added.
Based on the extracted data key message were formulated
(Step 4) and data was aggregated into explorative or explana-
tory overview charts, infographics, visuals, textual statements
or narratives (Step 5). Before incorporation into the knowl-
edge platform the product was run through a set of criteria
to determine whether all core translational components were
sufﬁciently integrated (see checklist in Fig.
2). When the trans-
lated knowledge product scored insufﬁciently, it re-entered
the translational cycle.
Design cycle
Parallel to the translational cycle the communication channel
was designed. Core components on navigation, organisation,
design aesthetics and semiotics were integrated into so called
‘proof of concepts’(trial products) which were subsequently
tested on the experience of the user (user-experience ana-
lysis). ‘Proof of concepts’ allow for iterative amendments
during several moments of evaluation, thereby warranting
feasibility and sustainability early on.

Preparation phase
In the FRESH AIR knowledge dissemination strategy sev-
eral objectives of the knowledge platform have been formu-
lated. The ﬁrst objective is to inform decision-makers and
other stakeholders about the prevalence of NCLD diseases,
risk factors and present feasible context-speciﬁc solutions.
The second objective is to share materials that assist in the
implementation of these context-speci ﬁc solutions. Since
purpose and audience determine the knowledge that is to be
communicated, two separate channels were created, each

serving one of the above mentioned objectives. A public
website serves theﬁrst objective whereas a linked knowledge
base serves the second. A knowledge base offers access to a
large range of documents, including scientiﬁc publications,
translated policy briefs, protocols and educational materials.
Since the knowledge base complements the website as a
source of information the following section will focus on the
development of the public website.
Developmental phase
The translational- and design cycle served as a template to
develop the public website. Figure
3 depicts an example of
how the translational cycle was operationalised. After retrieval
of evidence (Step 1) and critical appraisal of evidence (Step 2),
relevant data was extracted (Step 3). This was then used to
formulate key messages and create visualisations (Steps 4 and
5). Correct interpretation of the visualisations was supported
by adding a simpliﬁcation of the key messages (Step 5).
Figure
4 illustrates a concept of the home-page of the
FRESH AIR public website, demonstrating the integration
of the core components of knowledge creation. As the
development of the website is an on-going project and has
not yet been delivered, intermediate results are presented
and complemented by future ideas.
Future plans
Novel knowledge is continuously generated during the
FRESH AIR project. Hence, core components of knowl-
edge creation will be integrated in several additional ways.
Information will be presented in various forms. Global
prevalence of disease will be expressed in a bubble chart.
Bubble charts are explorative rather than explanatory,
allowing comparison between settings and different
measures.
Furthermore, storytelling will be used to trigger action or
share knowledge by presenting successful implementation
stories. Excessive detail will be avoided to permit the reader
to be able to imagine a comparable solution within their own
situation. Composite stories will be created from interview
narratives derived from the qualitative FRESH AIR data.

Warranting sustainability and outreach
Elements regarding sustainability, outreach and dissemin-
ation will furthermore be taken into account. Sustainability
will be warranted by basing the website on a WordPress
platform. This free content-management software does
not require programming skills and allows for content man-
agement independent of a web designer. Outreach to a
non-academic audience, including decision-makers, will be
maximized through the integration of several social media
channels and hyperlinks to leading health institutions.
Discussion
In this paper we presented a systematic approach towards
knowledge creation- the tailoring of research knowledge to
decision-makers to facilitate evidence-informed decision
making. We elaborated on the knowledge creation cycle, an
integral part of the KtA framework by Graham et al.
49
Guided by Lasswell’s widely known communication model,
we formulated an approach that incorporates how content
should be communicated— an overlooked but essential com-
ponent. The approach integrates two core components: (i)
the translation of knowledge towards the audience and (ii)
the design of knowledge created. Through a case study we
demonstrated how these two core components can be put
into practice.
This systematic approach is, to our knowledge, theﬁrst to
provide a practical approach to knowledge creation. A sys-
tematic approach to knowledge creation was urgently needed
for two reasons. Firstly, the vast amount of literature cover-
ing the question on how to communicate scientiﬁc evidence
to a target audience, indicates a lack of an overall effective
approach.
31,50,51 Secondly, the European Commission
increasingly emphasizes to include strategies on knowledge
dissemination to a non-academic audience in project propo-
sals.52 Consequently, researchers are expected to engage in
knowledge creation; a skill that they have generally not been
trained in.
Whereas decision-makers have been equipped with mul-
tiple tools to assist in using research evidence for evidence-
informed decision making,
53,54 researchers have hardly been
provided with any. The SUPPORT tool, developed for
decision-makers and researchers presents a variety of activities
on KT, but does not provide a practical approach on how
these activities can be operationalised.
16,55 Our approach com-
plements herein, as it provides researchers engaging in knowl-
edge creation with a simple, easy-to-implement tool that does
not require advanced training.
As previously noted, this paper only covers a small por-
tion of the broad and complex process knowledge
translation entails. While we have proposed a strategy to
warrant that researcher and policy makers‘speak the same
language’, our approach should not be considered a stand-
alone solution, but one embedded within the KtA cycle. As
suggested by Grahamet al., knowledge has to go through a
number of phases before it can shape practice. These phases
include adaptation to the local context, assessing barriers to
implementation and monitoring knowledge use.
49,56
Furthermore, researchers should build capacity for imple-
mentation by formulating, implementing and evaluating cap-
acity building plans.
Even though our approach was developed towards com-
municating research evidence to decision-makers, it may be
widely applicable as the approach integrates essential and uni-
versal components of science communication, data visualisa-
tion and user-centred design. Regardless of the speci ﬁc
audience, the questions concerning‘how something is said’
and ‘how it is communicated’ should always be given full
attention in the process of communicating research-evidence.
Conclusion
To conclude, this approach offers researchers a tool to facili-
tate effective knowledge creation towards decision-makers in
healthcare. The tool complements existing approaches; it is
systematic, practical and designed to be easily implemented
by researchers engaging in KT. However, it should not be
considered a stand-alone communication tool, but rather a
tool within the communication process of KT. Nonetheless,
through the integration of core components on knowledge
creation an approach has been established that may be
widely applicable to similar projects, ultimately optimising
evidence-informed decision making.
