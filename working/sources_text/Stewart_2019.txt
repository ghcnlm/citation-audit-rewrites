ABSTRACT
This article proposes a new model to support the use of evidence by
decision-makers. There has been increased emphasis over the last
15 years on the use of evidence to inform decision-making at
policy and practice levels but the conceptual thinking has not
kept pace with practical developments in the ﬁeld. We have
developed a new demand-side model, with multiple dimensions
to conceptualise support for the use of evidence in decision-
making. This model emphasises the need for multiple levels of
engagement, a combination of interventions, a spectrum of
outcomes and a detailed consideration of context.

1. Introduction
There has been increased emphasis over the last 15 years on the use of evidence to inform
decision-making for development within public administrations at both policy and prac-
tice levels. This drive toward evidence-based or evidence-informed policy or practice is
argued for on social, political and economic grounds, and is increasingly promoted as a
key development initiative (Newman et al.,2012).
From a social perspective, designing development policies and programmes on the
basis of‘theories unsupported by reliable empirical evidence’ is irresponsible as it leaves
as much potential to do harm as to do good (Chalmers,2005: 229). There are many
examples of well-intended development policies resulting in negative outcomes, for
example the Scared Straight programme to reduce juvenile delinquency (Petrosino
et al., 2003) or more recently the Virtual Infant Parenting programme to reduce
teenage pregnancy (Brinkman et al.,2016), justifying the social and ethical imperative
to consider evidence during policy design and implementation.
From a political perspective, the use of evidence in development decisions increases
transparency and accountability in the policy-making process (Jones et al.,2012; Rutter
& Gold, 2015). Being explicit about what factors inﬂuenced policy-making and how
diﬀerent factors (e.g. research evidence, interest and activist groups; government-commis-
sioned reports) were considered can increase the defensibility of policies and public’s trust
in policy proposals and public programmes (Shaxson,2014).

From an economic perspective, the use of evidence can reduce the waste of scarce
public resources. In the health sector, it has been estimated that as much as 85% of
research – to a total value of $200 billion in 2010 alone– is wasted, that is research is
not used to inform decision-making (Chalmers & Glasziou,2009). Seeing that public
resources fund most research, this is a threat to development. This amount of wasted
recourse is likely to be higher considering that, as a result of this non-use of evidence,
public policies and programmes are introduced at scale that might not achieve their
assumed outcomes. This argument carries particular weight in Southern African countries
in which the public sector assumes a direct developmental mandate (Stewart, 2014;
Goldman et al.,2015; Dayal,2016).
Over the last 15 years, the arguments above have translated into an increased support
for and adoption of the evidence-based policy-making paradigm (Dayal,2016). This
development has originated and seen the strongest growth in the health sector where evi-
dence-based policy-making has become the norm in policy and practice settings with
established systems for the production and integration of research into policies, guidelines
and standard setting (Chalmers,2005). However, other areas of policy-making (e.g. social
care, development, crime) have begun to experience similar developments (Stewart,2015;
Breckon & Dodson, 2016; Langer et al.,2016). Evidence-based policy-making has also
received a particular wave of support in African governments that have driven innovation
regarding the institutionalisation of evidence use, with notable examples from South
Africa and Uganda (Gaarder & Briceño,2010; Dayal,2016).
Despite this, general support for the use of evidence has not been translated into a sys-
tematic and structured practice of evidence-based policy-making. For example, under the
past two Obama administrations, a mere 1% of government funding was informed by evi-
dence (Bridgeland & Orszag, 2015). A similar paradox is observed in the UK policy-
making context, which arguably has gone furthest in the institutionalisation of evi-
dence-based policy-making with the creation of the What Works Network, Scientiﬁc
Advisory Posts and clearing houses such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (NICE). Despite these eﬀorts, a recent inquiry into the‘Missing Evidence’
(Sedley, 2016) found that while spending £2.5 billion on research per year, only 4 out
of 21 government departments could account for the status and whereabouts of their com-
missioned research evidence (let alone use it). Closer to home, in South Africa a survey of
senior decision-makers found that while 45% hoped to use of evidence during decision-
making, only 9% reported being able to translate this intention into practice (Paine
Cronin, 2015).
It seems that the use of evidence to inform decision-making is challenged by a discon-
nect between the support for it in principle (which is widespread) and its practical appli-
cation. This disconnect has led to wide-range research interest, largely focused on
empirical analysis to explain and overcome this phenomenon. Barriers to evidence use
have been explored in detail (Uneke et al.,2011; Oliver et al.,2014) and so have the eﬀec-
tiveness of interventions aiming to bridge this disconnect (Walter et al.,2005; Langer et al.,
2016). This article proposes a fourth explanation: that a lack of an explicit theoretical foun-
dation challenges the design of applied interventions aiming to support the use of evidence
during decision-making. That is, our current models for conceptualising evidence-based
policy-making, in particular from a demand-side perspective, can be improved to more

accurately reﬂect the realities of decision-makers and the contexts in which they aim to use
evidence.
This article proposesﬁve important elements to consider for those supporting the use
of evidence by for development. Theseﬁve elements have emerged from many years of
experience of providing support to public administrations and have been integrated
within one model.
1.1. Current models
The majority of proposed models conceptualise evidence-based policy-making as an inter-
play between a supply of and demand for evidence. This body of scholarship originates in
Weiss’s( 1979) seven-stage model of research use and Caplan’s( 1979) two-community
model of research use. Notable reﬁnements have since been added through the linkages
and exchange model (CHSRF, 2000; Lomas, 2000); the context, evidence and links
model (Crewe & Young,2002); the knowledge to action framework (Graham & Tetroe,
2009) and many others. The proposed model developed in this article is only focused
on the demand side of evidence use. That is, it only concerns activities and mechanisms
that support demand-side actors (i.e. policy-makers and practitioners) in their use of evi-
dence. It is based on many years of work in thisﬁeld within Southern Africa.
This focus on the demand side of evidence use seems justiﬁed given the relative lack of
research in evidence-based policy-making explicitly focusing on decision-makers
(Newman et al., 2013), as well as the well-established limitations of pushing evidence
by research professionals into policy and practice contexts (Lavis et al.,2003; Nutley
et al.,2007; Milne et al.,2014). There is increased decision-maker interest in understand-
ing what works to make policy and practice processes more receptive to the use of evi-
dence. The UK Department for International Development funded a £13 million
programme in 2014 to pilot diﬀerent approaches to increase the capacity to use research
evidence by decision-makers, including initiatives across Southern Africa. However, as
with many development initiatives while this investment in demand-side mechanisms is
welcome, there is a need to investigate and evaluate how best to conceptualise what is
essential for these mechanisms of change to be eﬀective.
1.2. Our experience
We have experiencedﬁrst hand how this lack of a theoretical foundation aﬀects the design
of demand-side evidence-based policy-making interventions. Working across sectors in
Southern African contexts and targeting a combination of di ﬀerent interventions
working at diﬀerent levels of public administrations, we found there was little theoretical
guidance available to guide us. Subsequently, our underlying theory of change has mainly
been informed by the literature from the health care sector; we had to consult diﬀerent
bodies of knowledge for each intervention applied and lacked a meta-framework to
guide us on the likely eﬀects of the combined intervention and its pathway to change
(Stewart, 2015). With the notable exception of Newman et al. (2012), our theoretical foun-
dation was informed by the literature not explicitly focused on building demand for evi-
dence and not tailored to our context of decision-making. Nevertheless, we developed an
approach to support the use of evidence in decision-making in governments that
618 R. STEWART ET AL.
<<<PAGE=5>>>
integrated diﬀerent interventions with awareness raising, capacity-building and evidence
use at multiple levels, starting with support to individuals as an entry point (seeBox 1).
However, we have repeatedly been asked to describe our approach in terms of the inter-
ventions we oﬀer and have found the options available too narrow to describe our activi-
ties. To some extent, these options are in line with the current literature that is asking us to
position ourselves either as providing training, which is seen as essential, or as building
relationships and networks, which is seen as secondary. Likewise, we have repeatedly
been asked to deﬁne one level of decision-making that we work at, or choose and separate
the impacts of the diﬀerent interventions we use. There has been an expectation that the
outcomes of our activities will be visible in changes to policies and not changes in practice.
It seems that the lack of an overall model for demand-side interventions to increase the use
of evidence negates an understanding of the spectrum of outcomes, interventions and
levels of decision-making required for this type of engagement. We have therefore
reached the conclusion that we need to share and integrate the elements that we have
experienced as key when conceptualising support to increase the use of evidence particu-
larly by public administrations.
Box 1. Nine principles underlying our approach to supporting evidence-informed decision-making.
Over the last 20 years we have developed and adopted the following nine principles to increase the use of evidence in
decision-making for development (reference removed for anonymisation):
(1) Use a broad deﬁnition of evidence, with the synthesis of good quality research studies as an ideal, but with the
recognition of the value of all sorts of evidence, from monitoring and evaluation data to citizens’ views and
ﬁnancial information.
(2) Emphasise the value of systematic synthesis of the available evidence over the use of a single research study.
(3) Use the term evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) rather than evidence-based policy-making (EBPM) to
recognise that decisions are informed by evidence, but not necessarily based on that evidence, and to
acknowledge that not all aspects of evidence use relate to policy-making speciﬁcally, but also broader decision-
making.
(4) Focus initially on building awareness and capability of individuals and supporting individuals in implementing
EIDM in their practice, although not restricting us to working with individuals.
(5) O ﬀer a combination of linked interventions, including:
. a range of workshops which respond to needs are participatory and focus on application to real-life problems,
. a ﬂexible mentorship programme which has provided for groups of individuals together, individuals one-on-
one, and teams,
. a linked programme of networking and relationship-building through the Africa Evidence Network.
(6) Invest in relationships and stakeholder engagement throughout our programme.
(7) Be needs-led, solution-oriented and ﬂexible throughout.
(8) Work to understand and respond to contextual factors.
(9) Invest in sustainability wherever possible.
2. Methods
In order to develop this new set of elements, we have drawn on 20 years of experience in
this ﬁeld, and speciﬁcally on 3 years of empirical data from the University of Johannes-
burg-based programme to Build Capacity to Use Research Evidence (UJ-BCURE). Our
empirical data sources have included: monitoring and evaluation data from all our work-
shops and mentorships; engagement data from the Africa Evidence Network, ranging
from those who attend our events, a survey of members, outcome diaries where we
record instances of incremental changes, and reports documenting reﬂections developed
in partnership with evidence users. We have also held a number of reﬂection meetings,
DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA 619
<<<PAGE=6>>>
including a programme-wide stakeholder event and a mentorship-speciﬁcr eﬂection
workshop, as well as consultations with our advisors and steering group. We have also
drawn out lessons from our research and capacity-building, which has informed the
identiﬁcation of key elements. Having pulled together preliminary ideas, we held a
writing workshop and team reﬂection meetings to further develop and test out our ideas.
3. Results
We have identiﬁed ﬁve important elements for consideration by those supporting the use
of evidence in decision-making for development in Southern Africa, and further aﬁeld. We
have integrated these to formﬁve dimensions within one model. Each dimension is listed
and then expanded in turn below.
(10) Outcomes: Decision-makers move from awareness of evidence-informed decision-
making for development to capability to actual evidence use and back around to
awareness again.
(11) Entry points: Decision-makers can enter the process according to their need based
on a combination of two parameters: their individual position within an institution
and their starting point on the awareness– capability – use cycle.
(12) Outputs: What can be achieved increases and changes as individuals move around
the cycle.
(13) Contexts: Contextual factors are hugely inﬂuential in deﬁning the nature and signiﬁ-
cance of the shifts that take place.
(14) Interventions: In order to facilitate movement around the cycle, more than one
approach is needed to facilitate change.
3.1. Dimension 1: outcomes
Decision-makers move from awareness of evidence-informed decision-making to capa-
bility to use evidence in decision-making, to actual use of evidence and back around to
increased awareness again (Figure 1). These changes happen on a continuous cycle on
which awareness, capability and evidence use are not necessarily discrete outcomes, but
where people can move around the cycle in small incremental steps. All three phases
are important and relate to one another in a ﬂuid rather than linear fashion. This
model refutes the idea that evidence-informed decision-making is only achieved when
research inﬂuences a policy. When working with groups of people, they might be starting
at diﬀerent points on the cycle. They do not all have to be starting at the same place. The
individual’s own awareness, as well as demand within the speciﬁc government sector plays
a role in determining their starting point. To facilitate change, we are therefore aiming to
see shifts around the cycle, no matter how incremental they seem.
Individuals have attended our workshops and taken part in our mentorships with a
wide range of starting points: Some had very little awareness of evidence-informed
decision-making and came to learn more, whilst others were already aware and skilled
and came to explore opportunities to send colleagues along, and/or gain mentorship
support. A government researcher in South Africa was new to the evidence-based
620 R. STEWART ET AL.

approach and attended toﬁnd out what the approach was all about. In Malawi, monitoring
and evaluation oﬃcers in the districts in which we worked knew about monitoring and
evaluation but had not heard of evidence-informed decision-making. Others were
unclear on how to use monitoring and evaluation data in decision-making and wanted
to learn more. A Director in South Africa was not new to the use of evidence but came
to our workshops looking for support and guidance in implementing tools in her practice.
These examples all illustrate the variety of outcomes that individuals sought and how they
progress around the cycle.
3.2. Dimension 2: entry points
The model caters for multiple entry points for decision-makers (Figure 2). When support-
ing the use of evidence, people start at diﬀerent points, not only in their engagement with
the approach as described above, but also their professional position as individuals and
within teams and organisations. The level at which decision-makers engage with evi-
dence-informed decision-making needs to be taken into account when designing a pro-
gramme to support evidence-informed decision-making. Even if the support to use
evidence is aimed at an individual level, no individuals work in a vacuum. If the
support is needs-led with a focus on real issues faced in their professional practice, then
the levels of‘team’ and ‘organisation’ inevitably get drawn in. The engagement with evi-
dence can move up to higher levels of organisational structure. Engagement can also be
driven by senior leadership sending their teams or individuals along (arrows go both
ways). As such, this model can be applied to programmes that focus on high-level engage-
ment and those that start with individuals as an entry point, and the full spectrum in
between. Furthermore, they need a certain degree ofﬂexibility as no level operates in iso-
lation so a programme needs to be able to adapt as other levels engage with it.
Figure 1.A model in which the outcomes awareness, capability and use of evidence are a cyclical con-
tinuum not linear steps.
DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA 621
<<<PAGE=8>>>
Note that as we start to engage with evidence-informed decision-making at diﬀerent
levels (individual, team, organisation and institution), it becomes a spiral (Figure 2),
enabling movement from awareness to capability to evidence use (dimension 1), as well
as building from individual engagement to team engagement to organisational engage-
ment, and indeed organisational inﬂuence on team, on individuals, etc. (dimension 2).
This movement between levels of entry and around the cycle was clearly evident in our
activities. In both South Africa and Malawi, some individuals started by attending the
workshops, building their awareness and knowledge and moving on to mentorships to
embed their learning, develop their capability and begin to apply their learning. In
South Africa, as they were promoted in their institutions, they sent along their staﬀ for
training. Some people who were already well aware of the approach and wanted more
support came to the workshops to explore what we could oﬀer (a diﬀerent aspect of aware-
ness) and then sent their team for training and negotiated a team mentorship to ensure
team-level and/or organisational-level implementation of EIDM. For example, in South
Africa, an individual with awareness and capability who was already working to
implement EIDM sent her team along to awareness raising workshops, whilst another
requested individual mentorships for his already-aware team.
3.3. Dimension 3: outputs
What can be achieved increases and changes as you move around the spiral (Figure 3). We
refute the idea that the introduction of a new evidence-informed policy is the only indi-
cator of success, but rather that there are many small shifts that occur and that are also
important. In addition, even where policy changes occur, there are critiques that point
out that even if an evidence-informed policy is introduced, implementation and accep-
tance of that evidence-informed policy is not a given (Nutley et al.,2007; Langer et al.,
2016). The decision itself is not an endpoint. We argue further that there are many

awareness, capability and use of evidence.
622 R. STEWART ET AL.
<<<PAGE=9>>>
incremental shifts, as you move around the spiral, all of which are important. We recog-
nise that big changes are the result of multiple small steps, and that the larger changes can
take many years to accumulate. One programme taking credit for a change in policy fails
to recognise the many small steps that have led to that change. Similarly, judging a pro-
gramme on the presence or absence of that policy change fails to understand the impor-
tance of the many increments that may have taken place. Our spiral provides scope for
small changes to be recorded, whether they are inﬂuencing a future leader or introducing
a new idea to someone’s thinking. We have seen this play out in practice within our
programme.
We experienced a wide range of incremental shifts related to evidence used as the fol-
lowing examples illustrate. An attendee at our workshops commented that they under-
stood evidence better now. One Director talked about how their team searches
diﬀerently now, and are just more mindful of using/considering evidence in their tasks.
A national department is in discussions of how to amend the required paperwork,
which accompanies new policy drafts to indicate the evidence on which the draft is
based. A team has discussed how they might encourage institutionalisation of systematic
evidence maps to inform new white papers, having conducted one map as part of a UJ-
BCURE team mentorship. In Malawi M&E oﬃcers at district level became aware of
and gained more general EIDM skillsﬁrst, but when some were mentored individually
they were able to concretely apply EIDM skills to developmental problems in their com-
munities with immediate impact on decision-making and the improvement of service
delivery.
3.4. Dimension 4: contexts
Contextual factors are hugely inﬂuential in deﬁning the nature and signiﬁcance of the
shifts that take place (Figure 4). The spiral does not operate in a vacuum, people do not
work in isolation and programmes to support evidence use are always building and
Figure 3. There are multiple incremental steps in the process of increasing the use of evidence.
DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA 623

interacting with other related initiatives. Contextual factors can present both barriers
and facilitators to change. There is, therefore, a need to continually engage with,
reﬂect on and respond to the environment. This needs to incorporate eﬀorts to under-
stand the environment, as well as analysis of issues as they arise and, where feasible,
strategies to overcome or maximise them. We have seen this play out in practice
within our programme.
Throughout our programme of activities, contextual factors have been identiﬁed as
shaping what we are able to achieve. For example, we have conducted landscape
reviews to understand the contexts in which we are working before starting our inter-
ventions and have sought to update our understanding of context throughout our
activities. These eﬀorts have been highly signiﬁcant. Our engagement with one depart-
ment was delayed because of a national drought requiring the attention of those we
were working with. Our response was to wait until they were ready to engage with
us. In one case, many months and years of investment in relationship-building have
led to a trusting partnership which is now making signiﬁcant impacts on the use of
evidence in decision-making. Diﬀerences between government departments and con-
testation over remits have led to some of our initiatives gaining limited traction.
Our response has been to invest more in building cross-government relationships.
Working across two countries we have noticed particular contextual diﬀ erences in
each country. For example, in Malawi, there is a new M&E system and therefore a
focus on the use of M&E data. In South Africa, where there is a more established
M&E system, there has been a greater focus on the use of evaluations and evidence
syntheses. There are also more practical aspects, for example, limited access to compu-
ters and the internet in Malawi, shape the potential outcomes of evidence-use initiat-
ives as do request for per diems.

<<<PAGE=11>>>
3.5. Dimension 5: interventions
If, as proposed above, the role players, their levels of engagement, the incremental changes
and the contexts, all vary, then it is logical that in order to facilitate movement around the
cycle, you need more than one approach to facilitate change. It does not make sense that a
single intervention could achieve awareness raising, build capacity and support applied
learning, or support the full range of shifts that need to accumulate to make bigger
changes. Furthermore, individuals and their contexts change over time, requiring a
responsive andﬂexible approach.
In our programme, we found that we have needed more than one approach to support
change, and that those approaches needed to beﬂexible in their design to respond to needs
(Stewart, 2015). For example, our workshops provided a starting point for our mentor-
ships, increasing awareness and capability amongst colleagues, who then took up the
opportunity for mentorship to help them consolidate learning and increase their use of
evidence. In one example, a workshop participant used monitoring and evaluation data
to support improvements in ante-natal attendance at local clinics. In this case, evidence
was used to understand the problem better and improving service delivery, not to
change policy per se. In some cases, the workshops provided a means for individuals
and teams to establish trust in what we do (they were already aware of EIDM). Having
built up trust, they engaged in the mentorship programme. In a few cases, individuals
took up mentorships through being referred by others who had taken part in our work-
shops, rather than attending themselves. Even in these cases, the combination of interven-
tions was key in that referral. We are aware that together our workshop and mentorship
programme has achieved more than either intervention could have achieved on its own. In
Malawi, workshops and group mentoring wereﬁrst necessary for individuals to acquire
EIDM skills before some individual mentoring could take place as the concept of EIDM
had been new. Such group orientation created an environment in which there was
greater acceptance of the value and practice of EIDM and therefore made individual men-
toring possible.
4. Discussion
As illustrated inFigure 5, we have identiﬁed ﬁve key elements relating to the provision of
support for evidence use for development in Southern Africa. These have been integrated
into a demand-side model, withﬁve dimensions to conceptualise support for the use of
evidence in decision-making. This model emphasises the need for multiple levels of
engagement, a combination of interventions, a spectrum of outcomes and a detailed con-
sideration of context. This model builds on and contributes to the literature of evidence-
informed decision-making in a number of ways.
Contrary to most conceptual scholarship on evidence-based policy-making for devel-
opment, this model starts with the evidence user. In fact, this model is exclusively
focused on the evidence user and interventions aiming to increase its use. It thereby
hopes to shift attention and currency away from the producers of evidence to zoom in
on the actors positioned to consider evidence during decision-making. If evidence-
based policy-making, as it claims, concerns the making of policy and practice decisions
informed by the best available evidence, then something is missing in the models that
DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA 625
<<<PAGE=12>>>
have largely focused on the supply of evidence or the interplay between supply and
demand. A model of evidence-based policy-making that does not consider and centre
around the act of decision-making (or the actor as a decision-maker) risks losing legiti-
macy and relevance to the very institutions and individuals it aims to serve – the
decision-makers. We are therefore using the term evidence-informed decision-making
and positioning this model as an attempt to conceptualise e ﬀorts to improve the
demand-side of evidence use. This builds in particular on the research by Newman
et al. (2012), who laid out initial components required to stimulate demand for research
evidence. Our contribution, therefore, hopes to expand these components and to provide a
coherent framework to map their interrelations.
While our concern here is exclusively on conceptualising demand-side interventions
for evidence use by public administrations, we acknowledge the continued need for
supply-side programmes and overall meta-frameworks of the evidence use system. We
hope to echo existing calls for frameworks to become less linear and re ﬂect more
closely the realities and perspectives of all actors in the evidence-based policy-making
process (Nutley et al.,2007; Best & Holmes,2010; Stewart & Oliver,2012).
This article aims to unpack and formalise the demand-side of research use providing a
structured approach to combine and analyse a range of diﬀerent interventions (e.g. train-
ing, mentoring, organisational change, co-production) in their contribution to decision-
makers’ use of evidence for development. If, as our model proposes, there is variation
in who, what, when and how changes occur around the cycle, then it is logical that in
order to facilitate movement around the cycle, we need more than one approach to facili-
tate change (Figure 5). There is clearly a need for more than one approach, and for
Figure 5.A model for increasing the use of evidence by decision-makers at multiple levels, raising their
awareness, building capacity and supporting evidence use.
626 R. STEWART ET AL.
<<<PAGE=13>>>
ﬂexibility in how these approaches are employed. Our model, therefore, attempts to con-
ceptualise diﬀerent demand-side mechanisms and interventions as mutual reinforcing.
This overlaps withﬁndings of systematic reviews on the impact of interventions aiming
to improve the use of research evidence (Gray et al.,2013; Langer et al.,2016) that indicate,
for example, how the eﬀects of evidence-informed decision-making training programmes
can be enhanced by a complementary change in management structures. Our model thus
advocates to increasingly understand demand-side interventions as complimentary and to
study their combined eﬀects. Such a holistic structure and study of demand-side interven-
tions might reduce the need to consult diﬀerent bodies of literature and epistemic commu-
nities as encountered when conceptualising our own capacity-building programme.
Newman et al. (2012) identify six diﬀerent approaches to capacity-building alone, while
Langer et al. (2016) encountered 91 interventions in their systematic review of what
works to increase evidence use. Thus an overall approach to structure and analyse these
diverse interventions is required.
This article highlights that interventions to encourage the use of evidence need to focus
on the many stages of the cycle. By using overlapping interventions, we are able to impact
along the dual continuums of awareness-capability-evidence-use and of individuals-
teams-organisations (Stewart,2015; Stewart et al.,2018). As multiple levels are considered,
the use of the term‘evidence-based policy-making’ becomes too speciﬁc. For this reason,
we advocate the broader, more inclusive and realistic term of‘evidence-informed decision-
making’ (EIDM, rather than EBPM). The model encourages the careful tailoring of
demand-side interventions to the levels of decision-making and their associated evi-
dence-informed decision-making needs. The model thereby allows for consideration of
multiple aspects of an individual’s work (their own position on evidence-informed
decision-making), their individual, team and organisational roles, and their incremental
learning: it does not put them in a box, that is it unpacks the‘user’ to provide a more dis-
aggregated and nuanced understanding of diﬀerent types of decision-makers working in
development.
Our approach conceives the use of evidence by decision-makers as a continuum. As
much as this applies to refuting the conception of separate and discrete interventions, it
also applies to outcomes of evidence use. By positioning evidence used as a continuum,
this article attempts to counter both, a strict separation of evidence-informed decision-
making awareness, capacity and decision-making processes, as well as an equation of
each of them with evidence use. This evidence use continuum builds on Newman et al.
spectrum of evidence-informed decision-making capacity from intangible shifts in atti-
tudes to tangible shifts in practical skills. Thus an intangible shift such as decision-
makers incorporating the question‘where is the evidence’ in their professional vocabulary
(Dayal, 2016) is valued as much as a decision-maker searching an academic database. We
also side with Newman et al. in emphasising that evidence use is not tied to the content of
the ﬁnal decision at practice or policy level. For instance, if during policy development
decision-makers did consider rigorous evidence, but opted not to formulate policy in
line with the results of this evidence, the policy should nevertheless be regarded as evi-
dence-informed. Such a conception of evidence use emphasises the value of incremental
changes, all of which are important and should be targeted by demand-side interventions.
We thereby challenges the falsehood that a new policy or a policy change is the single goal

of programmes to facilitate the use of evidence and should present the measure by which
to evaluate their success.
Our model leaves much room for adaptation and is in direct conversation with a
number of diﬀerent bodies of research. We recognise that it does not include citizen evi-
dence speciﬁcally, nor the role of citizens in decision-making, although we would argue
that it also does not exclude citizens as either generators of evidence nor as actors in
decision-making. We hope our model may serve as an adaptable platform that other
can develop further and integrate their ideas within; and, equally important, that our
ﬁve elements might be integrated with existing evidence-use frameworks and encourage
others to build on these. In terms of further development, there is a strong overlap
between the conception of our outcomes with Michie et al. (2011) Capability, Opportu-
nity, Motivation– Behaviour Change (COM-B) framework of behaviour change. We
have deliberately avoided the term motivation to not create confusion. A recent systematic
review used Michie’s COM-B framework to conceptualise evidence use outcomes (Langer
et al.,2016) and we would assume that further research could attempt to integrate this fra-
mework closer with ourﬁve elements. The same applies to the scholarship of French and
peers (2009), who have developed a detailed model of user capacities required for the
adoption of evidence-based practices in health care. Their circle of capacities features a
transition of 15 diﬀerent capacities that could be directly integrated into our proposed
model.
An additional body of highly relevant research is that led by the Overseas Development
Institute (ODI) and International Network for the Availability of Scientiﬁc Publications
(INASP) on how context aﬀects evidence use. A range of recent publications (Shaxson
et al., 2015; INASP, 2016; Weyrauch, 2016) has added a wealth of knowledge on the
role and importance of context in the interaction between evidence and decision-
making. What is more though, and extends beyond the mere acknowledgment that
context matters greatly as in our model, is that increasingly this research and capacity-
building provide active advice and guidance on how to move from an analysis of contex-
tual factors into an active integration and embedment of these factors into evidence use
interventions. Lastly, we also point to the body of scholarship on co-production and
user-engagement in research (Stewart & Liabo, 2012, Oliver et al., 2015; Sharples,
2015). While we have not explored this in detail in our own research and capacity-build-
ing, we would be curious to see the analytical and conceptual relevance of our model for
evidence-informed decision-making interventions that foster a co-production and engage-
ment between evidence producers and users.
Naturally, this article is subject to some limitations. It is based on 20 years of experience
in the development ﬁeld in Southern Africa, and in particular on recent research and
capacity-building conducted in two countries (Malawi and South Africa), which was
large scale involving a total of 14 government departments across a wide range of
sectors. It also draws on the wider experience of the authors, but there is nevertheless a
risk that the model might be bound by the contexts in which it was developed. In addition,
and as indicated above, this model is exclusively concerned with demand for evidence and
its use. The supply of evidence is treated exogenous. We assume other scholarship to be
better placed to provide a meta-framework for evidence use (Greenhalgh et al.,2004)
and position our contribution to conceptualise a subset of these frameworks. From our
experiences, our proposed model might also more accurately explain how and why
628 R. STEWART ET AL.
<<<PAGE=15>>>
evidence use occurs and what active interventions can bring about this occurrence. As a
diagnostic tool to explain an existing lack of evidence use, however, the model seems to
be less relevant.
Our article is alsoﬁrmly anchored in the normative assumption that the use of evidence
during decision-making is desirable and beneﬁcial for development. This is an assumption
implicit throughout the article and others might not agree (Hammersley,2005). While
important, we do not perceive these debates to have direct implications for the relevance
and validity of our model.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we reﬂect on what the implications are of our article for future facilitation to
increase evidence use for development. We propose that future programmes should con-
sider multiple interventions that can be combined to meet needs as individuals, teams and
organisations seek to increase their awareness, capability and implementation of evidence-
informed decision-making. Importantly, we highlight the need to rethink what we deﬁne
as ‘success’ to be broader than just the production of an evidence-informed policy, extend-
ing back to all the multiple steps between initial awareness, incorporating other kinds of
decisions (such as not introducing a policy at all or not changing an existing one), and
following any decisions forward to implementation. As a consequence of this, we highlight
the need for new approaches to M&E of interventions that aim to increase evidence use
and new approaches to evaluate their impact. We encourage others to test out our
model in their research and capacity-building and to continue to reﬂect upon and
improve our understanding of how we can engage with decision-makers to increase the
use of evidence.
