Workplace coaching has experienced a dramatic rise in popularity over the past 
decade and is one of the fastest growing performance-enhancing interventions 
used by modern organizations. Yet, despite its popularity, workplace coaching 
has not been the subject of much empirical research and a true science of 
coaching has yet to be developed. The purpose of this research was to update 
prior meta-analyzes that investigated the impact of coaching on organizational 
outcomes and to provide recommendations for how the field needs to evolve. 
Results indicated that, consistent with prior meta-analyzes, workplace coaching 
is effective in achieving positive organizational outcomes. The effects of several 
moderators were also investigated. Finally, we  discuss the results in terms of 
recommendations for future directions that we believe will establish and advance 
the science of coaching.

1. Introduction
Coaching has experienced a dramatic increase in interest and use in the past several years. 
In fact, coaching has been described as one of the fastest-growing specialties within the Human 
Resources profession (Bozer and Delegach, 2019). The International Coaching Federation (ICF) 
reported that there were more than 71,000 coaching professionals in 2019 ( International 
Coaching Federation, 2020), a number that has more than tripled in the past 10 or so years 
(Theeboom et al., 2014). Indeed, coaching in the workplace has been so well accepted that many 
organizations provide it as part of a benefit package to their most valued employees. The ICF 
estimates that over two billion US dollars per year is invested in workplace coaching worldwide 
(International Coaching Federation (ICF), 2020).
As coaching has increased in acceptance, it has also evolved to meet the demands of its 
clients. Coaches are much more likely to have received formal training now than in the past 
(Passmore and Sinclair, 2020). There are also an increased number of assessment techniques 
(Möeller and Kotte, 2022) and interventions (Greif et al., 2022) available to today’s coaches. 
Additionally, the COVID pandemic accelerated the shift in the delivery modality of coaching,

with many coaches switching to technology-based delivery platforms 
rather than face-to-face interactions.
Despite the popularity of workplace coaching in practice, 
scientists have lamented the lack of empirical research in this area 
(Jones et al., 2016; Silzer et al., 2016). Critics have questioned whether 
coaching is actually empirically based (Sherman and Freas, 2004; Greif 
et  al., 2022 ) or worth level of investment ( Sonesh et  al., 2015 ). 
Fortunately, however, researchers have begun to respond to this need, 
with a dramatic uptick in research examining coaching effectiveness 
over the past decade (Kotte and Bozer, 2022).
This increase in research activity, combined with the rise in 
popularity of workplace coaching, drive the need for another review 
of the scientific literature to allow us to assess the state of the art and 
to suggest directions for future research. Hence, the present 
manuscript describes a meta-analytic review of research on the 
effectiveness of workplace coaching since 2018. This review also 
considers the impact of several moderator variables that may influence 
the effectiveness of coaching.
Ultimately, our goal is to provide a set of prescriptions that will 
move the field toward a true science of coaching. At present, the field 
of coaching is still relatively immature (albeit very popular) in the 
sense that we  do not understand exactly what works, what the 
underlying mechanisms of action are, which coaching approaches are 
most effective, or how long coaching needs to take to achieve results. 
Our analyzes and subsequent discussion and conclusions will attempt 
to address these questions.
1.1. Definition of coaching
Workplace coaching (which includes executive coaching and 
other coaching interventions aimed at improving performance in the 
workplace) is defined in several ways in the literature (see Greif et al., 
2022 for a review). Some of these definitions incorporate the idea that 
coaching is a counseling and support process (Greif et al., 2022), while 
others emphasize goal setting and organizational outcomes (Kilburg, 
1996; Grant, 2003). Perhaps the most accepted definition of coaching 
is that of the International Coaching Federation, which defines 
coaching as, “Partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and 
creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and 
professional potential” (International Coaching Federation, 2020). 
Notably, what most of these definitions have in common is the notion 
that coaching involves an intimate relationship between a coach and 
a client (or group of clients) that is aimed at improving the client’s 
outcomes, the organization’s outcomes or both. In this sense, there is 
a fairly wide consensus around what executive coaching is meant 
to accomplish.
Where the definitions diverge somewhat, is in how they define the 
coaching process itself. Indeed, coaching has been described using a 
wide variety of words such as: counseling, behavior modification, 
facilitation, appreciative inquiry, problem solving, goal setting, etc. 
(Greif et al., 2022). Unfortunately, this conceptual confusion and lack 
of specificity around the exact nature of the coaching process makes 
it difficult to evaluate coaching research, to compare outcomes across 
coaching studies or to provide guidance for training new coaches. 
Moreover, if coaching is defined as any type of interaction between 
coach and client, with few documented strategies, approaches, tools 
or prescriptions unacceptable variability in outcomes is to be expected. 
That means that some coaching situations succeed better than others 
for reasons that cannot be easily discerned.
While it is unlikely that a single, agreed upon definition of 
coaching will be accepted any time soon, one way to begin to establish 
parameters around the various approaches to coaching is to 
understand the “mechanisms of action. ” That is, we need to better 
understand the theoretical justification for why various coaching 
approaches are expected to achieve desired outcomes. To date, several 
theoretical bases have been proposed to guide coaching practice. 
These are reviewed in the following section.
1.2. Theoretical bases of coaching
In general, coaching practice has been heavily influenced by 
Positive Psychology which focuses on positive aspects of human 
experience (as opposed to mental illness or maladaptive behavior). 
Indeed, according to Auer et al. (2022) , many have suggested that 
“coaching can be thought of as an applied form of positive psychology 
(Grant and Cavanagh, 2007, p. 3) or that coaching fits appropriately 
within the broader positive psychology framework ( Freire, 2013; 
Theeboom et al., 2014). Hence, the influence of positive psychology is 
evident across coaching approaches.
That said, prevailing reviews of coaching generally converge on 
two different theoretical bases upon which coaching practice is 
defined (Bono et al., 2009; Vandaveer et al., 2016). On the one hand, 
coaching has been conceived as primarily a facilitation process that 
has its roots directly in positive psychology and includes techniques 
such as appreciative inquiry and counseling. The emphasis from this 
perspective is on the process of coaching ( Williams and Lowman, 
2018). That is, the coach’s role is to provide active and empathic 
listening, Socratic questioning, and clarification with the aim being to 
help the client remove barriers that are keeping them from achieving 
their personal and professional goals (Vandaveer et al., 2016). It is 
largely non-directive and aimed at helping the client gain insights and 
actualize their potential.
The second view of coaching puts the emphasis more squarely on 
the outcome of coaching by focusing on goal setting and goal 
achievement (Whitmore, 2010). The theoretical basis for this approach 
rests on literature into goal setting, including action planning and 
accountability as a means to achieve durable behavioral change. Some 
of the specific approaches that fall into this category include strength-
based coaching (MacKie, 2014) and Cognitive-Behavioral coaching 
(Passmore et al., 2013). The common ingredient is that the coach’s role 
is to help the client clearly define their goal, develop concrete actions 
plans designed to achieve the goal and set up mechanisms so that the 
client is accountable for their progress towards achieving the goal 
(Grant, 2022).
As noted, the influence of positive psychology is evident in these 
approaches as well. For example, strength-based coaching focuses on 
identifying and leveraging an individual’s strengths and talents to 
enhance their performance and overall effectiveness as an executive 
or leader. Rather than focusing primarily on weaknesses and areas of 
improvement, this coaching method emphasizes the identification and 
development of existing strengths and leveraging them to achieve 
personal and professional goals (MacKie, 2014).
It should be noted that the two approaches outlined above are 
not mutually exclusive—a coaching session can include elements of
<<<PAGE=3>>>

Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org
both; the distinction is based more on the overarching focus of the 
coaching and what it is trying to achieve. That said, we  were 
interested in operationalizing this distinction to see if it had an 
effect on outcomes. Hence, in the present meta-analysis, 
we  attempted to investigate whether one of these overarching 
approaches was more effective than the other by including the 
theoretical foundation of coaching (process versus outcome) as a 
moderator variable.
1.3. Coaching outcomes
As with many interventions aimed at improving workplace 
performance, the question of what outcomes coaching can affect 
must be answered on several levels. Borrowing from the training 
effectiveness literature, Kotte and Bozer (2022) described the use of 
a four-level model based on Kirkpatrick’s hierarchy. The levels in this 
framework are: subjectively perceived benefit, affective and cognitive 
learning outcomes, client behavior change, and performance results. 
In a similar vein, Jones et  al. (2016)  applied a training-based 
conceptualization of outcomes presented by Kraiger et al. (1993). This 
model conceptualizes expected outcomes as falling into three 
categories: affective, cognitive and skill based . Affective outcomes 
include attitude and motivational outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, 
wellbeing). Cognitive outcomes include learning declarative 
knowledge, problem solving and other cognitive strategies. Finally, 
skill outcomes include acquisition and automaticity of new skills (e.g., 
negotiation skills; delegation skills). To this, Jones et al. (2016) added 
a category called results (similar to Kirkpatrick) that represents 
organizational-level changes and outcomes (e.g., increased sales or 
lower attrition).
Past research into coaching has employed a variety of effectiveness 
indicators that represent all levels of the frameworks described above. 
Unfortunately, there does not seem to be  much theoretical 
concordance between the coaching technique employed and the 
outcomes assessed. In other words, past researchers have not 
attempted to draw differential hypothesizes predicting that specific 
outcomes will be influenced more or less based on the nature of the 
coaching being studied. For example, it might make theoretical sense 
to expect affective outcomes to be  more affected by facilitation/
process-based approaches than outcome/goal setting-
based approaches.
In the present meta-analysis we  attempted to investigate this 
question by conducting sub-analyzes that crossed type of outcome by 
theoretical foundation so that we could assess whether there were 
differential effects. To do this, we coded the effectiveness outcomes 
using the same framework as Jones et  al. (2016)  (i.e., affective, 
cognitive, skill and results) and looked at two questions. First, was 
there an overall effect for outcome type and second, did the type of 
coaching have differential effects on the outcome types.
1.4. Previous meta-analyzes
Theeboom et  al. (2014)  conducted a meta-analytic review of 
coaching effectiveness in organizations. They concluded that, across 
a variety of outcomes, coaching had a significant positive effect on 
individual effectiveness. The effect sizes ranged from g = 0.43 for 
coping to g = 0.74 for goal-directed self-regulation. The authors also 
reported that within-subjects (pre-post only) designs yielded 
significantly higher effect sizes than mixed designs (pre-post with a 
comparison group). They also found that the number of coaching 
sessions was not related to effectiveness.
Jones et al. (2016) critiqued the Theeboom et al. (2014) analysis 
on the basis that they included studies that were not conducted in the 
workplace. They also suggested an emphasis on variables that are more 
relevant to the workplace. In their meta-analysis, they also found that 
coaching was associated with a moderate positive effect 
on effectiveness.
Jones et al. (2016) also considered several potential moderator 
variables. Contrary to Theeboom et al. (2014), Jones et al. (2016) did 
not find a significant difference between within-subject and mixed 
research designs. However, like Theeboom et al. (2014), Jones et al. 
(2016) found no effect of the number of coaching sessions 
on outcomes.
Additionally, Jones et  al. (2016)  investigated some potential 
moderators not considered previously. For example, they reported that 
internal consultants were significantly more effective than those who 
were external to the organization. Additionally, they reported no 
difference between face-to-face versus mixed-modes of delivery. 
Finally, Jones and her colleagues investigated the impact of multi-
source feedback (feedback given not only from a supervisor but also 
subordinates, peers, clients etc.) in the coaching process. Surprisingly, 
they found that having multi-source feedback was associated with 
worse outcomes.
Like Jones et  al. (2016) , Burt and Talati (2017)  sought to 
improve the Theeboom et  al. (2014)  analysis. Specifically, they 
tightened the inclusion criteria to include only pre & post test for 
treatment and control groups, included unpublished studies and 
added studies for additional years. They found that, while the 
overall effect size was somewhat smaller than reported by 
Theeboom et al. (2014) , there was still a moderate positive effect of 
coaching. There were no moderating effects of age, type of measure, 
or authors.
1.5. The present meta-analysis
Several years have passed since the last meta-analysis of the 
literature on the effectiveness of workplace coaching. As previously 
noted, the number of coaches has more than tripled in this timeframe 
(Passmore and Sinclair, 2020). Moreover, the investment in coaching 
is estimated at over two billion US dollars a year ( International 
Coaching Federation, 2020). As with many other techniques that 
promise to improve performance in the workplace, this increase in 
coaching has been largely uninformed by empirical effectiveness 
research. And while there is some evidence that coaching can have 
positive outcomes (Theeboom et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2016), it is not 
all clear whether some coaching approaches are superior to others, 
which outcomes are most influenced by coaching or even if coaching 
can have negative, unintended consequences. Therefore, there is a 
need to analyze any new data to provide a more current estimate of 
the effects of coaching and the factors that may influence 
its effectiveness.

2. Hypotheses
H1: There will be no difference in coaching effectiveness based on 
the type of coaching offered (process/facilitation-based or 
outcome/goal setting-based).
H2: There will be  no difference between the effectiveness of 
coaching as assessed by the three types of outcome measures.
H3: Studies that employed process/facilitation-based coaching 
will yield better outcomes for affective-based measures than 
cognitive or skill-based measures, while the opposite will be true 
for outcome/goal setting-based coaching.
H4: Self-reported outcomes will be higher than either evaluation 
by supervisors or evaluation by subordinates.
H5: Face-to-face coaching will yield better results than 
virtual coaching.
H6a: The duration of coaching as measured by the number of 
sessions will have a significant positive impact on 
coaching outcomes.
H6b: The duration of coaching as measured by the total hours of 
coaching will have a significant positive impact on 
coaching outcomes.
3. Methods
3.1. Search strategy
A variety of approaches were taken to collect relevant 
published and unpublished research findings relevant to the meta-
analysis. Papers after 2014 (the last meta-analysis) were considered 
for inclusion. Electronic databases (Web of Science, PsychInfo, 
JSTOR Business, ERIC, Google Scholar, and ProQuest) were 
searched using the keywords “coaching, ” crossed with “workplace, ” 
“executive, ” “effectiveness, ” “impact, ” and “evaluation. ” 
Additionally, Dissertation Abstracts were searched to seek 
unpublished studies. Finally, unpublished studies were sought by 
emailing authors that have been active in the area. No unpublished 
results were received.
Each article was evaluated for inclusion using the criteria 
described by Theeboom et al. (2014) . Namely, included studies must 
have been conducted in the workplace by trained coaches. The 
included studies also needed to provide results regarding work-
related outcomes. Included studies needed to include sufficient data 
to compute an effect size. Finally, only studies that reported 
individual-level outcomes (as opposed to group or team) 
were included.
The original search yielded a total of 114 papers that were 
evaluated for inclusion. After evaluating each study against the 
inclusion criteria, 11 papers were included for the final analysis. These 
studies are summarized in Table 1. The associated PRISMA flowchart 
is presented in Figure 1. Several papers were excluded because they 
did not deal with workplace outcomes. The remainder were excluded 
because they did not include the data to evaluate coaching outcomes. 
There were no disagreements among the raters.
3.2. Meta-analytic software
We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v4; Borenstein 
et al., 2022 ). This software is advantageous in that a) it allows the 
entry of multiple data formats and b) it allows consideration of both 
categorical and continuous moderators (through 
meta-regression).
3.3. Calculation of effect sizes
Like Theeboom et al. (2014) , we decided that effect sizes based 
on standardized means were the best fit for this data set, as all 
included studies reported means and standard deviations and is 
recommended for small data sets. We also found that the original 
justification to use the Hedges and Olkin (1984)  approach to 
estimating effect sizes also held for the present data. Namely, it 
provides a relatively conservative estimate of the lower boundary of 
the confidence interval ( Johnson et  al., 1995 ). Additionally, all 
estimates were created using the random effects model as 
recommended by Borenstein et al. (2021) . This estimate assumes 
that the studies are a sample of a larger universe of studies. In so 
doing, the estimate considers two possible sources of variance: a) 
within-study error and b) variation of true effects across studies. 
Again, this is considered to be the more conservative approach as 
compared to the fixed-effects model ( Borenstein et al., 2021).
Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran’s Q (Cochran, 1954) 
and the I 2 statistic ( Higgins and Thompson, 2002 ). This analysis 
yielded a Q value of 126.45 (df = 11, p < 0.001), indicating heterogeneity 
of effect sizes among the studies. The associated I 2 value was 91.3, 
indicating that a substantial portion of the variance can be attributed 
to true effect differences rather than sampling error. However, 
we noted the presence of a substantial outlier when reviewing the 
average effect sizes in the individual studies (see Figure 1). Namely, the 
effect size estimates of Onyishi et al. (2021) were substantially higher 
than the other included studies (Hedge’s g = 3.52). After removing this 
study, the Q value was reduced to 12.64 (df = 10, p > 0.05), indicating 
a homogeneous pool of effect sizes. Further, the I 2 was reduced to 
20.09, indicating much less variance in the true score estimate. Given 
that, the subsequent analyzes were conducted without the Onyishi 
et al. (2021) study as it was a clear outlier.
Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot (see Figure 2). 
Inspection of the plot suggests that the standard errors were generally 
symmetrical with regard to the means.

Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org
3.4. Moderator variables
3.4.1. Theoretical foundation
As noted, we  categorized the studies according to whether the 
coaching approach used a process/facilitation framework or an 
outcome/goal setting framework by using consensus ratings generated 
by the authors. The classification ratings were carried out by taking 
reference to the above-mentioned aspects of the two different theoretical 
orientations. If the coaching included discussion of achievement of 
specific outcomes and/or setting of specific goals, we categorized it as 
outcome/goal. Otherwise, studies that emphasized discussion, 
identifying obstacles to success and general facilitation by the coach 
were categorized as process/facilitation. Since there is virtually no 
literature regarding the relative effectiveness of coaching approaches, 
we were not able to make a formal prediction about which would yield 
higher outcomes. Hence, we did not have a hypothesis for this variable.
3.4.2. Outcome type
Individual studies used a variety of outcome measures to assess 
the effects of coaching. To allow synthesis of these outcomes, 
we adopted the categorization approach used by Jones et al. (2016) as 
described above. Outcomes measures were assigned to one of three 
categories by the first two authors. No discrepancies between the 
raters occurred. The first category was Affective. This category 
included attitudinal, emotional, and motivational measures. The 
cognitive category included outcomes to knowledge, procedures, and 
strategies. Finally, the skill category refers to measures that involve the 
development of new skills. None of the included papers reported 
results that would have fit into the “results” category described by 
Jones et al. (2016).
We did not have a strong basis for an a priori hypothesis regarding 
the relative expected change in outcomes since previous studies have 
not shown any differences. We did, however, hypothesize that there 
would an effect of coaching type on outcomes, such that the process/
facilitation-based programs would have a higher impact on affective 
measures while outcome/goal setting-based programs would yield 
higher scores on cognitive and skill outcomes.
3.4.3. Evaluation source
Studies of the effectiveness of coaching combine several methods 
of estimating coaching outcomes. These include self-evaluation, 
evaluation by supervisors, and evaluation by subordinates. However, 
previous research has indicated that these assessment sources might 
yield very different outcomes ( cf. Dunning, 2013 ). Therefore, 
we  analyzed the data to determine if the source of the evaluation 
source moderated coaching outcomes.
3.4.4. Modality
Several studies have reported that technology-based 
communication may be  substantially different than face-to-face 
communication (see Walther et al., 2015 for a review). It is reasonable 
to hypothesize that the differences may result in different coaching 
outcomes depending on modality. Therefore, we analyzed face-to-face 
versus virtual modalities as a possible moderator variable.
3.4.5. Number of sessions/hours of coaching
Previous meta-analyzes have demonstrated that the amount of 
coaching was not related to coaching outcomes. This runs counter to 
the traditional dose–response relationship that one might expect in 
areas such as psychotherapy. Due to the variability in past coaching 
practice, it is possible that the correlation between the amount of 
coaching and coaching outcomes was obscured. Since modern 
coaches are more likely to have had formal training than in the past 
and it can be expected that the coaching practices are more oriented 
to certain standards, it might be that this hypothesis is now supported.
4. Results
4.1. Aggregated effect sizes
The weighted effect sizes, averaged across outcomes is presented 
in Table  2. As illustrated in the Table, the point estimate was 
significant. This result indicates that, across studies and outcome 
measures, coaching interventions are likely to have a medium positive 
effect. Although the I2 was relatively low [after excluding the Onyishi 
et al. (2021) study], we evaluated select moderator variables in the 
service of replicating and extending the existing meta-analyzes. The 
details of this analysis are presented in Table 3.
4.2. Moderating effect of theoretical 
foundation
H1: There will no difference in coaching effectiveness based on the 
type of coaching offered (process/facilitation-based or outcome/
goal setting-based).
Theoretical approach (process vs. outcome) was analyzed as a 
moderator variable. There was no significant difference between the 
two approaches. Process-oriented coaching yielded a point estimate 
of g = 0.45 while Outcome-oriented coaching indicated a point 
estimate of 0.39. The details of this analysis are presented in Table 3.
4.3. Moderating effect of outcome type
H2: There will be  no difference between the effectiveness of 
coaching as assessed by the three types of outcome measures.
To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the degree to which reported 
outcomes vary as a result of the type of outcome by computing effect 
sizes separately for each outcome type. Outcomes related to skill 
yielded a significant point estimate of g = 0.72. Affective outcomes 
yielded a point estimate of g = 0.41. The effect sizes were not 
significantly different. The details of this analysis are presented in 
Table 3. None of the studies assessed cognitive outcomes according to 
the definition outlined above.
4.4. Effects of coaching type on outcome 
type
H3: Studies that employed process/facilitation-based coaching 
will yield better outcomes for affective-based measures than

cognitive or skill-based measures, while the opposite will be true 
for outcome/goal setting-based coaching.
T o assess the hypothesis that different types of coaching would 
create different outcomes, we conducted separate analyzes on the skill 
and affective outcome types using coaching type as a moderator. 
When considering Affective outcomes, process-based coaching 
yielded an effect estimate of g = 0.42. Outcome-based coaching 
yielded a similar point estimate (g = 0.48). The details of this analysis 
are presented in Table 3.
Looking at skill outcomes, process-based coaching was associated 
with a point estimate of 0.53. However, this was not significant, likely 
due to the small sample size. Outcome-based coaching yielded a 
point estimate of 0.42. The details of this analysis are presented in 
Table 3.
Due to the limited number of studies, we  were only able to 
evaluate Hypothesis 3 for outcome based coaching. The results 
indicate no significant difference in creating skill versus affective 
outcomes (ZDiff = 0.77, p = n.s.).
4.5. Moderating effect of evaluation 
source
H4: Self-reported outcomes will be higher than either evaluation 
by supervisors or evaluation by subordinates.
The results of our analysis of this hypothesis indicated that 
positive outcomes were reported regardless of evaluation source. 
The highest point estimate resulted from manager-rated outcomes 
(g = 0.50). Self-reported outcomes were also associated with 
positive estimates ( g = 0.41). However, the one study that 
investigated evaluations from subordinates yielded a smaller 
positive, but not significant, point estimate ( g = 0.24). This 
estimate was significantly lower than the other two categories 
(Q(2) = 0.39, p > 0.05). Again, however, since the employee-rated 
effect size was based on only one study, it may change as more 
studies investigate this effect. The details of this analysis are 
presented in Table 3.
4.6. Moderating effect of modality
H5: Face-to-face coaching will yield better results than 
virtual coaching.
To examine this hypothesis, we explored the differences in face-
to-face versus virtual modalities in coaching outcomes. The results 
indicate that both face-to-face and virtual coaching were associated 
with significant positive outcomes. Face-to face coaching yielded a 
point estimate of g = 0.48, Virtual coaching yielded a point estimate 
of g = 0.35. The difference between the two groups was not significant 
(Q(1) = 0.67, p > 0.05). The details of this analysis are presented in 
Table 3.
4.7. Moderating effect of number of 
sessions
H6a: The duration of coaching as measured by the number of 
sessions will have a significant positive impact on 
coaching outcomes.
To test this hypothesis, a meta-regression was used to evaluate 
whether number of sessions (k = 9) was related to coaching outcomes. 
The result of this analysis indicates that the number of sessions was 
not a significant predictor of overall coaching outcomes (Z = 1.03, 
p = 0.30).
4.8. Moderating effect of hours of coaching
H6b: The duration of coaching as measured by the total hours of 
coaching will have a significant positive impact on 
coaching outcomes.
To test this hypothesis, a meta-regression was used to evaluate 
whether total hours of coaching ( k = 8) was related to coaching 
outcomes. The result of this analysis indicates that the number of 
sessions was not a significant predictor of overall coaching outcomes 
(Z = 0.1.15, p = 0.25).
5. Discussion
There has been an explosion in the popularity and use of 
workplace coaching since the last published meta-analysis, with 
considerable resources (time and money) invested in it. The goal of 
the present study was to evaluate how coaching has evolved and 
whether there has been a change in its estimated impact or a better 
understanding of the variables that might moderate its effectiveness. 
We hoped that the results of this study could shed light on the best 
approaches for training coaches and guidance for optimizing the 
delivery of coaching in the workplace. While we partially accomplished 
this goal, perhaps the strongest contribution of this work is 
highlighting what still needs to be done. We begin by reviewing what 
we  found (in this section) and then turn our discussion toward 
outlining what we believe is needed to move the field forward.
After removing one clear outlier, the overall effect of coaching was 
positive and of moderate effect size. Interestingly, this effect was 
relatively homogenous (Q = 12.64) as compared to past analyzes. 
Similar to past analyzes (Theeboom et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2016), this 
finding was also positive across all outcome types. That is, there was 
no difference in the effectiveness of coaching as a function of which 
outcome measure was used. Overall, based on three meta-analyzes 
(representing thousands of data points) it is safe to conclude that 
coaching is an effective workplace intervention.
That said, we  were interested in seeing whether we  could 
meaningfully distinguish different types of coaching based on the 
theoretical framework upon which they were developed. The data did
<<<PAGE=10>>>
Cannon-Bowers et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1204166
Frontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org
not yield positive results in this regard; indeed, there was no difference 
between coaching that stemmed from a process/facilitation framework 
versus an outcome/goal setting framework. There are several reasons 
this might be the case.
First, the level of homogeneity just mentioned was so high, that 
there was insufficient variance to detect a difference given the sample 
size. Second, the two approaches might actually be equally effective. 
Or third—and most likely—the approaches are not sufficiently 
differentiated to allow meaningful comparisons. Unfortunately, the 
vast majority of studies lacked enough detail to make 
clear determinations.
For likely similar reasons, we  did not find the hypothesized 
relationship between coaching type and outcome type. Specifically, 
process/facilitation-based coaching did not have a greater impact on 
affective outcomes nor did the outcome/goal setting-based coaching 
have a greater impact on skill outcomes. Given the level of detail in the 
studies, it is impossible to know why this was the case for the reasons 
noted above.
With respect to the modality of coaching, the COVID-19 
pandemic heightened interest in the effectiveness of virtual coaching. 
Therefore, we considered the differences between virtual and live 
coaching. Our analysis revealed no significant difference between the 
two modalities, supporting the assertion that virtual coaching can 
be a useful tool in effecting workplace effectiveness. This is consistent 
with Jones et al. ’s finding about hybrid coaching. It is an important 
finding because it gives remote coaches confidence that coaching can 
be  as effective if carried out virtually as it is in face-to-face 
interactions. This profoundly increases the possible pool of both 
coaches and clients and could help coaching become even more 
popular in the future.
Like previous analyzes, we also investigated the moderating effect 
of the number of coaching sessions. Also like the previous analyzes, 
we found this variable not to be a significant moderator of coaching 
outcomes. Because we were concerned that studies “sessions” are of 
varying length, we  also considered the total number of hours of 
coaching received. Again, this effect was not significant. Besides being 
durable, this is an interesting finding that requires further 
consideration. On the one hand, it could reflect a sort of demand 
characteristic where the act of being coached (independent of the 
actual coaching) is responsible for the positive outcomes. This seems 
unlikely (McCambridge et al., 2012), but given the current data, it is 
feasible. More likely, the number of sessions required to achieve 
desired outcomes varies considerably across studies.
Finally, we considered the moderating impact of the source of 
evaluator used to judge the perceived impact of coaching. The results 
indicated that both self-reports and supervisor reports yielded 
moderate, positive, and significant point estimates. However, the one 
study that reported results based on employee (subordinate) ratings 
yielded a negative, but not significant, estimate. This is an issue that 
requires additional investigation in future studies of 
coaching effectiveness.
5.1. Directions for future research
Including the present study, reviews and meta-analyzes have been 
consistent in reporting a moderate, positive effect of coaching for over 
a decade. This effect seems robust across outcomes, number of 
sessions, and modality—clearly something is working! The question 
now becomes, how can coaching outcomes be  optimized? 
We  attempted to begin answering this question by investigating 
whether the theoretical bases of coaching could determine which 
approaches are more successful than others. We were unable to do 
this, and it is unclear why the distinctions we  drew were 
not meaningful.
Our strongest conclusion from this exercise is that future 
researchers would do the field a great service by including details 
about the coaching approach when publishing studies. This would 
allow us to better understand the similarities and differences between 
approaches so that they can be  better associated with specific 
outcomes. In fact, the science of coaching  might benefit from a 
taxonomy of standardized coaching approaches, strategies, and 
techniques to assist us in better understanding which interventions 
are best for any given client, situation and/or desired outcome.
Another set of observations pertains to the outcome measures 
themselves. While we are not advocating that the Kraiger et al. (1993) 
categorization of outcomes, or one based on Kirkpatrick’s hierarchy, 
or any other is superior, we  are suggesting that some theoretical 
framework of outcome types be used when studies are conceived. 
Indeed, the field would be well served by thinking through which 
outcomes are expected to be  affected by coaching in general and 
which are expected to change due to specific elements or approaches 
of coaching in particular. In addition, like Jones et al., none of the 
studies included in our analysis used outcomes as the results level. At 
this point in the history of coaching as an organizational intervention, 
it is important for research to establish positive influences on 
organizational results as a function of coaching. Without this, it will 
be impossible to conduct cost–benefit analyzes to justify continued 
investment in coaching.
Related to the question of what is the best type of coaching is the 
related question of, “who are the best coaches?” According to ICF , 
managers and leaders using coaching skills strongly agree that clients 
expect coaches to be  certified and/or credentialed. However, the 
studies represented in this analysis include coaches with a very wide 
range of backgrounds and experience. Interestingly, very few studies 
include information about the coach’s certification (ICF or otherwise). 
Without such information, it is difficult to associate the quality of 
coaches with the outcomes they create.
Likewise, studies of coaching include very little information about 
the nature of coaching clients. For the most part, the studies reported 
here used volunteers in large organizations as the clients. However, 
this may not generalize well to the actual clients who seek out or are 
offered coaching. Almost nothing is reported about the client’s 
coaching goals or previous experiences. So, while it’s valuable that 
coaching “can” create good outcomes (as defined by the researcher), it 
would be better to demonstrate that coaching can help clients achieve 
their goals. This may represent the more externally valid outcome. 
Hence, we recommend that future research into coaching effectiveness 
take a more client-centric view, specifically reporting whether 
outcomes were consistent with the client’s goals and desires.
Another observation regarding passed studies into coaching 
effectiveness is that they have focused on an undifferentiated (or at 
least undefined) set of desired changes. However, there is a trend in 
the industry towards coaching designed to address a specific set of 
skills and outcomes--e.g., conflict resolution ( Brinkert, 2016 ) or 
leadership (Wise and Hammack, 2011). This is another area where
<<<PAGE=11>>>
Cannon-Bowers et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1204166
Frontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org
additional outcome research may provide more targeted guidance to 
the coaching community.
In another vein, a viable question that remains unanswered is 
“how many coaching sessions (or hours) are needed to see 
results?. ” All three meta-analyzes have found that the number of 
sessions/h does not predict outcomes. As noted, this could 
be some sort of demand characteristic, but is more likely due to 
the coarseness of the data. Future researchers would do well to 
adopt more precise measurement schemes that can track outcomes 
over the course of a coaching relationship (e.g., longitudinal, 
within-subjects designs). This would reveal when outcomes are 
changing and help answer the question of how much coaching is 
needed. It might also uncover important individual differences in 
coaching effectiveness.
The issue of unwanted effects stemming from coaching also 
requires further study. Schermuly and Graßmann (2019)  presents a 
number of possible side effects that could possibly occur. These 
include relationship problems with supervisors, dependence on the 
coach, and possible reduction in job satisfaction. At this point, it is 
unknown how prevalent these—or other—unwanted effects occur 
as a function of coaching. This should be  the subject of 
future research.
Finally, scholars in the area of workplace coaching have repeatedly 
called for more theory-focused research (i.e., Theeboom et al., 2014; 
Bozer and Jones, 2021). Ideally, scientists would advance theories that 
propose a “mechanism of action” for specific coaching outcomes. 
Examples could include goal setting, appreciative inquiry, cognitive-
behavioral approaches, positive psychology, and others (Sutton, 2020). 
Empirical research could then test these mechanisms with the goal of 
identifying the specific coaching activities that could support the 
client’s goal. However, researchers in this area have been slow to adopt 
this approach. There is a clear need for additional theoretical work to 
support the explosion of interest in workplace coaching and to guide 
future research.
5.2. Limitations
Despite the increase in interest regarding workplace coaching, 
the empirical literature in this area is still quite limited. As noted

above, there is a lack of detail about the coaches, the coachees, and 
the content of coaching sessions. Furthermore, there is often a 
lack of detail regarding the setting in which the coaching was 
provided. This makes it difficult to build a knowledge base in any 
meaningful way. Furthermore, there is simply a lack of controlled 
studies. As noted in the results, some moderator variables only 
included one study, limiting the confidence one can have in the 
conclusions. Finally, several studies did not include adequate 
statistical data to allow inclusion in the meta-analysis. It would 
be  helpful if journals in this area enforced for stringent 
requirements for reporting results.
5.3. Recommendations for advancing the 
science of coaching
Consistent with two previous meta-analyzes, our analysis found 
that, overall, coaching is an effective intervention for improving
<<<PAGE=13>>>
Cannon-Bowers et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1204166
Frontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org
workplace outcomes. At this point, in order to establish and advance 
a science of coaching, we recommend the following:
Future researchers need to include details on the type of coaching 
approach being followed. As noted, ultimately, a taxonomic approach that 
defines various approaches and their attributes is desirable. For the 
moment, researchers need to at least describe the approach in enough 
detail that readers understand the way the coaching was carried out.
Future research needs to better explicate the types of outcomes 
that can be expected from coaching and also attempt to associate 
specific coaching approaches and features with expected outcomes. 
Further, longer term, results-level outcomes of coaching need to 
be investigated more often.
Future research would benefit from specification of the coach’s 
credentials. While there seems to be a desire on the part of clients for 
coaches to have credentials/certifications, an empirical look at the 
relationship between these and effectiveness would be  useful. For 
example, the results of such analyzes could inform the manner in 
which coaches are trained.
Future research should employ actual coaching clients or, if 
volunteers are used, at least define better who the clients are.
Future researchers need to consider whether coaching is effective 
in achieving more targeted outcomes (e.g., improved conflict 
resolution skills) as well as more generic ones.
Future researchers should consider longitudinal, within-studies 
designs that track outcomes more precisely over time.
Future research needs to be  more theoretically grounded and 
strive to better understand the “mechanisms of action” of coaching. 
This is related to the first recommendation focusing on coaching 
approaches but goes further by seeking to understand the specific 
aspects of the coaching relationship that can account for desired 
outcomes. Findings from such studies can inform the development of 
more effective and possibly efficient coaching strategies.
