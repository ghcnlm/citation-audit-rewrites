ABSTRACT
this study examines the effect of training practices on job performance in the public 
sector of a sub-s aharan a frican region. Building on social cognitive theory, this study 
integrates the mediating role of self-efficacy and the moderating role of perceived 
organizational politics to explain employees’ performance in public universities. this 
study is a quantitative survey using s tructural equation Modeling (seM) to analyze the 
responses of 370 non-teaching staff members at public universities in ghana. the 
findings show a positive and significant relationship between training and job 
performance. the study also finds that self-efficacy fully mediates the effect of training 
on task and contextual performance but partially on adaptive performance. the study 
further establishes that perceived organizational politics moderate the effect of training 
on contextual performance but not on self-efficacy and job performance. a gain, 
perceived organizational politics moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and 
job performance. Based on the findings, this study provides two key practical 
implications for the leadership of public institutions in general and public universities. 
First, the human resources divisions of various public universities must concentrate on 
training to enhance job performance. s econd, the directorate of human resources of 
public universities and all public sector institutions must devise strategies to minimize 
organizational politics, which negatively affects overall job performance. implications for 
theory and practice are also discussed.
1.  Introduction
globally, organizations rely on improved skills, knowledge, and capability of a talented workforce to cre -
ate competitive advantage (halawi & haydar, 2018; lin & hsu, 2017; showkat et  al., 2023). t herefore, 
organizations continuously focus on improving employees’ job performance to enrich organizational per -
formance to gain a competitive advantage ( chatterjee et  al., 2023; thevanes & Dirojan, 2018). enhancing 
employee performance cuts across all sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, manufacturing, con -
struction, and services. to enhance the performance of the service sector, there is a need to consider the 
work done by non-teaching staff in various universities. University non-teaching staff rarely achieve high 
job performance, which is influenced by several factors ( gyimah et  al., 2022). Factors such as self-efficacy, 
training, promotion, and salary are likely to significantly affect job performance within the university 
context; hence, they deserve recognition and attention ( abu-tineh et  al., 2023). One of the crucial strat -
egies for universities and organizations in general to gain a competitive advantage is to utilize training 
(Yang et  al., 2023). training is an important function in cultivating employees’ explicit and implicit knowl -
edge, skills, and abilities and transfers employees into valuable resources to improve job performance

(lin & huang, 2021). For these reasons, training has become a key variable in productivity drivers at the 
firm and national levels. For instance, in Part iii under the Protection of employment of the ghana labor 
act 2003, a ct 651 s ection 10 (Rights of a Worker) indicates that it is the right of an employee to be 
trained and to help him/her to develop skills and be given information that applies to the job.
current research studies on the subject have focused on how training practices affect job perfor -
mance and suggest that employees’ job performance is dependent on the training received (haryono 
et  al., 2020; Kanapathipillai & azam, 2020; sheeba & christopher, 2020). although training has a positive 
relationship with job performance (l yons & Bandura, 2022; Park et  al., 2018), it is difficult to realize this 
when employees undergoing the training program lack self-efficacy. s everal other studies, such as 
Mangkunegara and agustine ( 2016), argue that training partially affects employees’ job performance. 
therefore, to achieve the full effect of training on job performance, the literature has suggested that the 
role of other factors, such as self-efficacy and environmental and organizational factors should be con -
currently considered in the training-job performance relationship. For example, Park et  al. ( 2018) suggest 
that future studies on the relationship between training and job performance could look at other moti -
vational factors such as self-efficacy and how it will influence job performance. g aravan et  al. ( 2021) 
suggest that environmental and organizational content moderators should be incorporated when exam -
ining the job performance of employees.
it is vital to understand the mediating and moderating roles of self-efficacy and perceived organiza -
tional politics in employee performance after training. this is because the training of employees does 
not automatically translate into performance unless they believe in their capabilities to do so, and 
resources for the training practice are made available to employees. s elf-efficacy studies have consis -
tently shown that it is one of the key factors that predict performance (Bandura, 2015; carter et  al., 2018; 
Yagil et  al., 2023). thus, self-efficacy influences learners’ behavior and transfer outcomes both directly and 
indirectly through its mediating effect on outcome expectations ( chiaburu & lindsay, 2008; grossman & 
salas, 2011). For instance, chiaburu and lindsay ( 2008) indicate that employees’ perceived training and 
self-efficacy positively influenced their motivation to perform. s tajkovic et  al. ( 2018) conclude that 
employees with high levels of self-efficacy are less likely to give up on the pursuit of their responsibilities 
and, therefore, perform better on their job. the behavior and actions that occur informally inside an 
organization are usually perceived as organizational politics. this encompasses individuals’ actions aimed 
at supporting their private interests, which may agree or disagree with those of other individuals (Bukhari 
& Kamal, 2015; Ferris et  al., 2018). the individual actions directed toward achieving one’s own self-interest 
goals without regard for the well-being of others or the organization, which is referred to as organiza -
tional politics (Kacmar & Baron, 1999), is notable for both its pervasiveness and capacity to disrupt orga -
nizational processes and impact workers’ job performance and well-being. For example, a hmad et  al. 
(2017) conclude that organizational politics have a significant and negative relationship with job 
performance.
Despite the impact of self-efficacy on the performance of trained employees coupled with burgeoning 
research on training-job performance relationships, there is a paucity of studies and inconsistencies in 
the literature on how self-efficacy and perceived organizational politics partially or fully affect the job 
performance of trained employees, particularly in developing countries (Mangkunegara, 2021). Meanwhile, 
these regions are emerging in terms of the labor force and hence need more training to build the strong 
human capital that would be used to increase productivity ( gyimah et  al., 2023). this study sought to fill 
this gap by analyzing the influence of training practices on job performance, which is the mediating and 
moderating role of self-efficacy and perceived organizational politics on the job performance of 
non-teaching staff at public universities in ghana.
this study makes some key contributions to both literature and practice. First, the study employs 
social cognitive theory to explain this integrative training–job performance relationship through 
self-efficacy and its dependence on organizational politics. By so doing, the study advances training and 
performance research by drawing on the tenets of social cognitive theory (Bandura, 2015) to theoreti -
cally specify and validate training and job performance. s econd, the study offers empirical evidence that 
will augment the discussion on the effect of training on employee job performance in relation to, per -
haps, mediating and moderating variables. third, this study provides evidence that self-efficacy plays a 
mediating role in the training-performance relationship, and this relationship is also dependent on

organizational politics. Based on this assertion, this study makes a fourth contribution by theorizing that 
the suggested relationships will provide diverse perceptions in understanding the dynamics through 
which training improves job performance. last but not the least, the study focuses on developing econ -
omy, particularly, a frica and ghana to be precise. this will widen the range of empirical inquiries on 
training and the resultant benefits, which have mainly focused on e uropean, american, and a sian con -
texts (haryono et  al., 2020; l yons, 2020; sheeba & christopher, 2020). i t is innovative to focus on the 
public sector of ghana, particularly because performance studies have gradually begin to shift toward 
research in developing economies, including those in a frica (Bonsu et  al., 2022; Mohammed et  al., 2023; 
sakyiwaa et  al., 2020). For example, from the few studies from an a frican perspective (Olonade et  al., 
2020; nsazi, 2013), the case of ghana remains gray; hence, there is a need for more studies to fill this 
void in the literature.
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. the second section presents the theoretical back -
ground and hypothesis development. the third section covers the method; data employed, and study 
design. the fourth section also presents the analysis of the data employed whereas  the fifth section  
discusses the empirical findings. the sixth section presents the conclusions and implications of the study, 
and the final section highlights the limitations and future directions of the study.
2.  Theory and hypothesis
social cognitive theory posits that people take part in intentional influence over their inspiration and that 
whatever a person does in life is dictated by this intentional influence (Bandura, 2015). the theory, there -
fore, argues that in every human institution, self-efficacy convictions are the focal instrument; they are 
conceived to affect everything from inspiration to a fulfilled life (Bandura, 2015). Bandura ( 2015) further 
argued that if people are not convinced that they can accomplish the behavior required to achieve an 
expected goal, they would not participate in that behavior or would exert very little effort. s ocial cognitive 
theory suggests that people are more productive when they are motivated, which happens when they are 
convinced that they can participate in the behaviors required to attain their goals. specifically, according 
to social cognitive theory, people with greater self-efficacy are bound to accept goals, set progressively 
more complex goals, and persevere on goals during challenges. these procedures, at that point, result in 
improved performance (Bandura & l ocke, 2003; locke & latham, 1990). anytime a person has an ambition, 
he is inspired to go through the necessary process, irrespective of the obstacles, to accomplish such ambi -
tions. as indicated by Baron and Kenny ( 1986), because people perform well on their tasks because of their 
motivation to achieve their set goals, goals act partially as mediators.
although most studies and theories on self-efficacy usually concentrate on its positive impact, Bandura 
(2015) opines that in an introductory setting, self-efficacy may negatively affect job productivity. i n a 
preliminary context, Bandura ( 2015) posited that self-doubt may not be bad. For instance, in a discussion 
on athletes, he noted that an athlete who sees him/her to be very effective in his abilities does not have 
much motivation to devote a lot of effort to tiresome preparatory practice in learning tasks. i n this case, 
the level of doubt undoubtedly aids training. hence, he opines that when people have great self-efficacy, 
they might not exert effort in preparation for a future task, because they are convinced that they have 
what it takes to succeed. s ocial cognitive theory postulates that self-efficacy is the fundamental instru -
ment responsible for people’s motivation, productivity, and fulfillment in life (Bandura, 2015). that is to 
say, despite all the training that employees may receive, if they are not motivated by their inspiration to 
fulfill certain things in life that are connected to their role, training will not result in the expected out -
come (performance). a lthough, overall, the theory concentrates on the positive impact of self-efficacy, 
there is some uncertainty regarding the role played by self-efficacy in overall performance.
2.1.  Training and job performance
training is a significant element in improving a firm’s human capital, capabilities, and organizational 
knowledge, thus strengthening its competitive advantage (Febrian et  al., 2016; gyimah et  al., 2020; idris 
et  al., 2020). according to Dessler ( 2006), training improves current and future job performance, as well
<<<PAGE=5>>>

as activities that serve to improve job performance. there are several ways to improve job performance, 
including by providing work training to employees (haryono et  al., 2020). s ome previous scholars (includ -
ing n yaisu et  al., 2017) conclude that training employees has a positive effect on staff job performance. 
this viewpoint stems from the goal-setting theory, which suggests that a minute a difficult task is given, 
the only rational course of action is to attempt and keep at it until it is accomplished, leading to per -
formance (task, adaptive, and contextual). Bandura and c ervone ( 1986) stress that goals perform a stim -
ulating function, as they lead to better performance. a gain, as observed by smith et  al. ( 1990), if the task 
for which a goal is allocated is new to the individual in charge of accomplishing it, they would carefully 
plan to design strategies that would aid them in achieving their goals. Universities are mainly formal and 
thrive in employee training to improve performance. For non-teaching staff of universities to perform 
better, they need to be trained to achieve a competitive advantage. therefore, this study hypothesizes 
the following:
H1: training practices have a significant positive effect on employee performance
2.2.  The direct and mediating roles of self-efficacy
as recognized by social cognitive theory, a strong sense of self-efficacy encourages the achievement of 
personal goals. People with high levels of certainty can handle challenging tasks and critical challenges. 
self-efficacy makes people design challenging goals, stick to them, be more prepared to face failure, and 
regain their motivation after each situation (Bandura, 2012). in addition, self-efficacy helps address vari -
ous phenomena such as changes in behavior, level of reactions, despair, and failure (Bandura, 2015). 
self-efficacy is a significant variable that mediates the effect of dispositional variables on learning per -
formance (lazzara et  al., 2021). i t is likely that people already possess self-efficacy before entering a 
program or gain it in the course of training (s alas & c annon-Bowers, 2001). haccoun and s aks ( 1998) 
suggested that training boosts self-efficacy while self-efficacy mediates the impact of training on training 
results.
Post-training self-efficacy plays two roles. First, it makes people to ponder about their learning out -
comes and arrive at the conclusion that they are “able to do”; and secondly, this knowledge serves as 
motivation to increase a person’s readiness to perform (willingness to do). While haccoun and s aks 
(1998) take a positive stance on the likelihood that training programme designs might essentially result 
in decreasing self-efficacy. this is significant because the structure of the training program (content and 
assimilation difficulty) affects a person’s level of self-efficacy, with effects on the application of training. 
if the content of the training enables the attainment of knowledge, this increases self-efficacy levels and, 
as such, a positive effect on the application of training is possible. i ndividual-level variables (e.g., cogni -
tive ability) play a role in self-efficacy of people (Bandura, 2012). nevertheless, this study argues that 
self-efficacy encompasses the effects of these factors. c onsequently, post-training self-efficacy is per the 
purposes of this study is defined as people’s perceived capacity to act as set by the training program. 
self-efficacy is essential to the learning and development profession because available data demonstrate 
that it is connected to people’s performance ( guerra et  al., 2022). subsequently, self-efficacy has aided 
individuals in learning many new behaviors and an array of work-related skills. For instance, research 
indicates that self-efficacy expectations influence salesforce performance, academic research performance, 
workers’ attendance at work, enlisting people’s achievement in fundamental training, and managers’ 
decision-making capabilities (l yons & Bandura, 2022).
empirically, c anrinus et  al. ( 2012) explored the connections between self-efficacy, work fulfilment, 
motivation, and commitment among teachers. the authors concentrated on how relevant indicators of 
teachers’ perceptions of professional identity (work fulfilment, commitment to work, self-efficacy, and 
alterations in level of motivation) are connected. Based on their analysis, they argue that classroom 
self-efficacy and relationship fulfilment play a major role in influencing the connections between these 
factors. tojjari et  al. ( 2013) also in their studies analyzed the impact of self-efficacy on job satisfaction 
and performance in sports referees in i ran. their study demonstrated that the general self-efficacy of 
sport referees has a significant influence on the intrinsic and extrinsic features of job satisfaction. While
<<<PAGE=6>>>
cOgent BUsiness & ManageMent 5
this effect is not significant for general factors of job satisfaction, it had an impact on their performance. 
in another study based on social cognitive theory, s alman et  al. ( 2016) investigated the effect of 
self-efficacy on workers’ job performance in Pakistan’s health sector and revealed that self-efficacy has a 
strong connection with job performance factors, such as job commitment, job satisfaction, and absen -
teeism. hence, the second hypothesis of this study is as follows:
H a2 : s elf-efficacy has a significant positive effect on employee performance
H2b: s elf-efficacy positively mediates the relationship between training practices and employee performance
2.3.  Moderating role of perceived organisational politics
Politics in an organization represent machinations of personal interest that fit well with the concept of 
the social market (Khan & chaudhary, 2023). the perception of organizational politics depends on an 
individual’s awareness of politics and reactions ( cooper-thomas & Morrison, 2018). Organizational politics 
should not be understood as a concept that is only harmful and can undermine the organization’s ability 
to operate (Khan & chaudhary, 2023). thus, managers must make decisions and implement new meth -
ods to mitigate the adverse effects of politics in the organization. Perceived organizational politics can 
negatively impact job performance outcomes when employees believe that their work environment does 
not support them (noori et  al., 2022). hence, the political climate perceived by members may cause a 
significant difference in the responses of employees toward their role in the organization ( awaah, 2023). 
therefore, when individuals in an organization perceive the environment to be negative, they can reduce 
resources, actions, effective organizational change, job performance, and trust among managers and 
employees (Zhang et  al., 2019).
in ghana, organizational politics can take various forms, such as favoritism, power struggles, and the 
manipulation of information and resources ( awaah, 2023). these political behaviors can have a significant 
impact on employee attitudes towards training and job performance (Zhang et  al., 2019). When employ -
ees perceive that promotions, rewards, and opportunities for growth are based on factors other than 
merit and performance, it can create a sense of unfairness and demotivation ( awaah, 2023). a dditionally, 
organizational politics can create a culture of distrust and competition among employees ( akoto et  al., 
2022; horsey et  al., 2023). this may lead to a lack of enthusiasm for training initiatives and a decrease 
in job performance (noori et  al., 2022).
the literature has indicated that there is a negative relationship between organizational politics, per -
formance, and satisfaction (noori et  al., 2022) as well as loyalty (Riaz et  al., 2023). specifically, a review 
of the literature indicates that the relationship between self-efficacy and job performance is based on 
the mechanistic condition of perceived organizational politics (s alman et  al., 2016 and tojjari et  al., 2013). 
therefore, there is a relationship between self-efficacy and job performance based on perceived organi -
sational politics. thus, the negative organizational politics perceived by an individual leads to less 
self-efficacy and decreases organizational attractiveness to encourage appropriate input (Jabbar et  al., 
2020). therefore, the third hypothesis of this study is as follows:
H3: Perceived organisational politics moderate the role of self-efficacy in the relationship between training and 
job performance.
Based on the above discussion, a theoretical framework for the study is constructed, as shown in 
Figure 1 .
3.  Methods
3.1.  Study context and setting
the non-teaching staff of public universities in Kumasi, the second-largest city in ghana, are selected to 
test our hypothesized model specified above. there are three (3) public universities: Kwame n krumah 
University of s cience and technology (KnUst ), a kenten a ppiah-Menka University of skill training and
<<<PAGE=7>>>
6 c. O. sOMUah et al.
entrepreneurial Development ( aaMUsteD), and Kumasi technical University (K tU). KnUst is the first and 
largest public tertiary institution in Kumasi, the entire a shanti region, and the second oldest institution 
in ghana. KnUst was established in 1951 as the Kumasi c ollege of technology, with the chancellor, 
chairman of the university council, and the vice-chancellor as the main leaders of the institution. the 
akenten a ppiah-Menka University of skills training and entrepreneurial Development ( aaMUsteD), was 
established on a ugust 27, 2020, under a ct 1026 of 2020 of the Parliament of the Republic of ghana. 
aaMUsteD was formed from the c ollege of technology e ducation, Kumasi ( cOlteK) and the c ollege of 
agriculture education ( cagRic), asante-Mampong, which are campuses of the University of education, 
Winneba. the University traces its history to the evolution of c OlteK and cagRic. c OlteK started as a 
technical teachers c ollege ( ttc) in 1966 and later metamorphosed into the Kumasi a dvanced technical 
teachers c ollege (K attc) in 1978. Kumasi technical University was founded in 1954 as the Kumasi 
technical i nstitute and later promoted to a non-tertiary polytechnic rank under the ghana e ducation 
service. the technical University a ct 2016 ( act 1992) upgraded the former Kumasi Polytechnic to the 
present Kumasi technical University. the university has a mission to be a center of experience for tech -
nological and entrepreneurial development.
there are two broad categories of staff in each of the selected institutions: teaching and non-teaching 
staff. While the teaching staff are mainly involved in academic work, the non-teaching staff ensure 
day-to-day administration and management of the university. a dministrative and management issues 
such as staff and student welfare matters, employment and recruitment, and the like are some of the 
key tasks of university non-teaching staff (s arpong-Danquah et  al., 2018). the study population includes 
non-teaching staff of public universities in the a shanti Region. a ccording to the records of the three 
selected institutions, there is a total of 1816 non-teaching staff at the time the inquiries are made. the 
study includes non-teaching staff within lower-level and middle-level management positions in the study 
institutions across gender.
3.2.  Study design and sample
the study uses cross-sectional survey data gathered through a questionnaire and employed both descrip -
tive and inferential study designs for the analysis. specifically, the study design is chosen to help estab -
lish the relationship between three variables: training, performance, self-efficacy, and perceived 
organizational politics (s arantakos, 2005). to determine the representative sample size from the three 
institutions, the Krejcie and Morgan ( 1970) sample size determination formula is utilized and applied to 
each campus center. Krejcie and Morgan’s ( 1970) sample size determination is as follows:
 s X N PP d N X PP= − () ÷− () +− ()
2 22 1 11  (1)
Figure 1.  Hypothesized theoretical Framework.
<<<PAGE=8>>>

where s = required sample size; X2 = the table value of chi-square for one level of freedom at the desired 
confidence level (3.841); n = the population size; P = the population proportion (assumed to be 0.50, since 
this will give the maximum sample size); and d is the degree of accuracy expressed as a proportion (0.05).
after computations, the sample sizes for the respective campus centers are as follows: KnUst (767), 
aaMUsteD (415), and K tU (166), making a total sample size of 936. i n applying a sampling technique 
to enhance representatives, the researcher adopted a proportionate sampling technique to determine 
the proportion of non-teaching staff at each study institution. the proportionate sampling technique is 
given by
 P = ×study respondents
target population sample size. 
after obtaining the sample for each stratum, a systematic sampling technique was employed to 
 identify respondents from a sampling frame (register). i n doing so, the systematic sampling technique 
formula, population
sample size, is used to arrive at the k th term.
after administering questionnaires to all 936 sampled participants from the three selected intuitions, 
370 successfully filled questionnaires are retrieved after several follow-ups and visits. this represents an 
approximately 40% response rate, which is quite good for an empirical study of this nature. table 1  
presents the demographics of the data based on which we justify that the sample size is representative 
of the non-teaching staff of public universities in ghana. hence, the study can make generalizations 
based on the findings.
3.3.  Measurement of variable
the study uses prevailing tested and validated questionnaires in the literature such as a waah ( 2023), 
horsey et  al. ( 2023), hochwarter et  al. ( 2003), Kirkpatrick ( 1996), Pradhan and Jena ( 2017), and noori 
et  al. ( 2022). a ll items on the questionnaire are closed-ended, with the exception of section a

3.4.  Reliability and validity measurement
composite reliability and c ronbach’s alpha reliability tests are employed in this study to estimate the 
consistency (reliability) of the instruments (n kukpornu et  al., 2020). a c ronbach’s alpha coefficient 
greater than 0.7, is enough to accept that the instrument is reliable and good for analysis (hair et  al., 
2019; Jalloh et  al., 2019). a s reported in table 2 , all the factor loadings for each item are significant, 
ranging from 0.599 to 0.872, indicating strong convergent validity. i n addition, a Ve scores are generally 
above the threshold value of 0.5, demonstrating the validity of the instruments. Moreover, it can be 
observed that the composite reliability ( cR) and c ronbach’s alpha values ( ca) are also generally higher 
than the minimum cutoff point of 0.7, which also illustrates strong scale reliability.
confirmatory factor analysis assessing the performance of the six factors suggests that the model 
provides a good fit to the data. Basing on the criterion as suggested by Kline (2004) and hair et  al. 
(2019) that a good fit model should have a normed chi-square (X 2/df ) of less than 5 as well as a com -
parative fit index ( cFi) above 0.90; a standardized root mean square residual (sRMR) close to .04; and a 
root mean square error of approximation (RMsea ) less than 0.08, we can conclude that the model is a 
good fit. a gain, the fitness of the sub-models in the six-factor model further emphasized the overall 
fitness of the model used in this study ( table 3 ). thus, the model thoroughly accounts for all the dynam -
ics and characteristics inherent in the data, and is therefore suitable for further analysis. a ll model fit 
indices for each construct exceed the standard criteria and demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed 
model to analyze the connection between training, self-efficacy, organizational politics, and employee 
performance.
4.  Results
Descriptive and correlation analyses (mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients) indicating 
the scope and degree of association of all the variables show that training had a significant positive 
relationship with self-efficacy and job performance ( r = 0.139, p < 0,05; r = 0.258, p < 0.01). although the 
association between training and organizational politics is positive, it is insignificant at the 5% signif -
icance level. Meanwhile, there is a significant positive association between organizational politics and 
job performance ( r = 0.133, p < 0.05). table 4  indicates that it is possible to test the hypotheses (h1 
– h3).
4.1.  Baseline (direct) SEM regression results
table 5  presents the estimates of the effect of training and self-efficacy and organizational politics on 
three indicators (task, contextual, and adaptive) of performance under each of the three models: (1), (2), 
and (3). there is a significant positive effect of training on adaptive performance (β = β = .24, p < 1%), as 
observed in model (3). however, the results reveal that there is no statistically significant relationship 
between training and task and contextual performance, as reported by models (1) and (2). c oncerning 
the effect of organizational politics, there is a positive significant effect on task and contextual perfor -
mance at 1% and 5% (β = .141, p < 1%, β = .08, p < 5%), respectively. therefore, it can be conclude that 
organizational politics are relevant for increasing both task and contextual performance. On the contrary, 
there is no indication that organizational politics has an effect on employees’ adaptive performance, even 
at the 10% significance level, as observed in model (3) [β = -.006, p > 10%]. however, for the relationship 
between self-efficacy and job performance, all results from the three models indicated a significant pos -
itive relationship at the 1% significance level. thus, self-efficacy generally improves employee 
performance.

4.2.  Mediation—moderation results
this study further investigates whether organizational politics moderated the effect of training and 
self-efficacy on performance. the results from Model (1) indicate that organizational politics moderates 
the effect of self-efficacy on task performance (β = −.012, p < 1%), but not the relationship between 
training and task performance (β = .01, p > 10%, ns). i n Model (2), the effects of both training (β = .049, 
p < 5%) and self-efficacy (β = −.07, p < 1%) on contextual performance are moderated by organizational 
politics. On the other hand, Model (3) reports that the interaction of organizational politics and training 
(β = −.044, p > 10%, ns) does not have any statistical effect on adaptive performance. i n contrast, the 
results show that the interaction between organizational politics and self-efficacy (β = −.052, p < 10%)

has a small but significant negative effect on adaptive performance ( table 5 ). Figures 2–5 show a graph -
ical representation of these relationships.
the mediating role of self-efficacy in the relationship between training and performance measures is 
then examined with and without the moderating effect of organizational politics. i t can be observes 
from table 6  that self-efficacy mediates the effects of training on adaptive, task, and contextual perfor -
mance. the nature of the mediation effect is identified to be full with the training-task and 
training-contextual performance relationships but partially mediates the effect of training on adaptive 
performance (0.10, 95% bias-corrected ci [0.024 0.170], 0.11 at a 95% bias-corrected ci [0.027 0.178], 
-0.091 at a 95% bias-corrected ci [-0.159 -0 .024], respectively). there is no indication that self-efficacy 
mediates the effect of organizational politics on performance measures. Focusing on the moderated 
mediation effect of self-efficacy, it can be observed that controlling for the effect of organizational poli -
tics does not instigate any significant change in the mediating role of self-efficacy. thus, organizational 
politics do not moderate the mediation effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between training and

on performance measures at various levels of organizational performance.
5.  Discussion of findings
the findings from the direct regression results indicate that training had a significant positive effect on 
adaptive performance against task and contextual performance. this implies that an enhancement in 
the training programs for the university staff, particularly non-teaching staff, and increases the capacity 
of the staff to adapt to conditions within the working environment rather than enabling them to 
improve their task and contextual performance. Based on this result, hypothesis H1 is supported. this 
finding is in line with Wamwayi et  al. ( 2016), who find that training needs appraisal, length of training, 
training method, and training feedback positively affect the productivity of non-teaching employees in 
their study of public universities in Kenya. i n other words, for universities to improve the productivity 
of their staff in order to gain competitive advantage, training programs should be highly considered in 
any decision aimed at driving changes and modifications in the structure and process of business at 
universities. a ccording to the literature, a fast-paced digital world requires employees to have the 
knowledge, skills, and capabilities required to adapt to new processes and production methods. through 
training, the findings of this study suggest that non-teaching staff will be able to acquire the

capabilities needed to fuel their drive to adapt and use new processes and systems within the univer -
sity environment.
Regarding the mediating role of self-efficacy in the relationship between training practices and job 
performance, the results indicate that the nature of the mediating role of self-efficacy is dependent on 
the dimension of performance under investigation. c oncerning the impact of training on adaptive per -
formance, the findings of this study suggest partial mediation of self-efficacy. however, for task and

contextual performance indicators, the results of this study suggest that self-efficacy fully mediates the 
effect of training on task performance. this implies that training can only lead to higher task and con -
textual performance because there is a resultant increment in the self-efficacy of the non-teaching staff. 
this confirms the findings of haccoun and s aks ( 1998), which conclude a similar mediating effect of 
self-efficacy on the relationship between training and employee performance. the findings further indi -
cate that a higher level of self-efficacy is required to improve task, contextual, and adaptive performance; 
thus, hypotheses H a2 and H b2 are all supported. a gain, tojjari et  al. ( 2013) report that the self-efficacy of 
sports referees is a significant contributor to the intrinsic and extrinsic elements of job satisfaction.

Workers with high self-efficacy usually work hard to learn how to carry out new tasks because they are 
sure that their hard work will be successful. On the other hand, workers with low self-efficacy might 
exert less effort to learn and perform complex tasks because they are unsure that their efforts would be 
successful.
We observe that organizational politics do not have a statistically significant positive effect on 
task and contextual performance, but not on adaptive performance. notwithstanding this mixed 
effect, evidence indicates that it negatively moderates the effect of self-efficacy on task, contex -
tual, and adaptive performance. thus, H3, which states that the path from self-efficacy to perfor -
mance outcomes is leveraged by organizational politics, is strongly supported. however, this study 
did not find any evidence that organizational politics moderated the effect of training on 
self-efficacy.
however, we find that the effect of training on contextual performance can be moderated by the 
existence of organizational politics. this result therefore demonstrates the varied effect of organiza -
tional politics at the workplace and is indicative of the fact that stakeholders handle organizational 
politics with some level of circumspection and tone; the mixed findings concord with the study by 
Ugwu et  al. ( 2014), who argue that bad political behavior negatively influences the productivity of 
workers and decreases overall organizational productivity, while great political behavior positively 
influences the performance of workers and raises organizational productivity. i n addition, a bbas and 
Raja ( 2014) and Vigoda- gadot (2007) report that the perception of organizational politics has a mixed 
effect on performance.
6.  Conclusion and implications
6.1.  Conclusion
this study aims to examine the role that self-efficacy plays in enhancing the benefit of training on employees’ 
job performance in the organization. additionally, the study further investigates how organizational politics 
influences self-efficacy in its mediation role in the relationship between training and job performance. the 
structural equation modeling technique is employed to analyze the data with the help of a survey question -
naire from 370 non-teaching staff of public universities in Kumasi, ghana, which are randomly sampled. We 
suggest that job training practices can influence employee performance due to the resultant improvement in 
self-efficacy. this work highlights that training on its own does not necessarily result in an increment in the 
job performance of non-teaching staff, unless self-efficacy is actualized or boosted.
6.2.  Theoretical implications
theoretically, the current study has pointed out the heterogeneous effect of organizational politics 
and how an uncontrolled political climate within the workplace can be harmful to employees’  
Figure 9.  Plot of the Moderation of o rganisational Politics on training – a daptive Performance Relationship.

self-efficacy and extending their performance on the job. On its own, organizational politics is iden -
tified as a boosting task and contextual performance; however, it minimizes the effect of self-efficacy 
on task and contextual performance. therefore, it can produce net harm or benefit depending on 
the direct effect size on performance measures (particularly task and contextual performance). this 
calls for circumspection of the extent to which politics are practiced and encouraged at the work -
place, particularly among non-teaching staff. Furthermore, the study highlighted the significance of 
training in boosting the adaptive performance of non-teaching staff. this emphasizes the critical role 
that training plays in managing change and motivating employees to take up new challenges and 
improve the status quo in the workplace. the study therefore theorizes that training targeted at 
improving skills, competence, and instilling a sense of self-belief among workers is vital for improv -
ing employee performance.
6.3.  Practical and managerial implications
Our findings have the following implications for management and practice. First, there is a need for 
managers (university management) to periodically build workers’ capacity to improve their level of 
self-efficacy. Based on the result that training increases self-efficacy, which enhances work outcomes, 
we again recommend that human resource managers concentrate on training regimes that not only 
improve the task capacity of the working staff, but also build their level of self-efficacy. i n this regard, 
training that requires mentorship and coaching or job training is recommended compared with train -
ing through symposiums and conferences. through coaching or mentoring, workers receive advice and 
support from supervisors, which is likely to enhance self-efficacy. Finally, employers must put systems 
and measures in place to balance the level of politics in the workplace. Politics itself is not a bad 
thing; the problem is that when it is unchecked, it negatively impacts employees’ output, which may 
accumulate and jeopardize work outcomes. there is a need for authorities to handle organizational 
politics at some level of circumspection and tact. therefore, it is important for every political maneuver 
to be regulated.
7.  Limitation and further studies
this study had some limitations that need to be acknowledged. the first issue to recognize as far as the 
limitations of the study are concerned is the complexity of job performance. Job performance is com -
plex, multi-faceted, and underpinned by several variables; the researcher concentrates on only two main -
stream variables directly related to the research problem and topic under study. a gain, the use of only 
closed-ended items in collecting the data made it impossible for respondents to provide unsolicited 
responses. Moreover, although the use of triangulation in collecting research data significantly improves 
the validity of the data, questionnaires are the only instrument used to collect data. Future studies can 
take the opportunity and include more variables that may affect job performance and examine their 
relationship. Furthermore, future studies can take advantage of triangulation in data collection by includ -
ing other designs, such as interviews and other qualitative means, in addition to the quantitative design 
employed in the current study.
