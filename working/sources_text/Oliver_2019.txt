The dos and don’ts of inﬂuencing policy: a
systematic review of advice to academics
Kathryn Oliver 1 & Paul Cairney2
ABSTRACT
Many academics have strong incentives to inﬂuence policymaking, but may not know where
to start. We searched systematically for, and synthesised, the‘how to’ advice in the academic
peer-reviewed and grey literatures. We condense this advice into eight main recommenda-
tions: (1) Do high quality research; (2) make your research relevant and readable; (3)
understand policy processes; (4) be accessible to policymakers: engage routinely,ﬂexible,
and humbly; (5) decide if you want to be an issue advocate or honest broker; (6) build
relationships (and ground rules) with policymakers; (7) be‘entrepreneurial’ or ﬁnd someone
who is; and (8) reﬂect continuously: should you engage, do you want to, and is it working?
This advice seems like common sense. However, it masks major inconsistencies, regarding
different beliefs about the nature of the problem to be solved when using this advice. Fur-
thermore, if not accompanied by critical analysis and insights from the peer-reviewed lit-
erature, it could provide misleading guidance for people new to thisﬁeld.
Introduction
M
any academics have strong incentives to inﬂuence policymaking, as extrinsic moti-
vation to show the‘impact’of their work to funding bodies, or intrinsic motivation to
make a difference to policy. However, they may not know where to start (Evans and
Cvitanovic, 2018). Although many academics have personal experience, or have attended impact
training, there is a limited empirical evidence base to inform academics wishing to create impact.
Although there is a signiﬁcant amount of commentary about the processes and contexts affecting
evidence use in policy and practice (Head, 2010; Whitty, 2015), the relative importance of
different factors on achieving‘impact’ has not been established (Haynes et al.,2011; Douglas,
2012; Wilkinson, 2017). Nor have common understandings of the concepts of‘use’or ‘impact’
themselves been developed. As pointed out by one of our reviewers, even empirical and con-
ceptual papers often routinely fail to deﬁne or unpack these terms— with some exceptions
(Weiss, 1979; Nutley et al.,2007; Parkhurst, 2017). Perhaps because of this theoretical paucity,
there are few empirical evaluations of strategies to increase the uptake of evidence in policy and
practice (Boaz et al., 2011), and those that exist tend not to offer advice for the individual
academic. How then, should academics engage with policy?
There are substantial numbers of blogs, editorials, commentaries, which provide tips and
suggestions for academics on how best to increase their impact, how to engage most effectively,
or similar topics. We condense this advice into 8 main tips, to: produce high quality research,

make it relevant, understand the policy processes in which you
engage, be accessible to policymakers, decide if you want to offer
policy advice, build networks, be‘entrepreneurial’, and reﬂect on
your activities.
Taken at face value, much of this advice is common sense,
perhaps because it is inevitably bland and generic. When we
interrogate it in more detail, we identify major inconsistencies in
advice regarding: (a) what counts as good evidence, (b) how best
to communicate it, (c) what policy engagement is for, (d) if
engagement is to frame problems or simply measure them
according to an existing frame, (e) how far to go to be useful and
inﬂuential, (f) if you need and can produce ground rules or trust
(g) what entrepreneurial means, and (h) how much choice
researchers should have to engage in policymaking or not.
These inconsistencies reﬂect different beliefs about the nature
of the problem to be solved when using this advice, which derive
from unresolved debates about the nature and role of science and
policy. We focus on three dilemmas that arise from engagement
— for example, should you‘co-produce’ research and policy and
give policy recommendations?— and reﬂect on wider systemic
issues, such as the causes of unequal rewards and punishments for
engagement. Perhaps the biggest dilemma reﬂects the fact that
engagement is a career choice, not an event: how far should you
go to encourage the use of evidence in policy if you began your
career as a researcher? These debates are rehearsed more fully and
regularly in the peer-reviewed literature (Hammersley,2013;d e
Leeuw et al.,2008; Fafard, 2015; Smith and Stewart,2015; Smith
and Stewart, 2017; Oliver and Faul,2018), which have spawned
narrative reviews of policy theory and systematic reviews of the
literature on the‘barriers and facilitators’to the use of evidence in
policy. For example, we know from policy studies that policy-
makers seek ways to act decisively, not produce more evidence
until it speaks for itself; and, there is no simple way to link the
supply of evidence to its demand in a policymaking system (see
Cairney and Kwiatkowski, 2017). We draw on this literature to
highlight inconsistencies and weaknesses in the advice offered to
academics.
We assess how useful the‘how to’ advice is for academics, to
what extent the advice reﬂects the reality of policymaking and
evidence use (based on our knowledge of the empirical and
theoretical literatures, described more fully in Cairney and Oliver,
2018) and explore the implications of any mismatch between the
two. We map and interrogate the‘how to’advice, by comparing it
with the empirical and theoretical literature on creating impact,
and on the policymaking context more broadly. We use these
literatures to highlight key choices and tensions in engaging with
policymakers, and signpost more useful, informed advice for
academics on when, how, and if to engage with policymakers.
Methods: a systematic review of the‘how to’ literature
Systematic review is a method to synthesise diverse evidence types
on a clear de ﬁned problem (Petticrew and Roberts, 2008).
Although most commonly associated with statistical methods to
aggregate effect sizes (more accurately called meta-analyses),
systematic reviews can be conducted on any body of written
evidence, including grey or unpublished literature (Tyndall,
2008). All systematic reviews take steps to be transparent about
the decisions made, the methods used to identify relevant evi-
dence, and how this was synthesised to be transparent, replicable
and exhaustive (resources allowing) (Gough et al., 2012). Pri-
marily they involve clearly de ﬁned searches, inclusion and
exclusion processes, and a quality assessment/synthesis process.
We searched three major electronic databases (Scopus, Web of
Science, Google Scholar) and selected websites (e.g., ODI,
Research Fortnight, Wonkhe) and journals (including Evidence
and Policy, Policy and Politics, Research Policy), using a com-
bination of terms. Terms such as evidence and impact were tested
to search for articles explaining how to better‘use’ evidence, or
how to create policy‘impact’. After testing, the search was con-
ducted by combining the following terms, tailored to each data-
base: ((evidence or science or scientist or researchers or impact),
(help or advi* or tip* or "how to" or relevan*)) policy* OR
practic* OR government* OR parliament*). We checked studies
on full text where available and added them to a database for
data-extraction. We conducted searches between June 30th and
August 3rd 2018. We identiﬁed studies for data extraction when
they covered these areas: Tips for researchers, tips for policy-
makers, types of useful research / characteristics of useful
research, and other factors.
We included academic, policy and grey publications which
offered advice to academics or policymakers on how to engage
better with each other. We did not include: studies which
explored the factors leading to evidence use, general commen-
taries on the roles of academics, or empirical analyses of the
various initiatives, interventions, structures and roles of aca-
demics and researchers in policy (unless they offered primary
data and tips on how to improve); book reviews; or, news reports.
However, we use some of these publications to re ﬂect more
broadly on the historical changes to the academic-policy
relationship.
We included 86 academic and non-academic publications in
this review (see Table 1 for an overview). Although we found
reports dating back to the 1950s on how governments and pre-
sidents (predominantly UK/US) do or do not use scienti ﬁc
advisors (Marshall, 1980; Bondi, 1982; Mayer, 1982; Lepkowski,
1984; Koshland Jr. et al.,1988; Sy, 1989; Krige, 1990; Srinivasan,
2000) and committees (Sapolsky, 1968; Wolﬂe, 1968; Editorial,
1972; Walsh,1973; Nichols,1988; Young and Jones,1994; Lawler,
1997; Masood, 1999; Morgan et al., 2001; Oakley et al., 2003;
Allen et al. 2012). The earliest publication included was from
1971 (Aurum, 1971). Thirty-four were published in the last two
years, reﬂecting ever increasing interest in how academics can
increase their impact on policy. Although some academic pub-
lications are included, we mainly found blogs, letters, and edi-
torials, often in high-impact publications such as Cell, Science,
Nature and the Lancet. Many were opinion pieces by people
moving between policy ofﬁcials and academic roles, or blogs by
and for early career researchers on how to establish impactful
careers.
The advice is very consistent over the last 80 years; and
between disciplines as diverse as gerontology, ecology, and eco-
nomics. As noted in an earlier systematic review, previous studies
have identiﬁed hundreds of factors which act as barriers to the
uptake of evidence in policy (Oliver et al., 2014), albeit

unsupported by empirical evidence. Many of the advisory pieces
address these barriers, assuming rather than demonstrating that
their simple advice will help ease theﬂow of evidence into policy.
The pieces also often cite each other, even to the extent of using
the exact phrasing. Therefore, the combination of previous aca-
demic reviews with our survey of‘how to’ advice reinforces our
sense of ‘saturation’, in which we have identiﬁed all of the most
relevant advice (available in written form). In our synthesis, using
thematic analysis, we condense these tips into 8 main themes.
Then, we analyse these tips critically, with reference to wider
discussions in the peer-reviewed literature.
Eight key tips on‘how to inﬂuence policy’
Do high quality research. Researchers are advised to conduct
high-quality, robust research (Boyd, 2013; Whitty, 2015; Doc-
quier, 2017; Eisenstein, 2017) and provide it in a way that is
timely, policy relevant, and easy to understand, but not at the
expense of accuracy (Havens, 1992; Norse, 2005; Simera et al.,
2010; Bilotta et al.,2015; Kerr et al.,2015; Olander et al.2017;
POST, 2017). Speciﬁc research methods, metrics and/or models
should be used (Aguinis et al. 2010), with systematic reviews/
evidence synthesis considered particularly useful for policymakers
(Lavis et al., 2003; Sutherland, 2013; Caird et al., 2015; Ander-
mann et al.,2016; Donnelly et al.,2018; Topp et al.,2018), and
often also randomised controlled trials, properly piloted and
evaluated (Walley et al.,2018). Truly interdisciplinary research is
required to identify new perspectives (Chapman et al., 2015;
Marshall and Cvitanovic, 2017) and explore the “practical sig-
niﬁcance” of research for policy and practice (Aguinis et al.2010).
Academics must communicate scienti ﬁc uncertainty and the
strengths and weaknesses of a piece of research (Norse, 2005;
Aguinis et al., 2010; Tyler, 2013; Game et al.,2015; Sutherland
and Burgman, 2015), and be trained to“estimate probabilities of
events, quantities or model parameters” (Sutherland and Burg-
man, 2015). Be ‘policy-relevant’ (NCCPE, 2018; Maddox, 1996;
Green et al., 2009; Farmer, 2010; Kerr et al., 2015; Colglazier,
2016; Tesar et al.,2016; Echt,2017b; Fleming and Pyenson,2017;
Olander et al.,2017; POST,2017) (although this is rarely deﬁned).
Two exceptions include the advice for research programmes to be
embedded within national and regional governmental pro-
grammes (Walley et al., 2018) and for researchers to provide
policymakers with models estimating the harms and beneﬁts of
different policy options (Basbøll,2018) (Topp et al.,2018).
Communicate well: make your research relevant and readable.
Academics should engage in more effective dissemination,
(NCCPE, 2018; Maddox, 1996; Green et al.,2009; Farmer, 2010;
Kerr et al.,2015; Colglazier,2016; Tesar et al.,2016; Echt,2017b;
Fleming and Pyenson, 2017; Olander et al. 2017; POST, 2017),
make data public, (Malakoff,2017), and provide clear summaries
and syntheses of problems and solutions (Maybin,2016). Use a
range of outputs (social media, blogs, policy briefs), to make sure
that policy actors can contact you with follow up questions
(POST, 2017) (Parry-Davies and Newell,2014), and to write for
generalist, but not ignorant readers (Hillman,2016). Avoid jargon
but don’t over-simplify (Farmer, 2010; Goodwin, 2013); make
simple and deﬁnitive statements (Brumley, 2014), and commu-
nicate complexity (Fischoff,2015; Marshall and Cvitanovic,2017)
(Whitty, 2015).
Some blogs advise academics to use established storytelling
techniques to persuade policymakers of a course of action or
better communicate scientiﬁc ideas. Produce good stories based
on emotional appeals or humour to expand and engage your
audience (Evans, 2013; Fischoff, 2015; Docquier,2017; Petes and
Meyer, 2018). Jones and Crow develop a point-by-point guide to
creating a narrative through scene-setting, casting characters,
establishing a plot, and equating the moral with a‘solution to the
policy problem’(Jones and Crow,2017; Jones and Crow,2018).
Understand policy processes, policymaking context, and key
actors. Academics are advised to get to know how policy works,
and in particular to accept that the normative technocratic ideal
of ‘evidence-based’ policymaking does not reﬂect the political
nature of decision-making (Tyler, 2013; Echt, 2017a). Policy
decisions are ultimately taken by politicians on behalf of con-
stituents, and technological proposals are only ever going to be
part of a solution (Eisenstein,2017). Some feel that science should
hold a privileged position in policy (Gluckman,2014; Reed and
Evely, 2016) but many recognise that research is unlikely to
translate directly into an off-the-shelf ready-to-wear policy pro-
posal (Tyler,2013; Gluckman,2014; Prehn,2018), and that policy
rarely changes overnight (Marshall and Cvitanovic,2017). Being
pragmatic and managing one ’s expectations about the likely
impact of research on policy— which bears little resemblance to
the ‘policy cycle’— is advised (Sutherland and Burgman, 2015;
Tyler, 2013).
Second, learn the basics, such as the difference between the role
of government and parliament, and between other types of
policymakers (Tyler, 2013). Note that your policy audience is
likely to change on a yearly basis if not more frequently (Hillman,
2016); that they have busy and constrained lives (Lloyd,2016;
Docquier, 2017; Prehn,2018) and their own career concerns and
pathways (Lloyd, 2016; Docquier, 2017; Prehn, 2018). Do not
guess what might work; take the time to listen and learn from
policy colleagues (Datta,2018).
Third, learn to recognise broader policymaking dynamics,
paying particular attention to changing policy priorities (Fischoff,
2015; Cairney,2017). Academics are good at placing their work in
the context of the academic literature, but also need to situate it in
the “political landscape” (Himmrich, 2016). To do so means
taking the time to learn what, when, where and who to inﬂuence
(NCCPE, 2018; Marshall and Cvitanovic,2017; Tilley et al.,2017)
and getting to know audiences (Jones and Crow,2018); learning
about, and maximising use of established ways to engage, such as
in advisory committees and expert panels (Gluckman,2014; Pain,
2014; Malakoff, 2017; Hayes and Wilson, 2018) (Pain, 2014).
Persistance and patience is advised— sticking at it, and changing
strategy if it is not working (Graffy,1999; Tilley et al.,2017).
Be ‘accessible’ to policymakers: engage routinely,ﬂexibly, and
humbly. Prehn uses the phrase ‘professional friends’, which
encapsulates vague but popular concepts such as‘build trust’and
‘develop good relationships’ (Farmer, 2010; Kerr et al., 2015;
Prehn, 2018). Building and maintaining long-term relationships
takes effort, time and commitment (Goodwin, 2013; Maybin,
2016), can be easily damaged. It can take time to become estab-
lished as a “trusted voice” (Goodwin, 2013) and may require a
commitment to remaining non-partisan (Morgan et al. 2001).
Therefore, build routine engagement on authentic relationships,
developing a genuine rapport by listening and responding
(Goodwin, 2013; Jo Clift Consulting, 2016; Petes and Meyer,
2018). Some suggest developing leadership and communication
skills, but with reference to listening and learning (Petes and
Meyer, 2018; Topp et al.,2018); Adopting a respectful, helpful,
and humble demeanour, recognising that while academics are
authorities on the evidence, we may not be the appropriate people
to describe or design policy options (Nichols,1972; Knottnerus
and Tugwell,2017) (although many disagree (Morgan et al.,2001;
Morandi, 2009)). Behave courteously by acting professionally
(asking for feedback; responding promptly; following up meetings

and conversations swiftly) (NCCPE, 2018; Goodwin, 2013;J o
Clift Consulting, 2016). Several commentators also reference the
idea of ‘two cultures’ of policy and research (Shergold, 2011),
which have their own language, practices and values (Goodwin,
2013). Learning to speak this language would enable researchers
to better understand all that is said and unsaid in interactions (Jo
Clift Consulting, 2016).
Decide if you want to be an‘issue advocate’ or ‘honest broker’.
Reﬂecting on accessibility should prompt researchers to consider
how to draw the line between providing information or recom-
mendations. One possibility is for researchers to simply dis-
seminate their research honestly, clearly, and in a timely fashion,
acting as an‘honest broker’of the evidence base (Pielke,2007). In
this mode, other actors may pick up and use evidence to inﬂuence
policy in a number of ways— shaping the debate, framing issues,
problematizing the construction of solutions and issues,
explaining the options (Nichols,1972; Knottnerus and Tugwell,
2017)— while researchers seek to remain‘neutral’. Another option
is to recommend speciﬁc policy options or describe the impli-
cations for policy based on their research (Morgan et al.,2001;
Morandi, 2009), perhaps by storytelling to indicate a preferred
course of action (Evans, 2013; Fischoff, 2015; Docquier, 2017;
Petes and Meyer, 2018). However, the boundary between these
two options is very difﬁcult to negotiate or identify in practice,
particularly since policymakers often value candid judgements
and opinions from people they trust, rather than new research
(Maybin, 2016).
Build relationships (and ground rules) with policymakers .
Getting to know policymakers better and building longer term
networks (Chapman et al., 2015; Evans and Cvitanovic, 2018)
could give researchers better access to opportunities to shape
policy agendas (Colglazier,2016; Lucey et al.,2017; Tilley et al.,
2017), give themselves more credibility within the policy arena
(Prehn, 2018), help researchers to identify the correct policy
actors or champions to work with (Echt, 2017a), and provide
better insight into policy problems (Chapman et al.,2015; Col-
glazier, 2016; Lucey et al.,2017; Tilley et al.,2017). Working with
policymakers as early as possible in the process helps develop
shared interpretations of the policy problem (Echt,2017b; Tyler,
2017) and agreement on the purpose of research (Shergold,2011).
Co-designing, or otherwise doing research-for-policy together is
widely held to be morally, ethically, and practically one of the best
ways to achieve the elusive goal of getting evidence into policy
(Sebba, 2011; Green, 2016; Eisenstein, 2017). Engaging publics
more generally is also promoted (Chapman et al., 2015).
Relationship-building activities require major investment and
skills, and often go unrecognised (Prehn,2018), but may offer the
most likely route to get evidence into policy (Sebba,2011; Green,
2016; Eisenstein, 2017). Initially, researchers can use blogs and
social media (Brumley,2014; POST, 2017) to increase their vis-
ibility to the policy community, combined with networking and
direct approaches to policy actors (Tyler,2013).
One of the few pieces built on a case study of impact argued
that academics should build coalitions of allies, but also engage
political opponents, and learn how toﬁght for their ideas (Coffait,
2017). However, collaboration can also lead to con ﬂict and
reputational damage (De Kerckhove et al.,2015). Therefore, when
possible, academics should produce ground rules acceptable to
academics and policymakers. They should be honest and
thoughtful about how, when, and why to engage; and recognise
the labour and resources required for successful engagement
(Boaz et al.,2018). Successful engagement may require all parties
to agree about processes, including ethics, consent, and
conﬁdentiality, and outputs, including data, intellectual property
(De Kerckhove et al., 2015; Game et al., 2015; Hutchings and
Stenseth, 2016). The organic development of these networks and
contacts takes time and effort, and should be recognised as assets,
particularly when offered new contacts by colleagues (Evans and
Cvitanovic, 2018; Boaz et al.,2018)
Be
‘entrepreneurial’ or ﬁnd someone who is. Much of the‘how
to’ advice projects an image of a daring, persuasive scientist,
comfortable in policy environments and always available when
needed (Datta, 2018), by using mentors to build networks, or
through ‘cold calling’ (Evans and Cvitanovic,2018). Some ideas
and values need to be fought for if they are to achieve dominance
(Coffait, 2017; Docquier, 2017), and multiple strategies may be
required, from leveraging trust in academics to advocating more
generally for evidence based policy (Garrett,2018). Academics are
advised to develop“media-savvy” skills (Sebba, 2011), learn how
to “sell the sizzle ”(Farmer, 2010), become able to “convince
people who think differently that shared action is possible, ”
(Fischoff, 2015), but also be pragmatic, by identifying real, tan-
gible impacts and delivering them (Reed and Evely,2016). Such a
range of requirements may imply that being constantly available,
and becoming part of the scenery, makes it more likely for a
researcher to be the person to hand in an hour of need (Goodwin,
2013). Or, it could prompt a researcher to recognise their relative
inability to be persuasive, and to hire a‘knowledge broker’to act
on their behalf (Marshall and Cvitanovic,2017; Quarmby,2018).
Reﬂect continuously: should you engage, do you want to, and
is it working?. Academics may be a goodﬁt in the policy arena if
they ‘want to be in real world’, ‘enjoy ﬁnding solutions to complex
problems’(Echt, 2017a; Petes and Meyer,2018), or are driven‘by
a passion greater than simply adding another item to your CV’
(Burgess, 2005). They should be genuinely motivated to take part
in policy engagement, seeing it as a valuable exercise in its own
right, as opposed to something instrumental to merely improve
the stated impact of research (Goodwin, 2013). For example,
scientists can “engage more productively in boundary work,
which is de ﬁned as the ways in which scientists construct,
negotiate, and defend the boundary between science and policy”
(Rose, 2015). They can converse with policymakers about how
science and scientiﬁc careers are affected by science policy, as a
means of promoting more useful support within government
(Pain, 2014). Or, they can use teaching to get students involved at
an early stage in their careers, to train a new generation of
impact-ready entrepreneurs (Hayes and Wilson, 2018). Such a
profound requirement of one ’s time should prompt constant
reﬂection and reﬁnement of practice. It is hard to know what our
impact may be or how to sustain it (Reed and Evely, 2016).
Therefore, academics who wish to engage must learn and reﬂect
on the consequences of their actions (Datta,2018; Topp et al.,
2018).
The wider literature on the wider policymaking context. Our
observation of this advice is that it is rather vague, very broad,
and each theme contains a diversity of opinions. We also argue
that much of this advice is based on misunderstandings about
policy processes, and the roles of researchers and policymakers.
We summarise these misunderstandings below (see Table2 for an
overview), by drawing a wider range of sources such as policy
studies literature (Cairney, 2016) and a systematic review of
factors inﬂuencing evidence use in policy (Oliver et al.,2014), to
identify the wider context in which to understand and use these
tips. We also contextualise these discussions in the broader evi-
dence and policy/practice literature.

Firstly, there is no consensus overwhat counts as good evidence
for policy (Oliver and de Vocht,2015), and thereforehow best to
communicate good evidence. While we can probably agree what
constitutes high quality research within eachﬁeld, the criteria we
use to assess it in many disciplines (such as generalisability and
methodological rigour) have far lower salience for policymakers
(Hammersley, 2013; Locock and Boaz,2004). They do not adhere
to the scientiﬁc idea of a‘knowledge deﬁcit’ in which our main
collective aim is to reduce policymaker uncertainty by producing
more of the best scientiﬁc evidence (Crow and Jones, 2018).
Rather, evidence garners credibility, legitimacy and usefulness
through its connections to individuals, networks and topical
issues (Cash et al.,2003; Boaz et al.,2015; Oliver and Faul,2018).
One way in which to understand the practical outcome of this
distinction is to consider the profound consequences arising from
the ways in which policymakers address their‘bounded rationality’
(Simon, 1976; Cairney and Kwiatkowski,2017). Individuals seek
cognitive shortcuts to avoid decision-making ‘paralysis’— when
faced with an overwhelming amount of possibly-relevant
information— and allow them to process information efﬁciently
enough to make choices (Gigerenzer and Selten, 2001). They
combine ‘rational’ shortcuts, including trust in expertise and
scientiﬁc sources, and ‘irrational’ shortcuts, to use their beliefs,
emotions, habits, and familiarity with issues to identify policy
problems and solutions (see Haidt,2001; Kahneman,2011; Lewis,
2013; Baumgartner, 2017; Jones and Thomas,2017; Sloman and
Fernbach, 2017). Therefore, we need to understand how they use
such shortcuts to interpret their world, pay attention to issues,
deﬁne issues as policy problems, and become more or less
receptive to proposed solutions. In this scenario, effective policy
actors—
including advocates of research evidence— frame evidence
to address the many ways to interpret policy problems (Cairney,
2016; Wellstead et al.2018) and compete to draw attention to one
‘image’ of a problem and one feasible solution at the expense of
the competition (Kingdon and Thurber, 1984; Majone, 1989;
Baumgartner and Jones, 1993; Zahariadis, 2007). This debate
determines the demand for evidence.
Secondly, there is little empirical guidance onhow to gain the
wide range of skills that researchers and policymakers need, to
act collectively to address policymaking complexity, including
to: produce evidence syntheses, manage expert communities,
‘co-produce ’ research and policy with a wide range of
stakeholders, and be prepared to offer policy recommendations
as well as scientiﬁca d v i c e( T o p pe ta l . ,2018). The list of skills
includes the need to understand the policy processes in which
you engage, such as by understanding the constituent parts of
policymaking environments (John, 2003,p .4 8 8 ;( C a i r n e ya n d
Heikkila, 2014), p. 364–366) and their implications for the use
of evidence:
● Many actors make and inﬂuence policy in many ‘venues’
across many levels and types of government. Therefore, it is
difﬁcult to know where the‘action’is.
● Each venue has its own ‘institutions’, or rules and norms
maintained by many policymaking organisations. These rules
can be formal and well understood, or informal, unwritten,
and difﬁcult to grasp (Ostrom, 2007a, 2007b). Therefore, it
takes time to learn the rules before being able to use them
effectively.
● These ‘rules of the game’ extend to policy networks, or the
relationships between policymakers and inﬂuencers, many of
which develop in ‘subsystems’ and contain relatively small
groups of specialists. One can be a privileged insider in one
venue but excluded from another, and the outcome may relate
minimally to evidence.
● Networks often reproduce dominant ‘ideas’ regarding the
nature of the policy problem, the language we use to describe
it, and the political feasibility of potential solutions (Kingdon
and Thurber, 1984). Therefore, framing can make the
difference between being listened to or ignored.
● Policy conditions and events can reinforce or destabilise
institutions. Evidence presented during crises or ‘focusing
events’(Birkland, 1997) can prompt lurches of attention from
one issue to another, but this outcome is rare, and policy can
remain unchanged for decades.
A one-sizeﬁts-all model is unlikely to help researchers navigate
this environment where different audiences and institutions have

different cultures, preferences and networks. Gaining knowledge
of the complex policy context can be extremely challenging, yet
the implications are profoundly important. In that context,
theory-informed studies recommend investing your time over the
long term, to build up alliances, trust in the messenger,
knowledge of the system, and exploit‘windows of opportunity’
for policy change (Cairney, 2016, p.124). However, they also
suggest that this investment of time may pay off only after years
or decades— or not at all (Cairney and Oliver,2018).
This context could have a profound impact on the way in
which we interpret the eight tips. For example, it may:
1. tip the balance from scientiﬁc to policy-relevant measures of
evidence quality;
2. shift the ways in which we communicate evidence from a
focus on clarity to an emphasis on framing;
3. suggest that we need to engage with policymakers to such an
extent that the division between honest broker and issue
advocate become blurry;
4. prompt us to focus less on the ‘entrepreneurial’ skills of
individual researchers and more on the nature of their
environment; and
5. inform re ﬂection on our role, since successful engagement
may feel more like a career choice than an event.
Throughout this process, we need to decide what policy
engagement is for— whether it is to frame problems or simply
measure them according to an existing frame — and how far
researchers should go to be useful and in ﬂuential. While
immersing oneself fully in policy processes may be the best way
to achieve credibility and impact for researchers, there are
signiﬁcant consequences of becoming a political actor (Jasanoff
and Polsby, 1991; Pielke, 2007; Haynes et al., 2011; Douglas,
2015). The most common consequences include criticism within
one’s peer-group (Hutchings and Stenseth,2016), being seen as
an academic‘lightweight’(Maynard, 2015), and being used to add
legitimacy to a policy position (Himmrich,2016; Reed and Evely,
2016; Crouzat et al.,2018). More serious consequences include a
loss of status completely— David Nutt famously lost his advisory
role after publicly criticising UK government drug policy— and
the loss of one’s safety if adopting an activist mindset (Zevallos,
2017). If academics need to go ‘all in’ to secure meaningful
impact, we need to re
ﬂect on the extent to which they have the
resources and support to do so.
Three major dilemmas in policy engagement . These mis-
understandings matter, because well-meaning people are giving
recommendations that are not based on empirical evidence, and
may lead to signiﬁcant risks, such as reputational damage and
wasted resources. Further, their audience may reinforce this
problem by holding onto deﬁcit models of science and policy, and
equating policy impact with a simple linear policy cycle. When
unsuccessful, despite taking the ‘how to ’ advice to heart,
researchers may blame politics and policymakers rather than
reﬂecting on their own role in a process they do not
understand fully.
Although it is possible to synthesise the‘how to’ advice into
eight main themes, many categories contain a wide range of
beliefs or recommendations within a very broad description of
qualities like’accessibility’and ‘engagement’. We interrogate key
examples to identify the wide range of (potentially contradictory)
advice about the actual and desirable role of researchers in
politics: whether to engage, how to engage, and the purpose of
engagement.
Should academics try to in ﬂuence policy?. A key area of dis-
agreement was over the normative question of whether academics
should advocate for policy positions, try to persuade policymakers
of particular courses of action (e.g., Tilley et al.,2017), offer policy
implications from their research (Goodwin,2013), or be careful
not to promote particular methods and policy approaches
(Gluckman, 2014; Hutchings and Stenseth, 2016; Prehn, 2018).
Aspects of the debate include:
● The public duty to engage versus the need to protect science.
Several pieces argued that publicly-paid academics should
regard policy impact as a professional duty (Shergold,2011;
Tyler, 2017). If so, they should try: to inﬂuence policy by
framing evidence into dominant policy narratives or to
address issues that policymakers care about (Rose, 2015;
Hillman, 2016; King,2016), and engage in politics directly or
when needed (Farmer,2010; Petes and Meyer,2018). Others
felt that it risked an academic ’s main asset – their
independence of advice (Whitty, 2015; Alberts et al., 2018;
Dodsworth and Cheeseman, 2018)— and that this political
role should be left to the specialists, such as scientiﬁc advisors
(Hutchings and Stenseth, 2016). Others emphasise the
potential costs to self-censorship (De Kerckhove et al.,
2015), and the tension between being elite versus inclusive
and accessible (Collins,2011).
● The potential for con ﬂict and reputational damage . Some
identify the tension between being able to provide rational
advice to shape political discourse and the potential for
conﬂict (De Kerckhove et al.,2015). Others rejected it as a
false dichotomy, arguing that advocacy is a “continuous
process of establishing relationships and creating a commu-
nity of experts both in and outside of government who can
give informed input on policies” (Himmrich, 2016).
● The need to represent academics and academia : Some
recommend discussing topics beyond your narrow expertise
— almost as a representative for yourﬁeld or profession (Petes
and Meyer, 2018)— while others caution against it, since
speaking about one ’s own expertise is the best way to
maintain credibility (Marshall and Cvitanovic,2017).
Such debates imply a choice to engage and do not routinely
consider the unequal effects built on imbalances of power
(Cairney and Oliver, 2018). Many researchers are required to
show impact and it is not strictly a choice to engage. Further,
there are signi ﬁcant career costs to engagement, which are
relatively dif ﬁcult to incur by more junior or untenured
researchers, while women and people of colour may be more
subject to personal abuse or exploitation. The risk of burnout, or
the opportunity cost of doing impact rather than conducting the
main activities of teaching and research jobs is too high for many
(Graffy, 1999; Fischoff, 2015). Being constantly available,
engaging with no clear guarantee of impact or success, with no
payment for time or even travel is not possible for many
researchers, even if that is the most likely way to achieve impact.
This means that the diversity of voices available to policy is
limited (Oliver and Faul,2018). Much of the‘how to’ advice is
tailored to individuals without taking into account these systemic
issues. They are mostly drawn from the experiences of people
who consider themselves successful at inﬂuencing policy. The
advice is likely to be useful mostly to a relatively similar group of
people who are conﬁdent, comfortable in policy environments,
and have both access and credibility within policy spaces. Thus,
the current advice and structures may help reproduce and
reinforce existing power dynamics and an underrepresentation of
women, BAME, and people who otherwise do notﬁt the very
narrow mould (Cairney and Oliver,2018)— even extending to the

exclusion of academics from certain institutions or circles (Smith
and Stewart, 2017).
How should academics inﬂuence policy?. A second dilemma is:
how should academics try to inﬂuence policy? By merely stating
the facts well, telling stories to inﬂuence our audience more, or
working with our audience to help produce policy directly? Three
main approaches were identiﬁed in the reviews. Firstly, to use
speciﬁc tools such as evidence syntheses, or social media, to
improve engagement (Thomson, 2013; Caird et al.,2015). This
approach ﬁts with the ‘deﬁcit’ model of the evidence-policy
relationships, whereby researchers merely provide content for
others to work with. As extensively discussed elsewhere, this
method, while safe, has not been shown to be effective at
achieving policy change; and underpinning much of the advice in
this strain are some serious misunderstandings about the prac-
ticalities, psychology and real world nature of policy change and
information ﬂow (Sturgis and Allum, 2004; Fernández, 2016;
Simis et al.,2016).
Secondly, to use emotional appeals and storytelling to craft
attractive narratives with the explicit aim of shaping policy
options (Jones and Crow,2017; Crow and Jones,2018). Leaving
aside the normative question of the independence of scientiﬁc
research, or researchers’ responsibilities to represent data fully
and honestly (Pielke, 2007), this strategy makes practical
demands on the researcher. It requires having the personal
charisma to engage diverse audiences and seem persuasive yet
even-handed. Some of the advice suggests that academics try to
seem pragmatic and equable about the outcome of any such
approach, although not always clear whether this was to help the
researcher seem more worldly-wise and sensible, or simply as a
self-protective mechanism (King,2016). Either way, deciding how
to seem omnipotent yet credible; humble but authoritative;
straightforward yet not over-simplifying— all while still appearing
authentic— is probably beyond the scope of most of our acting
abilities.
Thirdly, to collaborate (Oliver et al.,2014). Co-production is
widely hailed as the most likely way to promote the use of
research evidence in policy, as it would enable researchers to
respond to policy agendas, and enable more agile multidisciplin-
ary teams to coalesce around topical policy problems. There are
also trade-offs to this way of working (Flinders et al., 2016).
Researchers have to cede control over the research agenda and
interpretations. This can give rise to accusations of bias,
partisanship, or at least partiality for one political view over
another. There are signi ﬁcant reputational risks involved in
collaboration, within the academic community and outside it.
Pragmatically, there are practical and logistical concerns about
how and when to maintain control of intellectual property and
access to data. More broadly, it may cloud one’s judgement about
the research in hand, hindering one’s ability to think or speak
critically without damaging working relationships.
What is the purpose of academics engagement in policymaking?.
Authors do not always tell us the purpose of engagement before
they tell us how to do it. Some warn against‘tokenistic’ engage-
ment, and there is plenty of advice for academics wanting to build
‘genuine’rapport with policymakers to make their research more
useful. Yet, it is not always clear if researchers should try andseem
authentically interested in policymakers as a means ofachieving
impact or actually to listen, learn, and cede some control over the
research process. The former can be damaging to the profession.
As Goodwin points out, it’s not just policymakers who may feel
short-changed by transactional relationships:“by treating policy
engagement as an inconvenient and time-consuming‘bolt on' you
may close doors that could be left open for academics who
genuinely care about this collaborative process” (Goodwin, 2013).
The latter option is more radical. It involves a fundamentally
different way of doing public engagement: one with no clear aim
in mind other than to listen and learn, with the potential to
transform research practices and outputs (Parry-Davies and
Newell, 2014).
Although the literature helps us frame such dilemmas, it does
not choose for us how to solve them. There are no clear answers
on how scientists should act in relation to policymaking or the
public (Mazanderani and Latour, 2018), but we can at least
identify and clarify the dilemmas we face, and seek ways to
navigate them. Therefore, it is imperative to move quickly from
basic ‘how to’ advice towards a deeper understanding of the
profound choices that shape careers and lives.
Conclusions
Academics are routinely urged to create impact from their
research; to change policy, practice, and even population out-
comes. There are, however, few empirical evaluations of strategies
to enable academics to create impact. This lack of empirical
evidence has not prevented people from offering advice based on
their personal experience, rather than concrete evaluations of
strategies to increase impact. Much of the advice demonstrates a
limited understanding or description of policy processes and the
wider social aspects of ‘doing’ science and research. The inter-
actions between knowledge production and use may be so com-
plex that abstract‘how to’ advice is limited in use. The‘how to’
advice has a potentially immense range, from very practical issues
(how long should an executive summary be?) to very profound
(should I risk my safety to secure policy change?), but few authors
situate themselves in that wider context in which they provide
advice.
There are some more thoughtful approaches which recognise
more complex aspects of the task of in ﬂuencing policy: the
emotional, practical and cognitive labour of engaging; that it often
goes unrewarded by employers; that impact is never certain, so
engagement may remain unrewarded; and, that our current
advice, structures and incentives have important implications for
how we think about the roles and responsibilities of scientists
when engaging with publics. Some of the‘how to’literature also
considers the wider context of research production and use,
noting that the risks and responsibilities are borne by individuals
and, for example, one individual cannot possibly to get to know
the whole policy machinery or predict the consequences of their
engagement on policy or themselves. For example, universities,
funders and academics are advised to develop incentives, struc-
tures to make ‘impact’ happen more easily (Kerr et al., 2015;
Colglazier, 2016); and remove any actual or perceived penalisa-
tion of‘doing’public engagement (Maynard,2015). Some suggest
universities should move into the knowledge brokerage space,
acting more like think-tanks (Shergold, 2011) by creating and
championing policy-relevant evidence (Tyler, 2017), and pro-
viding “embedded gateways” which offer access to credible and
high-quality research (Green,2016). Similarly, governments have
their own science advisory system which, they are advised, should
be both independent, and inclusive and accountable (Morgan
et al.,2001; Malakoff,2017). Government and Parliament need to
be mindful about the diversity of the experts and voices on which
they draw. For example, historians and ethicists could help pol-
icymakers question their assumptions and explore historical
patterns of policies and policy narratives in particular areas
(Evans, 2013; Haddon et al.,2015) but economics and law have
more currency with policymakers (Tyler,2013).
However, we were often struck by the limited range of advice
offered to academics, many of whom are at the beginning of their

careers. This gap may leave each generation of scientists toﬁght
the same battles, and learn the same lessons over again. In the
absence of evidence about the effectiveness of these approaches,
all one can do is suggest a cautious, learning approach to
coproduction and engagement, while recognising that there is
unlikely to be a one-size- ﬁts all model which would lead to
simple, actionable advice. Further, we do not detect a coherent
vision for wider academy-policymaker relations. Since the impact
agenda (in the UK, at least) is unlikely to recede any time soon,
our best response as a profession is to interrogate it, shape and
frame it, and to help us all toﬁnd ways to navigate the complex
practical, political, moral and ethical challenges associated with
being researchers today. The‘how to’literature can help, but only
if authors are cognisant of their wider role in society and complex
policymaking systems.
For some commentators, engagement is a safe choice tacked
onto academic work. Yet, for many others, it is a more profound
choice to engage for policy change while accepting that the
punishments (such as personal threats or abuse) versus rewards
(such as impact and career development opportunities) are
shared highly unevenly across socioeconomic groups. Policy
engagement is a career choice in which we seek opportunities for
impact that may never arise, not an event in which an intense
period of engagement produces results proportionate to effort.
Overall, we argue that the existing advice offered to academics
on how to create impact is not based on empirical evidence, or on
good understandings of key literatures on policymaking or evi-
dence use. This leads to signiﬁcant misunderstandings, and advice
which can have potentially costly repercussions for research,
researchers and policy. These limitations matter, as they lead to
advice which fails to address core dilemmas for academics —
whether to engage, how to engage, and why— which have pro-
found implications for how scientists and universities should
respond to the call for increased impact. Most of these tips focus
on the individuals, whereas engagement between research and
policy is driven by systemic factors.
