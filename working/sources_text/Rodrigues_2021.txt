Abstract 
Skills and competences are frequently invoked by policy –makers in reference to labour 
market developments and education objectives. However, these concepts have different 
meanings across academic disciplines such as sociology , economics, and education.  
This paper proposes a unified conceptual framework for tasks, skills and competences.  
We start from the concept of task, as the smallest unit o f work involved in an economic 
process. Skills are defined as the ability to perform tasks. Sim ilar tasks are grouped into 
task domains, which are bundled by employers into jobs. Likewise, similar skills make up 
skill domains , while competence is the ability to master skills across domains.  
This framework has two major advantages. First, it provides distinct definitions of relevant 
concepts and the relations between them. Second, it bridges  the socio-economic concepts 
of skills and tasks, which relate to the labour market, with  the education and training  
literature, which focuses on skill and competence development as learning objectives . We 
also propose a way to measure the different concepts empirically.

A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences

1. Introduction and policy context 
Skills are at the heart of European policy. The New Skills Agenda for E urope1 states that 
skills are a pathway to employability and prosperity, and a catalyst in the virtuous circle of 
job creation and growth. It proposes ten actions to make the right training, skills and 
support available to citizens so that Europe can face the challenges of global competition, 
skill-biased technological change and population ageing. The European Pillar of Social 
Rights2 gives an even broader role to skills by stating that they are important not only to 
manage successful transitions in the labour market, but also to participate fully in society. 
In terms of specific actions and initiatives, the Upskilling Pathways and the Key 
Competences for Lifelong Learning are building blocks of the Pillar and of the New Skills 
Agenda for Europe. They aim t o help people, including adults with low skill levels, acquire 
the core set of skills necessary to work and live in the 21st century. The underlying 
assumption is that everyone has the right to quality and inclusive education, training and 
lifelong learning in order to maintain and acquire skills. Thus, the fundamental question 
for EU policy-oriented research in the area of skills is "how well do systems responsible for 
skills development (i.e. education and training) function in providing required skills a nd 
addressing skills mismatches, thus ensuring good labour market and social outcomes?"  
(ESTAT/EMPL, 2016). 
Answering this question requires a well -defined framework and system of indicators for 
measuring skills at large. Although there is a proliferation of indicators and benchmarks 
for skills in the EU, such as the World Indicators of Skills for Employment (WISE) database3 
or Skills for Jobs Indicators 4 by the OECD, or the European Skills Index by Cedefop5, there 
is no common and consistent conceptual def inition, which makes them difficult to 
compare, sometimes even contradictory. A consistent definition and conceptual framework 
for skills at large is still needed (Green 2011).  
Part of the problem is that the area of skills straddles across disciplines, w hich can be 
themselves inconsistent in their approach and basic concepts, and it is not always clear 
which is the perspective taken. For instance, although the policy discourse mostly refers to 
the economic concept of skills (with a focus on the labour mar ket), when it comes to the 
development of learning outcomes and the process of skills development the educational 
concept of competences is often used. It is unclear how these two central (and at least 
partly overlapping) concepts relate to each other. In some recent policy documents and 
discussions, skills and competences are used interchangeably, in some others they seem 
to refer to different things.  
This paper proposes a unified conceptual framework for tasks, skills and competences. We 
present simple d efinitions of the main concepts in this area that are consistent with the 
relevant disciplines and approaches; in particular, we focus on bridging the socio-economic 
approach centred in the application of skills to tasks in the labour market and the 
educational perspective focused on the development of skills and competences in 
education and training. Although our primary perspective is the world of work and 
employment – and what these concepts mean in the labour market – this framework also 
tries to interf ace with the understanding of skills and competences used in the field of 
education. We hope that this paper can foster inter -discipline dialogue and feed into 
subsequent efforts of measuring and monitoring skills at large and at the European level.

2. How the concepts are used in different disciplines 
There are differences, both within and across disciplines, in how the concepts of skills and 
competences are defined and linked to each other, and in the purposes for which they are 
used (see Green 2011 and Payne 2017).  
The economic concept of skill is broadly related to that of human capital,  which 
encompasses all individual attributes that have a market value (Green, 2013). In 
economics, skills are used to explain or account for a variety of phenomena such as wage 
inequality, economic growth or organizational performance (e.g., Hanushek and 
Woessmann 2012; Hanushek et al., 2015). Recent applied economic research has shown 
that, besides ‘cognitive skills’, the so-called ‘non-cognitive skills’ and personality traits also 
play an important economic role (e.g., Heineck and Anger, 2010, Heckman, 2012). In 
general, the term competence is not often used in this literature. 
In economics, the term skill is also used as a defining element of occupations, which are in 
turn typically related to the concepts of division of labour. For example, the International 
Standard Classification of Occupations by the International Labour Organisation defines 
skill as “the ability to carry out the tasks and duties of a given job”, and di stinguishes 
between skill level  and skill specialization  to classify different occupations (ILO 2012). 
From a sociological perspective, skills in relation to occupations are one of the 
determinants of the position that individuals occupy in the social stru cture, or social class 
(Vallas 1990; Warhurst et al. 2017). 
In contrast, in psychology and education the focus is generally on how learning outcomes 
are achieved and can be enhanced. What is seen as an input in economics and sociology is 
seen as an output in psychology and education. Hence the need in these areas to 
disentangle the components of learning outcomes and to come up with the more 
comprehensive concept of competence, which encompasses knowledge, skills and 
attitudes as elements that can be acquir ed and developed in education and training 
episodes. Even within these disciplines, there is no broadly accepted definition of 
competence, let alone a unifying theory (Weinert 2001; Delamare Le Deist and Winterton 
2005; Winterton et al. 2006). 
To some exte nt, skills in economics is conceptually similar to competence in psychology 
and education (Green, 2011), and as previously mentioned the two terms are often used 
interchangeably. However, they are not identical concepts and using them as synonyms 
can lead to confusion. In educational research, skills are a component of competences.  
Although knowledge and attitudes are also attributes of individuals with clear economic 
value, they are fundamentally different from skills in the way they are acquired and 
applied to tasks in labour markets. 6 A clear demarcation of each of those concepts is 
necessary to inform education and training systems, but also to correctly interpret 
changes in labour markets in terms of their implicit skills demands. 
3. Main definitions and conceptual framework 
This section provides definitions for the concepts of task, skill, and competence which 
are used throughout the paper and introduces the links between them. These concepts 
                                                      
6 A concept that is strongly linked to skills and which has become increasingly popular within labour economics 
lately is that of tasks (Autor 2013). A task can be simply defined as a unit of work activity that produces 
output; from this perspective, a skill can be defined as the ability to perform a particular type of task, 
consistently with the ILO definition. This approach opens up the possibility of a conceptualisation and 
classification of skills that is anchored in what people actually do at work, and thus can be used to bridge the 
supply side concept of skills (linked to competence development) and the demand side of tasks (linked to the 
performance of work).

refer to attributes of individuals (skill and competence) or to  the activities that they carry 
out (tasks and occupations). 
In this sense, the two groups of concepts refer to the supply and demand sides of the 
labour market. On the supply side, we have concepts such as skill or competence, which 
apply to individuals and refer to potentialities, that is, to abilities to do something. On the 
demand side, we have concepts such as tasks, tasks bundles, and jobs, which apply to 
activities carried out by individuals and refer to s pecific acts of transformation  within the 
context of economic organisations (i.e., labour inputs into production processes).  
Although both sides are distinct, they are necessarily linked and to a large extent 
correspond to each other in ways that we will discuss later: for instance, a skill (supply 
side) is an ability to perform a specific task (demand side); a cluster of tasks  (demand 
side) can be associated to a competence (supply side). 
 
3.1 The underlying relation between tasks and skills 
Tasks 
From a material perspective, the economy is a process of transforming inputs into outputs 
which have economic value. Work is an input in this process, and tasks are more or less 
discrete units of work that contribute to produce the final output (Autor, 2013)7. 
In analytical terms, the level of granularity o r discreteness of the concept of task is 
arbitrary. In practice, it depends mainly on the complexity of the economic process and on 
the forms of work organisation that hold in each moment of history and even in each 
industry, sector or firm. For instance, Taylorism as a form of work organisation explicitly 
aimed at discretising, standardising and simplifying as much as possible the tasks of each 
worker, in order to increase the degree of managerial control of the labour process, reduce 
wages and increase efficiency (Braverman 1974).  
In other words, the idea of tasks as the smallest unit of labour input presupposes a degree 
of structure and differentiation that is the deliberate result of a historical process of work 
organisation and division of labour. In i tself, work as transformative activity need not be 
split into tasks, but can be continuous and undifferentiated. The breakdown of work into 
tasks, especially as it accelerated during the Industrial Revolution, is associated with gains 
from specialisation a nd exchange. This phenomenon is secularly increasing in the 
economic process as a whole, because of the unfolding of the division of labour and 
growing economic complexity. 
Although the differentiation of labour into tasks is historically determined by the  division 
of labour and economic complexity, the level at which tasks are defined analytically is 
arbitrary and ultimately depends on the research objectives. A task can be defined at the 
most discrete level possible: a very small unit of labour input with in a very specific 
transformation process, such as fastening a screw or writing an e -mail.  It can also be 
defined as a complex cluster of different sub -tasks, such as factory assembly, or 
managing correspondence. In fact, we could go as far as considering the economic process 
                                                      
7 The main proponent of the tasks approach, David Autor, uses the concept at a level of generality that does 
not specify whether the task has to be performed by humans or not (it could be performed by a robot, or by an 
animal). This is intentional, because it allows to explicitly discuss under which conditions will the task will be 
performed by a human: assuming technological feasibility, whether a task is performed by a human or by a 
machine depends on the relative cost of each alternative. For us, this is problematic because machines lack 
real agency, and thus they can always be understood as tools used by some human worker, who would be the 
one providing the labour input in the last instance. In this paper, tasks are assumed to refer always to human 
input following the approach of Fernández-Macías and Bisello 2020.
<<<PAGE=10>>>

as a unique all -encompassing and very complex task. However, for definition and 
classification purposes it is useful to regard them at their most discrete level possible.  
Therefore, we define task as a discrete unit of work activity that contributes to the 
production of economic output. To classify tasks, we use the taxonomy proposed by 
Fernández-Macías and Bisello (2020) that is organised along the dimensions of content 
and method (see  Figure 1 below).  
The first dimension refers to the content of the tasks themselves, which is what people 
do at work. It is based on the object that is transformed in the production process (things, 
ideas or social relations) and on the type of processing involved (which is strongly linked to 
the types of skills required).  
At the highest level of generality, this taxonomy differentiates three domains or categories 
of task contents: i) physical tasks (that operate on things), further subdivided into strength, 
dexterity and navig ation; ii) intellectual tasks (that operate on ideas), subdivided into 
information processing and problem solving; and iii) social tasks (that operate on people), 
subdivided into serving, teaching, selling, managing and caring. Within each of these high -
level categories, different subcategories of tasks are differentiated based on their typical 
skills requirements, with further low -level indicators under each of the subcategories. 
Although there is an obvious arbitrary aspect in the selection of categories and the 
boundaries between them, this proposal reflects the main elements identified in the 
specialised literature on this subject (see Fernández-Macías and Bisello 2020). 
The second dimension of this taxonomy refers to the methods and tools  used to 
perform those tasks (how people work) and reflect the forms of work organisation and 
technology used in production. See Figure 1 below for more details on this task 
classification. 
Implicit in the classification shown above is the fact t hat, even though they are defined as 
discrete and distinct units of work, tasks can be related to each other by similarity. The 
reason behind this similarity is that different tasks can share some key properties, most 
importantly with respect to the object  on which they operate (things, ideas or people) and 
the type of transformation process they entail (for instance, all codified information 
processing literacy tasks involve cognitive processes such as comprehension and 
expression operating on different ty pes of text). These relations of similarity between 
tasks allow us to classify them as in Figure 1, and is also reflected in relationships 
between skills and competences that we will discuss later.

Skills 
Skill can be generally defined as the ability to per form a task well. Although a skill is an 
attribute of individuals, it necessarily refers to a specific activity (or as we are saying, act 
of transformation). In our context, the specific act of transformation that the concept of 
skill refers to is a discre te task within a particular work process. Therefore, each task has 
an associated skill and its completion is skill-dependent.8 
For our current purposes, skills have two crucial features: 
1. A skill can be graded depending on how well the task is performed. In other words, skill 
is a relative concept, as one can be very skilled or not very skilled in doing something. 
This gradation is specific to each type of task.  
2. A skill is something that is acquired and that can be improved by different means, 
mostly by learning and practising. 
Because skills are directly related to tasks, we can classify them in a way analogous to the 
one presented earlier in Figure 1, along three categories: 
1. Physical skills: ability to do well physical tasks, involving strength or dexterity.  
2. Intellectual (or cognitive) skills: ability to do well intellectual tasks, involving information 
processing or problem-solving. 
3. Social skills: ability to do well social tasks, involving attending, teaching, influencing or 
managing. 
Depending on the degree of granularity or discreteness aimed for, we could construct skills 
classifications and indicators at different levels of the tasks framework presented in 
Figure 1. 
The methods and tools dimension of the tasks framework refers to how rather than what 
is done at work, and therefore there is not such a clear skills equivalency. However, there 
can be skills associated with those categories too, to the extent that operating wi th a 
particular tool, or under a particular form of work organisation, involves also physical, 
intellectual or social tasks. For instance, operating with computers requires some physical 
dexterity skills (for typing), intellectual information -processing skills, and problem -solving 
skills. Working in teams requires some social skills. 
Skills hierarchy  
Skills can also differ in complexity. A more complex skill is one that incorporates or 
requires mastering lower-level skills. In other words, less complex ski lls are enablers of or 
pre-requisites to the acquisition of more complex skills.  
This complexity property of skills implies a vertical or hierarchical relation between skills, 
in two possible ways:  
 Development, whereby one skill may develop into a more complex one (Panel A of 
Figure 2). 
 Aggregation, whereby two or more skills are combined into a more complex one 
(Panel B of Figure 2). 
An example of a complex skill developed from a simpler one could be a very specific 
numeracy skill, for instance making powers of a number: this skill requires having acquired 
first the skills of multiplying, which in turn requires having mastered adding. An example 
of a complex skill aggregated  from many lower -level skills could be programming, which 
                                                      
8 This definition of skill is very broad and abstract and, therefore, it could refer to a person or a machine. For 
instance, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent could be skilled in the performance of a specific task. However, as 
previously mentioned the fact that machines lack agency makes this concept problematic, and in any case all 
the discussion in this paper refers to human beings.
<<<PAGE=13>>>
A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences

requires both literacy and numeracy skills, on top of technical skills related to the use of 
digital tools.9 
Based on this relation of hierarchy between skills, they can be classified and compared 
according to their complexity. Simple skills are those that do not require mastering 
additional lower-level skills; the more low -level skills are required for mastering a given 
skill, the highest its complexity. Also, we can call basic or foundational skills those that are 
necessary for acquiring many important higher-level skills.  
Figure 2 - Examples of vertical/hierarchical relations between skills 
 
Skills transferability 
Although the concept of skill is specific to a particular task, skills can be laterally 
transferable to other tasks insofar as those tasks share some properties. The 
transferability of skills across tasks requires necessarily some common properties in the 
related tasks, but these common properties may not be obvious at all. 
The degree of transferability between skills varies, depending on the similarity between 
the tasks considered. Some skills may have limited transferability because they relate to 
tasks whose properties make them peculiar (so that there are few similar tasks). Some 
other skills may relate to tasks whose properties apply to many other tasks, and thus 
those skills will have a high transferability. The range of different skills to which a skill 
may be transferable indicates how general or specific a skill is. 
Based on this transferability attribute, and consistently with the literature,  we adopt one 
additional dimension to classify skills: 
 Generic skills are transferable to many similar tasks (to varying degrees). 
 Specific skills apply only to a specific task and therefore are not transferable. 
Ultimately, skills generality can be understood as a continuum, ranging from very task -
specific skills to very generic skills.  
Tasks and skills domains 
We previously defined task as a discrete unit of work act ivity that contributes to the 
production of economic value, and skill as the ability to perform a task well. Figure 3 
represents how tasks and skills are linked, in a very simplified way. As explained above, to 
each task correspond s one skill and the (horizontal) distance between tasks (skills) 
                                                      
9 Unlike skills, it does not make sense to characterise tasks as more or less complex because they are simply 
units of work in a production process that do not have a hierarchical position as such. If anything, the skill 
required to perform a task may be more or less complex. For instance, suppose the task of making the power 
of numbers. The skill to do that requires having mastered the skill of multiplication and before that the skill of 
addition. However, the task itself does not require actually adding and multiplying numbers.

indicates the similarity (transferability) between them. 10 The complexity axis is only 
present in the skills space and for simplicity we only consider two levels: basic and 
complex skills. In this example, skills C, D and E are basic ones while skills A, B, and F are 
complex ones. 
Figure 3 - An example of tasks and skills spaces  
 
The tasks represented in Figure 3 can be cluster ed by similarity, represented by their 
horizontal proximity. For instance, tasks a, b and c above can be put together in a cluster, 
task d in another, and tasks e and f in a third one. We refer to any cluster of tasks as a 
task domain. By analogy, a skill domain can be defined as the corresponding cluster of 
skills (and their associated lower -level skills). Again, in Figure 3 we could identify three 
clusters of skills or  skills domains  (A, B and C; D; and E and F). In Figure 4 below, we 
present other examples of task and skill domains. 
Figure 4 - Examples of tasks and skills domains 
 
Even though all task domains  depicted are formed by three tasks, the corresponding 
skill domains are very different. The domain in Panel B is composed of tasks that only 
require basic skills, while the domain in panel A is formed by tasks that require three basic 
and two complex skills, and the domain in panel C requires fo ur basic and one complex 
skill. Apart from the number of skills and their complexity, a crucial difference between the 
domains is how similar are the tasks involved. While in the domain represented in Panel A 
the tasks are very similar, in Panels B and C t hey are quite dissimilar, as represented by 
the horizontal distance between them.  
  
                                                      
10 In the diagram, there are more skills than tasks simply because some of the tasks depicted here require 
complex skills, which themselves build on basic skills. The tasks corresponding to these basic skills are not 
represented.
<<<PAGE=15>>>

12 
We can define the main attributes of skill domains as follows: 
 The complexity of a skills domain is related to the complexity of the skills that 
compose it. The domain in Panel B is less complex than those in panels C and A. 
 The consistency of a skills domain depends on the similarity of the tasks that 
constitute it, and hence on the transferability between the corresponding skills. 
The domain in Panel A is highly consistent because the tasks are similar among 
them and the related skills are to a great extent transferable. In contrast, the 
domains in Panels B and C are less consistent because the necessary skills to 
perform well in the domain are also quite distinct (and less transferable).  
The attributes of complexity and consistency only apply to skills domains, but since every 
skill has an associated task, they can be also indirectly applied to task domains. In other 
words, a task domain whose associated skills domain is complex but consistent can also 
be considered as a complex and consistent task domain. 
Since we have defined (task or skill) domain just as a cluster of tasks or skills, any domain 
is conceivable in principle. But only domains that have some degree of cons istency have 
practical value, and they are implicitly used by organisations to structure labour input into 
production (resulting in jobs or occupations, which are consistent clusters of tasks, more 
on this later) and by educational systems to organise the learning process (resulting in 
competences and curricula, which are consistent clusters of skills). An example of skills 
domain with practical value is “digital skills”, which can be defined as a cluster of 
transferable and hierarchically related skills li nked to the performance of tasks involving 
digital tools. 
 
3.2 Competences  
We can now define competence as a general ability to do well in a particular task 
domain. By definition, there can be as many competences as task domains can be defined.  
It is imp ortant to note that the concept of competence is related but not synonymous to 
the concept of skills domain, because it includes much more than just a cluster of skills. 
This is because “to do well in a particular task domain” requires not only to have a number 
of specific skills, but also to have a general understanding of the domain (knowledge) as 
well as certain attitudes that help to do well in that domain. Thus, there are the three 
elements of competence: 
1. A set of key skills for the domain . Notice that  a task domain can contain a 
potentially infinite number of tasks, and it is thus impossible for any person to be 
skilled in every possible task within a domain, strictly speaking. 11 The individual 
must possess some key skills in the domain; the transferabi lity property of skills 
should enable her to deal with other (similar) tasks in that domain. 
2. A general knowledge of the domain,  that enables an understanding of the object 
and transformation processes of the tasks involved, which will allow to respond 
better to new tasks or situations of uncertainty that may emerge in the domain.  
3. A particular set of attitudes  which are beneficial for performance in the domain 
and to act when confronted with uncertainty in the domain. 
These components are what enable someon e to successfully confront different and 
uncertain challenges and tasks in a particular domain. For instance, being digitally 
competent does not mean having all the possible skills in the digital domain, but having a 
certain level of key skills in the digi tal domain, some general knowledge of that domain 
                                                      
11 That is why in the definition, we say that competence is “a general ability to do well in a particular task 
domain”, rather than “being skilled in all tasks of a particular domain”.
<<<PAGE=16>>>
A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences 
 
13 
and a particular set of attitudes (such as attention to detail, openness to change, or 
capacity to focus) that are useful to confront different tasks and situations in the digital 
domain.  
The properties that we previously used to characterise skills (and indirectly tasks) domains 
(consistency and complexity) are directly related to the difficulty of attaining competence 
in a domain. In general, the more complex and the less consistent a domain is, the more 
difficult it will be to attain competence in such a domain, because the requirements in 
terms of skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary for the associated competence will be 
more demanding. 
Knowledge 
For our purposes,  knowledge is the cognitive outcome of an assimilation of facts and 
figures, concepts, ideas and theories which are already established ( know-what) about a 
domain. Knowledge can be acquired and developed in the context of the formal education 
system, in so -called non-formal learning settings  – structured learning outside the 
education system, such as workplace training – and in informal settings through one’s life 
experience.  
Because we restrict the definition of skill to a specific task or work activity, a skill does not 
necessarily require  knowledge. It is possible to have “the ability to do a task” without 
knowing facts, figures, ideas and theories. An “operational'” knowledge that allows carrying 
out the task well can be enough. However, since competence refers to the ability of doing 
well many different tasks in a domain (potentially including situations that the person may 
never have confronted before), some knowledge of the domain is necessary. Knowledge 
supports the transferability of skills to similar tasks, the capacity to respond to uncertainty 
and to find solutions to new problems in a domain.  
Attitudes 
In our context, attitudes can be defined as any personality trait that can be learned (i.e., 
not innate) and that contributes to a more effective performance in a domain. 12 Attitudes 
are of a psychological, emotional and behavioural nature, rather than of a cognitive or 
operational nature (contrary to skills or knowledge). While they can evolve over the life 
course, attitudes are mostly acquired in childhood and remain relatively stab le attributes 
for adult individuals (Caspi et al. 2005).  
In some cases, it may be difficult to differentiate attitudes from skills, since both can be 
learned and can be beneficial for the performance of a task or set of tasks. For instance, 
social tasks o ften require empathy; since empathy can be trained, it can be considered a 
skill; but it is also a psychological trait rather than an operational ability, and thus it can be 
considered an attitude. Here we refer to attitudes as pre -dispositions to act in a particular 
way and that are relevant for the performance in a task domain rather than a specific 
ability to perform a task as such. In practice, the same trait can be considered an attitude 
or a skill depending on the specific task or domain in question. For instance, for the task of 
providing psychological care, empathy can be considered a skill; whereas for statistical 
analysis empathy can be a desirable attribute for a better competence, but it cannot be 
considered a skill since statistical work does not require empathy as such. 
Attitudes are more general than skills and knowledge. Whereas skills are by definition 
linked directly to specific tasks, and knowledge refers to objects and processes linked to a 
                                                      
12 One could argue that attitudes can also affect skill, i.e. the ability to perform a specific task. However, since 
we have made a narrow and technical definition of tasks, the effect of attitudes would be marginal at that 
level, while they would be very relevant at the level of competence, which involves dealing with more 
uncertainty and complexity.
<<<PAGE=17>>>
A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences 
 
14 
particular domain, attitudes are not task - or dom ain-specific. What is specific to each 
domain is the relative importance or relevance of specific attitudes for doing well in such 
a domain. For instance, concern for others can be an important attitude for teachers, but 
irrelevant for software developers; whereas openness to change can be a positive attitude 
in many different domains.  
The concept of attitudes as a component of competence is similar to other concepts used 
in occupational or psychological research. For instance, the O*NET occupational datab ase  
describes 16 “work styles” as personal characteristics that can affect how well someone 
performs a job: achievement/effort; adaptability/flexibility; analytical thinking; attention to 
detail; concern for others; cooperation; dependability; independenc e; initiative; innovation; 
integrity; leadership; persistence; self-control; social orientation and stress tolerance. 
A production function approach to the concept of competence 
Building on the previous ideas, we can use a production function approach to d iscuss and 
study the concept of competence. In general, the competence of individual i in the domain 
j would be given by: 
𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 𝑔(𝐸𝑖𝑗). 𝑓(𝑆𝑖𝑗, 𝐾𝑖𝑗, 𝐴𝑖𝑗) 
Where 𝑆𝑖𝑗, 𝐾𝑖𝑗, 𝐴𝑖𝑗 stand for skills, knowledge and attitudes, respectively. The other 
component of competence, 𝐸𝑖𝑗, is an efficiency term, inspired by total factor productivi ty 
in the standard production function in economics. This efficiency term implies that, for 
equal amounts of the remaining components, there could be different competence levels 
depending on how efficiently the components are combined. 
We propose that this efficiency term can be linked to the concept of expertise, which can 
increase competence for a given level of skills, knowledge and attitudes by improving the 
efficiency of their use. Expertise involves a deeper understanding of the domain’s 
processes and  context that can be acquired mainly by accumulating experience in the 
domain, rather than in learning contexts. We will come back to this concept of expertise 
later, when we present a life-course approach to skills and competences. 
The functional form f should have the following properties: 
 Allow for the components’ substitution; 
 Be multiplicative, so that a balanced combination of components yields a better 
outcome; 
 Allow each component to have different weights. 
A Cobb-Douglas production function encompasses all these features and could be used to 
illustrate a particular example of the desired production function: 
𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 𝑔(𝐸𝑖𝑗 )𝑆𝑖𝑗
𝛼𝐾𝑖𝑗
𝛽𝐴𝑖𝑗
𝛾  
This production function is general enough to encompass different weights ( 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛾) 
for each of the components, so that in some domain skills can be more important than 
attitudes, while in other domains knowledge can be more important than skills, etc.  
Depending on the rate of substitution between the components, we can have similar levels 
of competence with different combinations of its components. 
Thus, competence can be modelled as a continuous variable that results from the 
combination of its components and can change due to shifts either in the efficiency term 
or in some  component. In Section 4, we introduce a dynamic perspective to these supply 
side concepts, by taking a life course perspective.

3.3 Jobs as a special type of task domain 
The conceptual framework proposed here defines task as a discrete unit of work act ivity 
and a task domain as any cluster of tasks. The equivalent concepts in the supply side of 
the labour market would be skill and competence.  
At the level of generality of the previous discussion, any task domain is conceivable, 
including one that encompasses the entire space of tasks. Indeed, there are some possible 
task domains that would make no sense because they bundle tasks that, in practice, would 
be impossible to be performed well by any individual (no individual would be able to 
master all the n ecessary skills, nor acquire all the necessary knowledge and attitudes). In 
contrast, other possible task domains have a consistency that makes them practical for 
arranging work patterns in economic organisations. Indeed, economic organisations 
typically try to bundle the tasks to be performed by workers in a way that is efficient and 
maximises profit. For an illustration of how tasks are bundled into jobs, see box 1 below.  
 
Box 1: How do organisations bundle tasks into jobs? 
 
Let us suppose that we want to set up a productive organisation to provide some goods to 
the market, shoes for instance. We initially assume a given amount and type of demand, 
and a given technology. With those conditions, we will have to combine a number of 
inputs, including labour. This labour input can be split into a vector of specific tasks that 
have to be carried out, each with an associated amount of labour input necessary (x 
amount of working hours for cutting the leather, x amount of hours for sewing, etc; there 
will also be many administrative, design, marketing and other types of tasks). Let us say 
there are in total about 1,000 distinct tasks to be carried out, each with their associated 
necessary labour input. 
As implied by Ronald Coase in his classic treatise on the nature of the firm (Coase 1937), 
it would be impossible to contract via the market the labour input to perform each of the 
tasks individually for a given production process because the coordination costs would be 
enormous. Therefore, tasks are bundled into jobs to be performed by workers under a 
labour contract. But how do we bundle tasks in the most efficient way? 
As previously discussed, the fact that each task requires a different skill, and that skills 
are related by transferability and hierarchy, suggests that it makes sense to bundle tasks 
that require related skills. This way, jobs will tend to involve task domains which are 
consistent, and occupational careers will tend to imply increasing levels of complexity 
(because mastering low-level skills gives access to related higher-level skills). 
But for a specific productive organisation, the amount of demand may not allow a very 
detailed task specialisation (Adam Smith famously argued that the division of labour is 
limited by the size of the market), and perhaps there will be several jobs requiring skills 
across different domains (in other words, jobs with inconsistent task domains). Task 
bundling may also be affected by business strategy: we may prefer to limit task 
specialisation and hire competent but generalist workers with a high degree of skills and 
autonomy (for instance, to produce luxury customised shoes), or opt for a Taylorist-type 
extreme task division limiting generalist skills and autonomy (to produce cheap 
standardised shoes). There are many other factors that can affect the bundling of tasks 
into jobs in particular organisations, from industrial relations systems and cultural norms 
to personal relations. Therefore, jobs will partly, but never perfectly, reflect skill domains. 
 
We can thus define a job as consistent bundle of tasks (or task domain) that is associated 
with a specific position within an economic organisation, for some level of task 
consistency. Since we previously defined competence as a general ability to do well in a 
particular task domain, competence would be the supply -side equivalent to the demand -

16 
side concept of job. That is why we speak about a “competent cook” or a “competent 
mechanic”. 
Finally, occupations are groups of jobs that are similar in terms of the competences they 
require and their hierarchical position within organisations. The concept of occupation, 
which is regularly used to classify jobs in the economy, tends to reflect more directly the 
complexity of the domains as previously defined, because they are in fact cons tructed as 
groups of jobs that require similar competence levels. 
 
3.4 A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences 
Figure 5 puts together the previously discussed concepts of tasks, skills and co mpetences 
and illustrates the links between them. This framework classifies the concepts in two 
sides, depending on whether they refer to the supply or the demand side of the labour 
market. In the demand side, the key concepts are task, task domain and job, in order of 
complexity. Tasks are small and discrete units of labour input, task domains are clusters of 
tasks, and jobs are clusters of tasks used by organisations to structure labour input into 
their production processes. In the supply side, the concep ts are skills, skill domains and 
competences, again in order of increasing complexity. Skills are abilities to perform 
specific tasks, skill domains are clusters of skills linked to task domains, and competences 
are a combination of skills, knowledge and a ttitudes that allow the worker to do well in a 
given task domain, or in a job. In this framework, each of the supply-side concepts has one 
related demand side concept (or two). The relationship between task and skill is strictly 
one-to-one, as well as the relationship between task domain and skill domain. The 
demand-side correspondence of the concept of competence is less direct and unequivocal, 
because it refers to a task domain but there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the 
definition of such a domain, as previously explained. The concept of competence can apply 
both to a job (as a particular cluster of tasks, within a productive organisation) and to a 
task domain.

4. Competence development: a life course perspective 
As described above, the concepts of competence, skills, knowledge, attitudes and expertise 
refer to potentialities of individuals. These potentialities evolve over the life course as a

result of learning experiences of a formal, non-formal or informal nature.13  In this section, 
we follow a life course approach to explore the dynamic aspect of competence and its 
components.  
4.1 The acquisition of competences throughout the life course 
It is well establ ished that individuals have the capacity to learn throughout life. Research 
in neuroscience shows that learning capacity is particularly high in childhood, when the 
brain has a very high level of plasticity. Starting in adolescence, the brain structure is 
consolidated by reinforcing (weakening) the most (least) used synapses. During adulthood 
this plasticity is reduced, which makes learning still possible albeit more demanding from 
a cognitive point of view. At this stage, the learning capacity is determine d by the relation 
between what we attempt to learn and what we already know. If these are too different, 
the brain structures must be reshaped, which is particularly demanding. Despite this lower 
plasticity during adulthood (affecting the capacity to learn  new things), cognitive ability 
and performance are not compromised. In fact, adults tend to show high levels of 
functionality due to the relative specialisation on specific areas, which makes brain 
processes more efficient. In sum, through specialisation and experience adults get better 
at doing what they have already learned.  
Educational psychology also assumes that individuals maintain a capacity to learn 
throughout their lives, but at different degrees and in different ways. For instance, during 
childhood most of the learning is done through “cumulative learning”, whereby new mental 
schemes or patterns are established. During adolescence and adulthood, most of the 
learning happens by assimilation and/or accommodation, whereby the result of a new 
stimulus is generally linked to an existing mental structure, although it can contribute to 
change it slightly (Piaget 1954). 
The learning process, or the acquisition and development of competences (skills, 
knowledge and attitudes), is also affected by genetic and environmental factors. The latter 
refers to the types of learning environment one is exposed to and includes how frequently 
what has been learned is practiced in reality. When learning outcomes are not applied (in 
paid work or any type of activity), they  will not evolve or consolidate as they would if they 
are applied regularly. If they are only rarely used, they may even depreciate in the long 
run. 
4.2 A dynamic competence production function 
Clearly, the competence in a domain, and its constituents, wil l vary significantly over the 
life course. Hence, we can add a time dimension to the production function of competence, 
so that the competence in period t depends on the skills, knowledge, attitudes and 
expertise at that point in time: 
𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝑔(𝐸𝑖𝑗𝑡). 𝑓(𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡, 𝐾𝑖𝑗𝑡, 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑡) 
The level of each of these elements ( 𝐸, 𝑆, 𝐾, 𝐴) in period t results from the level in the 
previous period t-1 and from the experience acquired between t-1 and t (𝐿𝑡): 
𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡−1, 𝐿𝑖𝑗𝑡), where 𝑋 = {𝐸, 𝑆, 𝐾, 𝐴} 
                                                      
13 We can define these concepts following Cedefop (2014). Formal learning refers to learning occurring in an 
organised and structured environment (such as in an education or training institution or on the job) and that is 
explicitly designated as learning (in terms of objectives, time or resources). Formal learning is intentional from 
the learner’s point of view and it typically leads to certification. Non-formal learning refers to learning which 
is embedded in planned activities not explicitly designated as learning, but which contain an important learning 
element. It is intentional from the learner’s point of view and it typically does not lead to certification. 
Informal learning refers to learning resulting from daily activities related to work, family or leisure. It is not 
organised or structured in terms of objectives, time or learning support. Informal learning is in most cases 
unintentional from the learner’s perspective.
<<<PAGE=21>>>

18 
The experience, 𝐿 (which should not be confused with expertise, E), can be of a positive 
nature - practicing a competence - or of a negative nature - not practicing a competence. 
In summary, competence development occurs when either expertise, skills, knowledge and 
attitudes change over time. The case of expertise is particularly interesting because it 
allows competence to improve even with constant skills, knowledge and attitudes. One 
increases expertise by devel oping an in -depth understanding of the domain that allows 
using resources (skills, knowledge and attitudes) in a more efficient way. An expert can 
build on accumulated experience to identify the most efficient strategies for dealing with 
uncertainty in a given task domain.  
4.3 Representing the development of competence over the life course 
The development of competence and its constituents is largely specific to each individual, 
as it depends on individual genetic and environmental factors. However, despit e this 
diversity, it is possible to articulate a set of general principles that would broadly apply to 
all individuals. Linking insights from educational psychology and neuroscience to the 
concepts presented in previous pages, we propose the following typi cal patterns of 
competence development throughout three main stages of the life course. 
1. Childhood and adolescence - Period of initial education and training 
As already discussed, learning starts very early in childhood and it initially comprises 
mostly basic and general knowledge, skills and attitudes. These basic elements will then 
be developed into more specific and complex ones as people progress in education and in 
life. 
2. Adulthood - Work 
After initial education and training, most individuals join the la bour market. The 
knowledge, skills and attitudes accumulated during initial education and training will be 
put into practice, normally in a specific task domain (or job). In this context, the concept of 
occupational mismatch (over - and under -education) ref ers to situations in which the 
competences (knowledge, skills and attitudes) initially accumulated by the individual are 
not adequate for the job she takes up when joining the labour market. This mismatch can 
reflect inconsistencies between the educational  system and the available jobs, some 
dysfunction in the sorting and matching process of individuals to jobs, or individual 
deficiencies in the processes of competence acquisition or job design (at either side of the 
market). 
Whatever the initial level of competence in the domain and the degree of matching to the 
actual job performed, continuing work activity in a given domain results in further 
accumulation of skills, knowledge and attitudes relevant for doing well in that domain. In 
other words, the level of competence in the domain continues to grow. In fact, experience 
in the domain contributes to an increasing practical understanding and efficiency in that 
domain, which allows individuals to develop better strategies to operate and cope with 
uncertainties in that domain. This accumulation of efficiency and practical understanding 
of the domain is what we have called expertise, and it can only be acquired through 
experience and thus at work. 
As individuals age, their cognitive abilities start declining. While this process starts already 
in early adulthood (as early as the twenties), in many cases it is only apparent in late 
adulthood because the accumulation of expertise more than compensates the declining 
cognitive ability with a more efficient use of the available skills and knowledge.  
3. Old age - Retirement 
When individuals retire, they are less likely to put their work -related skills into practice, 
which contributes to their depreciation. Eventually, in the later stages of life, the cognitive
<<<PAGE=22>>>
A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences 
 
19 
abilities decline to an extent that not even expertise is able to compensate (especially if 
there is no practice), and the overall level of competence in the domain will decline. 
Following the production function approach proposed earlier, the evolution of competence 
over the life course would result from the combined effect of all these constituent 
elements at each point in time. On this basis, we can represent a typical life course 
development of competence to be as follows: 
The stage of highest competence growth is typically around the transition from education 
to work, when expertise also starts being accumulated.  
Its peak typically occurs when expertise reaches its maximum, after a certain period of 
experience in the domain. At this point, skills and attitudes are  also likely to be close to 
their highest, whereas knowledge is likely to have already declined for some time. 
After this peak towards the second half of the career, the level of competence would 
typically start a very slow decline driven by dropping knowl edge and skills but contained 
by continuing peak (or even growing) expertise; after retirement, the decline in competence 
would be steeper. 
Figure 6 - An illustration of the development of competence over the life course 
 
Figure 6 provides a stylised depiction of the evolution of competence and its components 
in a particular domain over the life course, to illustrate some of the ideas discussed so far. 
For instance, knowledge is mostly accumulated over the initial education period, peaking 
very early in adulthood and slowly declining over the work period because of growing 
specialisation. Skills, on the other hand, grow much more slowly before adulthood, because 
they are mostly acquired by practice in a particular domain, and they tend to peak around 
the middle of the career, declining more slowly (until retirement, when they would drop 
fast). Attitudes are difficult to represent (the metric reflects how at titudes contribute to 
competence in the domain), but we have tried to reflect the fact that in early childhood 
some of the key attitudes are acquired, and then the more domain -specific attitudes are 
acquired in the work period. Finally, expertise (correspo nding to the efficiency term in our 
equation) would only start to grow in the work period, peaking around the time of 
retirement, and declining much less steeply afterwards. These different paths imply a 
different effect of the different stages of life on the development of overall competence. 
In the early years, competence would mostly grow because of knowledge accumulation, 
while in adulthood skills and expertise would be the main drivers. After the middle of the
<<<PAGE=23>>>
A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences 
 
20 
career, the overall competence level would  be mostly maintained by growing expertise, 
whereas skills and especially knowledge would tend to contribute negatively in these later 
years. 
This description of the development of competence and its components is very general 
and purely illustrative, but it may apply broadly across domains or jobs, at least in cases 
where there is a relatively good match between initial education and the labour market, 
and thus some consistency in the process of competence development. In practice, the 
actual development o f competences could depart from this ideal type in several ways. 
First, at the individual level, the specific timing of different evolutions will depend on 
genetic, nurture, and environment, as well as the opportunities to apply learning. Second, it 
can vary greatly across domains, depending on the weight that each component has in the 
formation of competence. For instance, some jobs require mainly practical skills rather 
than abstract knowledge (e.g. , dexterity), in whose case competence development may 
follow more closely that of skills. Third and final, the development pictured in  Figure 6  
assumes a prototypical life course with a highly consistent career, with initial education 
matching the adult oc cupation, and no significant spells of unemployment or periods of 
additional adult education. This stylised pattern may be fundamentally altered, by 
idiosyncratic external shocks driven by either demand or supply factors, or by an increase 
in lifelong learning. We elaborate some of these points in the next section. 
The framework presented in this paper can also serve as a blueprint to develop indicators 
for monitoring skills and competence development at large. An ideal monitoring 
framework would require an  ad-hoc longitudinal survey, following cohorts of people over 
their life course to measure the acquisition, development and use of skills and 
competences. In the absence of such a survey, in Annex B we show that some indicators 
already available in the Eur opean Statistical system can be used to measure some of the 
dimensions of the framework described in this paper. 
5. Some additional illustrations 
The conceptual framework presented in the previous pages provides consistent definitions 
and explicit hypotheses about the structure and relationships between the concepts of 
jobs, tasks, skills and competences. This framework tries to bring together concepts that 
are normally discussed separately, typically only from the point of view of supply 
(competences, skills) or demand (jobs, tasks). It also tries to incorporate those concepts 
into a life -course perspective that is particularly useful to discuss the development of 
competences over time.  In this section, we present some illustrative applications of this 
framework to specific concepts or phenomena in the area of skills and human capital. In 
particular, we will discuss supply -side and demand -side effects in the development of 
competences that depart from the typical pattern discuss above, as well as the topic of 
mismatch between supply and demand of skills.  
Supply-side factors 
During the period of initial education and training, adolescents may follow a 
general/academic or a vocational type of education (VET). In both cases, students 
accumulate skills, knowledge a nd attitudes that are potentially useful for their careers. 
The main difference is that students in VET are trained for a specific profession and learn 
from hands-on situations. According to our conceptual framework, this would mean that 
students in genera l education and those in vocational education develop their 
competences differently. VET students immediately start accumulating skills and expertise 
for the job, and they start specialising in one domain earlier in life than those in general 
education. The accumulation (and importance) of general knowledge in the development 
of their competences would be lower than for those in general education.

During their careers, adults may decide to participate in further training or education. 
According to Cedefop (2014), adult learning is defined as “general or vocational education 
provided for adults after initial education and training for professional and/or personal 
purposes, and which aims to provide general education, provide compensatory learning in 
basic skills, give access to qualifications or acquire, improve or update knowledge, skills or 
competences is a specific field”. Adults can also participate in education and training 
episodes, by their own initiative or through on -the-job training. These episodes aim at 
refreshing or expanding their skills, knowledge or attitudes, thus increasing their general 
competence14. Initiatives like the European Skills Agenda are developed to encourage this 
type of adult learning (e.g., the Upskilling Pathways program 15). In our framework, adult 
learning would be illustrated by an upward shift in the skills, knowledge or attitudes 
curves, depending on the type of training followed.  
Demand-side factors 
On the demand side, it is important to note that the task contents of a jo b can 
substantially change during the life of individuals, which may render their initially 
accumulated competences inadequate for carrying out their tasks. For instance, the 
introduction of new technologies or a reorganisation of production or work can tr igger a 
significant change in the task content of a job. In the conceptual framework, the impact of 
a significant change in the task contents of a job on the competence curve of the 
individual can be represented as a sudden drop in the relevant curves, to the extent that 
the stock of expertise, skills, knowledge or attitudes of the individual is not so relevant 
anymore for the job. It is important to remember that the competence curves represent 
the development of competence and its components for a particu lar task domain or job: if 
the task domain changes, the curves necessarily change as well. Periods of adult 
education or training can bring up the curves again, or experience; or the drop can have 
long-term effects on the competences of the worker.  
Supply-Demand matching factors 
Cedefop (2014) defines skills mismatch as the “situation of imbalance in which the level 
or type of skills available does not correspond to labour market needs.” Following our 
framework, we would argue that the level at which the c oncept of mismatch should be 
discussed is at the level of competences relative to the jobs (and their associated tasks). 
Our concept would also imply that the mismatch can differently affect the components of 
competences, namely skills, knowledge or attitudes. 
A specific case of mismatch is when the worker cannot find a job according to her initial 
education, i.e., a trained doctor has to work as a waiter because she cannot find any job as 
a doctor. In this case, the typical development illustrated earlier in Figure 6 would not 
apply. We could picture this situation with two separate curves. The first case 
(underutilised competence) would be identical to Figure 6 until the adulthood period, when 
the absence of any practical application of these competences would lead to a decline in 
skills and knowledge and no expertise accumulation; in other words, a decline in the 
overall competence curve from the adulthood period. Since the frustrated doctor would 
work as a waiter, she would develop the associated competences, which we could picture 
with a second set of curves. In this case, there would be no initial competence 
development before adulthood, because there was no training at all for the waiting 
profession. There would also be a steep accumulation of competence in the beginning of 
                                                      
14 The terms up-skill or re-skill are commonly used, but here we refer to upgrade and increase competences as 
a whole.

the adult period (mostly of a practical skill nature), coinciding with the necessity of 
learning in the practice of a job for which there was no previous preparation. 
6. Conclusions 
There are two main motivations behind this paper. On the one hand, it tries to address the 
confusion and conceptual inconsistency that, in our view, is often found in policy 
documents and papers on the subject of skills and competences. On the other hand, it 
attempts to provide explicit concepts and links for bridging the analysis of the supply and 
the demand side of skills, in education systems and the labour market respectively. In our 
view, the acceleration of technical change in the economy associated with t he digital 
revolution makes increasingly important to integrate the demand and supply perspectives 
in any analysis of skills and competences. 
The cornerstone of our proposal is the strong and direct link that can be established 
between the concepts of task and skill: a skill is the ability to do a task well. On this simple 
basis, it is possible to establish a series of equivalencies between the supply and demand 
side of skills and tasks that provide the basic structure of our framework. The equivalency 
between tasks and skills also allows using task taxonomies to classify the corresponding 
skills in a very practical way. 
In this framework, competence is a much broader concept than skill, because it implies 
being able to cope not only with a number of predefined tasks but also with uncertainty in 
a given domain. This uncertainty, which is an important element in all real -life 
employment contexts, is what explains the importance of the other elements – beyond 
skills – that make up competence: knowledge, attitudes, and expertise. The acquisition and 
development of competence, which in our proposal is always domain -specific, takes place 
throughout the life-course, with the different components growing or declining separately 
in different periods. Typically, initia l education at a young age develops mostly the 
components of knowledge and attitudes, whereas skills mostly develop (and consolidate) 
with their application in an actual work context and expertise accumulates slowly with 
work experience. The overall level of competence of a person in a given domain at a given 
time is an aggregate function of these different components, and can be affected by 
different events such as a change in task content (for instance as a result of technical 
change) which can make some skills obsolete, career shifts or spells of adult education. 
The framework proposed in this paper, thus, has a quasi -symmetrical structure that builds 
upon the basic equivalence between tasks and skills. On each side, tasks and skills cluster 
into domains. Since any domain can incorporate uncertainty in the undefined space that 
lies between its component tasks, these domains become the real -world concepts of job 
(as a particular task domain embedded in the division of labour of an economic 
organisation) and competence (as a general ability to do well in a given task domain). 
As previously discussed, competences encompass other elements beyond skills. In this 
paper, we proposed a production function approach to operationalise this framework, with 
competence being a function of knowledge, skills and attitudes relevant to a given domain, 
with expertise added as an efficiency term since it entails a better use of the available 
cognitive resources, and which is acquired by long -term practice. This operationalisati on 
can also be applied dynamically to the development of competence in a given domain over 
the life-course, as proposed in the last section of this paper with a number of illustrations.

Annex B – Monitoring tasks, skills and competences: some possible indicators 
The conceptual framework presented in this paper provides a consistent definition of the 
key concept of competence, which is composed of four different elements: skills, 
knowledge, attitudes and expertise. These different components evolve over the life course 
of an individual as they are acquired, developed and deployed in education, work, and 
other aspects of life. As  they evolve, they need to be measured consistently, to guide 
policymaking coordinate skills policy in initial education, vocational education, and on -the 
job training.  
An ideal monitoring framework to measure skills, tasks, and competence over time would  
focus on individuals, following their development in education, in the transition to work, 
and throughout their professional life. Implementing this monitoring framework would 
involve developing a dedicated survey, combining standardised testing with qual itative 
self-assessment for skills, knowledge, attitudes and expertise. It would also measure the 
task content of occupations – what people do at work and the skills this requires – 
following the classification presented in this paper (see Figure 1).   
Direct measures of skills and competences across countries are still scarce. The two 
international data sets that come closest to measuring these concepts are the Programme 
for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Programme  for the International 
Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), both developed by the OECD. PISA provides 
internationally comparable survey of students on a relatively narrow set of knowledge and 
skills, including language proficiency and numeracy. PIAAC is measures some skills used by 
adults at work and in everyday life – namely literacy, numeracy, computer skills, but offers 
little to no information on skills for social and physical tasks (see Box 2 below). The other 
important data source is the LFS, whi ch provides national aggregate indicators for early -
school leavers, unemployment, mismatch, expertise, among others.  
Granular data on the skills required in the labour market is also very scarce at the 
European level. Ideally, we would like to know the pr ecise tasks each worker performs (or 
is expected to perform) at work in each occupation. Some data on work organization and 
tasks can be found in international surveys such as the European Working Condition 
Survey (EWCS), conducted every five years by Euro found, but the focus on working 
conditions only partially overlaps with the range of possible tasks described in the 
framework. PIAAC does contain survey information on whether employees are adequately 
skilled for their position, and whether they use the s kills (literacy, numeracy, and digital) 
that they possess in their line of work. However, is mostly cross -section data and not 
available in all EU countries (see Fernández-Macias and Bisello, 2017). 
To improve data on tasks and skills of occupations at the  European level, we would 
suggest to complement the currently available data on tasks with data on job vacancies – 
and the descriptors of requirements therein, which provide the competences (and skills) 
sought by employers in real time. This could allow ca pturing the changing demand for 
skills by employers over time, by collecting the skills that they require in real time. Indeed, 
previous studies such as Deming et al. (2019) used it to track the changing requirement of 
skills across occupation groups in th e U.S., while Tijdens et al.  (2018) relied in part on it to 
quantify skill mismatches by occupations. The JRC has acquired pilot data for the UK from 
Burning Glass Technologies, a commercial provider, and is validating its suitability to act 
as an indicator of occupational tasks and skill demand. Cedefop is also currently testing its 
own data collection platform for European job vacancies, and the JRC is in talks to achieve 
a shared methodology. From an initial analysis of this type of data, it emerges that  it also 
presents some disadvantages. First, the availability of online job vacancies varies by 
country, sector and occupation, which limits representativeness. According to Cedefop, the 
detail of content also changes considerably by European country and l anguage, 
complicating international comparisons. Some sectors, such as the software industry and
<<<PAGE=31>>>
A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences 
 
28 
healthcare, appear to be over-represented relative to their share of total occupation, which 
can only be partially explained by higher turnover in those sector s. Second, online 
vacancies inevitably provide a partial, one-sided perspective of the task and skills required 
for any given position. They emphasise the methods and tools of work – and related skills 
– especially knowledge of a specific software or techn ology, and refer less explicitly to 
other types of skills such as basic literacy or numeracy, which may only be required at an 
advanced level. This is to be expected from the aspirational type of communication use in 
vacancy notices, which will only explic itly mention the skills and competences that it 
cannot take for granted from a typical applicant, leaving basic skill requirements implicit. 
Moreover, vacancy notices provide limited objective task -related information of work 
organization, rarely mentionin g the degree of control or (lack of) autonomy that 
employees in those occupations experience. Overall, online vacancy data can provide a 
valuable complement of a monitoring framework, by providing timely signals about 
emerging skills, but offer limited comparable data of skill use across occupations.  
Box 2: What does PIAAC measure? 
 
The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) 
developed and conducted the Survey of Adult Skills. The OECD defines human capital as 
“the knowledge, skills, competencies and other attributes embodied in individuals that are 
relevant to economic activity” (OECD, 1998, p. 9). Skills are further classified into cognitive, 
technical, communication and interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. In spite of the 
pragmatic approach taken by the OECD, whereby “competencies” and “skills” are used 
interchangeably (OECD, 2013), the PIAAC skills assessment module measures mainly 
cognitive skills (literacy, numeracy and problem solving), and to a limited extent technical 
skills (via computer use) and knowledge (via the literacy and numeracy tests) (see OECD 
2013, p. 101). The survey focuses on key skills needed for individuals to participate in 
society and for economies to prosper. It directly assesses adult proficiency in key 
information-processing skills – literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich 
environments – and gathers information on how adults use their skills at home, at work 
and in the wider community. Hence, from the perspective of our conceptual framework, 
the PIAAC assessment module captures mainly transversal skills, rather than competences 
as defined. It also overlooks the physical and social skills, described in Section 3 of this 
paper. Physical skills relate to physical tasks, involving strength or dexterity. Social skills 
relate to proficiency in tasks such as attending, teaching, influencing or managing. 
 
In the absence of unified data sources to implement this monitoring framework, we 
compile a set of existing indicators that shed some light on tasks, skills and competences.  
Table 1 lists these indicators, reports their source, explains the reason for their inclusion, 
and reports the frequency with whi ch they are collected. Taken together, they can help 
shed some light on the state of skills development and use in the European Union, and can 
be used to benchmark country performance and at guide and monitoring competence 
development policies. However, th ey are imperfect surrogates of a dedicated longitudinal 
survey: most of them capture a snapshot of single life stages (like education or transition 
to employment) and tend to describe cross -sectional national aggregates, rather than the 
evolution of individuals in cohorts. Although there are indicators covering all main aspects 
of the framework, they are not all collected as frequently.  
Annex C lists and briefly describes other existing skills monitoring frameworks.  Compared 
to these other frameworks, the  conceptual framework for tasks, skills and competences 
presented in this document seems better suited to the needs of policy -making. It is also 
the only one directly contemplating tasks and skill demand (WISE being the only one that 
considers tasks). More  importantly, our proposal is unique in integrating the tasks and
<<<PAGE=32>>>
A unified conceptual framework of tasks, skills and competences 
 
29 
skills perspectives and in taking an explicit lifecycle perspective, which helps in 
coordinating the skills policies across stages of life that make up skill ecosystems.    
By adopting a lif elong perspective, the proposed monitoring framework would allow to 
identify problems in competence development at different stages of life. This is relevant 
to identify problems during adolescence before students enter the labour market, such as 
a lack of basic skills because this will compromise future competence development. It can 
also be useful to identify and target the segment of the labour force that may need re -
skilling or up-skilling activities, in terms of either demographics, geography, occupati on or 
industry. Updating the monitoring framework at different points in time would help 
identify the most relevant changes in the area of tasks, skills and competences. For 
instance, the changes in tasks (skills used at work, or sought after by employers)  provide 
valuable information on the change in skills needs – in terms of both skill obsolescence 
and the appearance of new types of skills – which will allow skills development systems to 
change accordingly.

Annex C – A brief overview of existing skills monitoring frameworks 
Education and Training 2020 Strategy (DG EAC) 
“Education and Training (2020) is a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and 
training. It provides common strategic objectives for EU member states, including a set of principles 
for achieving these objectives, as well as common working methods with priority areas.  
There are six objectives described in the following benchmarks for 2020: 
1. Early leavers from education and training: The share of early school leavers from education and 
training aged 18 to 24 should be less than 10%; 
2. Tertiary education attainment: By 2020, the share of 30 -34 years old with tertiary educational 
attainment should be at least 40%. 
3. Early childhood education and training : At least 95% of children between 4 years old and the 
age for starting compulsory education should participate in childhood education. 
4. Employment rate of recent graduates : The share of employed graduates (20 -34 years old) 
having left education and trainin g no more than three years before the reference year should 
be at least 82%. 
5. Low achievers in reading, mathematics and science : The share of 15 years old with insufficient 
abilities in reading, mathematics and science should be less than 15%. 
6. Learning mobility 
o An EU average of at least 205 of higher education graduates should have had a period 
of higher education -related study or training (including work placements) abroad, 
representing a minimum of 15 ECTS credits or lasting a minimum of three months. 
o An EU average of at least 6% of 18 -34 years old with an initial vocational education 
and training (IVET) qualification should have had an IVET -related study or training 
period (including work placements) abroad lasting a minimum of two weeks, or less if 
documented by Europass. 
European Skills Index (Cedefop) 
The European Skills Index (ESI) is developed by Cedefop. It has three pillars to assess how well the 
skills formation and matching systems of EU MS are performing in relation to the degree to which 
they are developing, activating and matching skills reserves within their economies. The ESI focuses 
on these supply and matching aspects of the skills system.  
Each pillar is broken down further into sub -pillars to further organise the indicators into related 
groups. In total, ESI has 3 pillars, 6 sub-pillars and 15 indicators.

Eurostat 
The Eurostat dataset on skills -related statistics contains indicators originating from multiple data 
sources which focus on the following topics:  
● skills supply (the existing skills of the labour force); 
● skills demand (the skills needed by employers); 
● skills development  (the skills developed by participation in education and training 
activities). 
Skills supply and skills demand are measured through three different approaches: 
● indirect measures, for instance skills assumed to be acquired through formal education; 
● direct measures, which are direct assessments of skills through e.g. test scores for skills 
supply; 
● self-reported level of skills, that is people's self-evaluations of skills.

Getting Skills Right: Skills for jobs indicators (OECD) 
Based on O*NET database descriptors, OECD (2017) measures mainly skills needs and mismatch 
indicators. The indicators on skills needs include a mapping of the shortage or surplus for three 
domains of competence: skills, knowledge and abilities.

World Indicators of Skills for Employment (OECD) 
The WISE database provides a statistical snapshot of skills development in 214 countries. It 
contains 64 indicators in five broad areas: 
● contextual factors 
● skill acquisition
