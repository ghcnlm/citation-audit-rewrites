REVIEW ARTICLE
Capacity development for knowledge mobilization:
a scoping review of the concepts and practices
Hamid Golhasany1✉ & Blane Harvey 1
There is a growing emphasis worldwide on the use of knowledge mobilization (KMb) to
improve policies and practices with the latest research evidence. This emphasis calls upon
knowledge producers (e.g., university researchers) to produce more relevant evidence, and
knowledge users (e.g., practitioners) to access and apply evidence. However, doing KMb can
be challenging for these groups without effective support and training. Therefore, individuals
and organizations are undertaking capacity development interventions to facilitate the KMb
process with more effective support structures, skills, and incentives. Despite its recognized
importance, theoretical evidence and practical guidance on capacity development for KMb
are scattered across disciplines and practices. To address this, we conducted a scoping
review study to review the current practices and concepts and identify signiﬁcant gaps. One-
thousand six-hundred thirty records were gathered, and 105 peer-reviewed and gray litera-
ture documents from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed. Two reviewers worked independently in
screening the records, and one researcher analyzed the retained documents. The analysis
reveals that capacity development for KMb is a multidimensional and multiscalar concept and
practice with a diverse range of initiators, initiatives, and beneﬁciaries. This study also reports
on three thematic areas of signiﬁcance emerging from the literature, namely: (a) individuals’
and organizations’ challenges in doing and supporting KMb, (b) the capacities and supports
deemed needed for effective KMb, and (c) the strategies being used for delivering capacity
development. Furthermore, this study identiﬁes evidence gaps related to the process aspects
of capacity development for KMb (i.e., planning), capacity development initiatives being
undertaken in developing country contexts, and results from more formal evaluations of KMb
capacity-building effectiveness.
Introduction and background
C
alls for stronger links between research evidence and policy and practice have become
commonplace across nearly allﬁelds of study in the past 15 years (Powell et al.,2018;
Graham and Tetroe, 2007; Lal et al., 2015). In the ﬁeld of education, for instance,
researchers have established a rich knowledge base over the past decades that could improve
educational practices and help address a wide range of educational challenges. However, many
studies report a considerable gap between actual classroom practices and the potential of

research evidence from educational studies (Cain, 2017; Borg,
2009; Schaik et al., 2018). The use of research knowledge to
improve educational practices and administration has continued
to be described as low, infrequent, intermittent, and inadequate
(Lysenko et al., 2015; Lysenko et al., 2014; Zuiker et al., 2019;
Powell et al.,2018).
To address this gap, research organizations have adopted a
range of strategies, generally referred to as knowledge mobiliza-
tion (KMb), to facilitate and maximize the use of research evi-
dence by knowledge users (Davies et al., 2015; Cooper, 2014).
KMb is understood as the reciprocal ﬂow of knowledge and
expertize between academics, practitioners, policymakers, and
intermediaries that act to facilitate this knowledgeﬂow (Social
Sciences and Humanities Research Council,2019). Alongside this
growing emphasis on KMb, the literature on the processes,
challenges, and incentives for knowledge mobilization has grown
substantially (Powell et al.,2018). A growing set of terms such as
knowledge translation, knowledge exchange, and knowledge
mobilization has also appeared in the literature, which refer to
closely overlapping concepts of mobilizing research evidence into
practice and policy (Bielak et al.,2012; Phipps et al.,2012; Mal-
lidou et al.,2018).
Despite this growing attention, the process of mobilizing
knowledge with a view to creating impact remains slow and
unpredictable, which reduces the perceived beneﬁts of invest-
ments from public resources in scientiﬁc research (Edwards et al.,
2019). A range of challenges has been cited as obstacles to
increasing or accelerating the uptake of research evidence through
KMb, with insufﬁcient resourcing and limited KMb competencies
being among them (Mallidou et al.,2018; Cooper et al., 2018;
Ellen et al., 2013). Moreover, previous research highlights an
inconsistency between research organizations’ mission statements
about KMb and the actual practices they pursue and the support
they offer for engaging in KMb and creating impact (Sá et al.,
2011; Fischman et al.,2018). These challenges point to capacity
development for knowledge mobilization as an important
approach to facilitate KMb practice among individuals such as
researchers and practitioners (Cooper et al.,2018; Bayley et al.,
2018). Capacity development is deﬁned as“the process by which
individuals, groups and organizations, institutions and countries
develop, enhance and organize their systems, resources and
knowledge; all reﬂected in their abilities, individually and col-
lectively, to perform functions, solve problems and achieve
objectives”
(OECD, 2006). This deﬁnition is congruent with the
conceptualization of knowledge mobilization in the academic
literature because it highlights multi-directionality (top-down and
bottom-up), acknowledges the role of both individuals and
organizations, provides comprehensive scope (systems, resources,
and knowledge), and afﬁrms context speciﬁcity.
Despite the importance of capacity development for KMb, this
process has theoretical and practical challenges. Most notably, the
literature on capacity development for KMb, including practical
guidance, is both limited and fragmented, with studies spread
across different disciplines and contexts (Dagenais et al.,2016;
Orem et al., 2014; Bennett et al.,2016). This challenges further
research on capacity development for KMb, and it could threaten
the success of capacity development initiatives. Second, although
some studies have evaluated the individual and organizational
challenges in the KMb process (Oliver et al.,2014; Golhasany
et al.,2020), our understanding of the key factors that could make
capacity development for KMb more effective remains limited
(Tetroe et al.,2008; Murunga et al.,2020). Especially important is
that the intended beneﬁciaries of capacity development, such as
academic researchers, tend to have had little voice over initiatives’
outcomes and processes (McLean et al.,2018). Finally, challenges
around capacity development for KMb are complicated by the
inconsistency between KMb ’s theoretical literature (i.e., what
research theorizes to be working) and KMb practice (i.e., what is
being done in practice). In other words, research shows that the
practice of operationalizing capacity development for KMb is
highly variable, and in some cases has not been evidence-based
(Ward, 2020).
Given the gaps in our understanding of capacity development
for KMb, we argue that studying the available theoretical and
empirical literature may be instrumental in informing future
studies and designing and implementing more effective capacity
development initiatives. Due to the complex, understudied, and
dispersed nature of the evidence available area of study, a scoping
review was deemed the most appropriate methodological
approach (Kastner et al.,2012). This scoping review aims to (A)
obtain a broad picture of KMb capacity development practices
and concepts in the literature and (B) identify the gaps in the
literature and documented practices that might negatively affect
capacity development initiatives and practices.
The following section of the paper describes our methodolo-
gical choice and procedure for reviewing the literature. Then, we
examine the literature on capacity development for KMb and
present the three themes that emerged from it. Finally, the dis-
cussion section evaluates our ﬁndings against previous
understandings.
Methods
Scoping studies (or reviews) are deﬁned as “exploratory projects
that systematically map the literature available on a topic, iden-
tifying key concepts, theories, sources of evidence and gaps in the
research” (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 2010, para:
“scoping reviews”). They are often carried out to identify different
types of evidence, clarify concepts and de ﬁnitions, examine
research methodologies conducted on a certain topic orﬁeld, and
identify key characteristics or factors related to a concept (Munn
et al., 2018; Tricco et al.,2016). For this study, we followed the
method outlined by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), which sets out
ﬁve stages for the review process: (1) formulating the research
question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting the litera-
ture; (4) charting the data; and (5) collating, summarizing, and
reporting the results. The sixth step in this method (i.e., con-
sulting with stakeholders to inform or validate studyﬁndings) is
optional (Arksey and O’Malley, 2005) and not included in the
results reported here. Additionally, to provide more transparency
to the research process, this study followed the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) (Tricco et al.,2018).
The study’s protocol was reviewed by two expert academics
before its commencement and is available online (Supplementary
Table S1).
Formulating the research question. The key objective of this
review is to consolidate the available knowledge of capacity
development for KMb, including the key concepts and practices,
and identify noticeable gaps in the current literature. Therefore,
our approach to the study spanned a range of ﬁelds, regions,
study designs, terminologies, study types (i.e., empirical or con-
ceptual analyses), and publication types (i.e., both peer-reviewed
and gray literature). This broad scope was necessary to capture
the wide range of studies constituting this ﬁeld’s literature.
Accordingly, the study followed this research question:How has
capacity development for KMb been conceptualized and oper-
ationalized to date, based on peer-reviewed and gray literature?In
this research question, the guiding elements were both conceptual
(e.g., What is capacity development for KMb?) and operational

(e.g., how is capacity development undertaken in practice across
different contexts?).
Identifying relevant studies. As noted above, our study aimed to
capture the full breadth ofﬁelds and sources, including gray lit-
erature that is not indexed in academic databases (Berrang-Ford
et al., 2015). We developed our search strategy in consultation
with a university librarian, which comprised of the following: (a)
searching for peer-reviewed publications through the following
databases: Scopus, ERIC (ProQuest), PubMed, EBSCOhost and
Web of Science; and (b) searching in Google Scholar for gray
literature.
There is an inherent complication related to the search terms
for this scoping review. KMb and capacity development
terminology can vary across and within disciplines, even though
these concepts are systematically linked and refer to similar
functions (Bielak et al.,2012). To address this, we used a range of
search terms related to KMb and capacity development. These
included: “knowledge broker*”, “knowledge mobili*”, “knowl-
edge transfer*”, “knowledge translat*”, “knowledge exchange”,
“capacity building”, and “capacity development”. Boolean opera-
tors AND and OR, along with advanced search strategies in the
databases were used. In databases where proximity search options
were allowed, namely Web of Science, ERIC, and Scopus, the
terms strengthen* and support* along with build* and develop*
were used to search with proximity (set within the range of two
words).
For instance, the search strategy for Scopus included using the
following string: “knowledge broker*” OR “knowledge mobili*”
OR “knowledge transfer *” OR “knowledge translat *” OR
“knowledge exchange” AND capacit* W/2 (build* OR develop*
OR strengthen* OR support*). All databases were searched on
June 8th, 2020, and a search limit was applied for the English
language with a publication date of in and after 2010. This was
done to focus on the results that align with the recent
developments in the KMb ﬁeld and to make the study scope
more feasible.
Despite the challenges of including gray literature (Tricco et al.,
2016), we recognize that there may be considerable evidence on
capacity development initiatives captured in institutional reports,
working papers and policy briefs that should not be overlooked.
To include evidence from gray literature in a practical approach,
we followed practices set out in past research and only reviewed
the ﬁrst ten pages of the Google database for the search string
used (Azevedo Perry et al.,2017; Bradford et al.,2016).
Screening and selecting the studies. The authors compiled the
titles and abstracts of gathered records and then removed
duplicates using EndNote software. In theﬁrst level of selection,
two researchers read the titles and abstracts with two criteria for
selection. Testing the reliability of the ﬁrst screening indicated
85% agreement among the researchers with a Kappa score of 0.64,
which is acceptable for interrater reliability, considering our
study’s scope and variability of terminologies (McHugh,2012).
All discrepancies were discussed among the researchers. Based on
our research objectives, we set the following criteria at theﬁrst
level of screening (titles and abstracts):
1. Does the title or the abstract of the document point to the
goal for increasing the uptake of knowledge in practice,
policy or production of products as the central focus of the
document?
2. Does the title or the abstract of the document point to
developing, enhancing and organizing individual or collec-
tive systems, resources and knowledge to perform KMb
functions as the central focus of the document?
The second screening level involved reading the records in full
text to ensure they passed our selection criteria. At the second
screening level, our scoping review targeted documents with a
clear focus on capacity development for KMb. The reason for
different screening levels was to achieve more explicit focus on
capacity development for KMb in the selected records. Therefore,
studies focusing on capacity building more broadly (for instance,
building research capacity); or documents on KMb practice
without a clear capacity development element were excluded. All
conceptual and empirical studies (e.g., case studies, commen-
taries, and review papers) were included except protocol papers.
The criterion for the second screening level asked: Does this study
provide speciﬁc empirical evidence or conceptual guidance on
developing, enhancing and organizing individual or collective
systems, resources and knowledge to perform KMb?
Charting the data. Once theﬁnal selection of papers was iden-
tiﬁed, one researcher read each document to chart the data on
some predetermined features (Table 1) related to capacity
development for KMb. Charting the data based on the initial
framework helped us to have a systemic approach in analyzing
the documents and obtaining a broad picture of included con-
cepts and practices. Two researchers piloted data charting of ten
documents, and then one researcher continued with the rest of
the documents (Supplementary Table S2). The following are the
features or dimensions that were used for charting the data:
It should be noted that categorizing every document based on
predeﬁned criteria is difﬁcult (Glegg et al.,2019; Bornbaum et al.,
2015). This is because of the included documents’ variability and
the present study’s broad scope (Arksey and O’Malley, 2005). For
instance, some studies lacked adequate reporting, referenced
necessary information in other unincluded documents, or could
be placed in multiple categories.

Summarizing and reporting the results. To summarize the data
found in the included studies, we followed Arksey and O’Malley’s
(2005) data analysis approach, paying special attention to the
process, rationale, and contexts identiﬁed in each study. The
analysis continued with an iterative and re ﬂective process of
reading extracted information, referring to the original studies
and discussing the emerging key themes among the researchers.
The narrative accounts for the underlying elements within these
themes and highlights the literature’s gaps, dominating issues,
major trends, and broader practice implications (Levac, 2010).
Findings
This study collected a total of 1630 records from various sources,
including 472 from Scopus, 30 from ERIC (ProQuest), 202 from
PubMed, 284 from EBSCOhost, 542 from Web of Science, and
100 from Google Scholar. After screening these records, 105 of
them were deemed eligible for inclusion (see Fig.1). Among the
included records, 102 were peer-reviewed published studies and
three were classiﬁed as gray literature (i.e., they were not from
traditional academic or commercial publishing channels). The
gathered records also included conceptual papers (e.g., com-
mentaries), empirical papers, case studies, and review papers. The
majority of the gathered literature were health-related studies,
followed by education studies, while the remaining studies were
either multidisciplinary or did not specify their ﬁeld of focus.
Moreover, most studies came from developed countries (namely,
Canada, Australia, and the UK), with very few coming from
developing country contexts. This distribution is noteworthy,
given the pressing need for evidence-informed and contextually
relevant policy and practice in developing countries as well.
What information and priorities inform the initiation of
capacity development for KMb? In the literature on capacity
development for KMb, studies often start by describing the
challenges knowledge producers or users face in doing KMb and
then propose initiatives to develop capacities for supporting and
facilitating this process. This challenge description varies from
engaging exclusively with the academic literature to scoping their
target group’s speciﬁc challenge and context. This scoping usually
consists of identifying, contextualizing, and delineating the
bounds for the speciﬁc KMb challenges of the intended bene-
ﬁciary. Scoping allows for establishing a logical relationship
between the identiﬁed challenge, necessary capacities, potential
delivery strategies, and contextual factors such as assumptions,
values and available resources. This is often referred to as tai-
loring or contextualizing capacity development initiatives (Lee-
man et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2016; Fairbrother et al., 2016;
Leeman et al., 2017; Dobbins et al.,2018; Dobbins et al.,2019;
Moore et al.,2016). The scoping process also provides a baseline
for KMb challenges that is important for evaluating the outcomes
and impact of the intervention (MacGregor et al.,2013; Uneke
et al., 2015a; Dobbins et al.,2019; Williamson et al.,2019).
Despite the importance of scoping KMb challenges for capacity
development, we found instances in the reviewed texts where
studies do not provide a clear case of the KMb challenges and the
affected groups. This can especially occur when new mandates or

Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol (Page et al.2021).

leadership in organizations prioritize KMb, when new govern-
ment funding is provided, or in review studies of capacity
development with a general sense of KMb challenges. This section
reviews the methods used to undertake a scoping of KMb
challenges, as well as the most common challenges cited in the
literature as the basis for capacity development for KMb. In the
documents that we reviewed, 45% (47 of 105) reported under-
taking a scoping of the KMb challenges relevant to capacity
development. Speciﬁcally, among these 25% (12 of 47) discussed
establishing a capacity baseline, 34% discussed knowledge users’
KMb challenges (16 of 47), 15% discussed knowledge producers’
(7 of 47), and 40% discussed challenges in organizations (20
of 47).
The ﬁrst major sub-theme emerging from this literature is
insufﬁciently established KMb baselines or the lack of data in this
regard in the literature on capacity development for KMb. In our
review, some studies highlighted the lack of information about
the current capacity of individuals and organizations in many
KMb capacity development initiatives. Accordingly, evaluations
and assessments were carried out or proposed to understand the
current capacity to produce and use relevant evidence (Ellen et al.,
2013; Waqa et al., 2013; Uneke et al., 2015a; Stamatakis
et al., 2017; Uneke et al.,2017b; Visram et al.,2018; Bornbaum
et al.,2015). Understanding current capacity can help to identify
strengths and areas where improvements are most needed.
Moreover, this understanding will help to ensure initiatives ’
suitability for particular contexts and realities (Stamatakis et al.,
2017; Haynes et al., 2018) (Wilson et al., 2011; Makkar et al.,
2016; Brennan et al.,2017). For this purpose, measures such as Is
Research Working for You? (Dobbins et al., 2018), Staff
Assessment of engagement with Evidence (SAGE) (Makkar
et al., 2016), Seeking, Engaging with, and Evaluating Research
(SEER) (Brennan et al., 2017), and Organizational Research
Access, Culture and Leadership (ORACLe) (Makkar et al.,2016)
were developed or used in the literature to obtain a picture of
current capacities to engage in KMb.
Knowledge user challenges. On the individual user side (e.g., decision-
makers, practitioners), limited skills and motivations for accessing,
interpreting, and applying evidence are reported as signiﬁcant bar-
riers to increasing the uptake of evidence (LaPelle et al.,2006; Lee-
man et al.,2017;U n e k ee ta l . ,2017a, b; Dobbins et al.,2018;E d w a r d s
et al.,2019; Barratt and Fulop,2016;G r a ye ta l . ,2013; Moore et al.,
2018; Ongolo-Zogo et al.,2018
). Furthermore, the literature indi-
cates that the existence of multiple sources of information that are
not completely research-based, as well as the knowledge users’
limited ability to evaluate research and connect it to their practices,
might be a contributor to low and infrequent use of research
(Cooper et al.,2017;V i s r a me ta l . ,2018). Beyond research access/
application skills, other important challenges are developing a
favorable attitude toward evidence use, managing time constraints,
and obtaining institutional support and resources (Barratt and
Fulop, 2016; Brennan et al.,2017;H o l m e se ta l . ,2014; Eames et al.,
2018;T a t ee ta l . ,2019).
Knowledge-producer challenges . At the individual knowledge-
producer level (e.g., researchers), studies most prominently con-
ﬁrm the role of organizations in either supporting or limiting
KMb engagement. Studies report that the most signiﬁcant chal-
lenges to researchers’ participation in KMb are related to the
traditional institutional rewards systems that prioritize research
productivity over other performance metrics (Cain et al.,2018;
Cooper et al., 2018; Lal et al., 2015; Murunga et al., 2020).
Another major challenge to researchers is the lack of necessary
institutional support for KMb, which limits access to KMb
funding, training, and infrastructure (Cooper et al.,2018). Beyond
the role of organizational supports, researchers ’ inadequate
knowledge of the current landscape of policy and practice, limited
ability to link and engage with non-academic partners, and dif-
ﬁculties in collaborating with non-academic partners have been
described as other key challenges (Barwick,2016; Lal et al.,2015;
Edwards et al.,2019; Reed et al.,2014).
Organizational challenges. An important challenge in organiza-
tions is aligning organizational priorities, culture, and KMb
strategy with the amount of support individuals need to engage in
KMb. Therefore, studies that focus on improving alignment
between organizational priorities and reward structures for doing
KMb often discuss cultivating culture shift or culture change in
organizations (Barreno et al.,2013; Przybycien et al.,2011; Ellen
et al., 2013; Ayah et al.,2014; Dobbins et al.,2018; Kislov et al.,
2018; Smits et al.,2018; Williamson et al.,2019). Other important
barriers include resistance to change (Glegg and Hoens,2016),
unclear communication (e.g., clarity of mandates, and roles),
insufﬁcient organizational funding, limited access to KMb
resources (Yost et al.,2014; Dobbins et al.,2019; Smits et al.,2018;
Albers et al., 2020), and ineffective management and leadership
for leading initiatives (Briggs et al.,2010; Masood et al., 2018;
Hunter et al.,2019; Moore et al.,2016; Kislov et al.,2014; Kislov
et al., 2017).
How are capacities being targeted?This section highlights the
most common processes that capacity development studies and
initiatives have undertaken to align the identiﬁed KMb challenges
described above with capacities needed to undertake and support
KMb. More speciﬁcally, after describing the challenges in doing
KMb, capacity development literature typically discusses the
necessary competencies or organizational structures needed to
overcome these challenges. This discussion can be about which
capacities are necessary, how they are identiﬁed, and why they are
prioritized over others based on contextual factors and goals. In
these discussions, studies often select a particular approach or
process to target a list of necessary competencies for doing and
supporting KMb. This linking process is signiﬁcant because it
affects the relevance of initiatives to the needs and challenges of
capacity development bene ﬁciaries. In other words, different
approaches to this process could result in the selection of different
sets of targeted capacities and different capacity development
delivery strategies. For instance, Tait and Williamson ( 2019)
demonstrate that capacity development interventions with the
same delivery strategy (i.e., training) can have different focuses
ranging from teaching the application of KMb theories to
expanding KMb networks.
One of the main approaches reported in the included studies is
conducting reviews to identify necessary KMb capacities and
competencies for organizations and individuals (Edwards et al.,
2019; Alvaro et al.,2010; Boyko et al.,2012; Gagliardi et al.,2014;
Bornbaum et al., 2015). In the included records, 18 literature
reviews were present in our study (17%) and were among the
identiﬁed processes for linking KMb challenges with necessary
capacities (37% of total 49). For instance, Mallidou et al. (2018)
identiﬁed 19 core KMb competencies from the literature, grouped
into three main categories: knowledge, skills, and attitudinal
aspects. The authors were interested in KMb competencies for
those in the health sector.
Another major route that studies have taken in identifying
necessary capacities in connection with the identi ﬁed KMb
challenges is using established frameworks and models. In our
review, 15 studies (30% of 49) used speciﬁc frameworks to extract
KMb capacities or to design interventions based on their
contextual characteristics (e.g., resources). The UK MRC

(Oborn et al.,2013) were among the cited frameworks.
Initiatives also directly engage with their bene ﬁciaries in
capacity development planning to assess their needs, preferences
and goals to identify needed capacities accordingly. In our review,
these engagements took different forms, and we identiﬁed 18
instances of them (37% of 49). For instance, several studies
describe involving the bene ﬁciaries of capacity development
initiatives in priority setting and needs assessment to increase the
relevance of the interventions (Gerrish,2010; Straus et al.,2011;
Wahabi and Al-Ansary,2011; Wilson et al.,2011; Holmes et al.,
2012; Thomson et al., 2019; Gagliardi et al., 2015). These
engagements and assessments were in the form of doing
environmental scans (Holmes et al., 2012), directly assessing
researchers or knowledge users’ KMb needs (Peirson et al.,2012;
Allen et al., 2013; Waqa et al., 2013; Barratt and Fulop, 2016;
Thomson et al., 2019), interviews with management and
responsible staff (Wilson et al., 2011; Ellen et al., 2013;
Fairbrother et al.,2016), participatory program designs (Bennett
et al.,2016
; Eames et al.,2018), Appreciative Inquiry (Hung et al.,
2018), learning by doing (Keita et al.,2017), and integrated KMb
(Park et al.,2018).
How is capacity development being delivered?The ﬁnal stage of
capacity development that emerged as a theme relates to delivery
strategies, which were reported in 58% of documents (61 of 105).
Delivery strategies refer to the actual interventions (e.g., a
workshop) and the speciﬁc goals they pursue (e.g., educating) to
create the KMb support structures or enhance KMb skills. In the
process of capacity development for KMb, after understanding
the audience’s challenges and identifying the necessary capacities
for doing and supporting KMb, the literature often describes
these strategies. This description often explains why a particular
strategy (e.g., organizing a workshop) has been chosen to deliver
capacity development, what measures are taken to ensure its
relevance to its beneﬁciaries, and the experience of, or challenges
in adopting this strategy. For instance, Gagliardi et al. (2015)
demonstrated that users would need ﬂexibility, ongoing access
and tailored support in mentorship as a strategy for capacity
development.
We identiﬁed three broad goals for capacity development that
were articulated in the delivery strategies: (a) providing educa-
tional and skills-development opportunities (43% of 61 docu-
ments), (b) facilitating relationships and access to other
stakeholders (40% of 61 documents), and (c) increasing the
beneﬁciaries’ self-reliance in doing KMb (17% of 61 documents).
However, these three categories are not mutually exclusive as
many share overlapping goals, and many initiatives might utilize
multiple strategies concurrently.
Capacity development initiatives documented in our review
employed educational and skills-development strategies to
provide their participants with better KMb-relevant skills,
knowledge, competencies, and attitudes. Educational initiatives
include providing KMb training programs (Przybycien et al.,
2011; Bhogal et al.,2011; Holmes et al.,2012; Uneke et al.,2015a;
Masood et al.,2018; Ho et al.,2011; Ginossar et al.,2018; Moore
et al., 2018; Park et al.,2018; Jessani et al.,2019) or organizing
smaller educational events such as workshops (Briggs et al.,2010;
Wahabi and Al-Ansary,2011; Ho et al.,2011; Allen et al.,2013;
Waqa et al.,2013; Uneke et al.,2017a; Uneke et al.,2018b). Other
educational initiatives include mentorship or peer-support
opportunities (e.g., KMb champion and role modeling) (Straus
et al.,2011; Brownson et al.,2017; Ho et al.,2011; Pettman et al.,
2013; Gagliardi et al.,2014; Lachance et al.,2019; Gerrish et al.,
2011; Gagliardi et al., 2015). These educational interventions
differ in length, targeted capacities and competencies, and
participant size. Moreover, initiators often incorporate various
educational concepts within the educational strategies to enhance
capacity development. These concepts can include problem-based
learning (Bhogal et al., 2011; Wahabi et al., 2015), cognitive
learning theory and adult learning theory (Straus et al.,2011),
peer teaching and self-directed learning (Wahabi and Al-Ansary,
2011), and blended and experiential learning models (Gerrish and
Piercy, 2014; Harper and Dickson,2019).
Another category of initiatives in this study is those with
relational goals to improve access, networks, connections and
relationships between different stakeholders. These included
strategies such as building networks and increasing co-creation
opportunities for organizations and individuals (Murnaghan
et al., 2013; Campbell et al.,2017; Mansilla et al.,2017; Haynes
et al., 2020; Green et al.,2012; Johnston et al.,2010; Hung et al.,
2018), providing secondment opportunities (Gerrish, 2010;
Gerrish and Piercy, 2014; Jenkins and Anstey, 2017; Kislov
et al.,2018; Uneke et al.,2018b; Uneke et al.,2018a; Hope,2016),
creating communities of practice (Bazyk et al., 2015; Masood
et al.,2018; Hurtubise et al.,2016; Wolfe et al.,2019), organizing
joint events (Laing and Wallis,2016; Mulvale et al.,2017; Reed
et al., 2014), establishing advisory committees (Uneke et al.,
2015b; Keita et al.,2017), and establishing KMb platforms and
forums (Edwards et al.,2019; Haynes et al.,2020; Ongolo-Zogo
et al., 2018).
The last category of capacity development strategies we
identiﬁed aims to provide researchers or knowledge users with
more self-reliance in doing KMb. Speciﬁcally, these initiatives
often focus on enhancing the accessibility of KMb support to
participants as a basis for their selection and design. Examples of
these initiatives include creating guidelines for partnering with
non-academic partners, templates for writing simple language
summaries, and checklists and assessment criteria for assessing
the quality of engaged research proposals (Holmes et al.,2012;
Yost et al.,2014; Makkar et al.,2016; Uneke et al.,2017c; Hunter
et al., 2019; Lachance et al.,2019; Leeman et al.,2017; Barwick,
2016; Stamatakis et al.,2017). Yost et al. (2014) argue that these
tools facilitate the KMb process, provide accessibility, and
increase users’ conﬁdence. Thomson et al. (2019) also highlight
the need for accessibility and increasing reach in offering capacity
development and demonstrated that accessibility could be
increased by using different formats (e.g., webinars) instead of
traditional in-person events (e.g., workshops).
Discussion
This scoping review provides a landscape of the literature on
capacity development for KMb and highlights some of its
important theoretical and practice gaps. This review has shown
that capacity development for KMb has a multidimensional scope
in terms of actors involved (in terms of both initiators and
beneﬁciaries), intervention levels, and intervention types and

characteristics (such as accessibility and relevancy). While there is
a wide range of literature on capacity development in relation to
KMb, the following section reviews the insights and gaps in
knowledge and practice that emerge from the review. We focus
on ﬁve key themes.
Organizations as both catalysts and sites for capacity devel-
opment. Literature on KMb has emphasized the role of organiza-
tional support and incentives and has demonstrated that the lack of
engagement in KMb among knowledge producers or users is
mainly a function of organizational support (Cooper et al.,2018;
Golhasany et al.,2020;G o p a u le ta l . ,2016; Zuiker et al.,2019). For
instance, receiving effective support from research organizations to
engage in KMb remains an entrenched challenge for academic
researchers, as previous studies have highlighted for several years
(Sá et al.,2011; Cooper et al.,2018). However, our study also shows
that despite the evidence about the importance of organizational
support for KMb, most capacity development initiatives target
individual-level capacity development. 46% of documents included
in this review targeted individual-level capacity development, while
26% of documents were related to the organizational level. Parti-
cularly signiﬁcant is theﬁnding that only 6% of documents in our
review focused on knowledge-producer organizations.
This tendency to focus on the individual is also reﬂected in
delivery strategies for capacity development. Our review classiﬁed
delivery strategies into educational, relational, and self-reliance
categories. Consistent with other studies, our review showed that
delivery strategies with educational goals were the most common
capacity development for KMb (43% in the present study)
(Mallidou et al.,2018; Murunga et al.,2020; Oborn et al.,2013).
Furthermore, more evidence is necessary on delivery strategies
with dedicated goals for organizational capacities such as hiring
knowledge mobilizers (Bornbaum et al.,2015; Glegg and Hoens,
2016; Dobbins et al., 2018; Smits et al., 2018). This mismatch
between actual capacity development practices and what the
evidence suggests are the most needed supports may be due to the
resources needed for capacity development at the organizational
level. Literature suggests that capacity development at this level
requires a suite of multi-level and multi-faceted interventions to
bring any practical and impactful changes, and this might be
unaffordable or unviable for some capacity development
initiatives (Williamson et al.,2019; Zuiker et al.,2019; Murunga
et al.,2020; Gray et al.,2013; Kislov et al.,2014). Thus, a key task
for research organizations, including universities, will be to
understand how their organizational incentives and practices
might need to evolve in order to strengthen and sustain KMb.
Relational dimensions of KMb are critical but understudied.
The second insight is about the relational goals in strategies for
KMb capacity development. Beyond offering opportunities for
co-learning and developing trust among partners (Straus et al.,
2011), relational strategies can be impactful in building the
capacities for KMb by helping to produce more relevant research
outputs and educating participants to engage in KMb activities
(Gerrish, 2010; Dilkes et al.,
2011; Boyko et al.,2012; Allen et al.,
2013; Murnaghan et al.,2013; Restrepo et al.,2014; McCay et al.,
2015; Mansilla et al.,2017; Mulvale et al.,2017; Hung et al.,2018;
Dannevig et al.,2019;O ’Brien et al.,2019). For instance, Edelstein
(2016); Haynes et al. (2020); Hope (2016); Cooper et al. (2017)
found that research partnerships with community partners build
capacity for research use by giving more access to data, providing
professional development opportunities, and creating more out-
puts for knowledge users, making KMb ‘built-in’ to research
projects, and inducing more systemic changes. We refrain from
using the term“effective” to assess the contribution of relational
strategies due to the limited available evidence about the effec-
tiveness of relational versus educational strategies to capacity
development for KMb. Furthermore, a remarkably wide range of
activities found in the literature can be considered relational,
from research engagement with knowledge users to research done
by clinicians and practitioners with scienti ﬁc advisors. This
diversity of activities, paired with limited evidence on effective-
ness, presents an opportunity for considerable future research and
learning.
Diversifying the evidence base on capacity building for KMb.
The third insight emerging from this study is about the geo-
graphical representation of capacity development initiatives
documented in the literature, which are highly skewed toward
western developed countries (more than 80%). It is important to
consider that the sociopolitical contexts (e.g., access to policy-
makers) between developed and developing countries are very
different. Therefore, consistent with past literature (Jessani et al.,
2016; Murunga et al., 2020), we voice our concerns about the
transferability of this body of evidence to low and middle-income
countries as capacity development is highly context-dependent.
Further investment into research and programming on capacity
development for KMb in under-served regions, particularly in the
global South, seems highly appropriate, and attention should be
given to documenting both processes and their results.
Documenting capacity development processes in KMb. Our
review also identiﬁed a signiﬁcant evidence gap in this literature
on the process aspects of capacity development, particularly when
compared to the evidence available on outcomes. While outcomes
represent the skills, structures, and attitudes that initiators seek to
develop in individuals and organizations, the process aspect
relates to the design and delivery of capacity development
initiatives. Kislov et al. (2014) highlighted a similar distinction
between content and strategic thinking in capacity development.
This gap challenges capacity development with insufﬁcient and
sometimes inconsistent evidence and practices, and limited gui-
dance about the optimal ways of assessing and linking the ben-
eﬁciaries’ needs to the necessary capacities and delivery strategies.
Moreover, we found limited evidence available on how individual
and organizational values, available resources, or the use of
established KMb theories shape capacity-building design or
implementation (Mulvale et al., 2017; Murunga et al., 2020).
Despite a wide recognition that the contextualization and tailor-
ing of initiatives is a key to the success and effectiveness of
initiatives (Fairbrother et al., 2016; Lachance et al., 2019), our
review found limited evidence on processes for doing so. Leeman
et al. (2017) highlight this shortcoming in the literature and argue
that the “one-size-ﬁts-all” approach would limit the effectiveness
of capacity development in different contexts.
To contribute to building more evidence on the process aspects
of capacity development for KMb literature, we suggest the
following two areas for action. The ﬁrst is providing greater
speciﬁcity and consistency in reporting on initiatives related to
capacity development. We suggest the following seven speciﬁca-
tions that would strengthen the evidence base linking capacity
development processes to their outcomes: (1) speciﬁc audience
proﬁle and their KMb challenge, (2) pro ﬁle of the capacity
development initiator, (3) the level and scope of intended change
(i.e., individual or organizational), (4) how the targeted capacity/
capacities have been identiﬁed, (5) how the delivery strategy was
chosen and executed, (6) what outcome and process indicators
were used, and (7) key contextual variables such as assumptions,
values and resources. Second, scholars and practitioners might
draw on evidence from otherﬁelds (e.g., management studies) for

guidance (Oborn et al.,2013). As an instance of such reference, in
our review, studies such as Bennett et al. (2016); Holmes et al.
(2014); Eames et al. (2018) draw guidance from the Potter and
Brough (2004) model of capacity development. The Potter and
Brough (2004) model allows linking different aspects of capacity
development, like the role of individuals and organizations, to
create a more systemic approach to capacity development in
different contexts. Their model incorporates a hierarchy of needs
in capacity development that correspond to a series of
interconnected levels (Potter and Brough,2004).
Limited evidence on the evaluation of capacity development for
KMb.A ﬁnal gap that our paper identiﬁes relates to theoretical
evidence and practical clarity on using evaluative practices for
capacity development for KMb. In the literature reviewed for this
study, assessing current capacity, establishing a baseline before
the commencement of capacity development, and measuring
changes in skills and supports was not common practice. This
lack of assessment limits our understanding of the effectiveness of
different capacity development approaches and delivery strategies
(Gray et al., 2013). This gap might be because evaluation and
assessment are time and resource-intensive (Stamatakis et al.
2017). However, our review suggests that another potential
challenge to using evaluations might be due to differing inter-
pretations of what evaluation is and what it should cover in
capacity development initiatives and studies.
In some initiatives, evaluation can mean planning and
delivering initiatives that are deemed user-friendly based on the
feedback of intended participants (Ginossar et al.,2018; Haynes
et al.,2020). For instance, capacity development initiatives report
whether their interventions were “well-received” (Tait and
Williamson, 2019), and participant feedback (through surveys
and interviews) assesses whether initiatives were accessible,
relevant, and interesting in terms of quantity and quality (Park
et al., 2018). The literature on KMb capacity development can
also portray evaluations and assessments as a mechanism to
advance and establish KMb learning and achievement of
individuals and organizations (Murunga et al., 2020; Scarlett
et al., 2020; Bornbaum et al.,2015). For instance, Donnelly et al.
(2014, p.53) point out that “conceptualizing evaluation as a
change process and an approach to measure change opens the
door for evaluation to be considered a mechanism of IKT
[integrated knowledge transfer]”. Usually, in this sense, studies
measure and compare the skills, attitudes and structures for doing
and supporting KMb before and after the interventions.
Finally, the literature sometimes deﬁnes evaluation as capacity
development’s contribution to increasing research uptake and
informing policies and practices (Kreindler,2018;T a t ee ta l . ,2019).
For instance, Thomson et al. (
2019) listed changes in patient care
outcomes, such as hospital stays, as a contribution of their KMb
capacity development initiative. Even though all of these
interpretations of capacity development evaluation are informative,
we need better guidance on using different approaches under
various contexts to save more resources and maximize learning.
Limitations
Our study intentionally sought to review a vast scope of the
available literature on capacity development for KMb. However,
the large volume and scope of the gathered documents and their
varied goals and designs presented some limitations. First and
foremost, given the cutoff date used for collecting records, data and
documents after June 2020 have not been included in the analysis.
This may miss the most recent developments in theﬁeld. Fur-
thermore, our study used inductive analysis to identify emerging
themes, which proved to be challenging for data classiﬁcation,
particularly given the broad range of materials we were analyzing.
This meant that there was a level of subjective interpretation that
needed to be applied in analyzing and classifying records. The
high-level representation of studies from predominantly health-
related ﬁelds may be another limitation to generalizing under-
standing from this study to other contexts andﬁelds. This suggests
a need for more published evidence from otherﬁelds.
A ﬁnal notable limitation related to the scoping review method
adopted for this study was that we could undertake citation tra-
cing of references in the included documents to gain more
insights. Even though these limitations do not undermine the
objectives and the nature of this study, they might have impacted
the understanding gained from reviewing the literature.
Conclusion
The ﬁndings from this scoping review provide a broad picture of
the processes, concepts, and complexities of capacity development
for KMb. It demonstrated that most capacity development for
KMb initiatives focus on individuals and providing educational
opportunities. However, as the role of organizational supports and
capacities is emphasized in literature to overcome the challenges of
doing KMb, we believe further research on capacity development
for KMb on organizational levels is warranted. Equally important,
our study argues that the process aspect of capacity development
for KMb is much less researched and discussed than the outcomes
side. This is a signiﬁcant gap in the literature that potentially affects
the effectiveness of capacity development initiatives. Future
research, including experimental studies that are less common in
this literature, is needed to address this gap.
