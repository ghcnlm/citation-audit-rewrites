Foreword 
The Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation is a collaborative movement of 
international parliamentarians, committed to improving policy outcomes and social 
accountability. The goal of GPFE is to create enabling environments for nationally 
owned, tran sparent, systematic, and standardized evaluation processes. Through 
capacity building, knowledge sharing and advocacy, the GPFE supports and empowers 
parliamentarians to deliver evidence-based policy that helps achieve good governance, 
sustainable development, and social equity. In achieving the objective  of GPFE which is 
to support parliaments and governments to institutionalize evaluation, the Forum has 
conducted another comprehensive study to update the NEPs. 
 
The Global Mapping o f National Evaluation Policies  was first started in 2013 by the 
Parliamentarians Forum with support from EvalPartners. The 2013 report was well 
received by many international organizations, parliamentarians and VOPEs. The 
findings of the report were used for advocac y and planning for NEPs at country level. 
The Parliamentarians Forum again with support from EvalPartners, conducted the 
global mapping in 2015 which revealed several development s in NEP s in various 
countries. Both mapping reports were presented and discus sed in many international 
evaluation conferences and analyzed findings in several books and publications. GPFE 
held regional consultations on NEP s in Asia, Africa and MENA regions based on the 
mapping studies. 
 
As it is important to take stock of developments in NEPs, GPFE decided to conduct the 
global mapping again this year. The objective of the study is to provide information on 
the status of national evaluation policies and systems by country, which will be used for 
advocacy initiatives where t here are no such systems. It is noteworthy to see there are 
many developments in NEPs in many countries and more countries have endorsed NEP 
compared to the past. The findings of the mapping will be certainly used by GPFE for 
supporting Parliamentarians and working with VOPEs on NEPs.

Executive Summary 
National Evaluation Policies (NEPs) are developing throughout the world as a means of 
ensuring good and inclusive government policies and programs. In 2013 and 2015 
Parliamentarians Forum for Development Evaluation in South Asia (PFDE) with support 
from EvalPartners issued studies of the status of NEPs. These reports were used as a 
basis for discussions about NEPs as well as in formulating NEPs in several countries. The 
purpose of th e present  mapping report is to provide current information about the 
status of NEPs in countries around the globe. It aims to enhance those discussions and 
supply more information to serve as a basis for NEP s development and 
implementation.  
The methodology used for the study included a desk review of the available literature 
on NEPs, a thorough internet search for information on NEP s by country, a short 
questionnaire sent to Voluntary Organizations for Professional Evaluation (VOPE s) and 
other evaluation professionals , government officials and stakeholders. Triangulation 
was used to confirm and strengthen the self -reported responses. All links to policies 
and documents were double checked for availability and relevance.  
The questions were sent to 132 VOPEs, 19 were returned for incorrect addresses, and 48 
responded with information.   Information on 65 countries was collected from Internet 
sites, professional literature, and other correspondence. A total of 113 countries are 
included in the study.  
The research found an increase in NEPs  from 
2013 to 2021 . In 2013 there were 20 countries 
with an NE P and in 2021 there are 3 5. 
Furthermore, 10 countries are currently awaiting 
legislative approval of their policies.  Countries 
that were developing policies in 2013  and 2015, 
have actualized them  by 2021.  Countries that 
did not have an NEP in 2013 and 2015 but were 
practicing evaluation routinely have , initiated 
NEPs in 2021.  
NEPs vary from country to country to suit the 
context. Like the previous studies, this study 
found 21 countries that routinely conduct evaluation with no NEP. Several countries 
have sectorial evaluation requirements but no NEP.  In others, specific states  that have 
statewide policies but no NEP. Some countries have an NEP and in addition, have 
sectorial policies.

The evaluation function is administered or 
coordinated by a variety of government 
departments. The research found that 21% of the 
countries surveyed designate specific ministries 
or departments for carrying out evaluations, 
while 1 9% assigned the administration and 
coordination to the Ministry of Planning and 
Development. The Executive (President, or 
Cabinet) was the coordinating body in 1 7% of the 
countries. The remaining countries were spread 
equally among the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Audit Office, the Ministry of 
Economic Planning, and separate ministries for each sector. 
 
Along with this  increase in the development, approval, and legislation  of NEPs, there 
has been a trend to focus attention on capacity building, not only for evaluators, but for 
stakeholders as well. In addition, countries are working on National Evaluation Policy 
Frameworks (NEPFs) as precursors to NEPs.  
 
Evaluation frameworks and policies are developing and being formalized around the 
world. Knowledge about such policies increases with experience in the field. The major 
challenges remain - quality, use and follow-up of the evaluations conducted because of 
the NEPF or the NEP. Like in the previous studies, context plays an important role in the 
development and implementation of an NEP. Governments change, political 
personalities replace each other and the situation on the ground is in flux. Thus, NEPs 
should be well integrated into the functioning of governments to ensure sustainability.  
Resembling evaluation itself, NEPs are an iterative process and should be flexible and 
adaptive to the circumstances on the ground.

Mapping the Status of National Evaluation Policies 
1. Introduction  
The present study updates the information gathered in the 2013 and 2015 studies of the 
Status of National Evaluation Policies (NEPs) around the world. The first part of the 
report begins with a discussion of the rationale for this updated report and is followed 
by a brief background of recent developments in the field of worldwide evaluation. The 
second se ction explains the methodology  used in the research . The findings sectio n 
consists of detailed tables of the status of NEPs in countries where accurate 
documentation could be found. The report concludes with challenges, lessons learned 
and suggestions. 
 
In the beginning of the 2010s, interest in NEPs was growing and worldwide in formation 
was not available. Studies were conducted and reported, but nothing on a global scale 
was attempted. The Parliamentarians Forum on Development Evaluation in South Asia 
(PFDE) and EvalPartners initiated two seminal mapping reports, one in 2013 and  the 
second in 2015. These reports have been cited in forums, conferences, and the 
evaluation literature since publication . However, t here have been changes and 
developments in the field since 2015  and it is important for the information on NEPs to 
be as current and accurate as possible . A short list of places where the reports were 
referenced or used as a basis for discussion appears below:

2. Background 
Seven years have passed since the 2015 study. PDFE has grown into the Global 
Parliamentarian Forum for Evaluation ( GPFE), which was launched  on 25 th November 
2015 at the Parliament of Nepal. One of the missions of GPFE is to advocate for NEPs 
and evaluation systems. Advocating involves providing parliamentarians with 
information about existing NEPs, new developments, and experiences from the field.  
 
Several developments have pushed evaluation  and evaluation policy to the forefront. 
The most influential of all has been the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) 
proposed by the UN in 2015. With only nine years left to achieve the SDG s, the UN 
Secretary General has called on all sectors of society and people everywhere to 
mobilize for a Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs. In 2019 the UNDP, Independent 
Evaluation Office held a conference entitled  Leaving No one behind: Evaluation for 
2030.2 The conference theme included national evaluation capacities. The audience 
agreed that building an evaluation culture is a “job for us all.”  Participants confirmed 
that “national evaluation capacities” mean s more than individual capacity of evaluators; 
it also means institutional capacity. A presentation from Botswana illustrated that 
strengthening a Monitoring and Evaluation System (MES)  is not an event, but a process 
that requires commitment from all stakeh olders. Evaluation culture and capacities were 
emphasized. 
In line with the increased interest in capacity, two major events have taken place. One is 
the creation of the National Evaluation Capacity Index (INEC)3 in 2018. This initiative, led 
by the German  Institute for Development Evaluation (DEval) an d the World Food 
Program (WFP ) representing a wide group of governmental and non -governmental 
institutions, is developing the first assessment on National Capacities on Evaluation in  
nine countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. It strives to build evaluation capacity 
in the region with an emphasis on participatory evaluation. 
These developments point to another trend in the evaluation field – Regional Voluntary 
Organization of Profes sional Evaluators. The growth of RNENs and associations has 
promoted evaluation capacity building and development of NEPs  by combining the 
forces of single VOPEs. The ability of regional organizations to lobby for improvements 
has created a platform for discussions about NEPs as demonstrated at the 7th General 
Assembly and Evaluation Conference of EvalMENA4 in 2018 entitled National Evaluation 
Policies in the MENA  Region: Institutional Framework and Process and Processes at 
National and Sub-National Levels.  
 
In 2021 a conference jointly organized by the Congressional Policy and Budget 
Research Department (CPBRD), in partnership with the Senate Economic Planning

Office (SEPO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) -Philippines provides 
further evidence of the potential of regional organizations.5 The Asian Pacific Evaluation 
Association (APEA) is following up with a regional dialogue on NEPS in December 
2021.6   
 
Given the crucial role that evaluation plays in accelerating the achievement of the SDGs, 
the United Nations Population Fund  (UNFPA) Evaluation Office, the EvalYouth Global 
Network and the GPFE joined forces to launch the Eval4Action campaign .7 The 
Eval4Action campaign suggests a mapping of countries that have developed evaluation 
policies and monitoring evaluation systems  as a valuable starting point to inform 
strategy in promoting systematic use of evaluation evidence to inform public 
policymaking presses and improve public service delivery. A further development is the 
EvalAgenda20208, whose vision is to promote  (1) the enabling environment for 
evaluation, (2) institutional capacities, (3) individual capacities for evaluation, and (4) 
inter-linkages among these first three dimensions. 
 
The influence of the European Union and its requirements for evaluation has spread 
among countries that receive grants and aid from the EU .9 According to Ana Diogi, the 
EU is …fueling the awareness and demand for  better policies and use of public funds; 
training opportunities across Europe, such as IPDET, and several online courses may 
reduce the learning curve for several emergent and young evaluators .10 Several countries 
in the same study, The Institutionalisation of Evaluation in Europe, ( Eds. Reinhard 
Stockmann, Wolfgang Meyer, Lena Taube, 2020) , have written that they use evaluation 
only in EU projects related to the Structural Funds and Cohesion Policy 11 (Romania, and 
the United Kingdom) and  others have said that they apply the EU and SDG 
requirements to their local programs (Greece, Italy, Poland) as well.  
 
A recent review of the United Nations system reiterates the importance of human 
resources development, including training, the exchange  of experience and expertise, 
knowledge transfer and technical assistance for capacity -building, which involves 
strengthening institutional capacities, including planning, management, monitoring and 
evaluation capacities.12 National Evaluation Capacity Read iness Assessment efforts are 
taking place as a prerequisite for an NEP in Ethiopia, Iceland, Nepal, and Tajikistan. 
Regional support to standardized training of trainers could widen the pool of trained

evaluators.13   Furthermore, in the health sector, the project, National Evaluation 
Platform took place in Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania from 2014-2016.14 
 
A seemingly natural progression from capacity building is certification. Canada has a 
well-established certification system 15 that reflects the complexities of such a venture. 
Other countries including Japan and Sri Lanka are moving in this direction as well.  
 
Another development is the fast-growing Open Government Partnership 16, which now 
has over 78 country members 17 committed to the idea that an open government is 
more accessible, more responsive, and more accountable to citizens, and that 
improving the relationship between people and their government has long -term, 
exponential benefits for everyone. 
 
The burgeoning interest and activity concerning NEPs and NEPFs is impressive and 
encompassing. The methodology used for this mapping study reflects the breadth of 
the developments. 
3. Methodology 
The present  mapping exercise  attempted to include as many countries and NEPs a s 
possible within the two-month time limit available. It is based on a desk review, an 
internet search, and communication with VOPEs and other stakeholders. Given the 
difficulty of traveling during the COVID era, no face-to-face interviews were conducted 
like in the first two reports and conference attendance was limited to those available on 
Zoom.  
 
The desk review consisted of retrieving and reading previous research concerned with 
NEPs to gain a broad understanding of the fiel d. The publications of the OECD, UNDP, 
UNICEF, WB  and other professional  journals and relevant literature were helpful 
resources. Several recent articles shed light on the situation in Africa. The recent 
publication of The Institutionalisation of Evaluatio n in Europe , (2020) Eds. Reinhard 
Stockmann, Wolfgang Meyer, and Lena Taube was valuable in collecting information 
concerning the 16 European countries covered in the book.  In addition, a  recent study 
of 5 years of evaluation in Norway provided a retrospective view of Norwegian 
evaluation practice and use.18

Contacts were drawn from the IOCE database 19 of VOPEs, Regional VOPEs , and from 
personal connections with evaluators and stakeholders in the field . The questions were 
sent to 132 VOPEs, 49 were returned for incorrect addresses, and 48 responded with 
information. Thus, email contact was successful with 83 addresses with a response rate 
of 58%. 
It was important to keep the communication simple and not overburden respondents 
with a long list of questions . Many informants provided additional information and 
references. In some cases, other colleagues joined in, and a virtual discussion ensued. In 
many case s the letter was resent with a personal note.  Several responses required 
follow-up questions. The respondents were forthcoming and happy to participate in the 
study. The questions appear below. The letter is included in Appendix A. 
 
1.     Does your country have an NEP? 
2.    Is there a document declaring  it? legislating it? decreeing it? If so, what is the link 
to it? 
3.    Who administers the policy? Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and 
Development, the Cabinet, the Office of the President? Others? 
4.    Does it cover all govt. ministries and departments? 
5.    Or is there a separate policy for each sector? 
6.    If there is no formal policy, how is evaluation conducted in your country? 
  
The report is based on the responses of the 48 countries that responded combined 
with information from the in ternet, the literature and personal communications20 on 65 
other countries, making a total of 113 countries. Data was collected from 190 pdf files on 
the countries included in the study. Triangulation of the responses, internet information 
and the literature was conducted to verify the responses, which consisted of self -
reporting in many cases. Most responses included links to government documents and 
other resources. The internet search was complicated by the natural fact that some 
countries maintain websites in the language of the country. In such cases the search 
was conducted via translation software: translating “evaluation policy” into the 
language of the country and translating the website back into English. Alth ough time-
consuming, this technique unearthed valuable information. Another difficulty arose with 
sites uploading slowly. It was often necessary wait a long time for the site to upload.  
See Table 1  for a distribution of the sources of the data collection.  Detailed lists of 
countries and sources of information can be found in the Appendix E.

Once the data was collected  and analyzed, categories emerged. This challenging  
process was complicated because the categories were not clear cut. The definition of 
NEP is as vague as it had been in the previous mappings.  Does a policy have to be 
legislated to be a policy? Can it be a policy if it is regulated but not legislated? Is it a 
policy if it is approved, but not legislated? These questions arose and made it difficult 
to define the status of NEP categorically. In its recent publication, A Study on the Status 
of National Evaluation Policies and System s in Asia Pacific Region 2021 , the Asia Pacific 
Evaluation Association proposed the following definitions: 
 
Integration of Evaluation in Constitution - evaluation function, policy, norms, use, etc. 
has been integrated into the country’s constitution either from the start or through an 
amendment of the constitution.  
National Evaluation Policy  - any principle, rule or standard used to guide the 
government’s decisions and actions in planning, conducting, reporting, or using 
evaluation, or any policy, which may be legislated, decreed, formally announced, or 
directed by the national government. 
Evaluation Act/ Bill - an act/ bill which focuses on the evaluation function, policy, norms, 
use, institutions, etc. and lays down 
guidelines for the same at the 
national government level (centr al 
government level in a federal 
system).21 
 
These definitions are valid in theory. 
However, when confronted with the 
facts on the ground, the distinctions 
are not so clear. In addition, the  
growing appearance of Regulatory 
Impact Assessment ( RIA) or Analysis 
has further blurred the lines. Are RIAs 
evaluation? Do regulatory policies

amount to a policy like in Peru? According to EvalPeru, the Peruvian VOPE, a regulation 
is not an NEP. The findings reflect these complications.  
 
In the previous reports the definition adjusted to the situation and the understanding of 
NEPs at the time. In 2013 NEPs were viewed as a process with a clear ending – 
legislation. However, the road to legislation is long as witnessed by Sri Lanka and the 
Philippines. An NEP can be approved by the cabinet, but not yet made into a law. The 
2015 report viewed the developm ent of NEPs and included varying degrees of 
development in the definition. The present report views NEPs as being either legislated, 
approved, or regulated in the constitution, by law, or by decree . Table 2 presents the 
definitions used by the three studies, 2013, 2015 and 2021. 
 
Table 2: Definitions of NEP in the three studies 
2013 2015 2021 
A legislated policy that 
serves as a basis for 
evaluation across 
government agencies.  
 
A policy that is in the process 
of developing or evolving that 
is officially recognized by the 
government.  
A policy that is legislated, 
approved, or regulated in 
the constitution, by law, or 
by decree.  
 
While it is interesting to compare the three studies , it is important to bear in mind that 
internet technology has improved greatly since 2013. Today, translations are readily 
available, and websites are more complete. The two previous reports included face -to-
face interviews, which on the one hand enriched the  reports, yet on the other confused 
the data. Conflicting reports were common.  Interviewees did not always agree on the 
status of NEP in their countries.  
Lists of the data collection appear in the Appendix  B and C according to the source of 
the information: VOPE contacts, internet search and evaluation literature.  
4. Limitations of the study  
Like with all extensive research there were limitations to this study , the most serious of 
which has been the time frame. The research and the writing had to be completed in 
two months. Under normal circumstances this short time span does not allow enough 
time for respondents to complete the questions thoroughly, requiring repeated emails 
for clarifications. In addition, September and October  are evaluation conference 
months. Thus, many colleagues who would have answered the questions did not have 
the time and requested extensions which would  have been passed the deadline of the 
research itself. Furthermore, a third of the addresses were retur ned as incorrect .
<<<PAGE=19>>>

Despite these obstacles there was a 58% response rate, which far above the average of 
33%.22  
 
Moreover, the research was complicated by the fact that the status of NEPs is fluid. For 
example, Russia has legislated several acts or resolutions that appear to support an 
NEP, but the government has recently cancelled these resolutions with the intentions of 
revising them in 2022. So, the resolutions are in effect until 202 2. In addition, the 
definition of evaluation is not cons istent with other global definitions. Evaluation in 
Russia is closer to performance measurement  or assessment . However, some 
government departments require evaluation of their programs. According to Natalia 
Kosheleva23, they call it strategic audit and performance audit , though except for the 
name, this is evaluation. Thus, it was decided to include Russia in those countries that 
do not have an NEP but conduct evaluation within the government.   
 
Another limitation has been the changing defini tions of NEPs  in the three studies  as 
mentioned above . The three studies could not be compared on all counts since the 
definitions varied. Where possible, comparisons were made.  
 
5. Findings 
The research covered 113 countries and provided a wealth of information concerning 
evaluation practice and policies worldwide. The status  of NEPs  and the information 
across countries varied immensely. Through categorization and analysis, the following 
topics emerged:  
1. The definition and status of NEPs,  
2. The administrators of those policies,  
3. The sectors in which the evaluation function is prevalent 
 
5.1. Status of NEPs 
Clearly, defining a national evaluation policy has not gotten easier since the first 
mapping in 2013. Countries include evaluation requirements in the law, for example 
Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica,  Japan, Korea , and the USA . Some state evaluation 
requirements by decree like Algeria and Azerbaijan. Others provide guidelines but have 
no policy like Lebanon and the UK . Others have a legislated policy but no guidelines  
like the Kyrgyz Republic. Some NEPs are approved, but not legislated like Sri Lanka and 
the Philippines . Others are legislated, but not applied broadly  like Serbia . There are 
some countries that have clear regulations that include evaluation, but are regulations 
and neither policies, nor laws  like New Zealand and Thailand . A few countries do not 
have an NEP but do have states with statewide evaluation polic ies, Australia, India, and 
Pakistan for instance.  Still other s have an NEP for specific sectors , as in Fiji,

Luxembourg, and Poland. Although the data draw a complicated picture of NEPs, they 
indicate that there is a growing commitment to incorporate evaluation into the 
decision-making and policy implementation on the part of the countries in the study.  
Tables 5 and 6  list the countries according to their NEP status.  These categories, which 
emerged from the research are listed below in table 3.

In this study countries with the first three criteria are listed together. Those pending 
approval are listed in a separate table and those practicing evaluation routinely with a 
Monitoring and Evaluation System (MES) or an RIA are listed in a different table.  
 
Whereas the 2015 report found 27 countries with legislated NEPs, this report found 35. 
Seven countries that were evolving or developing NEPs in 2015 now have approved 
NEPs – Benin, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana,  Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Sri Lanka 
and the Philippines have cabinet approval and are awaiting legislation.  Kenya’s revised 
NEP has been approved by the National Development Implementation Technical 
Committee and is awaiting Cabinet approval.  In 2015 there were several countries that 
were categorized as evolving or developing NEPs. Some of those countries are now 
awaiting legislative approval of national evaluation policy frameworks (NEPF) or NEPs 
that they have developed – Argentina, Bhutan, Botswana, India, Nigeria, Trinidad and 
Tobago (not included in the 2015 report ), and Vietnam (not included in the 2015 
report). The research identified 20 countries that practice evaluation routinely, but do 
not have an NEP.  M&E is an integral part of the ir government policies and institutions. 
The findings indicated a trend to focus on capacity building and creating an evaluation

NEPs still vary from country to country . There are formalized and codified  NEPs 
(Mexico, Colombia, Canada) and more flexible  evaluation arrangements (Italy and 
Sweden). There are countries that have elaborate guidelines for evaluation like the U.K. 
but do not have a legislated policy. Others are revising l egislated policies to suit the 
realities in the field (Mexico, South Africa). In other cases, polices have been formulated, 
but not implemented due to changes in government or other conditions in the country 
context. Some NEPs require so many evaluations t hat they cannot be read and used at 
the pace that they are being produced. Thus, the central purpose of requiring 
evaluation is lost. These challenges are discussed at length in  Using Evidence in Policy 
and Practice Lessons from Africa (2020) , Eds. Ian Gol dman and, Mine Pabari. Similarly, 
this issue arises in Japan . Thus, the Japanese government reviews the situation of 
evaluation every year according to Law No. 86, 2001 . The latest review is the Report on 
the Implementation of Policy Evaluation, etc. and t he Reflection of the Results on Policy 
June 2021.24 Sometimes countries formulate a policy and then revise it in response to 
context as a work in progress  for example in Estonia, Korea, and Mexico. The book The 
Government Monitoring and Evaluation System in  India: a work in progress  (2013)25 
reflects this well in the title . In many cases countries do not have an official, legislated 
evaluation policy, but evaluation is conducted in many , if not all , the government 
ministries as a matter of course (Australia, Israel, and Malawi). Models of successful 
systems are well established frameworks like in Canada , Colombia, Mexico, and South 
Africa.  
 
It is encouraging to note that of the 2 2 countries listed as developing an NEP in the 
2015 report, nine have progressed to either having a  legislated NEP or needing 
legislation for an already approved policy:  Benin, Ecuador, Ghana, Mongolia, Niger, 
Peru, the Philippines, and Trinidad and Tobago  have an approved and legislated policy 
while Argentina, Nigeria, are awaiting legislation. Sri Lanka received Cabinet approval of 
her policy in 2015 and has been waiting for legislation since. The Philippines received 
approval in 2019 and has been waiting for legislation since then. Table 4 below shows a 
comparison of the three studies where comparison was possible.

5.2. Administrators of NEP and Sectors where evaluation is practiced 
Countries with or without an NEP channel the processes of the evaluation function 
through a variety of administrative and coordinating bodies. An administrating body 
requests, allocates and checks the process of evalu ation from beginning to end. A 
coordinating body  coordinates among several departments that are responsible for 
evaluations or different aspects of evaluations. In some cases, more than one ministry is 
responsible for evaluations. In others, each ministry carries out its own evaluation 
according to its own needs . Many countries rely on several different bodies. Countries 
have different forms of government  and different contexts . This is particularly true 
concerning administrative or coordinating bodies for the evaluation function. Table 9 
below shows the distribution of evaluation practice in 102 countries across 
administrative bodies as far as can be determined from the research . Information on 
the missing eleven countries was not available. Table 14 in Appendix E contains further 
details.

Examples of countries that have set up special evaluation departments  of their own are 
Azerbaijan, Benin, Bolivia , Costa Rica,  Japan, and Peru. Examples of Evaluation 
departments are” National Council for the Coordination of Social Policies (CNCPS)  in 
Argentina, Gross National Happiness Commission Secretariat  in Bhutan , Ministry of 
Social Development and Family in Chile, Department of Public Expen diture and Reform 
in Ireland, The Government Strategic Analysis Center  in Lithuania, Independent agency 
CoNEVAL in Mexico. Each ministry sets its own evaluation policy. In Israel, for example, 
there is no central evaluation mechanism, but most government m inistries have an 
evaluation unit that reports to the specific ministry. In India the Independent Office of 
Evaluation, Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO), NITI Aayog, has  
been created to consolidate the evaluation function, while maintaining independence 
from any one ministry or department. In some cases, the executive is the coordinating 
body for all evaluations and the evaluations themselves are carried out by separate 
ministries or departments (Malaysia). 
 
5.3. Sectors in which the evaluation function is prevalent 
In general, the countries where the administrator is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
evaluation is conducted on international projects rather than on domestic ones (Austria, 
Finland, Spain). These  countries conduct evaluations for their external development 
projects and not for their internal programs and policies. Local and external evaluators 
have developed evaluation frameworks in cooperation with the large number of donor 
organizations that require an evaluation  component to all programs – evaluation 
assistance is provided from the World Bank, the UN (UNDP, UNICEF, UNDAF), USAID, 
Asian Development Bank, OECD/DAC, the EU to name a few. In some cases, these 
evaluation frameworks develop into sector Evaluation Polic ies (Poland). In others they 
apply only to programs that require evaluation (EU sponsored programs in Greece, 
Romania, donor programs in Guatemala).  
 
In the Education Sector evaluation has been  well-established in many countries 
(Albania, Argentina, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Spain, Poland, UK). In 
some cases, such evaluation is driven by international testing such as OECD's 
Programme for International Student Assessment. Health is one of the first sectors to 
use some form of evaluation or evidence-based policy making  encouraged by the 
WFP-UNDP for example in Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Tanzania . The UK (the National 
Health System), the USA through the Center for Disease Control and Israel through the 
numerous health funds, have influential MESs the health arena.   Another growing area 
of evaluation policy and use is climate change  in part to fulfill the requirements of the 
Paris Agreement on Climate (Fiji, and Norway).  
 
Some countries have an NEP for specific sectors only. These are listed in table 10 below.

6. Conclusions 
In addition to the kinds of NEPs and the variations in the evaluation function among 
the countries survey ed, the research brought to light widespread developments in the 
field of evaluation. These are discussed below.  
 
6.1. Focus on capacity building and enabling environment 
As mentioned in the introduction, t he findings indicate a n increased focus on capacity 
building and creating an evaluation enabling environment within a country while 
advocating for a n NEP (Argentina, Eth iopia, Sri Lanka). The development and 
implementation of the National Evaluation Capacity Index (INCE as per its acronym in 
Spanish) reflects this focus . In a recent working paper , INCE is defined as a group 
venture aimed at developing an index for evaluation capacities by representatives from 
evaluation units of the governments in the region, professional evaluation networks, 
academic centres, civil society organisations  and bilateral and multilateral international 
agencies who contributed to its development through different consultation mechanisms 
(technical meetings, specific consultations, review of consultancy deliverables, etc.). 26 A 
change has taken place in incentives and advocacy for institutionalizing evaluation 
before legislating NEP. The consensus seems to be that establishing a positive enabling 
evaluation environment should be the first step before formulating an NEP. The 
Philippines provides a good example of this trend. They have proposed a National 
Evaluation Po licy Framework which was approved in 2015. The NEP  bill has been 
awaiting congressional approval since 2015. In the meantime, they have created the 
Evaluation Task Force (EFT) to develop the evaluation agenda .27 Another example is Sri 
Lanka, which has had a NEP approved by the cabinet since 2018 and is awaiting 
legislative approval. In the meantime, they are creating academic evaluation programs.   
 
6.2. Different forms of evaluation 
The kinds and uses of evaluation have changed since the 2015 mapping report.  
Countries develop different systems of evaluation and within the same country different 
departments use different systems. A popular system involves performance 
management system (PMS). Depending upon how it is used,  PMSs are a form of 
evaluation. Some countries (Brazil, Ghana, India) promote PMS in various form, which is 
different from  program evaluation that closely examine s the workings of a program. 
Some countries combine the two (Benin, Uganda, South Africa).  Gaining popularity are 
forms of Rapid Results Initiatives (RRI) because of the shorter time needed to perform 
the evaluation (Kenya. Uganda). Kenya and Uganda introduced the National Integrated 
M&E Strategy (NIMES), which improved policy formulation and implementation .28 New

Public Management (NPM) has been the driver in some countries like India (Division in 
the Indian Cabinet Secretariat) , New Zealand (Office of Auditor General) and Australia 
(Australian Public Service Commission).  Results-based evaluation (RBE)  is strong in 
Austria, Iceland, Luxemburg, Mongolia, and Peru. Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) 
has been incorporated into many e valuation systems (Belgium, Czech  Republic, 
Portugal). 
 
The increasing use of RIA has influenced the spread of evaluation use and the drive for 
NEPs. As defined in an Israeli Oversight Committee document, RIA is an international 
model that helps in making decisions and evaluating their effects. beneficial to the public. 
At the end of the process, it is made transparent in a public report. 29 Because of privacy 
and transparency issues RIA sometimes conflicts with evaluation. It is important to 
ensure that the evaluation process fits the regulatory requirements  and not at the 
expense of either one. Value-for-money is another term that has been mentioned as a 
rationale for conducting evaluations (Ireland, Singapore, and South Africa).   
 
The research indicate s an increase in use of ex -ante evaluation. In 2019, t he 
government of Benin decided to have an ex -ante evaluation prior to any project, 
program or action plan being submitted for approval .30 In Chile, the Ministry of Social 
Development evaluates ex -ante and ex post in social programs of all ministries. In 
Japan, more ex -ante evaluations were conducted on public works than ex -post 
evaluations in 2020 .31 Another interesting development is the  rising interest in self -
evaluation as practiced in Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea.  
 
In terms of evaluation use, evidence -based policy making is becoming more 
widespread in Brazil, India, Japan, Lithuania, the Philippines, Uganda, and the USA . 
Goldman and Pabari,  confirm this influence  on African governments: there are African 
examples of policy makers using evidence from evaluations and evidence synthesis, of 
experimentation in approaches to evaluation and evidence synthesis, and evidence use is 
being discussed in national and international platforms.32 
 
6.3. Government programs and polices vs. donor driven programs and projects     
Like the other two studies, the 2021 study  showed a distinction between government 
programs and policies and development programs funded by outside donors. 
Evaluations are performed according to donor requirements  in Bangladesh, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Palestine, Slovakia, Trinidad & Tobago  for example . Many wealthier 
countries that donate funds to less wealthy countries have formulated evaluation

policies and mechanisms for the international programs they fund for example, 
Denmark and Luxembourg. In the past, their own teams would conduct the evaluations, 
however, since the Paris Declaration in 2005, a high-level effort has been made to work 
as partners and not in the former paternalistic construct. Fortunately, many countries 
have learned from the donor requirements for M&E and have applied them to their  
own programs and policies . An example of such transfer is inspired by the Adaptation 
Community 33 , which focuses on climate change . The organization stresses the 
importance of M&E, has its own evaluation policy, and provides resources for members. 
Thus, some countries have evaluation policies in conjunction with climate control 
activities, for example Fiji and Morocco.34  
 
7. Challenges, Lesson Learnt & Suggestions 
Here we discuss the challenges involved in creating an NEP and the lessons learned 
from the research. The report ends with suggestions based on the research.  
 
7.1. Challenges concerning NEPs 
It is clear from the study that evaluation frameworks and policies are emerging around 
the world. As more policies are implemented, understanding of the challenges involved 
grows. The major challenges concern quality, use and follow -up of the evaluations 
generated by the policy. These are complicated by the  practical conditions on the 
ground. Development of an evaluation policy is an iterative process, and any such 
policy should include room for adaptations and flexibility. 
  
The complexities are reflected in  the activities in the field. The 2019 UNPD, IEO 
conference Leaving No one behind: Evaluation for 2030 , highlighted the challenges 
inherent in NEPs and evaluation in general.  The participants made it clear that 
monitoring and evaluation is not just a technical process, but also a political one.  
Evaluations should address participation, voice and power an d are central to 
institutionalizing equity. Implementation is not always simple. However, this is not an 
easy process . The Nepalese representative mentioned the following challenges: Data 
disaggregated by socio -economic and spatial considerations are not available impeding 
equity-focused and gender-responsive M&E. Both demand and supply sides of evaluation 
have limited capacity to facilitate, conduct and use outcomes of rigorous evaluations.  
 
These issues have taken center stage since the last mapping reports and were central to 
the 2021 conference jointly organized by the CPBRD, in partnership with the SEP and 
the (UNICEF-Philippines addressed the challenges faced by institutionalizi ng an NEPF. 
Violeta Corpus, director of NEDA, asserted: the main obstacles involve enlisting 
cooperation and engagement of stakeholders, finding qualified local evaluators, and

difficulty in securing stakeholder use of the findings.  This statement points t o the need 
for capacity building, not only for potential evaluators, but for stakeholders and 
parliamentarians as well. VOPEs try to influence policy but have limited power. They 
generally strengthen and reinforce the professional side of the evaluation eq uation. 
Efforts are made to interest stakeholders and to provide information about evaluation. 
Some evaluation organizations promote evaluation through advocacy and are 
successful in pooling resources and influencing those with power. The great 
accomplishment of gaining international support for designating 2015 the International 
Year of Evaluation has done much to place the issue squarely on the agenda. However, 
influential champions are needed to move forward.  
 
7.2. Lessons learned from the research  
There has been a great deal of activity surrounding the subject of NEPs. An increasing 
number of countries are interested in improving the capacity and i mplementation of 
evaluation an d recognize the role an NEP plays in the process . 35  A greater 
understanding of the need for preparation and capacity building has developed. The 
following lessons emerged from the research.  
1. Developing a good NEP is a slow and iterative process. 
2. A well thought out NEP system is better than a policy that is  too difficult to 
implement. 
3. Evaluation policy being in place is not enough to institutionalize evaluation. 
4. Implementation does not always follow an NEP.  
5. An NEP is not the only way to ensure that evaluation is conducted and used, but 
it is a good option t o ensure relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and 
sustainability.  
 
These challenges and lessons lead to the suggestions in the following section. 
 
7.3. Suggestions 
According to the challenges mentioned above and the lessons learned from the 
research we make the following suggestions. 
1. Devise an all-encompassing NEPF before moving on to an NEP. 
2. Include a formal and strategic plan for implementation in the NEP. 
3. Ensure that the NEP is flexible enough to adapt to a country's changing context.  
4. Explain and review the NEP with all stakeholders as well as with parliamentarians 
on a regular basis. 
5. Back the NEP with commensurate budget allocation in the annual budget.

<<<PAGE=40>>>

6. Advocate and work with parliamentarians. In the words of a long-time champion 
of NEP and evaluation, Hon. Kabir Hashim, to establish an NEP and make it a 
priority, you need parliamentary support, as well for funding. 
7. Provide capacity building for stakeholders and parliamentarians as well as local 
evaluators.  
The periodic mapping of NEPs has shown that NEPs are becoming part of the  
worldwide evaluation  picture. It is hoped that this tendency will continue and gain 
momentum with the help of information and experience  from the field . A good, 
working, and inclusive  evaluation function will produce and support  better programs 
and improved conditions around the globe.
