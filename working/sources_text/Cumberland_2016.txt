Assessment and  
Development of Global 
Leadership Competencies  
in the Workplace: A Review 
of Literature

Abstract
The Problem. 
In the 21st century, globalization is key. Therefore, assessing and developing global 
leadership competencies is an important topic in human resource development 
(HRD). Global leadership competencies encompass personality traits, knowledge, and 
skills, as well as behaviors. While there has been a plethora of scholar-practitioner 
literature identifying global leadership competencies, there has been far less focus on 
assessing global leadership competencies and how these competencies are developed.
The Solution. 
We attempt to address this gap by examining the state-of-the-art literature on 
global leadership assessment and development from several disciplines, including 
HRD, management, and leadership. With regard to global leadership competency 
assessment, our goal is to synthesize the literature and provide HRD professionals 
with a systematic method for identifying instruments that measure core global 
competencies. With regard to global leadership development, our aim is to provide a 
framework for understanding how global leadership competencies can be developed.
The Stakeholders. 
The identification and categorization of various instruments that measure global 
competencies, as well as a framework that outlines methods to develop these 
competencies, will benefit human resource (HR) professionals and HRD practitioners.

302 Advances in Developing Human Resources 18(3)
The need for global leadership is widely recognized as trade barriers have been liberal-
ized, as borders to countries have dissolved, and as technological changes have swept 
in (Beechler & Javidan, 2007; Canals, 2014). An IBM (2010) study of more than 700 
global chief human resource (HR) officers revealed that “developing future leaders” 
was the most important business skill needed to achieve business objectives (p. 18). 
These same HR executives suggested workforce gaps needed to be addressed to hire, 
develop, and retain “borderless leaders” who could function effectively in complex 
global environments and manage global business teams (p. 3). This leads us to two 
important questions: What are the tools to assess global talent, and what methods are 
currently being used to develop global leaders?
While scholar-practitioner literature has detailed comprehensive lists of cognitive 
skills and psychological traits (Terrell & Rosenbusch, 2013; Tubbs & Schulz, 2006) 
needed by leaders working in increasingly globalized environments, there has been less 
focus on assessing these global leadership competencies, how these competencies are 
learned, and the many ways organizations can provide employees the opportunity to 
acquire and develop these skills (Prewitt, Weil, & McClure, 2011). We focus on these 
emerging leadership development issues as they relate to global competency literature 
in the context of human resource development (HRD).
It has been more than a decade since Marquardt and Berger (2003) called on HRD 
to provide an in-depth examination of global leadership development at all levels of the 
organization. However, the reality is that programs intended toward developing global 
leaders and leadership are often perceived as “eclectic” (Oddou & Mendenhall, 2013, 
p. 230). There is also some confusion in the delineation of purpose and types of devel-
opmental activities of how global leaders learn and develop cognitive, attitudinal, and 
behavioral competency components (Edwards & Turnbull, 2013; Oddou & Mendenhall, 
2013; Pless, Maak, & Stahl, 2011; Terrell & Rosenbusch, 2013). In addition to these 
aforementioned gaps in the literature, this article addresses the call by Kuchinke, 
Ardichvili, and Lokkesmoe (2014) to HRD scholars and practitioners to examine and 
investigate the methods for assessing and developing global competencies. We attempt 
to address this call by examining the state-of-the-art literature on global leadership 
assessment and development. With regard to global leadership competency assessment, 
our goal is to synthesize the literature and provide HRD professionals with a systematic 
method for identifying instruments that measure core global competencies. With regard 
to global leadership development, our aim is to provide a framework for understanding 
the literature regarding how global leadership competencies can be developed.
Method
Our method included examination of several disciplines, including HRD, manage -
ment, and leadership. Articles were identified through database searches on Business 
Premier and the Education Resource Information Center (ERIC)-EBSCO, and Google 
Scholar, as well as within five HRD journals ( Advances in Human Resource 
Development, Human Resource Development International, Human Resource 
Development Quarterly, Human Resource Development Review , and International

Journal of Human Resour ce Management ). The primary keyword search terms 
included global leadership competencies, cultural intelligence development, global 
leadership development, and global leader development. In total, we identified and 
reviewed 98 articles or book chapters on global competency assessment and develop-
ment. Our search focused on literature from the last 15 years, with an eye to discerning 
how scholars have addressed the identification, assessment, and development of atti -
tudinal, cognitive, and behavioral global leadership competencies.
Identification and Assessment of Global Leadership 
Competencies
Given global expansion, technological advances, and the changing nature of work 
today, many leaders must assume global leadership responsibilities even when operat-
ing exclusively within their country of origin. As Canals (2014) suggests, truly global 
leaders (i.e., those who lead organizations that operate in more than one country) share 
much in common with domestic leaders. However, global leaders must also operate in 
different sociocultural and political value systems that create a far more complex, 
diverse, and uncertain business environment. Recognizing the additional business 
imperatives and the unique knowledge, skills, and competencies needed by global 
leaders, Caligiuri and Tarique (2009) broadly define global leaders as “high level pro-
fessionals such as executives, vice presidents, directors, and managers who are in jobs 
with some global leadership activities” (p. 336).
The term “competency” has traditionally been used to describe specific knowledge, 
skills, and characteristics required to be effective on the job (Lucia & Lepsinger, 
1999). The components of competencies have been linked to various terms, including 
characteristics, traits, aptitudes, skills, values, beliefs, abilities, attitudes, and behav -
iors. HRD professionals have come to rely on competency models for a wide range of 
practices, including recruitment and selection, training, and performance (Lucia & 
Lepsinger, 1999).
Organizing Framework
Competency models are commonplace in organizations that aim to prepare workers 
for future challenges (Kormanik, Lehner, & Winnick, 2009). We rely on Lucia and 
Lepsinger’s (1999) three-tiered pyramid model as an organizing framework to discuss 
the assessment and development of global leaders. Their model provides a specific 
delineation of the domain components of a competency and is focused on the employee 
level. The pyramid’s base includes personal characteristics such as personality traits, 
innate talents, or an aptitude suggesting a person has the potential to acquire a skill. 
The mid tier of the pyramid identifies skills and knowledge, which may be tangible or 
intangible. At the top of the pyramid are specific behaviors that can be observed and 
measured.
Due to the volume of competencies associated with global leadership, numerous 
scholars have created global leadership competency models, including Bird,

Mendenhall, Stevens, and Oddou (2010); Jokinen (2005); and Tubbs and Schulz 
(2006). While these taxonomies help organize a multifaceted phenomenon, criticism 
has been leveled that global leadership competency models operate from a Western 
lens (Holt & Seki, 2012) and fail to prioritize what competencies are most relevant in 
different cultural, environmental, and job/industry contexts for enhancing leadership 
performance (Canals, 2014). In addition, there is an implicit assumption that either 
global leadership competencies are different than those for domestic leaders, or that 
there is a higher need for certain competencies when leaders operate in more challeng-
ing global environments (Jokinen, 2005; Steers, Sanchez-Runde, & Nardon, 2012).
Whether one believes global leadership competencies are above and beyond 
domestic leadership competencies, or global leadership requires an emphasis on cer -
tain skills, effective assessment practices can aid in the identification, selection, and 
development of global talent (Herd, Alagaraja, & Cumberland, 2016). Brownell 
(2006) argued that competency-based models, while not a panacea, provide HRD pro-
fessionals with building blocks for identifying global leadership talent. Figure 1 out -
lines our global leadership development framework of the three competency arenas 
defined by Lucia and Lepsinger (1999), integrating common assessment tools that 
measure these competencies, along with four developmental training methods that 
address these different domains.
Personality and Dispositional Competencies
The first competency domain is personality traits, and the assessment of this domain 
often serves as the basis for global leadership selection and development programs 
(Caligiuri & Tarique, 2009; Stahl, 2001). A meta-analysis performed by Mol, Born, 
Willemsen, and Van der Molen (2005) found personality to be more predictive of 
global leader performance than domestic job performance. Based on our examination 
of the prominent literature reviews on global leadership competencies since 2005 
(Bird et  al., 2010; Jokinen, 2005; Mol et  al., 2005; Osland, Bird, Mendenhall, & 
Osland, 2006), as well as empirical studies not included in the aforementioned reviews, 
we identify 17 personality characteristics consistently linked to effective global lead -
ership. Table 1 lists these along with survey instruments used to measure these traits 
and dispositions. The psychometric properties of these global leadership instruments 
are reported in the works of Bücker and Poutsma (2010), Graf and Mertesacker (2009), 
and Bird and Stevens (2013). As noted by several researchers, the construct definitions 
for some of the traits and dispositions listed in Table 1 overlap (Bird & Stevens, 2013; 
Mol et  al., 2005), and, for this reason, we listed some traits together after examining 
the definitions described by the authors (e.g., adaptability and flexibility).
Personality traits are innate (Smith & Victorson, 2012) and also shaped by culture 
(Tubbs & Schulz, 2006). Culture is defined as “shared motives, values, beliefs, identi-
ties, and interpretations of meanings of significant events that result from common 
experiences of members of collectives and are transmitted across generations” (House, 
Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004, p. 15). As culture directs not only what an 
individual learns but also how behavior will be interpreted (Hofstede, 1984), some

scholars debate the merit of using personality characteristics for assessing global lead-
ers (Steers et  al., 2012). They maintain that different cultures value different charac -
teristics and, therefore, assessment of leaders on the basis of their personality 
characteristics may be ineffective in global environments.
Kowske and Anthony (2007) studied personality based traits (e.g., adaptability, self-
awareness, motivation) among mid-level managers across 12 countries using a multi-
rater development tool. These scholars found that culture dictates which competencies are 
valued (Kowske & Anthony, 2007). Agrawal and Rook’s (2014) study using the Global 
Leadership Executive Inventory (GELI) had similar findings. These scholars examined 
1,784 executives, representing 128 nationalities from the 10 national clusters identified by 
the Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) study (see 
House et  al., 1999). The national clusters include Anglo, Confucian Asia, Eastern Europe, 
Germanic Europe, Latin America, Latin Europe, Middle East, Nordic Europe, Southern 
Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 12 global leadership capabilities examined, all were 
evident in effective leaders across every culture. The degree to which these leaders exhib-
ited these qualities, however, varied. From these findings, the researchers concluded that 
leaders must adapt their behavior as different cultures place different values on certain 
leadership styles. These findings suggest that it is important to consider what traits or 
characteristics should be developed and in what contexts.

The categorization of assessment instruments by trait provided in Table 1 allows 
HRD resource professionals to consider what traits will be more important in different 
situations and then easily identify the instruments that measure those traits. However, 
in addition to personality traits, it is imperative to ascertain what specific knowledge 
and skills are required in the effective performance of global leaders. In what follows, 
we address the knowledge & skills competency domain for global leadership and the 
various assessment tools.
Knowledge and Skill Competencies
Knowledge is the complex process of remembering, relating, or judging an idea or 
abstract phenomenon (Bloom, 1956). Skills, on the other hand, define an individual’s 
ability to execute specific tasks that can be learned over time (Caligiuri, 2006). We 
discuss two domains that focus on knowledge and skills as they relate to leading global 
enterprises: global mindset and cultural intelligence (CQ).
The first knowledge and skill domain associated with global leadership is the con-
cept of a global mindset (Cohen, 2010). The idea of a global mindset has received 
much attention from scholars and practitioners over the last two decades. In their 
review of the literature on global mindset, Levy, Beechler, Taylor, and Boyacigiller 
(2007) defined this construct as “a highly complex cognitive structure characterized 
by an openness and articulation of multiple cultural and strategic realities on both 
global and local levels, and the cognitive ability to mediate and integrate across the 
multiplicity” (Levy et  al., 2007, p. 244). Most scholars articulate global mindset as a 
multidimensional construct, and while all scholars do not agree on every aspect, the 
majority include knowledge and skills as components of a global mindset. For a com-
prehensive view of the multiple ways that global mindset  has been defined, see 
Cumberland (2015).
The second broad domain associated with global leadership is CQ, a skill that 
enables individuals to use their abilities appropriately in cross-cultural situations 
(Brislin, Worthley, & MacNab, 2006; Earley & Ang, 2003). In their seminal book 
Cultural Intelligence: Individual Interactions Across Cultures, Earley and Ang (2003) 
advanced attention toward this construct over the last decade. Some scholars consider 
CQ as differentiated from the global mindset concept (Levy et  al., 2007; Thomas 
et  al., 2008), while other researchers argue CQ is simply a subset of the global mindset 
framework (Cohen, 2010; Story & Barbuto, 2011). Seminal scholars in this arena, 
Earley and Peterson (2004), define CQ as “a person’s capability to gather, interpret, 
and act upon radically different cues to function effectively across cultural settings or 
in a multi cultural situation” (p. 105). Furthermore, these scholars advance the argu -
ment that CQ can be measured and should be assessed prior to selection for interna -
tional assignments. An alternative view, espoused by Thomas et  al. (2008), suggests 
that CQ is such a complex construct that no single technique adequately measures CQ; 
rather, a combination of assessment approaches is needed.
As shown in Table 2, validated survey instruments specifically designed to measure 
global knowledge and skills are often used to measure global mindset and CQ. Three

literature reviews describing the psychometric properties of the various self-report 
measures include Bücker and Poutsma (2010), Graf and Mertesacker (2009), and Bird 
and Oddou (2013).
Another assessment approach for knowledge and skill aptitudes is the use of 
Situational Judgment Tests (SJT). An SJT presents a user with a job related issue and 
a set of possible responses from which the user identifies the best response and worst 
response, rates the responses, and then determines what they would do (Friedman 
et  al., 2013; Morris, Savani, & Roberts, 2014). Computer simulators are also a tech -
nique used to understand how individuals might solve a problem in the context of a 
global assignment. Computer simulations can examine multiple levels of intelligence 
from simple sense making to situations where possible harm could be had (Earley & 
Ang, 2003). This tool can provide both qualitative and quantitative data. The disad -
vantages, however, relate to the need for trained assessors, high cost, possible bias, and 
the potential that the presence of the assessor may be intrusive and influence behaviors 
(Earley & Ang, 2003). Finally, observation of intercultural interactions by an assessor 
may also reveal CQ and the presence of a global mindset (Earley & Ang, 2003).
The assessment of knowledge and skills is difficult given that there will be differ -
ences in which knowledge and skills are most pertinent to the role. For this reason, 
multiple methods of assessment may be useful when evaluating global knowledge and 
skills competencies. We turn now to the last and final level in the Lucia and Lepsinger’s 
competency framework and address behavioral competencies.
Behavioral Competencies
Having the appropriate personality traits as well as knowledge and skills of what to do 
is only part of the equation with respect to global leadership. Translating these apti -
tudes and abilities into action requires behavioral competencies. More proximal mea-
sures of behavior include 360-degree feedback instruments and assessment centers. 
Feedback instruments, such as 360s, are used to help identify the operational modes of 
individual executives (Kets de Vries, Vrignaud, & Florent-Treacy, 2004). The Global 
Leadership Life Inventory (GlobeInvent), for example, relies on a 360-degree

measurement tool focusing on the “inner theater of leaders” to measure the dynamic, 
two-way relationship between leaders and followers (Kets de Vries et  al., 2004, p. 
476). Cultural assimilators can also be used to determine how an individual might 
react during a culture clash. This tool uses a critical cultural incident for understanding 
how a person might react in a specific situation to reveal the presence or absence of 
intercultural skills (Earley & Ang, 2003).
An approach that provides direct measurement of skill and behavior, as well as 
knowledge and trait components of global leadership competencies, is the assessment 
center (Herd et  al., 2016). Because assessment centers are designed based on an anal-
ysis of organizational and position strategic objectives (Stahl, 2001), they avoid some 
of the criticisms levied at using survey tools, which tend to assume there are universal 
global competencies needed across situations (Canals, 2014; Steers et  al., 2012). 
Assessment centers define competencies in behavioral terms and use a battery of tests 
and simulations in individual and group formats, along with multiple raters, to assess 
intercultural competencies identified as important for the organization (Herd et  al., 
2015).
Assessment of global leadership is challenging given differences in situations and 
organizational strategic needs regarding which competencies will be most pertinent. 
For this reason, it is recommended that a targeted approach to assessing global leader-
ship competencies be used that is based on the specific needs of the organization 
(Canals, 2014). Assessment serves as the basis for designing global leadership devel-
opment initiatives, but many of the tools used for assessment are also used for devel -
oping and training global leaders. In the section “Development of Global Leadership 
Competencies,” we outline methods for developing global leader talent, identify prac-
tices used by organizations for improving global leadership skills, and provide a 
review of recent empirical literature on the effectiveness of global leadership 
interventions.
Development of Global Leadership Competencies
Organizations embrace a wide variety of approaches to develop global leader compe-
tences. Our global leadership development framework delineates four approaches: 
Self-Awareness Development, Didactic Training, Experiential Opportunities, and 
Immersion. We review each area in the following section.
Self-Awareness
Enhanced self-awareness is often considered the foundation of global leadership, and 
is developed by having participants identify and reflect on their own values, attitudes, 
and behaviors as a means to discover cultural roadblocks (Earley & Ang, 2003). Self-
awareness training most often focuses on dispositional and knowledge components of 
global leadership competencies. Mentoring and coaching, as well as 360-degree feed-
back, are avenues to help individuals become more self-aware of their cultural biases. 
Mentors and coaches can be particularly helpful as they can have individuals identify

hidden assumptions and use these to assist individuals in identifying other viewpoints 
(Brownell, 2006; Mendenhall, 2006). IBM uses global mentoring programs to “build 
relationships and share information via phone and e-mail, and connect in person when 
business travel allows” (Caligiuri, 2014, p. 65). Similarly, McDonald’s Corporation 
relies on post-arrival coaching to help newly transplanted employees adapt to job 
assignments overseas (Morris et  al., 2014).
Didactic Training
Didactic training involves a variety of approaches such as diversity training and lan -
guage training through formal education programs, self-training programs (Caligiuri, 
2006), and even theater training methods (Earley & Ang, 2003). Improvisational and 
theater-based leadership development methods are well suited for those who operate 
in complex, social systems that require flexibility, emotional intelligence, and adapt -
ability (Tawadros, 2015). In general, the didactic training approaches tend to rely on 
information-oriented activities with a primary focus on knowledge competency com -
ponents that enable the individual to understand cultural topics and viewpoints 
(Littrell, 2006) or gain specific skills through practice.
A specific didactic approach used to help employees improve intercultural interac-
tions is the cultural assimilator (Littrell, 2006). A cultural assimilator involves the 
participant by having them read cross-culturally oriented scenarios (critical incidents). 
Then, the individual reads a list of alternatives and indicates which course of action he 
or she would like to adopt. An instructor with a culturally aware view regarding what 
would be the most appropriate response then discusses with the individual what the 
most appropriate response would have been and why. The cultural assimilator devel -
ops global leadership competencies through conditioning by having participants prac-
tice responding to realistic cross-cultural situations.
On a broader scale, organizations may use International Assessment Centers (IAC) 
as a tool to train personnel for global assignments (Herd et  al., 2015), and these allow 
for the development of behavioral as well as knowledge and skill competency compo-
nents. DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, for example, used an IAC as part of its interna -
tional management development system. Another organizational example reflects the 
dual modality of IACs to both assess and develop the various components of global 
leadership competencies. The Grundfos Group, a global organization that manufac -
tures pumps, incorporates a range of techniques in their IAC, including simulation 
exercises, written exercises, group discussions, and a crisis management activity 
(Livings & Mitchell, 2011).
Experiential Opportunities
Experiential opportunities involve activities such as working abroad, international 
business travel, operating as a member of a global team, or serving as a volunteer in 
another culture (Caligiuri, 2006). Options in this learn-by-doing approach vary in 
intensity and length of time an individual will be involved (Caligiuri & Tarique, 2014).

For example, PricewaterhouseCoopers uses service project assignments in developing 
countries to help their leaders develop responsible global leadership behaviors (Pless 
et  al., 2011). Similarly, IBM’s Corporate Service Corps (CSC) program is a 6-month 
effort whereby individuals gain global experience by working in teams in developing 
countries, to assist micro-business enterprises in becoming more productive (Oddou & 
Mendenhall, 2013). Organizations such as General Electric use action learning teams, 
composed of high-potential employees from diverse countries, to collaborate on 
emerging markets and develop proposals, which are then presented to senior execu -
tives (Conger, 2014).
Immersion
Like experiential opportunities, developmental interventions commonly associated 
with immersion help develop all competency components and include long-term inter-
national assignments, expatriate assignments, and culturally immersive foreign-lan -
guage training (Conger, 2014). International assignments have been lauded as the 
most useful developmental approach for enhancing all components of global leader -
ship competencies (Beechler & Javidan, 2007; Oddou & Mendenhall, 2013). This 
learn-in-the field approach is recognized for building business acumen, cognitive 
complexity, flexibility, and the ability to navigate change and hone cross-cultural skills 
(Caligiuri, 2006).
With respect to language immersion programs, these are typically structured inter-
ventions and may involve some classroom and some natural interaction in a host coun-
try. Other types of immersion experiences may install the individual in a country 
where they are isolated from their native language and must use the new target lan -
guage for communication (Caligiuri, 2006).
Empirical Findings on Global Leadership Development 
Efforts
Despite the extensive amount of research advocating global leadership training, schol-
ars lament the limited number of empirical studies available on linking global leader-
ship development programs to enhancing global leader competencies (Nam, Cho, & 
Lee, 2013; Ng, Van Dyne, & Ang, 2009). Caligiuri and Tarique (2012) found that 
significant intercultural experiences in either an individual’s professional or personal 
life positively impacted their flexibility and tolerance for ambiguity. These scholars 
surveyed 420 global leaders and their supervisors to examine both experiential oppor-
tunities initiated by organizations such as working abroad, operating on a global team, 
being mentored by someone from another culture, and participating in meetings in 
international locales, as well as non-work related cross-cultural exposure (travel 
abroad for vacation, study or volunteering, and family diversity). Findings indicated 
that significant intercultural experiences on both the professional and personal level 
help individuals learn the appropriate skills and behaviors to operate effectively in a 
variety of cultural contexts. Likewise, another recent study by Dragoni and colleagues

<<<PAGE=13>>>
312 Advances in Developing Human Resources 18(3)
(2014) suggests that international experience in more culturally distant countries is 
valuable in developing leaders’ strategic thinking competencies (Dragoni et  al., 2014).
Another quantitative study of global leaders in a U.K.-based firm found that high con-
tact, cross-cultural leadership activities were more effective than low contact activities in 
terms of global leader effectiveness (Caligiuri & Tarique, 2009). High contact activities 
were defined as short-term international assignments, long-term expatriate assignments, 
global meetings held in international locations, membership on a global team, and men-
toring by a person from another culture. Low contact activities included formal education, 
cross-cultural training programs, and assessment centers for general leadership develop-
ment, diversity training, and language training. Along this same line, Pless et  al. (2011) 
found that the high contact experience of participation in a company-sponsored interna-
tional service-learning program increased individuals’ cultural intelligence and global 
mindset domains. Finally, Terrell and Rosenbusch’s (2013) phenomenological study of 
12 global leaders revealed that a variety of high contact cross-cultural experiences, includ-
ing global travel for work, overseas site visits, mission-related trips, as well as holding 
global jobs with or without relocating to another country, increased cultural intelligence 
by enhancing the ability of these leaders to adapt to new situations.
A recent study by Kuchinke et  al. (2014) adopted the Intercultural Development 
Inventory (IDI) to measure whether a student exchange program impacted intercul -
tural competence. Among the group of 41 students, there was very little change in the 
pre- or post-IDI scores. The authors conclude that it is not sufficient to send individu-
als into overseas assignments. Rather, they argue that participants on these assign -
ments also need customized in-country coaching and mentoring that is developmentally 
appropriate to maximize the global leadership development and learning to be gained 
from these assignments.
Conclusion
With increasing globalization, there is greater urgency to prepare leaders to operate in 
complex business environments involving diverse stakeholders (Alon & Higgins, 
2005). This literature review has contributed to the extant literature on competencies 
empirically associated with global leadership, tools used to assess these competencies, 
and methods used to develop these competencies on a macro scale. Taken together, 
findings from this literature review suggest that assessing and developing global lead-
ership has continued to garner attention across many disciplines, but there remain 
many promising avenues for future studies.
We suggest that HRD professionals need to continually increase their knowledge 
regarding global leadership competencies and be able to identify which global compe-
tencies are needed for the various roles in their organizations (Chaudhuri & Alagaraja, 
2014). Terrell and Rosenbusch (2013) make the case there is a spectrum of global jobs 
“each with unique competency requirements” (p. 1073). One of the gaps in the litera-
ture we found is the need for a more coherent understanding of what global leadership 
competencies are needed in different contexts. We urge HRD researchers to begin 
studying and mapping global competencies across these various spectrums, as it is

Cumberland et al. 313
unlikely organizations will be able to find employees who can successfully master all 
of the competencies that have been associated with global leadership.
As demonstrated in this review, there are a host of tools available to assess different 
global leadership competencies. Measurement of global leadership is not a settled 
matter, and HRD researchers should continually seek to improve or expand on mea -
surement tools that avoid a cultural bias. This area of global leadership assessment 
offers another fruitful line of inquiry.
Because HRD professionals are responsible for making a compelling case to senior 
leaders that there is the need to invest in the appropriate training infrastructure to build 
global leadership talent, staying aware of the empirical findings will provide more 
evidence of what types of interventions have proven effective and what types of inter-
ventions to employ in different contexts. HRD researchers could develop a training 
typology that delineates what leadership development programs work best under what 
type of circumstances to assist practitioners with these decisions.
Despite the systematic nature of this review, a limitation is that only peer-reviewed 
journal articles in English were included. Also, while multiple sources were located 
and reviewed, it is likely that some relevant literature was excluded or overlooked. 
Finally, HRD scholars and HR practitioners will want to consider the literature on 
expatriate career development, as this area was not examined in this overview. This 
establishes opportunities for future work. It is likely that, as the field of global leader-
ship development continues to expand, there will be an ongoing need to synthesize 
empirical studies to help practitioners successfully select and groom global leaders in 
the context of their critical strategic management objectives.
