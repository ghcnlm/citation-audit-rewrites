Summary
Motivation: Although the field of evidence-informed policy-making 
has grown significantly in the last 20 years, little is written about how 
it manifests within government policy, and whether it makes a mean-
ingful difference to development outcomes. This article seeks to fill 
that gap.
Purpose: Through reflection and analysis of shifts in the wider evidence 
ecosystem, and developments in South Africa specifically, the article 
describes how in South Africa the political and policy spheres come 
together with changes in production and use of evidence to increase the 
potential to improve the lives of millions of people.
Methods and approach: This article is based on structured reflection 
and analysis of 20 years of contributions to the evidence ecosystem in 
low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries (L&MICs), in 
particular in Africa. It includes analysis of documentation of initiatives, 
policies, and practices relating to the production and use of evidence, 
with a focus on South Africa.
Findings: There are clear shifts within evidence-informed decision- 
making (EIDM) systems over time in the production of evidence and 
in the implementation of evidence approaches. The varied expe-
riences documented in South Africa and across L&MICs highlight 
valuable lessons for others. In South Africa the policies underpinning 
evidence use, and the political context in which evidence-informed 
decision-making takes place, combine to contribute to increasing use of 
evidence in the country. Reflecting on the system developments across 
Africa and further afield reveals how one country's system is both influ-
enced by these wider contexts and has potential to influence the wider 
system with clear policy implications.
Policy implications: Routine use of evidence in decision-making 
requires new practices to become standard across not only policy 
systems, but also evidence systems. Changes are needed across a range 
of actors, organizations, and institutions. There are lessons to be learnt 
from varied experiences including those in L&MICs, to inform advances 
towards the institutionalization of evidence use in policy. This case study 
highlights the importance of synergistic developments in both evidence

1 | INTRODUCTION
Evidence-informed policy aims to improve development and societal outcomes (Stewart, 2019). In theory it has 
the potential to reduce harm and improve benefits, increase transparency and, therefore, also governance (Davies 
et al., 1999; Langer & Nduku, 2019). In part because of this considerable potential, there has been a notable increase 
in investment in activities to increase the use of evidence in policy in in low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle income 
countries (L&MICs) in the last 10 years.
Despite these investments in, and the growth of, the evidence field in L&MICs, the approach is still most often 
described as having its history in evidence-based medicine in high-income countries. Little attention is given to the 
expertise or innovation within evidence-based policy systems in L&MICs, particularly in Africa (Langer et al., 2019). I 
have been working with a wide network of people over the last 20 years to gain increased recognition for and docu-
ment the origins, expertise, and innovation within the evidence ecosystem in Africa, and South Africa in particular 
(Stewart, 2018). This is my prime motivation behind this research.
During the last 20 years, I have observed an increasing emphasis in the field on the “institutionalization” of 
evidence use in the field as a whole, and in South Africa in particular. Institutionalization has been described as 
“the process by which a set of activities becomes an integral and sustainable part of a formal system. It can be seen 
as a sequence of events leading to ‘new practices becoming standard practice’” (Yin, 1978, p. 5). It refers to the 
stability and continuation of particular practices (Koon et al., 2020), and to increasingly integrated processes that 
eventually reach consolidation and maturity (Renzi, 1996). Although the “formal system” most routinely refers to the 
system within government, the activities required for evidence-informed policy span both evidence production and 
use. This article focuses on unpacking shifts towards institutionalization in the evidence ecosystem across spheres 
of evidence production and use. It reflects on how, in the context of political and policy shifts in South Africa, 
these have become increasingly integrated over time, and in doing so, has led to greater synergies in the country's 
evidence ecosystem.
In addition, I have been concerned to observe a lack of focus in the wider discourse on “the why” of 
evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) that motivates me to work to support an increase in the use of evidence—
the desire to tackle poverty and inequality in the region, which is worsening in light of the current pandemic, and is the 
reason I became involved in this field in the first instance. This has been coupled with a longstanding observa tion  that 
isolation and duplication of effort within the field does nothing to enable change and that we need to work together 
in order to be effective (Farley-Ripple et al., 2020; Stewart, 2018).
Last but not least, despite the relationship between the evidence–synthesis community and the evidence–policy 
interface, the drive to encourage the use of evidence in decision-making sometimes omits consideration of what 
evidence is being promoted, and therefore leads to the promotion, communication, and consideration of individual 
pieces of evidence rather than the full evidence base. The potential for over-reliance on an individual study (Gough 
et al., 2020) leads me to reflect on the extent to which the evidence ecosystem in South Africa is shifting from 
consideration of individual pieces of research or sources of evidence to comprehensive collation and integration of 
complete evidence bases.
This article draws on structured reflections and analysis in order, first, to document developments in the evidence 
production and evidence implementation across L&MICs, and Africa in particular; and, second, to consider how 
production and use, of genuine partnerships at all levels, and of the poli-
cies and frameworks that underpin change.

evidence policy and evidence politics spheres in South Africa specifically combine with developments in evidence 
production and evidence implementation to advance the institutionalization of evidence use, with the potential to 
improve the lives of millions of people. It builds on a keynote paper presented at the Evidence and Implementation 
Summit, 2020. Following a description of methods in Section 2, the findings are presented in Section 3 in relation to 
the four areas: evidence, implementation, policy, and politics and on how they combine to contribute to the institu-
tionalization of evidence. This is followed by a discussion in Section 4; Section 5 concludes.
2 | METHODS
This article uses a case-study approach focusing on the evidence system in South Africa, including analysis of the 
broader contexts of both Africa, and L&MICs more generally. As a new democracy with a challenging history, South 
Africa has a dedicated commitment to tackling poverty and inequality through the development of a capable state. 
As one of the BRICS countries (comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, it is committed 
to sharing and learning from others, particularly other L&MICs, and plays a pivotal role within the African continent 
(National Planning Commission, 2012). Its leaders have been recognized for their use of evidence in policy (Sense 
about Science, 2020), and the central role that decision-makers have played in developing the evidence system are 
well recognized (Goldman et al., 2015; Langer & Stewart, 2016). This makes it an ideal focus for how an evidence 
system can shift through a sequence of events towards “institutionalization.” Having worked in the evidence field in 
South Africa for so long, I am able to take an insider approach, with opportunities to reflect on what has shifted over 
this time.
My research into the system in South Africa is based on an assessment of the shifts in evidence production and 
use, and in policy and practice, over the last decade through analysis of publicly available documentation. Documents 
were sought from government websites, and via Google Scholar, as well as through the institutional archive at the 
Africa Centre for Evidence at the University of Johannesburg, where the team has been working to support the use 
of evidence in South Africa for 20 years. Preliminary findings were shared with an international audience via the 2021 
Evidence and Implementation Summit, and feedback used to refine the findings presented below.
3 | FINDINGS
Using findings from my analysis of the evidence system across L&MICs, particularly Africa, I demonstrate shifts in the 
technical approaches used to prepare evidence for decision-making that increasingly combine rigour, relevance, legit-
imacy, and accessibility through an embedded co-production approach. Further, I demonstrate the implementation of 
EIDM as a deliberative intervention embedded within government through relationships, and capacity development 
of individuals, teams, organizations, and systems. In South Africa, these shifts have been underpinned and supported 
by policies that have driven the increasing shift towards institutionalization of EIDM at national and local policy level. 
Finally, I identify the politics, and the underlying principles, which facilitated these developments. These develop-
ments are increasingly integrated into one national evidence system, which while still evolving, has the potential to 
shape the lives of millions of South Africans.
There have been a number of significant shifts in how evidence is produced over the last 10 years. I traced 
these shifts across L&MICs, and both across Africa and within South Africa specifically (see Box 1 for examples). 
Four changes are clearly identifiable: (1) a greater focus on efforts to ensure research reporting is more policy- and 
policy-maker oriented; (2) changes in how research impact is measured, with moves towards a greater focus on the 
societal relevance of research; (3) changes in how research is funded, with moves towards more policy-relevant 
outputs that meet policy timeframes; and (4) changes to ensure that research is synthesized for decision-makers 
across a wider range of sectors and settings.

Developments in 
evidence production Example from L&MICs Pan-African example South African example
1.1 Efforts to ensure 
that research 
reporting is 
more policy- and 
policy-maker 
oriented
3ie's drive to improve 
dissemination of 
research by supporting 
or producing high 
quality policy briefs (see 
https:/ /www.3ieimpact.
org/evidence-hub/
publications/briefs).
The Development Research 
Uptake in Sub-Saharan 
Africa (DRUSSA) programme 
designed to improve writing 
of research across Africa's 
Commonwealth Universities 
(DRUSSA, 2017).
The SDG Hub at the University 
of Pretoria which curates 
South African research 
papers under SDG categories 
(Fourie et al., 2019).
1.2 Shifts in how 
research impact is 
measured, moving 
towards greater 
societal relevance
The UK's former Department 
for International 
Development (DFID) 
detailed how research 
impact and capacity to 
use research should be 
measured in its 2016 
guidance (DFID, 2016).
The African Union's Science, 
Technology and Innovation 
Strategy for Africa 2024 
specifies the need to 
“properly utilise scientific 
and technological 
knowledge to address 
societal challenges through 
innovative products, 
services, processes, business 
models and policies” (African 
Union, 2020, p. 46), and 
details the monitoring, 
evaluation and learning 
system for tracking such 
utilization.
The National Research 
Foundation (NRF) formed 
a task force on research 
impact in 2021 with a 
new policy and a number 
of public events including 
drives to demonstrate the 
relevance of research to 
societal priorities in South 
Africa (NRF, 2021a).
1.3 Shifts in research 
funding and 
commissioning 
towards 
policy-relevant 
outputs that meet 
policy timeframes
USAID, one of the largest 
development research 
funders, specifies in its 
scientific research policy 
that it seeks research 
that “will produce 
useful knowledge or 
understanding, feasible 
interventions or 
approaches, or innovative 
technology(ies) amenable 
to adoption and scale up 
within a reasonable time” 
(USAID, 2014, p. 8).
The African Technology Policy 
Studies Network highlights 
“the mismatch between 
research priorities and 
developmental challenges” 
(p. 26) and draws out lessons 
from new and innovative 
funding approaches globally 
for application across Africa 
(Mugwagwa et al., 2019).
Research commissioning 
under the Programme to 
Support Pro-Poor Policy 
Development focused 
on policy-relevant 
research designed in 
close consultation with 
government decision-makers 
(PSPPD, 2017).
1.4 Shifts in the 
evidence synthesis 
field to provide 
best evidence 
for decisions of 
relevance to a wider 
range of settings 
and sectors
A number of international 
development 
organizations have 
increasingly become 
involved in funding, 
supported, and produced 
evidence syntheses 
for decision-making, 
and evidence synthesis 
organizations have 
increasingly focused 
on the priorities of 
the global south 
(Stewart, 2019).
Capacity for producing 
systematic reviews has 
expanded across the 
continent with growing 
numbers of people and 
pockets of expertise (Stewart 
et al., 2017b).
The South Africa Cochrane Centre 
was founded in 1996, and 
the Cochrane HIV/AIDS 
Review Group's editorial 
base has been co-hosted in 
South Africa (and in the US) 
since 1998 (Cochrane, n.d.). 
Other evidence synthesis 
organizations, including the 
JBI and the Collaboration for 
Environmental Evidence, have 
active centres in the country 
linked to the University of 
Witwatersrand and the 
University of Johannesburg 
respectively.

Drilling down to the developments within South Africa further reveal the depth of these changes and how they 
are integrated to ensure that policy-makers’ needs for evidence are being met with the best available systematically 
synthesized evidence. The evidence synthesis field explicitly states that its goal is to provide better evidence to 
inform decisions, particularly policy decisions (Bunn et al., 2015; Gough et al., 2020). Observing more closely those 
working to produce synthesized evidence in South Africa, there is a record of a history in the production of systematic 
reviews to shape policy particularly relevant to the region. These efforts span the work of Cochrane, the Collaboration 
for Environmental Evidence, JBI (formerly the Joanna Briggs Institute), and the Campbell Collaboration. 3ie and the 
EPPI-Centre have also played roles in capacity support (Modise & Tannous, 2021a, 2021c). While most efforts have 
been in the health field, the Africa Centre for Evidence at the University of Johannesburg has become an established 
unit for evidence synthesis beyond health, working across broad areas of social policy (Modise & Tannous, 2021a).
As well as the increase in systematic review and evidence synthesis capacity noted above, there have been clear 
shifts beyond a standardized systematic review methodology to include new products that are tailored more closely 
to the evidence needs of decision-makers (Modise & Tannous, 2021c; Naude et al., 2015; Rosenbaum et al., 2011). 
These shifts have retained the principles of traditional systematic review approaches (for completeness, transparency, 
etc.), but altered both the outputs and the partnerships involved. We note an emergence of responsive evidence 
services (Tricco et al., 2017). Developed in Canada's McMaster Health Forum, rapid evidence responses were adopted 
and adapted by teams across Africa, funded in part through the World Health Organization (WHO) Alliance for Health 
Policy and Systems Research programme (Langlois et al., 2019). Specialists in Uganda were particularly involved in 
adapting the approach and providing training for teams across the continent, including two teams in South Africa at 
the Africa Centre for Evidence and the Medical Research Council (Mijumbi et al., 2014). The other significant shift 
has come through closer partnerships between research teams in government and in academia to produce evidence 
maps and reviews (DPME, 2016a, 2016b). These have led to changes in what evidence is considered and in how it 
is visualized and shared with decision-makers. These have been largely adaptations to the technical processes for 
producing evidence driven by shared learning across the production–use divide. The eventual co-production model 
developed in South Africa has been tested across sectors over the last five years and is now increasingly integrated 
into decision-making processes (DPME, 2021).
Last but not least, we are now seeing these two developments (for demand-driven evidence services, and for 
co-produced evidence products) coming together as explained in more detail below.
3.1 | Developments in evidence implantation
Evidence production, even when in response to demand, and even when co-produced with users, remains about 
the generation of useful evidence. When we consider EIDM as a whole, we cannot focus merely on the generation 
of evidence, but also on how it gets used. This section reports key observations regarding this implementation of 
evidence, including examples from the wider evidence ecosystem, across Africa and in South Africa (see Box 2). It 
then delves deeper into developments in the country and discusses their contribution to the wider system.
Three significant shifts were identified advancing the use of evidence: (1) a growth in initiatives that focused on 
supporting evidence use; (2) an increasing emphasis on relationships and partnerships across traditional evidence 
production and use boundaries; and (3) a growth in capacities for EIDM that increasingly emphasizes capacities for 
using evidence and not just producing it.
Closer examination of documents in South Africa highlights the manifestation of these shifts in the country in 
more detail. Tracking national and provincial activities for supporting EIDM over time, we see a growing number of 
activities that focus on using evidence and that are increasingly moving into government. There were changes within 
the Department of Science and Technology's mandate, with the 2019 White Paper emphasizing the impact of science 
(Department of Science and Technology, 2019), and a marked change in the mandate of the National Research Foun-
dation to ensuring the impact of research, and on measuring research impact (NRF, 2021b).

BOX 2 Developments in evidence implementation with examples
Developments in evidence 
implementation Example from L&MICs Pan-African example South African example
2.1 Initiatives for supporting 
the use of evidence
3ie has demonstrated 
a marked shift from 
early work in 2010 
when research teams 
were encouraged to 
engage with Southern 
researchers to increase 
the relevance of 
their work, towards 
a much greater focus 
on evidence use, and 
recent discussions 
about how development 
organizations can ensure 
that good research is 
integrated into policy 
(Thissen, 2022).
The African Institute for 
Development Policy 
(AFIDEP) worked with 
Fellows and Associates of 
the African Academy of 
Science to be proactive 
in their engagement 
with decision-makers 
and encourage their 
governments’ use of 
science and innovation 
(AFIDEP, n.d.).
Although always part 
of the President's 
Office, the 
Programme to 
Support Pro-Poor 
Policy Development 
(PSPPD) moved 
physical location 
following its first 
phase of work, 
from the Human 
Sciences Research 
Council offices into 
the Union Buildings, 
a symbolic but 
significant shift 
(PSPPD, 2017).
2.2 Relationships and 
partnerships that have 
been documented across 
the traditional evidence 
production and use 
boundaries
The COVID-END partnership 
of over 50 organizations 
that convened to 
support the generation 
and use of evidence 
syntheses to tackle the 
COVID-19 pandemic 
deliberately incorporated 
decision-makers and 
research producers across 
L&MICs, as evidenced in 
the work of the Global 
Evidence Commission 
that they convened 
(Global Evidence 
Commission, 2022).
Perhaps the biggest example 
on the continent is in the 
growing membership and 
activities of the Africa 
Evidence Network, which 
now has over 3,500 
members and facilitates 
numerous engagements 
every year that bring 
together researchers, 
policy-makers, knowledge 
brokers, and funders 
(Africa Centre for 
Evidence, 2020).
A new research 
network was 
launched in 2021 
within government, 
led from the 
President's Office, 
with an associated 
drive from the 
new head of the 
National School of 
Government for 
a more effective 
public service 
(Siluma, 2021).
2.3 Growth in capacities 
for EIDM and a shift 
in emphasis within 
these capacities from 
production of useful 
evidence to its use
The capacity for both 
evidence production and 
use across L&MICs was 
highlighted during the 
COVID-19 pandemic 
(Stewart et al., 2020).
We see an increase in 
capacities for collation 
of bodies of evidence 
for policy, with marked 
increases in capacities 
from those documented 
by Oliver et al. (2015) 
to those identified by 
Stewart and colleagues 
three years later (Stewart 
et al., 2017b). We also 
know that this has been 
accompanied by increases 
in the production of 
impact evaluations 
in Africa (Erasmus 
et al., 2020).
The production of 
evidence maps, 
often co-produced 
between those 
internal and 
external to

2016b).

There are notable developments in working relationships that spanned not only research and policy divides, 
but also crossed government departments and sectors. From 2015 to 2017 the UJ-BCURE team also facilitated an 
informal community of practice on evidence for senior officials at the centre of government (Stewart et al., 2017a).
There has been an accumulation of efforts to support the use of evidence by colleagues in government. This 
spans the UJ-BCURE Programme and the Vaka Yiko Programme, both of which were externally funded initiatives 
from 2014 to 2016, and combined capacity support with embedded mentoring of both individuals and teams 
within government (Stewart et al., 2017a; Vogel & Punton, 2018). Another example was the BUDDIES programme 
that focused on health decision-makers at a provincial level (Young et al., 2018). There were also offerings shared 
via the European Commission through its Master Class programme in Pretoria in 2019 (European Commission 
et al., 2018). The PSPPD programme instigated training on evidence-based policy-making and implementation 
for senior government officials and, when it closed, the course was moved to the University of Cape Town (UCT) 
(PSPPD, 2017). Most recently the University of Johannesburg launched a new Short Learning Programme on the 
Practices of EIDM.
This combination of EIDM activities, strengthened networks, and relevant capacities appears to reflect an 
increasingly supportive environment within South Africa for the implementation of EIDM, which has taken place in 
a wider context of developments across the continent, and indeed across L&MICs. Below, these shifts in evidence 
production and use are further contextualized in light of evidence policy and wider politics in South Africa.
3.2 | Developments in evidence policy and politics in South Africa
The use of evidence in policy development is itself underpinned by both policies and systems for policy development. 
Tracing these developments in South Africa, we see shifts within national policy frameworks as well as increasingly 
mandated systems. How South Africa's evidence ecosystem is underpinned by a strong foundation of legislation 
and reform, including the Constitution (Republic of South Africa, 1996) and the National Development Plan 2030 
(National Planning Commission, 2012; Stewart et al., 2019) has been documented elsewhere. In specific sectors such 
as environmental management (Rossouw & Wiseman, 2004), policies have underwritten drives towards evidence 
implementation planning. The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System was introduced centrally in 2015 and has 
become the cornerstone of evidence policy in the country (Magoro, 2021). Policy options are weighed according to 
the relative impacts, particularly for the most vulnerable populations, and cost–benefit analysis is undertaken. Policy 
implementation is planned and risks assessed, and a baseline is established to enable future monitoring of change. 
This all happens before a new policy is submitted to the cabinet (DPME, 2021). A specialist SEIAS Unit, which sits 
within the President's Office, must sign off on the SEIAS assessments before draft policies, bills, or regulations are 
included in Cabinet Memoranda, a summary of the main findings of that assessment must be included in the Memo, 
and the full report included in the annexes. This also applies to policies and regulations that are internally signed by 
ministers. Furthermore, this policy-review instrument is “geared” to ensuring national priorities of social cohesion and 
security, and economic inclusion, economic growth, and environmental sustainability are considered in the evidence 
assessment irrespective of the topic of the policy under review.
Reviewing the documentation related to SEIAS shows how marked the integration of evidence is within these 
policies. In early 2021, the Evidence Management Guide for SEIAS was produced by the research unit within DPME 
that supports the SEIAS team in the President's Office (DPME, 2021). It provides detailed guidance on the use of 
evidence within the SEIAS process and has been welcomed by government colleagues (DPME & ACE, 2021).
The policy drive for evidence use embedded within SEIAS was further strengthened in December 2020 with the 
publication of the new National Framework for Policy Development (The Presidency Republic of South Africa, 2020). 
As with the SEIAS documentation, this new framework contains multiple references to the EIDM approach—it 
contains the word “evidence” 120 times and has a detailed annex to guide the use of evidence in policy formulation 
(The Presidency Republic of South Africa, 2020).

We observe a political landscape in South Africa that has been conducive to the emergence of a national evidence 
ecosystem. The country's ruling party has had a somewhat turbulent relationship with evidence. In the 1990s, Pres-
ident Mbeki famously questioned the link between HIV and AIDS, resulting in a powerful and eventually success-
ful evidence-informed legal and social campaign for the right to access antiretrovirals (Heywood, 2009; Suthar & 
Bärnighausen, 2017). In contrast, President Ramaphosa has been lauded for his evidence-informed response to 
COVID-19, and one of his chief scientific advisors, Professor Salim Abdul Karim, was awarded the John Maddox 
Prize for standing up for evidence in 2020, alongside President Trump's Chief Medical Advisor, Dr Anthony Fauci 
(CAPRISA, 2020). We have seen the introduction of key policies under the leadership of the ruling party, including 
those already mentioned. We have also seen colleagues within government increasingly using evidence for their own 
work, irrespective of the external donor-driven evidence agenda (for example see Dayal, 2016, for an overview of 
the use of evidence in South Africa's 20-year review). We know that policy-makers seek out and use evidence in their 
work (Paine-Cronin & Sadan, 2015).
If we look to the structures of government, the creation of DPME in 2010 marks an important recognition 
of the importance of central co-ordination of government outcomes. While DPME is not alone in driving for 
stronger state capacity informed by greater knowledge (Goldman et al., 2015), it has played a major role in the 
“pull” of evidence into policy. DPME has had close relationships with the National Planning Commission, the 
PSPPD programme, and the SEIAS Unit, all of which have contributed significantly to systems for evidence use 
in government. It is from within DPME that the national evaluation system was set up (Goldman et al., 2018). 
DPME's research unit has played an important role in piloting, testing, and expanding the use of policy-relevant 
evidence maps in government, as well as facilitating relationships between producers and users of research more 
generally (DPME, 2016b ).
Another level of politics (politics with a small ‘p’) is evident in the documented work of the Africa Centre for 
Evidence over the last decade, one that shows the importance of how those outside government engage with those 
inside government. There is a clear shift from a programme designed to “build capacity” of government officials (the 
UJ-BCURE programme—Stewart et al., 2017a), to the language of “capacity sharing” that recognizes how little is 
known by the team, and by knowledge brokers more generally, about policy generation (Modise & Tannous, 2021b). 
The Centre's work has over time adopted a more sensitive approach in which this university-based team has acknowl-
edged that it is neither the leaders within nor the owners of the evidence system in government that it seeks to 
support (Stewart, 2021).
4 | WHAT THESE DOCUMENTED SHIFTS MEAN FOR INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF 
EVIDENCE USE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND ELSEWHERE
In combining the shifts in evidence production and implementation with the changes in the political and policy land-
scape in South Africa we can see how this combination shapes (or does not shape) the routine use of evidence through 
“new practices becoming standard practices” (Yin, 1978; Zida et al., 2018, p. 16) in decision-making in South Africa. 
First it is worth noting that there is a “coinciding” of shifts in the evidence systems, for production and for use, and in 
both the pro-poor and increasingly transparent policy context and in the longstanding drive towards improving the 
lives of South Africans through the provision of a strong state at the heart of government. The drives for good govern-
ance and a capable state are conducive to, and increasingly integrated with, drives for better use of better evidence in 
government.
There is a clear shift away from externally funded and externally driven activities to internal initiatives and invest-
ment as well as a traceable shift from individual relationships towards institutional ones (PSPPD, 2017). This is not to 
say that international donors do not still play a role, nor that the institutional-level relationships necessary for a formal 
system to operate routinely are all in place. In the area of evidence capacities, there are also shifts from individual 
capacity strengthening towards delivery beyond individuals to teams and their institutions, and towards delivery of

capacity development via institutions rather than externally funded time-bound initiatives. This is consistent with a 
growing capacity across the continent (Stewart et al., 2020).
There have also been technical innovations towards (co-)production of better evidence that have been domi-
nated by, and largely driven by, government colleagues, rather than external academics or “knowledge brokers.” The 
focus has shifted over time from developing research practices and tools to developing decision practices and tools 
that are informed by research. There are signs that the development of a co-production model driven from within 
government is part of a bigger move towards stronger, sustainable, and more equitable state–research partnerships. 
This technical and systems-level shift is reflected not only in decisions about individual policies (for example the 
human settlements policy), but also in systems for decisions across policies—as highlighted by how evidence is inte-
grated within the national policy framework and the SEIAS system (DPME, 2016a, 2016b, 2021; Department of 
Science and Technology, 2019; Stewart et al., 2019; The Presidency Republic of South Africa, 2020).
The drive for delivery of better outcomes for South Africans has provided a common ground for the values of 
EIDM: transparency, accountability, and careful curation of resources to the achieve the best possible outcomes. This 
is coupled with an increasing regulation and incentivization for the use of evidence in policy formulation. The policy 
developments in South Africa are key in driving the use of evidence in national policy. They have the potential to 
ensure evidence is considered in all changes to existing policy, and proposals for new policy. Perhaps most significant 
is that these policies lay the groundwork for structural incentives within decision-makers’ routine work for the routine 
consideration of the evidence base when making choices.
This analysis suggests that when these four important elements combine, we observe significant shifts towards 
the systematic use of evidence in decision-making. There is an increasing number of well documented policies that 
have been made on the basis of the best available evidence. These include policies on early-grade reading (3ie, 2019), 
the testing and expansion of social grants (Satumba et al., 2017), the introduction of a wage-labour subsidy (Levinsohn 
et al., 2014), the development of human settlements policy (DPME, 2016a), and a number of COVID-19 responses.
Despite the incentives, structures, and capacities for evidence use in the country, it is also clear that evidence 
in policy-making is not yet widespread, and is largely still occurring at a national rather than a sub-national level, 
although examples of the latter do exist (Magoro, 2021; Western Cape Government, 2020). Nevertheless, these 
examples, and the findings above of developments in four significant areas, suggest that South Africa's institutionali-
zation of evidence use is well underway, and has the potential to improve lives for millions of people.
If we consider developments in South Africa's evidence ecosystem in the wider context of the continent and 
of other L&MICs, we see that wider shifts around the world towards greater capacities for generating and using 
evidence, and recognition of those capacities, have provided a broader conceptual drive towards both better outcomes 
and greater agency in achieving them (Africa Evidence Network, 2020; Stewart, 2021; Stewart et al., 2020). There 
is evidence that wider changes have benefited the South African context, for example shifts in funding towards 
Southern-led organizations by funders, including the European Union (EU), the UK's former Department for Interna-
tional Development (DFID) (now incorporated into the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)), 
and foundations such as the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, have resulted in better-resourced African 
evidence centres, from ACRES in Uganda, to AFIDEP in Kenya, and SACE and CEBHC in South Africa. Further, there 
is evidence that developments in South Africa have had knock-on effects on both capacities and practices across 
the continent. Examples of South African influence on the continent have been documented by the Africa Evidence 
Network (see their gallery of Stories of Change). These also extend beyond Africa to Latin America (Boeira, 2020, 
2021). We also have a range of examples of peer-learning evidence collaborations in which African teams play an 
active role. Over the last 20 years, these have included the World Health Organization's Evidence-Informed Policy 
Network (EVIPNet) and the Partnership for Evidence and Equity in Responsive Evidence Systems (PEERSS, n.d.; 
WHO, n.d.), with increasing involvement from a growing number of African teams including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, 
Nigeria, Uganda, and, perhaps not surprisingly, South Africa. These teams are increasingly active in supporting both 
the production and use of evidence for EIDM. Their role in spanning these divides is particularly important, as is the 
political and policy landscapes in which they work (for more on the South African system, see Stewart et al., 2019).

These learning and influence roles are consistent both outside and within government: the National Development 
Plan 2030 explicitly sets out the role of South Africa in supporting the continent's development (National Planning 
Commission, 2012). With almost all global development priorities spanning national borders, from migration to COVID-
19, from economic development to food security, the importance of sharing and learning developments from and within 
countries and continents is clearly evident. Opportunities for sharing and learning from the developments in South Africa 
are reflected in a number of capacity “hubs” led from within the country with an African focus. I identified regional hubs 
led from South Africa that span support to national vaccine technical groups: the NITAG Support Hub (NiSH) (VACFA, 
n.d.); support for relationship-based learning on EIDM (AEN, 2019); and support that focuses on systems-level change in 
EIDM (the ACE-led Community of Practice within the PEERSS programme). Several of these hubs are still in their infancy; 
tracking their development will be essential to understand the potential for others to benefit from learning within South 
Africa. We also see the influence of South Africa's developments further afield. For example, the Africa Evidence Network 
is now mentoring an emerging regional network in Latin America (Boeira, 2021), and the Africa Centre for Evidence is 
facilitating a Community of Practice on Systems-Level change in Evidence Use that spans 10 countries across L&MICs.
This research has focused on South Africa in the wider African and L&MIC context. Our understanding of how 
evidence systems are strengthened, both through evidence production and implementation, and through the policy 
and politics that shape evidence use, will benefit from further research to document the ways in which other regions 
have informed developments in Africa, and how Africa has shaped developments elsewhere.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
This article has documented how policy, implementation, evidence, and politics come together to increase the use of 
evidence in decision-making that has the potential to change lives. It does not contain a complete political analysis 
of South Africa's evidence ecosystem, and there may be a case for conducting one in the future, although this should 
arguably be done from within government, and not externally. The time constraints of the research, and limited access 
to government documents, and internal documents of other evidence centres, means that it is not a complete picture 
of South Africa's evidence ecosystem, nor of the wider African or L&MIC context. It does, however, along with earlier 
analysis conducted with my colleagues (Stewart et al., 2019) represent the most complete analysis of the country's shifts 
towards the routine use of evidence in policy-making to date, contextualized within wider regional developments.
While there are documented country-level case studies of evidence use in Canada, the US, New Zealand, and the 
UK, and across the Scandinavian region (Boaz et al., 2019), this is the first country-level policy-oriented analysis from 
a L&MIC. The growing body of evidence from the ecosystems in a growing number of countries, including Uganda 
(Mijumbi et al., 2014; Mijumbi-Deve et al., 2017; Mijumbi-Deve & Sewankambo, 2017; Ongolo-Zogo et al. 2014, 
2015), Cameroon (Ongolo-Zogo et al. 2014, 2015), Nigeria (Uneke et al., 2012; Uneke et al., 2016, 2017), Brazil (Dias 
et al., 2014) and Chile (Pantoja et al., 2018; Rodríguez Osiac et al., 2017), are all limited to the health sector, and have 
a strong emphasis on the production of useful evidence and its consideration by decision-makers, rather than the 
government policy-making system. What we have not explored in this case study, and should perhaps be a subject for 
another analysis, is the extent to which evidence-informed policy is implemented in South Africa. This is something that 
has been considered elsewhere, including in Cameroon (Okwen, 2017), and in the UK (Breckon & Gough, 2019), and 
there is a growing body of relevant literature within South Africa from specific sectors, including health care (McCaul 
et al., 2020) and policing (Newham & Rappert, 2018), as well as in government performance (Tirivanhu et al., 2017).
By focusing across the evidence ecosystem in one country, South Africa—contextualized within developments 
across the continent and L&MICs as a whole—it has been possible to see the parallel and synergistic developments 
in different areas, including production and use, across sectors, and within both policies and the policy-making 
system. This allows the identification of lessons from South Africa regarding what is important in advancing routine 
evidence-use in decision-making, particularly within policy systems. Shared values and a desire and commitment to 
tackling poverty and inequality are at the heart of the work in South Africa and this “common agenda” may be the

secret to advancing evidence use elsewhere. A desire to understand one another, and to invest in relationships at 
individual, organizational, and institutional levels has been identified as key to shared goals, and synergistic develop-
ments in the evidence system. A recognition has emerged that decision-makers and decision-making have to be at 
the centre of efforts to increase the use of evidence in policy. This case study of South Africa has made it clear that 
decision-makers are not passive recipients of knowledge and have significant and leading roles to play. Lastly, there 
is growing clarity that supporting routine use of evidence, sometimes referred to as “institutionalization,” requires 
change throughout EIDM processes, among all actors, and across the ecosystem, not merely within the institutions 
of government.
South Africa has positioned itself not only to learn from others but also to share its own experiences and exper-
tise via a number of international relationships and regional hubs. Still in their infancy, further analysis of these 
learning relationships in the future will no doubt reveal more about both the scope for others to benefit from devel-
opments in South Africa, and for the South African ecosystem to learn from others. Other countries may benefit from 
mapping out their own evidence journeys alongside policy and political developments, as well as tracing their learning 
relationships with others. As this analysis has illustrated, the continental and L&MIC contexts can provide useful 
framing for the developments of evidence systems within individual countries. Over time, such research can enable 
greater comparisons, learning, and system strengthening across the global evidence ecosystem.
In conclusion, there is great potential and momentum in South Africa, and lessons for other countries, about how 
to enable meaningful change and to ensure that EIDM fulfils its potential to change lives for the better.
