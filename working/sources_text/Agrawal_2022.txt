M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
In 2022 India celebrates 75 years of its independence. This year also 
marks 70 years of the establishment of the Programme Evaluation 
Organization (PEO) by the Government of India. This marks a 
formal recognition of the monitoring and evaluation function within 
the government system. India is at a critical juncture – with future 
development contingent on carefully designed investments that are 
implemented efficiently. This will yield the intended developmental 
outcomes and help achieve our national priorities. Monitoring and 
Evaluation (M&E) is the cornerstone of this paradigm of output-outcome based performance 
measurement and public expenditure efficiency.
Since 2015, the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) at NITI Aayog has 
supported rigorous, data-driven, citizen-centric, and outcomes-driven program management 
and policy-making. DMEO has consistently undertaken initiatives to strengthen M&E systems 
and capacities necessary for addressing the complexities, diversities, and inequities across 
the country. DMEO is also partnering with States for facilitating cross-learning across all 
levels of the government.
It has increasingly become evident that M&E is imperative for sustainable development. 
In this context, DMEO has curated this Compendium of Essays encompassing various 
themes. These themes address different aspects of strengthening the M&E eco-system 
at the national and state levels. They will improve the understanding of the challenges in 
diverse M&E contexts and exploring the potential of data, technology and innovation in 
M&E for supporting evidence-based policy making. These essays will enable identifying 
institutional gaps in M&E systems and sharing good practices for course correction.
Cooperative federalism is the cornerstone for achieving the national development agenda. 
It is therefore imperative that M&E systems are further integrated as part of sub-national 
planning, implementation, and budgeting processes. This Compendium also includes 
experiences and lessons learnt from various States in India including Karnataka, Meghalaya 
and Uttar Pradesh, among others.
The essays cover a variety of relevant topics such as leveraging data for evaluation; 
formulation of evaluation policies; leveraging technology for monitoring of the delivery of 
public services; building capacities for evaluative thinking, as well as making evaluations 
inclusive and sensitive to the needs of the marginalized.

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
Since the Programme Evaluation Office (PEO) was established by 
the Government of India (GoI) in 1952, there has been considerable 
evolution of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems in the 
country at the national and state levels. Evidence-based policymaking 
has become integral to the governance structure in New India.
To build a strong M&E ecosystem in the country, the Development 
Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) at NITI Aayog has been 
mandated to actively monitor and evaluate the implementation of schemes, programs and 
initiatives of GoI to strengthen their implementation on an ongoing basis. DMEO is also 
collaborating actively with various State Governments to improve outcomes monitoring 
and institutionalize best practices emerging from the international and national arenas in 
the domain of M&E.
Sustainable development is not possible without strong M&E systems at both the national 
and state levels. This requires building institutional and resource capabilities for M&E at the 
sub-national level; making evaluations inclusive and sensitive to marginalized and vulnerable 
populations as well as contextualizing evaluation systems to measure the performance 
of public programs, track key development results, and support evidence-based policy 
planning and budgeting in states.
These are some of the key themes highlighted in this Compendium of Essays curated 
by DMEO. The diverse topics include various facets of strengthening the M&E ecosystem 
in states, capacity building, use of big data, participatory monitoring and optimizing 
government M&E systems during crises, among others. Alongside the DMEO team, this 
Compendium includes enriching contributions from highly distinguished experts across 
various organizations.
I appreciate the work of the team at DMEO, led by Dr. Sekhar Bonu, DG, DMEO. The editorial 
team consisting of Ashish Desai (Director), Urvashi Prasad (Director), Minal Malik (Research 
Officer), Veenu Singh (Research Officer) and Siby Christopher (Young Professional), worked 
under the overall guidance of Shri S.K. Dwivedi, Joint Secretary, DMEO in curating this 
compendium. DMEO’s editorial team was supported by Nandu S. Nair (Academic Associate 
Economics, IIM Kozhikode).

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
As India celebrates 75 years of its Independence, the country is at an opportune juncture – 
it is positioned among the fastest-growing large economies of the world with the asset of 
being home to one-fifth of the world’s youth population. Achievement of its development 
potential hinges not only on investing in the right policies and programmes but also 
implementing them effectively, wherein Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), plays a crucial 
role. However, in a large and diverse country such as India with a federated structure, M&E 
is all the more complex and challenging. Efforts to strengthen M&E systems and capacities 
must address complexities, diversities, and inequities. Experiencing an exogenous event 
such as the Covid-19 pandemic, has highlighted the importance of innovation in M&E.
This compendium of essays explores topical issues and trends for strengthening the M&E 
ecosystem. It is a curated invitation for papers from thought leaders, academicians, and 
policy makers.
The essays cover a broad range of topics from policy formulation, to use of technology and 
the role of capacity building in M&E. National policy is imperative for optimal utilization of 
resources but also to systematize the evaluation process and practice. The essay “Evaluation 
Policy at The Core of Evaluation Eco-System ” highlights the importance of a coherent 
national policy for evaluation at the Central and State levels. Karnataka is one of the first 
States in the country to evolve an Evaluation Policy in 2000. Over time, the State has 
developed a strong planning, monitoring and evaluation system in a decentralized, multi-
dimensional and participatory manner for pooling knowledge and resources by involving 
different stakeholders, including the public, private sector and civil society. “Strengthening 
the M&E ecosystem in States: Experiences from Karnataka ” articulates the approach, 
challenges, and benefits of executing data management systems, for enabling effective 
M&E systems.
Apart from having a coherent policy, in the current Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and 
Ambiguous (VUCA) world, M&E has to be capable of addressing the uncertainties of 
exogenous shocks. The essay “ A Framework for Optimizing Government Monitoring 
and Evaluation Systems During Crises” articulates, an M&E implementation framework to 
address the challenges of the VUCA world.
The M&E Framework needs to be supported by appropriate methodology and tools. While 
gold standard evaluations involve carefully calibrated before-and-after research designs, 
real-world policymaking and exogenous shocks often do not allow for planned evaluations

with phased programme implementation. The Essay titled “Leveraging Longitudinal Data 
for Evaluation” highlights how monitoring instruments can be pivoted into evaluation 
instruments with a longitudinal focus and incorporation of a causal lens. While we explore 
causality, it is imperative to go beyond “causality” to understand the “Why” and “How”. 
The Essay titled “ Mixed Methods in Evaluation: Beyond “causality”; to understand the 
‘Why’ and ‘How” highlights how mixed methods can strengthen M&E.
Use of data not only necessitates availability of data but also a cultural perspective. 
Supporting the mixed method approach in the Essay, “Building capacities for evaluative 
thinking and learning in Indian states: centering the role of values and norms” the authors 
draw on their experience of working with the Government of Meghalaya to center values 
and norms as a critical precursor to decision-making for evaluation. The Essay highlights 
the importance of long-term, process-focused, mixed-method, complex evaluations and 
the capacities that are required to support them. “ Capacity Building of National Rural 
Livelihood Mission Personnel on Evaluations and Data Utilization for Evidence-based 
Decision Making” further amplifies importance of capacity building, especially for large-
scale scheme evaluation programs. Culture and capacity are an integral part of successful 
M&E. “Developing a Culture of Evidence Use: Experiences from Uttar Pradesh” articulates 
a culture of data use for decision making in the Health Department of Government of 
Uttar Pradesh supported by the Uttar Pradesh Technical Support Unit (UPTSU).
In evidence-based policy making, quality of data is key, and technology can be leveraged for 
the same. Using a case experience, the Essay titled “Community Monitoring for strengthening 
responsible participation leveraging ICT” highlights how simple communication technology 
can be leveraged for unbiased, free and efficient participative monitoring. Moving beyond 
survey and administrative data; the essay “Big Data: Transforming Evidence based Policy 
Making” highlights how governance can be improved, made more efficient and effective 
through the use of Big Data.
Development must be inclusive of the marginalized classes as well. “ Inclusivity in 
Evaluations and Equity-Centric Budgeting”, attempts to underscore the role of equity-
centric evaluations for empowering marginalized groups while maintaining utmost 
sensitivity to their needs and requirements. One of the important dimensions of inclusivity 
is accessibility and affordability of food. The Essay, “ Road to Zero Hunger: Review of 
Evidence on India’s Food Safety Nets” undertakes a review of available literature on the 
effect of food safety nets on achieving food security and improving nutrition outcomes 
for the beneficiaries.
The Essay “ Enabling Coherence in Monitoring by Breaking Informational Silos ” details 
how India’s ability to break information silos can pave the way to a new phase of equitable, 
efficient, effective and sustainable resource utilization. In “Improving States’ Capacities for 
Responsive Social Protection Systems”, the author describes the relevance of building 
State capacity for designing, implementing, and financing social protection.
We are grateful to Honourable Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog; CEO, NITI Aayog; DG, DMEO 
and Shri S.K. Dwivedi, Joint Secretary, DMEO for their encouragement and guidance in 
putting together this compendium. We are also thankful to all the authors who shared

1. Introduction
A fundamental tenet of impact evaluation involves examining causal linkages that help 
establish how an intervention affected key outcomes and constituencies, whether positively 
or negatively. Randomized Control Trials (RCT) have emerged as the gold standard for 
establishing causal linkages. However, it is often impossible to randomly assign individuals 
to control and treatment groups in real-world policymaking due to ethical or practical 
considerations (White & Raitzer, 2017). Moreover, programs that succeed during trials often 
do not fare well when scaled up (List, Suskind, & Supplee, 2021)^BT or efforts at ensuring 
internal validity focuses on what works and not why it works (Deaton & Cartwright, 2018), 
consequently we may find that what works in Uttar Pradesh does not work in Kerala.
This implies that instead of putting all our eggs in one basket, it would make sense to think 
of non-experimental or quasi-experimental designs for impact evaluation. One strategy is to 
leverage existing data collection systems. Using the monitoring framework for Sustainable 
Development Goals provides an exciting opportunity for building such linkages. Almost all 
state planning departments are undertaking surveys for SDG monitoring. If these surveys 
can be planned to serve the goals of impact evaluation in critical domains, considerable 
serendipitous benefits can be achieved.
As the examples below suggest, a variety of longitudinal survey designs can be used in 
impact evaluation.
2. Natural Experiments
A rapidly transforming society offers tremendous opportunities for undertaking impact 
evaluations. Many Centrally Sponsored Schemes in India are expected to be applied 
nationally. However, states may find it challenging to implement these schemes 
simultaneously through the state and may undertake phased implementation. Moreover, 
states often have latitude in structuring the execution mode and may also supplement 
some of the benefits from their own resources. This provides tremendous opportunities 
for comparing programmes at varying levels of intensity.
An example evaluating the impact of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) illustrates. India Human Development Survey (IHDS), 
organized by the National Council of Applied Economic Research and University of 
Maryland, USA, conducted over 40,000 households across India in 2004-5 and 2011-12. 
MGNREGS was implemented in 2006. Since the same households were in 2004-5 and 
2011-12, this survey provides an interesting opportunity to compare household well-being 
before and after the implementation of MGNREGS. Since MGNREGS implementation varied 
substantially across states and villages in any given district, this variation provides an 
interesting opportunity to understand the opportunities offered by access to employment 
during lean seasons. Figure 1 (Desai, Vashishtha, & Joshi, 2015) describes the trend in 
borrowing from the moneylenders, who typically lend at much higher interest rates than 
banks and microcredit programmes over this period in time. Results show that as formal 
credit became more available during this period, reliance on moneylenders declined 
nationwide. However, the decline was much sharper in villages with well-functioning 
MGNREGS and households that could obtain work in MGNREGA.

3. Heterogeneous Impacts
The IHDS data also provided an opportunity to study the impact of improvement in 
transportation on women’s ability to participate in non-farm work (Lei, Desai, & Vanneman, 
2019). Comparing men’s and women’s participation in non-farm work shows that villages 
that gained roads between 2004-5 and 2011-12 allowed both men and women to improve 
access to non-farm work by easing their commutes to nearby towns. This impact was 
greater and statistically significant for women but not for men since even before the 
roads were constructed, men could walk to nearby highways and find some mode of 
transportation which was difficult for women. However, opportunities offered by improved 
transportation had far more significant impacts in villages in which gender norms were 
more permissive when it came to women’s participation in public life. In areas where gender 
norms were more restrictive as measured by the proportion of women who practiced 
ghunghat, it was more difficult for women to take advantage of improved transportation.

4. Unexpected Events
The pandemic has demonstrated the limit of our ability to undertake research in the face 
of disaster. When data collection structure was already in place, it was far easier to explore 
the impact of the pandemic than where new data collection systems had to be established 
from scratch. National Council of Applied Economic Research had begun data collection 
in the NCR region under Delhi Metropolitan Area Study in 2019. This study had a face-to-
face interview and a telephone interview component. The telephone interviews included 
monthly 5-minute phone calls to collect data on employment of selected respondents, men 
and women ages 21-49 over the prior month. These surveys were continued throughout 
the pandemic, allowing for monthly data on employment for the same respondent and 
during the lockdown. Additionally, it was possible to contact respondents from the face-to-
face survey sample to develop a representative sample of Delhi NCR residents to explore 
the impact of a pandemic.

The results suggest that most job losses occurred among men, contrary to the media 
claims. Women were somewhat protected because they tended to engage in farming, 
allied activities, and other forms of self-employment that were largely exempt from the 
restrictions placed by the lockdown. However, when we look at only loss in wage work, 
women experienced were relatively more disadvantaged than men (Desai, Deshmukh, & 
Pramanik, 2021).
These data also revealed greater vulnerability among urban households than rural 
households, highlighting the challenges facing urban informal sector workers. This study 
found that although the lockdown affected the urban poor more than the rural poor, 
safety net mechanisms were skewed towards the rural area and may partially explain the

urban to rural migration witnessed during the lockdown (NCAER National Data Innovation 
Centre, 2020).
5. Types of Longitudinal Studies
The examples above illustrate the opportunities longitudinal surveys can offer for impact 
evaluation using both prospective designs. It is also possible to conduct longitudinal 
research using a retrospective design that includes questions about past events and 
experiences. Still, in the interest of brevity, these are not included here. Below, I briefly 
describe different types of longitudinal studies and their advantages and shortcomings.
6. Repeated Cross-Sections in the Same Villages/Blocks
Instead of drawing fresh samples of villages and blocks for each maternal and child health 
survey, it may make sense to undertake surveys within the same villages and blocks, 
even if new households are selected each time. This would minimize respondent burden 
but allow the analyst to compare changes in the same area as infrastructure facilities 
and programme implementation change over time. For example, the impact of door-step 
delivery of vaccination services may depend upon the village’s location. Households in 
a developed village where health services are readily available may not benefit from a 
door-step delivery programme as much as more remote villages. Thus, tracing the impact 
of localized programmes may require data collection within the same villages and urban 
blocks.
7. Repeated Surveys of the Same Households
The examples from IHDS and DMAS above involve interviews of the same households at 
different times. By allowing us to study change over time in the conditions of the same 
households, these panel studies offer an opportunity to imitate a pre- and post-intervention 
approach of RCTs. However, they also involve some challenges such as a collection of re-
contact information to ensure that the same households can be located when the next 
round of data collection takes place; reducing differential attrition which may lead to a 
biased sample; and periodically refreshing the original sample to ensure new migrants 
are included. Despite these challenges, repeat surveys of households have been used 
extensively worldwide to provide impact evaluations. One of the most important and 
widely cited panel studies, Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in America, has been 
conducted for over 50 years with periodic sample augmentation and has yielded a large 
number of studies evaluating the impact of a variety of programmes and events (Johnson, 
McGonagle, Freedman, & Sastry, 2018).
8. Repeated Surveys of the Same Individuals
Given the complexities involved in maintaining household panels, many studies focus on 
individuals as their sampling unit and try to follow them regardless of their location. 
One of the benefits of studying individual panels is that it allows researchers to study 
the impact of programs over a more extended period of individuals’ life. Some of the
<<<PAGE=20>>>
Building Capacity for Leveraging Longitudinal Data for Evaluation
6
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
interesting studies of this genre in India include research on the effects of participation 
in ICDS on subsequent health or learning outcomes (Vikram & Chindarkar, 2020) and 
the impact of husband’s migration on the health of left-behind wives (Lei & Desai, 2021). 
Individual panels have been used successfully in various contexts for impact evaluation 
for long-term outcomes in many countries. They have a well-established framework that 
can be followed more quickly than household panels since they focus on single individuals 
and not a family group. 
9. Building Capacity to Undertake Longitudinal Studies
Undertaking longitudinal analysis requires both pieces of training in structuring data 
collection and planning. However, a tremendous amount of data collection is currently 
taking place via monitoring studies carried out by the state Planning Boards. Most of 
these studies are cross-sectional, but with some foresight and planning, critical features 
of longitudinal studies can be easily incorporated. In the section below, I focus on what it 
would take to build capacity for undertaking longitudinal research in state Planning Boards. 
Still, it also applies to other ministries and departments that undertake monitoring studies 
(e.g., studies of migrants done by the Ministry of Labour and Employment). 
Three aspects of developing the capacity to undertake longitudinal research are important: 
(1) Learning about different types of longitudinal studies and statistical techniques for 
analyzing longitudinal data; (2) Future-proofing monitoring and cross-sectional studies to 
preserve the possibility of turning them into prospective longitudinal studies; (3) Getting 
hands-on experience in designing and analyzing longitudinal data. 
10. Learning Activities
1. Studying Examples of Longitudinal Research:  Besides some of the readings 
above, there are many exciting examples of longitudinal research (Himanshu, 
Lanjouw, & Stern, 2018; Thorat, Vanneman, Desai, & Dubey, 2017).
2. Reading Methodological Literature on Longitudinal Research Design: Lambert 
and Gayle (2004) have a good reading list. Longitudinal and Life Course Studies: 
An International Journal offers excellent articles. 
3. Analyzing Existing Longitudinal Data Sets: Besides the India Human Development 
Survey, WHO Sage surveys also offer Indian datasets that can be used for 
longitudinal research.
11. Future-proofing Cross-Sectional Studies
1. Obtaining Identification and Recontact Information: Following individuals, 
households, or communities over time requires ensuring that researchers contact 
these units. This involves:
a. Collecting data on the location of villages and blocks, ensuring block maps and 
boundary information is preserved and collecting Local Government Directory 
ID so that external information about the communities from other sources
<<<PAGE=21>>>
Building Capacity for Leveraging Longitudinal Data for Evaluation
7
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
can be superimposed on any given data. Obtaining contact information about 
village Pradhan or RWA president is helpful, as is information about travel 
routes to the village. 
b. Household address, phone number, name of relatives/friends who can provide 
information about the household, and GPS coordinates of the family would 
make it easier to trace the households. 
c. Individuals’ age, birthdate, full name, phone number, email information, and 
recontact information for the household make it easier to trace the individuals. 
It is essential to avoid writing down nicknames and collect data on full names. 
Many families call little girls Munni, but when the interviewers revisit, she 
may be known by her formal name. Parents’ names will also help identify 
the individual. 
2. Obtaining Recontact Permission: While Data Protection Bill is still under review, 
it would be helpful to develop a study plan that allows for potential recontact in 
cases where a longitudinal study is envisaged. This would require consent from 
respondents to store their identification information and permission for a return 
visit. Consent forms should be modified to include this. 
12. Undertaking Longitudinal Studies
Some of the considerations for undertaking longitudinal studies include:
1. Repeated Cross-Section in Same Communities: This is low-hanging fruit. Most 
Planning Departments routinely carry out surveys for monitoring a variety of 
indicators. Undertaking surveys in the same locality would allow the study of 
changes over time while holding community factors and geography constant. 
Obtaining some community information through a community module that 
contains information about village or urban infrastructure (e.g., distance to the 
PHC or proximity to the highway) would help in analyzing how changes in various 
indicators being measured change over time and whether the changes are more 
significant for areas with better transportation. 
2. Repeated Surveys of the Same Individuals: Growth monitoring for young children 
or antenatal/postnatal care for women may lend themselves very well to a short 
panel. Since the interviewer would visit the households in rapid succession (e.g., 
in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and six weeks after 
birth), it would be easier to track the individuals. If the interval between two 
interviews is longer, ensuring that the individual is contactable is somewhat more 
challenging. However, panel studies in rural areas have been quite successful given 
India’s low level of migration. Urban tracking is a little more complicated. Note 
that non-contact may occur due to different reasons such as inability to find 
the individual, their or their guardian’s refusal to be interviewed, or death. These 
various reasons for non-interview should be coded separately to aid in analysis.

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
1. Introduction
The recent revolution in data management systems, has spurred a slow but steady 
evolution in the field of monitoring and evaluation systems involving a movement away 
from traditional implementation- based approaches to development planning towards 
new evidence -based and outcome focused approaches to maximize gross welfare with 
optimum utilization of resources. For ex. in health programmes, it is not enough to simply 
implement health programs, construct hospitals and provide infrastructure and assume that 
successful implementation is equivalent to actual improvements in public health. One must 
also examine outcomes in terms of decline in incidence of diseases, decline in mortality 
rates, and impacts in terms of better health for all, improvement in health index and quality 
of life. This is also strengthened by growing public awareness to assess the performance 
of the government periodically in terms of efficiency and outcomes of public expenditures. 
The introduction of a results-based M&E system therefore, takes decision makers a step 
further in assessing whether and how goals are being achieved over time and thus making 
the system accountable for public welfare.
An evidence-based approach to policymaking is now being accepted as an effective tool 
to improve policy outcomes on the assumption that better quality decisions will be made 
if the process is informed by robust evidence. With this structured approach to evaluation, 
knowledge generated can be used to improve practice, allowing successful programs to 
develop iteratively over time. Rigorous evaluation can end the spinning of wheels and 
bring more effective social policy outcomes. At global level, J-PAL has shown that how 
complex development challenges can be solved with data analytics and evidence-based 
decisions. (J-PAL OES-2015). 
In India the evaluation culture and practice were institutionalized through establishment 
of an independent Programme Evaluation Organization (PEO) in October 1952. 
(Dr S Chandrashekhar) & later an Independent Evaluation Office of Planning commission in 
2010 for evaluation of Govt. programmes and schemes. However, the culture of evaluation 
was not able to establish identity due to lack of demand. There were questions of autonomy 
also. Now the agenda is taken forward by Development Monitoring & Evaluation Office 
of NITI Aayog. The efforts are on to strengthen the M&E ecosystem at the Centre and in 
the States. 
2. M&E Ecosystem at Sub- Regional Level- Karnataka Model
Evaluation must satisfy a need. “What is involved is a complex mixture of institutional pre-
conditions, political culture, exposure to intellectual traditions, as well as sectoral concerns 
dominating the political discussion ...” (Furubo, Rist, and Sandahl 2002, p.16). 
Establishing a M&E ecosystem at sub-regional level pre-requisites the following:
  Readiness of the system- Government commitment & Basic Institutional 
arrangements
  Agreement among Departments to evaluate the schemes -ownership and 
accountability.

(Based on Jody and Rist, 2004)
Karnataka had a favourable environment enabling it to meet many of these basic requirements. 
Karnataka was one of the first States in the Country to adopt an Evaluation Policy in 2000. 
An evaluation division of Planning Department was overseeing the Evaluation of schemes 
and Programmes. An evaluation system and culture were established with departments 
participating in it. Later, for facilitating independent evaluation of Schemes/programmes, 
Karnataka Evaluation Authority (KEA) was set up vide Government of Karnataka order 
no. PD/8/EVN (2)/2011 dated 11th July 2011 and registered as a Society vide registration 
number DRB-C/SOR/140/2011-12 on 19th September 2011 under the Karnataka Societies 
Registration Act, 1960. It functions under Planning, Programme Monitoring and Statistics 
Department (PPMS). 
The State has established a strong data base and monitoring platform required to implement 
a result-based management system. The Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) 
is continuously involved in broadening and deepening the data base and provide all the 
relevant data for effective planning of schemes and activities and devise KPIs for designing 
effective monitoring tools. DES is a data mining platform; it has been empowered to act as 
Nodal Agency by Government in respect of all the statistical activities of the state and to 
provide advice to all the government departments on all the statistical matters. Statistical 
data on various socio-economic activities of the state are being collected, processed, 
analysed and published on regular basis.
The Directorate prepares estimates for Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), Gross 
Districts Domestic Product (GDDP), Per capita Income of the State and Districts, Wholesale 
and Retail Price Index, Annual survey of Industries, Estimation of Area, Yield and Production 
of various crops grown in the state during kharif, rabi and summer seasons, reconciliation 
of crop area statistics, conducting sample check on important developmental programmes, 
National Sample Survey, Agriculture Census, Economic Census, Registration of Births and 
Deaths and publishing various reports. In addition to this, the Crop Insurance Scheme 
Division conducts crop cutting experiments on major selected crops through mobile app 
and estimates average yields at the Gram Panchayat, Hobli, Taluk and District wise for 
settlement of insurance claims to the farmers for crop loss by Agriculture Department.
The Directorate publishes important publications called “Karnataka at a Glance” (GoK2021) 
and “District at a Glance” every year which contains taluk/district level information, 
linking with the Geographical Information System developed by Karnataka State Remote

Sensing Applications Centre (KSRSAC). These publications contain information about 2000 
parameters both static as well as dynamic (Population Census, Agricultural Census and 
Animal Husbandry Census) on yearly basis. The information is available on the website 
des.karnataka.gov.in and planning.karnataka.gov.in. Recently, NITI Aayog has evolved 49 
Indicators/87 data points spread across 5 sectors namely, Health & Nutrition (30%), 
Education (30%), Agriculture & Water Resources (20%), Basic Infrastructure (10%) and 
Financial Inclusion & Skill Development (10%) to monitor the transformation of Aspirational 
Districts (NITI Aayog 2018). Based on the information, the data for 49 indicators/87 data 
points is collected for all the taluks of the state to identify the development gaps across 
the talukas from the state average. 
3. Avalokana-Monitoring System
Avalokana, symbolizing transparency in governance, was launched on 20 Jan 2021 
redesigning the Decision Support System. It serves as an example of responsible, 
accountable, transparent and sustainable governance. The citizens at a click can view 
the Government spend by sector, geography, department, view SDG barometer etc. The 
platform assimilates and integrates data from the GP level to the State. More than 30,000 
Government officers are onboarded in the system. Avalokana provides real time information 
on more than 1700 schemes (Central Sector and District Sector). The State Treasury system 
Khajane II is integrated with Avalokana to provide seamless real time information on the 
dashboards. The boards and corporations of the Government also update their financial 
information on Avalokana.
4. SDG Barometer

non- governmental organizations, and educational institutions. The SDG Barometer stimulates 
and facilitates the adoption of SDGs by organizations, contribute to developing new 
governmental action programs, and provide insights for non- governmental organizations, 
business networks, and knowledge institutions to spur the effective implementation of the 
SDGs. Data has been organically collected in way of input from the taluk level, APIs with 
various departments are being integrated on https:/ /avalokana.karnataka.gov.in. Progress 
is monitored with 49 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) under 5 broad socio-economic 
themes - Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion 
& Skill Development and Infrastructure. 
5. Karnataka Evaluation Authority
KEA was established to supervise, facilitate, build capacity and handhold all departments 
for effective Planning, Monitoring and fine tuning of the policies, programmes, and schemes 
for result oriented and outcome-based implementation. The changeover from financial 
allocations and expenditures to output and outcomes was to ensure a transparent, 
accountable and outcome-oriented mechanism to bring out the impact of every rupee 
spent by the Govt. on welfare of the masses.

7.1. Evaluation of Mid -Day Meals scheme by KEA
A report on midday meals in the state by the Karnataka Evaluation Authority says that 2.1 
lakh children — 6.4% of total children in  government schools  — do not get  breakfast  at 
home. For them, milk given in school is the first meal of the day, pointing to the 
need of expanding the mid-day meals to breakfasts too. Noting that milk and midday 
meal scheme have done wonders in enrolment, retention, learning levels and health of 
children. Read more at: http:/ /timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/81441002.cms?utm_

Change in Guidelines for Bhagyalaxmi Scheme 
The scheme was launched in 2006–07 to improve the status of girl children in BPL 
families. The study observed Change in attitude towards girl child & Registration of 
the birth of a girl child was 100%.
The report noted, “With 18 years of age and minimum eighth standard education, the 
scheme looks somewhat marriage oriented.” as majority of parents (76.7%) use the 
Bhagyalakshmi scheme used money for marriage purpose when the girl child attains 
the age of 18.
The State Cabinet, took a decision on Oct. 22, 2020 to increase the age limit to 21 
for withdrawal of the full amount under the scheme.
The remodeled scheme allows for withdrawal of a portion of the total amount of 
Rs. 1.27 lakh to be withdrawn at the age of 18 for pursuing education and the remaining 
at 21 years. (The Hindu Oct. 23, 2020)

7 .2 .1 . SDG-1: No Poverty 
The analysis of Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index has identified that out of the total 
population in Karnataka, 1.01 crore population is poor (incidence of poverty) and 34.9 lakh 
population is multidimensionally poor (intensity of poverty). The five districts which are 
poor performers (high incidence, intensity and MPI) are Yadgir, Raichur, Bidar, Vijayapura 
and Gadag.
7 .2 .2 . SDG-2: Zero Hunger
To break the vicious cycle of low productivity, 398 critical GPs require immediate attention. 
These are in the districts of Chikkamagalur, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura Koppal Mysore 
Mandya, Ballari, Belgaum, Dakshina Kannada, Davangere and Hassan, especially in the 
priority agro-climatic zones-North Eastern dry zone, Northern dry zone & Southern 
transition zone. The main crops which require immediate focus are-maize, ragi, jowar, 
paddy and wheat.
7 .2 .3 . SDG3: Good Health and Well Being 
Data on Morbidity and Mortality of Diseases from 2011 to 2020 was obtained from HMIS and 
Epidemiological Transition Level Ratio (ETL) Ratio was drawn for each Taluka. ETL Ratio 
was calculated to determine the Burden of Communicable disease to non-Communicable 
disease. 57 Talukas were under High ETL Ratio. Shivamogga, Belagavi, Kalburgi, Dharwad 
and Haveri Districts were under High burden of Non – Communicable diseases. 57 talukas 
in Eight districts need focus to address anaemia among women. 
7 .2 .4 . SDG 4: Quality Education 
Learning outcomes and dropout showed that 3 districts fall in the high-risk category- 
Kalaburagi, Koppal and Bengaluru Urban where dropout is high, and the learning outcomes 
are low. One of the possible ways of reducing the dropout rate at secondary level and 
increasing learning outcomes would be through priority spending on secondary education 
under Samagra Shikshana Abhiyan. It should include focus on quality components, 
development of school infrastructure, ICT labs and digital infrastructure, transport and 
hostel facility. To improve the PTR, rationalization and redeployment of teachers from low 
PTR to high PTR talukas should be considered. Quality teachers must be recruited from 
DIETs to fill in the vacancies of teachers in blocks with high PTR.
7 .2 .5 . SDG 5: Gender Equality 
The analysis revealed that 112 talukas are below the State average in Gender Equality 
score. 16 Talukas reporting poor performance in all five themes used to compute GEI, 
health, Education, employment, empowerment, and infrastructure warranting immediate 
interventions. The major factors affecting the Female Labour Force Participation Rate 
(FLFPR) are -lack of skills, bank account, digital literacy, land ownership and house, access 
to decision making process in the family & fear of violence.

Abstract
Development evaluations strengthen evidence-based decision-making and help the policy 
makers achieve the SDGs. National evaluation policies provide the necessary institutional 
frameworks and mechanisms to systematise the evaluation processes and standards that 
contribute to enhance the demand for evaluations and create scope for building capacities 
of the development professionals and institutions. Evaluation policies steer, coordinate and 
systematize evaluations, helping in institutionalizing evaluations and contributing to the 
development of a strong evaluation ecosystem by bringing all relevant stakeholders to 
work together. Even though India recognized the value of evaluations as early as 1950, 
and has been conducting evaluative studies at national and state levels since then, the 
absence of coherent national evaluation policy renders them ad hoc exercises. The paper 
elaborates the importance of such a policy and what aspects it should cover, such as to 
what development interventions need to be evaluated and how often, adherence to national 
technical and ethical standards, necessary institutional mechanisms for capacity building 
and professionalization of evaluation through the involvement of professional associations 
and academic institutions, building partnerships with various institutional stakeholders, 
allocation of adequate resources, etc. Once a national policy is adopted, the next step 
would be to encourage various state governments through approaches of cooperative 
federalism to adopt similar policies and weave them together into a coherent evaluation 
ecosystem for the country. The paper argues that it will not only lead to optimal utilisation 
of resources but also systematise the evaluation process and practice.
1. Introduction
The post Second World War decades have witnessed a quantum expansion in programme 
evaluation activities, both in theoretical discussions as well as in the methodological 
quality and geographical reach of practical applications. This happened initially due to 
the large number of international development assistance programmes embarked upon 
by the advanced countries and the desire of the donors to get the money’s worth from 
the assistance extended by them, but later the developing nations started realizing the 
importance of country-led evaluations and evidence-based decision making for their own 
development interventions. Soon enough, the process of institutionalization of evaluation 
began in several countries in different forms and to different degrees. In recent years, 
there have been a number of studies to assess the progress of various countries in this 
direction, to identify factors contributing to this process, such as the constitutional or 
legislative mandate, executive instructions, etc.1 One of the important ingredients of this 
process of institutionalization is the adoption of a national evaluation policy (NEP). An 
evaluation policy acts like a rudder that steers activities relating to evaluation both for 
the national governments and non-government organizations. NEPs in a way demonstrate 
the willingness of the governments to review their policies and programmes and take 
appropriate actions. They also lay down evaluation standards that enhance the credibility 
of evidence produced on the effectiveness of development interventions in the country

and contribute towards building confidence and ensure accountability to the tax payers, 
donors and development investors. On the other hand, absence of a policy could lead to 
pitfalls like uncoordinated planning and execution of evaluations, poor quality of results 
and under-utilization of evidence, and inadequate review systems and standards. 
NEP, in this paper, is intended to mean an official document approved by the government, 
spelling out the planning and implementation of the evaluations in the government sector, 
which can be extended to the private sector as well. Not many developing countries 
have as yet adopted evaluation policies of their own, though many of them have been 
undertaking evaluations for decades. For instance, in Africa, only 5 countries (South Africa, 
Benin, Uganda, Nigeria and Zimbabwe) have established evaluation policies. Some others, 
like Kenya and Ghana are in the process of adopting such a policy. In Asia, a recent 
study on the status of national evaluation policies and systems in Asia Pacific Region 
found that out of the 14 responding countries, only Nepal has evaluation integrated in the 
country’s Constitution, whereas Sri Lanka has an evaluation policy approved by the national 
government. Japan has an Evaluation Act in place and Republic of Korea has drafted a 
bill, which is under process. (Diwakar et al., 2021). Bhutan too has a draft evaluation policy 
(Bhutan, 2017). 
India presents a case of curious exception. It does not have a Constitutional mandate or 
enacted statutes or frameworks of standards for evaluation. However, it has been carrying 
out evaluations for almost seven decades, and has some M &E institutional infrastructure. 
It cannot, however, be said that evaluation has become institutionalized. As pointed out 
by Mehrotra (2013), the evaluation ecosystem in India is indeed a ‘work in progress’. This 
paper looks at the imperatives and implications of a NEP for India, the aspects that such 
a policy should guide government’s planning and execution of evaluation functions to 
optimize the benefits, and more broadly, the place and role of the policy in creating a 
strong evaluation ecosystem in the country. It also emphasizes the need to encourage 
various state governments through approaches of cooperative federalism to adopt similar 
policies and weave them together into a coherent evaluation ecosystem for the country.
2.  Evaluation Ecosystem and Evaluation Policy: The Concept 
and Linkage
It is important to look at the overall evaluation ecosystem and the role of NEP within 
that ecosystem. Evaluation ecosystem refers to an overarching structure in which various 
types of organizations and partners in the field of evaluation interact, learn and grow 
together. It does not mean the mere existence of institutions that conduct evaluations from 
time to time; rather, it means mechanisms that encourage and promote evidence-based 
decision-making, streamline commissioning and conducting of high-quality evaluations, 
highlight the importance of maintaining ethical norms and standards, develop processes 
that ensure the results are utilized and finally connect all evaluation stakeholders, both 
government and private, through a network and learning process. The ecosystem also 
ensures development of institutional and individual capacities of the evaluators to the 
required level. Therefore, some of the prominent elements that characterize the ecosystem 
are the existence of a monitoring and evaluation system in a country, engagement of both
<<<PAGE=38>>>
Evaluation Policy – The Core of Evaluation Ecosystem
24
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
state and non-state stakeholders, recognition of the importance of evidence-based policies 
and interventions, use of evidence generated by evaluations, establishing evaluation as a 
separate discipline to professionalize this field, and existence of functioning professional 
associations of evaluators. Evaluation ecosystem in a country contributes to create both 
demand for evaluations and supply of quality evaluators. 
An evaluation ecosystem can exist and be functional even without a NEP. For example, 
countries like Australia, United Kingdom and Singapore don’t have any evaluation policy 
but they function within a well-developed ecosystem. However, a national policy has the 
ability to bind various elements of the ecosystem together into a coherent whole. It ensures 
that there is a mechanism to promote general awareness on the importance of evidence 
in developing effective policies and their implementation. A policy can boost the demand 
for quality evaluations (Højlund, 2015). The aspects of policy on capacity building, on the 
other hand, promotes supply of quality evaluators. Further, an evaluation policy helps in 
bringing together the state and the civil society together and promote the involvement 
of all segments of the society in planning, implementation and reviewing of development 
interventions, so that no one is left behind.
The United Nations Evaluation Group’s (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation 
prescribe that an organization should have an evaluation policy to ensure evaluation 
function’s adherence to set standards. This applies, not only to individual organizations 
but to governments as well. The Global Parliamentarians’ Forum for Evaluation (GPFE) 
also stressed the importance of national evaluation policies (see box)
What can a National Evaluation Policy achieve for parliaments and governments?
A National Evaluation Policy can: 
  Build public trust and confidence in parliamentary and governmental 
accountability, and the effectiveness of national development interventions 
  Ensure more effective resource allocation, by monitoring and reviewing successes 
and barriers to achieving outcomes 
  Provide assurance to tax payers, donors and investors for the accountability of 
resources and their appropriate investment in effective programmes 
  Provide a framework and evidence-based learning to support civil society 
interventions, to ensure more holistic and aligned programming 
  Assist in most efficiently meeting national Sustainable Development Goal targets, 
and achieving social equity and human rights 
  Demonstrate the tangible achievements of the parliament in order to encourage 
popular public support

3. Need for an Evaluation Policy in India
In India, Government have recognized monitoring and evaluation as important tools for 
the optimum utilization of resources for development right from the 1950’s. Subsequently, 
certain monitoring systems were put into place in different Ministries for the major 
developmental schemes and programmes. Those monitoring systems gradually evolved 
into results-based budgetary management systems and real-time monitoring systems. 
Evaluations are also conducted from time to time of individual schemes and programmes, 
generally as and when a need was felt, though some ministries like the Ministry of Rural 
Development and Panchayat Raj, conduct evaluation on a fairly regular basis. Recently in 
2016, the Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure) has issued instructions to all 
Ministries/Departments (D. O. No. 66(01)/PF. II/2015 dated 18 May 2016) require, inter alia, 
that (a) measurable outcomes need to be defined for each scheme over the medium term, 
and (b) an evaluation framework would be designed for each scheme. Any continuation 
of the scheme beyond 2019-20 would be contingent on the result of such evaluation by 
the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI). 
In spite of extensive development evaluation practice, India doesn’t have a national policy 
to coordinate and guide different components of the evaluation function for enabling 
delivery of high-quality evaluative evidence. Except the state government of Karnataka, no 
other state in India adopted an evaluation policy. Generally, evaluations are commissioned 
by individual ministries and departments independently, often in response to the need 
to fulfil the requirements of processing proposals for the continuation or scaling-up of 
programmes and not necessarily as a part of the learning process to improve performance. 
Many evaluation findings go unutilized, and there is no system of tracking the use of 
evidence. At times, in the absence of nationally laid down uniform technical and ethical 
standards the quality of evaluations also may not measure up to the required level. 
Simultaneously, evaluation has not yet been recognized as a professional field of study 
and usually generalists with added qualifications in M&E carry out this function. Unlike 
in some advanced countries, there are no full-time academic courses in M&E in higher 
educational institutions in India. Under the circumstances, evaluators are drawn from diverse 
fields of study with a top-up of short-term training or practical experience. Competency 
requirements and a system of certification of skills in this field are absent in India.
 It is indeed necessary to formulate NEP that could lead to embedding evaluation 
function formally and firmly in the decision-making process in governance. NEP would 
sensitize decision makers, program implementers and managers about the importance of 
measurement, evidence and learning. In other words, it would create evaluative thinking 
at all levels of the government. NEP will enhance the accountability of the state for its 
citizens. The specific objectives of an evaluation policy are as shown in Figure 1 below:

4. The Ingredients of an Effective Evaluation Policy
According to the Norm 12 of the UNEG Norms and Standards 2016, an organization’s 
“evaluation policy should include a clear explanation of the purpose, concepts, rules 
and use of evaluation within the organization; the institutional framework and roles and 
responsibilities; measures to safeguard evaluation independence and public accountability; 
benchmarks for financing the evaluation function that are commensurate with the size and 
function of the organization; measures to ensure the quality and the use of evaluations 
and post-evaluation follow-up; a framework for decentralized evaluations, where applicable; 
and provision for periodic peer review or external assessment” (UNEG, 2016). While this 
prescription is primarily for individual organizations, it can easily be adapted to national 
evaluation policies, mutatis mutandis. Countries which have adopted an evaluation policy 
did so according to their needs.
The revised National Evaluation Policy Framework adopted by South Africa (South 
Africa Planning Monitoring and Evaluation, 2019) is very comprehensive and provides 
the basis for a minimum system of evaluation across government with the purpose 
of guiding and promoting relevance, efficiency and quality in evaluation processes. 
The policy is structured into three broad sections the first providing the background 
(purpose, applicability, achievements, situational analysis, relevant legislations etc.), the 
second providing conceptual framework of evaluations (such as definitions, rationale for 
evaluations, types and approaches, evaluation criteria and questions, location of evaluation 
in policy/programme cycle, and links between evaluation, planning and budgeting) and the 
third institutionalization and evaluation practice in government (identification of evaluands, 
planning, preparing for evaluations and implementation, monitoring use of evaluation 
results, standardized systems and processes, and capacity development.
The draft Development Evaluation Policy of Bhutan (Bhutan Gross National Happiness 
Commission, 2017), lists as its objectives, a) providing an overall framework for evaluation, 
b) streamlining evaluation initiatives, and standardize evaluation processes and products, 
c) promoting quality and credibility of evaluations, and d) promoting use of evaluation
<<<PAGE=41>>>
Evaluation Policy – The Core of Evaluation Ecosystem

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
findings. The key sections of the policy relate to protocol for evaluation, promotion of 
evaluation culture, financing and monitoring the implementation of the policy. 
Uganda’s Public Sector Monitoring and Evaluation Policy (Uganda Prime Minister’s Office, 
2013) provides a framework for strengthening the coverage, quality and utility of the 
assessment of public policies and investments. It outlines the objectives of the policy, 
key concepts, guiding principles, policy requirements, roles and responsibilities of various 
ministries, departments and agencies, coordination and implementation plan. The Policy 
aims to enhance the basis for decision makers at all levels starting from the cabinet to 
the local councils. It, inter alia, proposes clear allocation of finances for monitoring and 
evaluation within the national budget. 
Nepal’s Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines (Nepal National Planning Commission, 
2013) sets out the provisions in 6 parts, viz., (a) background, objectives, concepts and 
evolution of M&E system in the country, (b) concepts and processes of results based 
management, monitoring and evaluation, (c) institutional structure of M&E at various levels, 
(d) monitoring and evaluation reports and their dissemination, their analysis and feedback, 
and implementation plan, (e) ensuring transparency, accountability and social responsibility, 
and f) miscellaneous provisions, including for human resources development and budget 
for monitoring plan. 
In India, only the state government of Karnataka adopted an evaluation policy as early as 
in 2000, according to which all schemes (PLAN) with more than Rs. 1 crore outlay were 
required to be evaluated at least once in 5 years by all the government departments, 
corporations, boards, local bodies and other publicly funded entities and 1% of the total 
outlay of a project/scheme, with an upper limit of Rs. 5 lakhs, is to be kept for evaluation 
purpose. It is mandatory for a scheme/project to continue beyond plan period to be 
justified by evaluation. A Karnataka Evaluation Authority was created to implement the 
policy. 
Recently, the Evaluation Community of India (ECOI), a Voluntary Organization of 
Professional Evaluators (VOPE) has suggested a draft policy which provided for a 
preamble tracing the history of monitoring and evaluation in India, applicability of the 
proposed policy, key definitions of terms relating to evaluation, evaluation principles and 
ethics, evaluation criteria, gender and equity, evaluation methods, evaluation management, 
professional standards and capacity building, annual evaluation plan, and implementation 
and governance of policy.
Broadly speaking, the components that need to be considered for inclusion in NEP are:
  The background and rationale for an evaluation policy
  The applicability
  Definitions of principal Terms
  Evaluation methods
  Professional standards and capacity building 
  Implementation and action plan
  Institutional arrangements and roles and responsibilities
<<<PAGE=42>>>
Evaluation Policy – The Core of Evaluation Ecosystem

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
The policy should also clearly indicate as to how the issues of gender equality and social 
equity need to be integrated into evaluations with special focus. Climate change is a rapidly 
growing concern all over the world. It is essential that all development interventions are 
also evaluated on nature and extent of their environmental effects.
The policy should emphasize on the time bound evaluations of various programmes/
projects/policies and prescribe criteria for prioritization. For example, a programme/project 
lasting less than three years may need only a terminal evaluation after it completes the 
period. Longer interventions may require both formative and summative evaluations. 
Special situations may call for more frequent evaluations. 
The policy should suggest mechanisms for tracking evaluation use, systematic assessment 
of evaluation quality, and specify roles of various stakeholders including VOPEs. The entire 
policy has to emerge out of a comprehensive consultative process that includes central 
and state government, legislators, civil society, academia and VOPEs.
5. Way Forward
Ideally, the principles set out in NEP should guide both public and private sector 
organizations. However, in a federal set-up like India, the constituent States are generally 
independent and can formulate their own policies. Hopefully, once a national policy is 
adopted, in due course a common pattern would emerge through consultative processes. 
Evaluations conducted based on a set of standard principles, norms and methods would 
perhaps create good examples for others to adopt appropriate policies. 
The success of an evaluation policy depends on its implementation and enforcement, and 
the implementation depends on the existence of an apex institution that oversees the 
implementation of the policy. To be effective, this central institution should ideally be a 
commission headed by the Prime Minister.
A set of post-policy adoption activities must be designed to address the implementation 
and enforcement of the policy, including: (a) researching how the policy should be 
implemented and enforced to be effective; (b) renewing relationships with the relevant 
and influential institutions during the advocacy campaign and developing new relationships 
with the institutions and individuals involved in implementing the policy; (c) enlisting the 
public offices as an ally in the implementation and enforcement effort by increasing public 
awareness; and (d) evaluating the effectiveness of the implementation and enforcement 
effort. Previous experience suggests that these activities are effective tools for the 
government departments, nongovernmental organizations, policy advocates like VOPEs 
to employ to help ensure that enacted policies are implemented and enforced as intended. 
Voluntary organizations of professional evaluators (VOPEs) can work as nodal points 
for extensive outreach, advocacy and sensitization. Their role in knowledge sharing and 
professionalization and creating networks for targeted learning is crucial.
Finally, the policy also should provide spaces for periodic review. For example, the South 
African Policy, originally adopted in 2013 has been amended in 2019 to extend it to state-
owned enterprises and to provide for inclusion of principles of gender equality and social 
equity. Adoption of the policy and its periodic review should be in consultation with various 
stakeholders including, in particular, VOPEs and other civil society organizations.

Abstract
Monitoring, which has the goal of ensuring the implementation of activities vis-à-vis the plan, 
is often considered a fault-finding process. The essence of monitoring, however, is to be 
vigilant about the processes and align the project activities to achieve the planned outputs. 
Community is usually considered as a beneficiary or target of interventions, instead of being 
given the status of stakeholder. Community, in practice, is often either considered a policing 
entity or remains a passive service recipient group. The effort previously done by GRAAM 
through its Arogya Shreni project in Karnataka, and being done presently in Jharkhand 
through its Jan Arogya Shreni action research project, is to provide the community with 
‘stakeholder’ status. Involving the community as part of the solution instead of seeing them 
as the reason for the problem is a paradigm shift in planning and thinking.
The National Health Mission recognises that the community should be an integral part 
of the public health system. Jan Arogya Samiti is one such platform at the grassroots 
level, created through the guidelines of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to enable 
effective community monitoring of Health and Wellness Centres. While expecting the 
community to participate in such structures, it is most important to create an enabling 
environment, build capacity and establish means and ways (process) for their engagement. 
The Jan Arogya Shreni action research project of GRAAM is one such initiative to establish 
processes of community engagement. Evidence from GRAAM’s Arogya Shreni project in 
Karnataka shows how the community participates in a positive way if stakeholdership is 
provided. Initial insights from the Jan Arogya Shreni experiment in Jharkhand reveal that 
the community is interested in participating in planning and monitoring health care delivery. 
This paper elaborates the concept, design and outcomes of community participation in 
monitoring of health services at the grassroots level. The innovation in the whole process 
lies in how the project leverages simple communication technology for unbiased, free and 
efficient monitoring. 
Keywords: Community monitoring, Participation, Health systems, Jan Arogya Samiti, 
Technology. 
1. Community Monitoring – Meaning, Purpose and Spirit
Traditionally, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) has been the domain of experts who 
measure performance against predetermined indicators, using standardised procedures 
and tools (Dillon, n.d.). However, in recent years there has been an emphasis on 
participatory approaches to monitoring such as Community-Based Monitoring (CBM). In 
India, mechanisms of participatory monitoring have been implemented in multiple sectors 
such as health (Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee or VHSNC and Jan 
Arogya Samiti), education (School Development and Monitoring Committee), livelihood 
(social audit under MGNREGA), and WASH (Jal Samitis or Water User Groups). 
The term “Community-Based Monitoring” (CBM) is generally used for the relevant 
participatory mechanisms in the public health domain, though its features make it 
applicable to other development domains. The Global Fund defines CBM as “Mechanisms 
that service users or local communities use to gather, analyse and use information on an

ongoing basis to improve access, quality and the impact of services, and to hold service 
providers and decision makers to account” (Global Fund, 2020). A key principle of CBM 
is that communities decide what to monitor, and act upon the data collected (Global 
Fund, 2020) Garg & Ray Laskar (2010) define CBM as a process that involves “drawing in, 
activating, motivating, capacity building and allowing the community and its representatives 
e.g., community-based organizations (CBOs), people’s movements, voluntary organizations 
and Panchayat representatives, to directly give feedback about the functioning of public 
health services.” 
CBM is thus needed to strengthen community oversight, ownership and expression of 
community voices with respect to service delivery. It can help to collect data that is 
essential for scrutinising public programmes and improving policies and programmes; the 
evidence and observations resulting from CBM can often be quite different from the 
results of monitoring undertaken or controlled by governments (Global Fund, 2020). The 
accountability that can be strengthened through CBM can in turn strengthen the access, 
quality and responsiveness of service delivery. 
Monitoring is often considered a fault-finding process. However, the essence of monitoring 
is to be vigilant about the process and align the project activities to achieve the planned 
outputs. We term community monitoring as supportive supervision. It is to provide 
necessary support to make the program successful by supervising the inputs, process 
and outputs, periodically and responsibly. In its desired or ideal form, CBM is constructive 
in nature; the concept of CBM emphasises the spirit of ‘fact-finding’, ‘learning lessons for 
improvement’ rather than ‘fault finding’ (Garg & Roy Laskar, 2010) and being part of the 
solution. 
In the world of development, community is usually considered as a beneficiary or target 
of interventions, instead of being given the status of stakeholders. Community, in practice, 
is often either considered a policing entity or remains a passive service recipient group. In 
CBM, however, the community is considered not just a service receiver but a stakeholder 
that can take responsibility to improve the health service delivery. CBM does not end with 
the members scrutinising service providers; it also includes acting on the evidence and 
observations gathered. Advocacy based on the evidence and observations gathered is 
thus an essential outcome of community-based monitoring (Global Fund, 2020).
An effective community-based monitoring system thus should lead to nuanced constructive 
feedback that can be a force for positive change, and can also make the community (or 
its representatives) find solutions to perceived problems. 
2. Challenges in Community Monitoring
1. CBM has highly desirable features and objectives. However, as the literature and 
authors’ practical experience with CBM experiments reveal, implementation of 
CBM may be ridden with challenges. These may lead to a gap between the intent 
and reality of CBM. 
2. The foremost challenge is to make service providers appreciate the ability and 
wisdom of the community, consider them as stakeholders and not just beneficiaries, 
and foresee the long-term advantages (rather than initial challenges) of engaging 
with them.

3. The need to build the capacity of the members of the community who would 
be involved in CBM, and to ensure not just the transfer but also the sustained 
retention of the required knowledge and competencies
4. The difficulty of motivating, building and sustaining people’s voluntary participation 
in meetings and various monitoring activities. 
5. Lack of consistent and stable funding (Global Fund, 2020). 
6. The possibility of elite capture or domination by powerful interests (Dillon, n.d.)
7. The processes involved in executing CBM are complex and require contextualising 
in response to local community structures, needs, and diversities. 
8. Attitudinal change is necessary among all stakeholders in order to have more 
synergy. A paradigm shift is required in perceiving their role from ‘questioning’ 
to ‘understanding’. 
9. There is a need for effective coordination and strong partnership among all 
stakeholders. This may be difficult to achieve in social contexts which have divides 
based on caste, religion, ethnicity, class etc.
3.  Mechanisms for Community Monitoring under National Health 
Mission: Communitization of Primary Health Care
The Communitization of health care (i.e., the promotion of community action in health care, 
especially primary health care) has been a longstanding priority under the National Health 
Mission (NHM). Under this priority, structures such as Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition 
Committee (VHSNC), Rogi Kalyan Samiti (RKS) and Planning and Monitoring Committee 
(PMC) were created for enhancing people’s participation in planning, implementing and 
monitoring primary health care (details in Appendix I).
With the advent of the Ayushman Bharat and the conversion of Sub Health Centres and 
Primary Health Centres to Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs), a 
need was felt for creating a Health Facility Committee at the Sub Health Centre-Health 
and Wellness Centre (SHC-HWC) level, equivalent to the Rogi Kalyan Samiti at PHC level. 
The Jan Arogya Samiti (JAS), created at the level of the SHC-HWC, is supposed to serve 
as a platform for community participation in the management and governance of the 
SHC-HWC. One of the functions of the JAS is to “support and facilitate the conduct of 
activities pertaining to social accountability at AB-HWC in coordination with VHSNCs.” 
(NHM, n.d.) Such a function implies that JAS have an important potential role to play in 
the community monitoring of SHC-HWCs. More details on the role and composition of 
JAS can be found in Appendix I.

engagement in public health delivery as a stakeholder. Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) was leveraged to make the initiative scalable, cost-effective and 
interesting to the stakeholders. It facilitated Community Monitoring of rural Primary Health 
Centres (PHCs) in Mysore District, Karnataka. The endeavour was to experiment whether 
the community can really participate in monitoring the health system, which is perceived 
as a more technical subject that the common man cannot understand. The experiment also 
intended to understand whether ‘community initiated’ change through grassroots advocacy 
and dialogue is possible. The Planning and Monitoring Committee (PMC) platform was 
strengthened with necessary capacities related to monitoring as part of the experiment. 
4.2. Project Framework
Arogya Shreni was designed as a 3-year action research project (2011-2014), covering seven 
talukas and 112 rural PHCs of Mysore district. It was intended to build the capacities of 
local communities in monitoring the PHCs. PMC members were the community monitors 
as mandated by NRHM. The selected PMC members participated by responding to a 
questionnaire about the availability and quality of services of their PHCs using Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS) technology. The responses to the questionnaire were used 
to construct facility scores and a ranking of PHCs in the district. With increasing awareness, 
the community members took a step beyond just monitoring. They were involved in 
carrying out advocacy efforts at the grassroots level to bring about changes in their 
PHCs. The project’s field facilitators worked intensively with PMC members, facilitating 
regular meetings among the members, carrying out dialogue with health providers, 
identifying problems and strategizing on addressing them locally, or escalating the matter 
appropriately. These efforts yielded positive changes on the ground as well as in attitudes 
and perspectives.

4.3. Challenges faced in Arogya Shreni
Any new initiative at the field level faces numerous challenges. Arogya Shreni wasn’t an 
exception from those systemic, implementation and community-level challenges. 
1. The experiment brought the gaps in PHC service delivery to the fore, and created 
a fear of inspection and other repercussions among PHC staff. 
2. The community representatives who participated in the CBM developed an 
expectation of change ‘too early’ and also of comprehensive transformation in 
the functioning of PHCs, which is not possible to achieve within the short or 
medium term. 
3. Arogya Shreni required the participants to respond to monthly IVRS-based 
monitoring rounds. The participants needed convincing that responding at such 
frequency was necessary. 
4. The technology-based CBM exercise was implemented through ‘yes-no’ responses 
on IVRS. A limitation of such responses is that they don’t reveal detailed 
information on the service gaps that exist.
5. Certain issues could not be addressed or corrected through the CBM exercise 
which included matters where authority lay beyond the PHC. Deep-seated 
malpractice could also not be addressed. 
6. Considerable time and efforts were needed for validation or back check of the IVRS 
generated responses and for the analysis of the responses obtained through IVRS
4.4. Outcomes of Arogya Shreni
The Arogya Shreni experiment generated a positive community response in terms of 
impressive participation in monitoring and advocacy. This proves that CBM experiments 
can be successful, provided that an enabling environment is available. The following positive 
outcomes were generated by the Arogya Shreni experiment: 
  Improved capacity and awareness: Through consistent capacity building efforts 
of the project, communities could discuss the subject of health with a greater 
understanding of underlying factors. The communities were not only more aware 
of the facilities and schemes, but also of the health system and processes. 
Technology use played a positive role in kindling community interest and also 
in capturing comprehensive information of PHCs. The project demonstrated that 
communities need continuous hand-holding in the form of sustained coordination 
and motivation by organisations working at the grassroots. 
“We have seen a change in the way communities articulate the problems 
of their PHCs. From making ambiguous comments about their PHCs such 
as “this PHC is of no use” or “this is a bad PHC; nothing works here”, the 
same community members now refer to specific issues, rather than making 
any sweeping statements. That is an important indicator of the success of 
the model.” - Arogya Shreni Field Team

  Dialogue and relationship building: The platform provided by the project for 
dialogue helped the community members build and improve relationships with the 
doctors and other PHC staff significantly. This, in turn, led to a better articulation 
of the change desired and the mobilisation of resources required to address the 
same
  Ownership and advocacy: A sense of ownership drove community members to 
use their circle of influence innovatively and consistently follow-up till the issues 
were addressed. With increasing awareness and not being satisfied by merely 
responding to questions, the PMC members showed keen interest in addressing 
issues at their PHCs, including through their own efforts. For instance, land for 
the construction of a PHC was mobilised in a village (where a Primary Health 
Unit with only a rudimentary setup was converted to a PHC). Villagers were also 
seen to be taking out rallies to make people aware of the facilities in their PHC 
and encouraging people to use the PHC instead of going to private hospitals.  
  The use of technology and generation of useful data:  The use of technology 
generated a comprehensive database of responses on the perceived state of 
services in the PHCs that could be analysed and used for planning and monitoring 
in the primary healthcare domain. 
  Improvement in infrastructure and human resource availability: Out of 34 
PHCs selected for intensive advocacy efforts, positive changes in the availability 
of human resources (such as filling of vacancies) and infrastructure (such as 
provision of drinking water facilities) were noted in at least 26 of them as a result 
of community involvement in monitoring. 
5. From Arogya Shreni to Jan Arogya Shreni
That communities have the willingness and the capacity to drive changes was effectively 
demonstrated in the Arogya Shreni experience. One of the lessons of Arogya Shreni 
was that community monitoring can be strengthened through capacity building at the 
grassroots level in partnership with reliable civil society organisations. Arogya Shreni also 
demonstrated the effectiveness of technology as a catalyst for strengthening community 
monitoring. 
As mentioned earlier, with the advent of Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres 
in 2018, Government of India conceived a participatory mechanism known as Jan Arogya 
Samiti at the level of the SHC-HWC and issued guidelines for operationalizing the same. 
A need was felt to pilot test these guidelines in the field to understand the operational 
modalities and the ground realities that shape the functioning of such mechanisms. Having 
had the experience of executing the Arogya Shreni model in Karnataka, GRAAM was 
provided with an opportunity of piloting a CBM framework in 2 districts of Jharkhand, with 
the establishment and strengthening of Jan Arogya Samitis at the core of such framework. 
Supported by USAID - JHPIEGO PROJECT NISHTA, the goal of this ‘Jan Arogya Shreni’ 
project is to demonstrate community participation, ownership and monitoring mechanism 
at AB- HWCs so as to improve health service delivery and health outcomes.

5.1. Objectives and Design
The objectives of the Jan Arogya Shreni project are as follows:
  To facilitate the establishment of Jan Arogya Samiti (JAS) at 35 HWCs through 
a community consultation process.
  To build the capacity of JAS in effectively implementing community monitoring 
and 89social audit 
  To demonstrate community engagement and monitoring through community 
structures such as Jan Arogya Samitis to create a vibrant healthcare system at 
the primary health care level 
  To establish and demonstrate a framework of community accountability and social 
audit of AB-HWCs in line with the JAS guidelines issued by NHM. 
The Jan Arogya Samiti project, like Arogya Shreni, is largely based on, but not limited to, 
the use of the technology-enabled mechanism (collection of IVRS based responses from 
JAS members on the state of health service delivery, human resources and infrastructure at 
the SHC-HWC) for strengthening CBM at the SHC-HWC level. It is essentially a replication 
of Arogya Shreni project done in Karnataka, with certain modifications

5.2. Outcomes of Jan Arogya Shreni
Jan Arogya Shreni aims to achieve the end of effective CBM through active Jan Arogya 
Samitis with pro-active people’s participation. Given the nascent stage of the project, these 
outcomes are yet to be demonstrated. However, the following initial outcomes have been 
noticed:

1. Stipulated JAS meetings are being held in most places: Out of seven HWCs 
visited by the M&E team during a recent field visit, five centres had conducted 
both the meetings required to have been held by that date, and two centres had 
conducted only one meeting.
2. JAS is involved in health visioning and grassroots health planning: For better 
reflection of local needs in the functioning of the AB-HWC, the Jan Arogya Samitis 
have expressed their needs, preferences and health-related priorities through the 
health visioning exercise. As a next step, the participatory health planning exercise 
has also been piloted. Once the planning capacities of the JAS are developed, it 
is expected that they will play an important role in preparing locally grounded 
plans that are infused with the support of the local communities. 
3. JAS have emerged as potential support for the HWC staff: It is expected that the 
constituted Jan Arogya Samitis will play an active role in guiding the management 
of the AB-HWCs and especially in organizing community-led health promotion 
activities. In this way, the HWC would be a valuable support structure to the 
HWC, especially for the Community Health Officers, a new cadre created to lead 
the HWCs. 
5.3. Challenges
Initial efforts to facilitate the establishment of Jan Arogya Samitis and to get community 
representatives to attend the meetings and training programmes have encountered a 
number of challenges, which illustrate some of the possible challenges of CBM stated at 
the early part of this paper: 
1. Some JAS members were not interested to attend the meeting as they have 
seen the non-functionality of the various committees formed in the past. It is 
also difficult to get JAS members together for meetings at times when they are 
busy with agricultural activities such as the harvest season.
2. For conducting training programmes, it is difficult to coordinate the availability 
of all JAS members on a single date
3. Some JAS members including health functionaries consider JAS as an additional 
burden in addition to their existing workload. 
4. In Khunti district, the extremist Pathalgadi movement has affected the regularity 
of VHSNC meetings; similar factors are likely to constrain the Jan Arogya Samiti’s 
meetings and functioning too. 
5. As of now, the awareness of JAS among the larger community is low.
6. School teacher/school health ambassadors who are members of JAS require 
official letters to leave school duties and come for meetings. 
7. Certain HWCs are far away from village areas and habitable land, and some are 
inaccessible. In such a context, there would be logistical difficulties in organising 
meetings and getting JAS members to attend them.

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
8. Some JAS members feel the need for financial remuneration for the time they 
spend on attending meetings.
9. Contextual adaptations have had to be made with respect to National Guidelines: 
the JAS guidelines issued by NHM don’t mention the inclusion of customary or 
traditional authorities such as tribal leaders. It was observed on the field that in 
some places in Jharkhand, the tribal leader known as ‘Munda’ was included in 
JAS under the bracket of ‘peer educator’. Munda is a powerful person in tribal 
contexts, and his inclusion is seen by the field implementation team as critical 
for enhancing the community acceptance of JAS. 
6. Discussion: Learning from the Experience and Way Forward
GRAAM’s experiences with Arogya Shreni and its initial observations from Jan Arogya 
Shreni reveal the following lessons:
1. In any kind of community involvement, people do expect to see some positive 
results. Once this is achieved, it helps build the confidence among the community 
to involve more intensively.
2. Community driven changes are possible with empowerment and consistent 
involvement. The importance of locally grounded civil society organizations to 
play the roles of capacity building, facilitation and constant handholding is very 
evident from the experiments.
3. Advocacy successes show that communities have the knowledge to use a wide 
variety of channels and engage with different stakeholders to bring changes.
4. The model has revealed the usefulness of a nuanced, non-confrontational and 
ownership-based approach to monitoring where the community itself takes 
responsibility to resolve certain issues.
5. Questionnaire-based survey is an important tool to help communities focus on 
issues and follow-up on identifying solutions. It is also a tool that helps them 
engage more qualitatively with other stakeholders
6. Rural communities have been able to successfully use a complex technology 
interface (IVRS + questions requiring numerical inputs). This implies that more 
advanced technology usage can be tested.
7. Acceptance of ranking cards by the health providers such as doctors is a way to 
successfully bring about healthy competition between PHCs, which in turn can 
lead to positive changes in the PHCs.
8. Advocacy successes show that communities have the knowledge to use a wide 
variety of channels and engage with different stakeholders to bring changes
9. The experiments have generated an enhanced understanding and re-affirmation 
of certain public health issues such as a) poor planning by the Govt. (less rational 
spatial distribution of PHCs and allocation of medicines to PHCs) b) lack of 
adequate focus on preventive health c) doctors are expected to be well-versed

with accounts, handling administrative issues, etc in addition to being culturally 
sensitive d) PHC infrastructure is not the sole determinant of quality healthcare 
services.
10. The experiments have generated an understanding of the diversity in behaviour 
and responses of community members, which is important at both institutional 
and individual levels. 
11. The piloting of the model is needed in different regions/districts before a 
state-level rollout is tried. The same model may play out differently in different 
socio-economic contexts, and necessary process adaptations may be required. 
It is important to extensively document the processes followed in community 
engagement, CBM and troubleshooting of problems that arise on the ground so 
that such process documentation can become the basis for more refined and 
robust guidelines for CBM in a range of contexts. 
Appendix I: Participatory Structures formed under NHM
  Rogi Kalyan Samitis (Patient Welfare Committees): These are participatory 
committees supposed to act as groups of trustees to manage the affairs of 
health centres such as the Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres 
and other public hospitals. 
  PHC Planning and Monitoring Committees (PMC): The function of the PMC is 
to monitor the availability of facilities and services at their PHCs, oversee the 
utilization of untied funds and carry out dialogue with the local health functionaries 
on issues affecting the health centre. The PMC comprises elected members of 
the Village Panchayat and VHSNC members. 
  Village Health and Sanitation Committees (VHSNCs): VHSNCs are formed at 
the revenue village level. VHSNCs are required to comprise elected members of 
the Panchayat, health workers, and other community representatives. Their role 
includes community-based planning and monitoring. 
  Jan Arogya Samiti (JAS): The Jan Arogya Samiti (JAS), created at the level of 
the SHC-HWC, is supposed to serve as a platform for community participation 
in the management and governance of the SHC-HWC. One of the functions 
of the JAS is to “support and facilitate the conduct of activities pertaining to 
social accountability at AB-HWC in coordination with VHSNCs.” (NHM, n.d.) The 
suggested functions of the JAS (as per the JAS guidelines) reveal that JASs are 
intended to act as important stakeholder in the primary health care domain, going 
much beyond establishing the answerability of the health centre. JAS are also 
envisaged to lead community-led health promotion activities, mobilise funds from 
various sources such as panchayat and CSR funds, and support Gram Panchayats 
in undertaking health planning (NHM, n.d.).

Health Officer (CHO) of the HWC is supposed to be the Member-Secretary. 
Sarpanches of the other GPs of AB-HWC area, President of VHSNCs, ASHAs and 
All Multi-Purpose Health Workers (Male and Female) of AB-HWC are supposed to 
be ex-officio members of JAS. Other JAS members are SHG representatives, peer 
educators, school health ambassadors and special invitees such as TB champion, 
youth representatives and a sterilised male (NHM, n.d.). The total number of 
members in a JAS is expected to range from 15-19.

1. Reframing the Problem
Conversations with public administrators about evaluation often begin with a distinct 
sense of apathy, anxiety, or scepticism. These reactions persist even when the need for 
integrating evaluation is increasingly emphasised as a critical element of any government 
program. Yet, while there now appears to be greater formal recognition of the benefits 
of evaluation and even a greater commitment of resources towards carrying them out, 
there continues to be little genuine appetite within public systems for evaluation. All too 
often, evaluation continues to be at best an after-thought, a response to requirements by 
funding organisations, or a time-bound strategic exercise to demonstrate success. 
In contrast, innumerable informal conversations with bureaucrats and field functionaries 
across government programs reveal, time and again, that practitioners are able to articulate 
deeply nuanced, reflective, constructive, and often causal and systemic explanations for the 
successes and failures they have experienced in the course of their work. These insights are 
shared with a great deal of enthusiasm and convey the extensive learning that happens on 
the field. Yet, while practitioners are learning, and are enthusiastic about critically assessing 
and reflecting upon their roles, programs and systems in more informal exchanges, such 
knowledge and insight largely remains personal and tacit rather than shared, acknowledged 
and applied. This is true even when diverse individuals across organisations express similar 
views and analyses, indicating that these are not just the subjective observations and 
opinions of a few. There seems to be little expectation, however, that their experiences 
and insights might be taken up as part of wider organisational learning, let alone have 
the scope for catalysing actual organisational or systemic change.
These paradoxes and tensions are not peripheral to the larger institutional challenge of 
building evaluation capacities and ensuring better public programs and systems. Indeed, 
understanding and addressing them may be the key to ensuring that present and future 
investments in research, monitoring and evaluation do not suffer what unfortunately seems 
to be a common fate across many countries and international development bureaucracies. 
Certainly, it seems the Indian experience is not exceptional. For instance, a recent analytical 
review (Yanguas 2021) of the relationship between knowledge and organisational change 
in international development agencies, found that even after spending significant time and 
resources building large M&E departments and deploying new knowledge management 
tools and systems, development professionals still really only learned personally, and 
knowledge from evaluation did not easily translate into organisational learning and change. 
‘At the end of the day, individual practitioners tend to learn from personal experience 
and rely on personal contact networks,’ ‘tacit learning prevails, while explicit knowledge 
management systems flounder,’ and ‘external agendas appear more compelling than 
internal research and evaluation’ (Ibid: 21). What’s more, it seems that this rather sharp 
finding itself doesn’t seem to really surprise either practitioners or evaluators.
As union and state governments across India consider mobilising and committing greater 
resources and expertise towards strengthening development monitoring and evaluation 
capacities, what are we to make of such disappointing and disheartening experiences? 
If public programs and systems aren’t actually going to learn from evaluations, are they 
worth it? Can we learn from what we do know to approach the challenge differently?

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
In this essay, we argue that we can and we must, but that it will require us to be both more 
realistic and more idealistic. More realistic because we must fully understand and respond 
practically to the contexts, constraints and experiences that determine why politicians, civil 
servants, field administrators and frontline workers have come to distrust or disengage 
from current practices of program evaluation. And we must be more idealistic: first and 
foremost, by acknowledging the existing desire and capacity that public functionaries 
have for learning, which is amply demonstrated by their high levels of personal learning 
and tacit knowledge. But we would like to suggest that we can build on this further to 
direct greater attention to the vital role that organisational norms and values play in 
creating and sustaining capacities for evaluative thinking and learning in public systems. 
For it is on the strength of these more foundational capacities that public programs and 
organisations might then be able to proactively determine their own needs for evaluation 
and other forms of learning, competently engage with monitoring, evaluation and other 
learning processes, and constructively absorb and integrate these learnings into systemic 
practice. This is what it would mean to genuinely value evaluation. 
This might seem like a tall order especially given the multiple constraints and complexities 
that characterise public systems and programs, but this is precisely why one can no longer 
avoid a deeper engagement with the foundational dimensions of the problem and continue 
to primarily think about building evaluation capacities as a matter of securing technical 
and material resources. We must also be willing to ask another set of questions. What are 
the values and norms that underpin current approaches to evaluation within government 
programmes? And how do these deeply embedded values and norms impede or enable 
the adoption of appropriate forms of  evaluation  for different public sector initiatives and 
shape a larger ecosystem of learning? 
2. Why don’t we Value Evaluation more?
Over time, engagement with and observation of evaluation experiences across government 
programs yields a common set of concerns, both from public administrators and evaluators. 
If there is to be change, we will have to take these criticisms and constraints seriously, 
and consider how both evaluators and government programs might be able to respond, 
adapt and evolve if systemic learning and improved outcomes are indeed the intended 
goals. There are a number of ‘supply side’ and ‘demand side’ factors that seem to have 
brought us here. 
First, we have often heard in conversations with bureaucrats that evaluation is only an 
academic exercise and therefore is less than useful for practice. There are good reasons 
for why this perception is so common. Partly, this has to do with a global academic 
phenomenon in which researchers based in the global north locate their research 
in developing countries because of cost as well as ease of access to respondents. 
The desired outcome for researchers is usually academic in nature, such as a journal 
publication. While researchers and government officials might try to meet the goals of 
both academic knowledge production and practical, programmatic insights, the outputs 
are often geared towards the former because the process is primarily led by academic 
researchers. Government officials we’ve spoken to find the process to be often one-sided 
and at odds with the goals they are trying to meet.

While this tension and misalignment is valid and can be both frustrating and extractive 
from the point of view of practitioners on the ground, the dismissal of evaluation as an 
academic exercise is a more serious problem because it perpetuates an artificial distinction 
between theory and practice. But while policymakers and program implementors might 
feel that theory has no tangible value, this is a concession on their part and diminishes 
the state’s own analytical capacity to make better use of valuable insights from scholarly 
research even when such knowledge could significantly improve the quality of public policy 
and programs. Of course, there is much that academics can do to dramatically increase 
the public accessibility of their research and writing, but in the end the greater costs of 
government systems not learning from existing academic knowledge are borne by the 
public. Research and evaluation processes done well builds bridges by synthesising relevant 
and rigorous existing knowledge for systemic learning, but this will not serve the purpose 
if evaluation itself is consigned to be a largely irrelevant academic exercise. 
If academic evaluators are associated with producing esoteric knowledge, there are other 
concerns raised with evaluators who come in as ‘independent’ consultants on behalf of 
a funder, or on behalf of higher-tier governments evaluating the work of other units. Not 
only does this run the risk of the process being viewed more as an examination than an 
evaluation (more on this point below) but external consultant-evaluators often concern 
themselves primarily with the narrow scope of evaluation itself. An evaluation is conducted 
and a report on the results is produced. They do not, or are unable to, convert the findings 
into learning opportunities for governments over the long term. What happens once an 
evaluation report is submitted? How are results translated into lessons across different 
levels of employees in the government system? Are relationships of trust built between 
evaluators and implementors? Objectivity and external review are important, but how can 
these be balanced with structured co-production of the evaluation for enhanced learning?
A third, related challenge centres on the range of tools the evaluation community is able to 
provide the public sector. This has more to do with the dominant trends in the evaluation 
community rather than choices made by individual evaluators. The now well-established 
preference for causal studies that focus on specific ‘treatments’ has also unfortunately 
led to evaluations turning into tests of success and failure . While this might help for 
furthering knowledge about specific research questions and trade-offs, a success-failure 
binary is less well-suited to the range of actors, activities, processes and relationships that 
occur and emerge in practice. Binaries can create anxiety about the results of evaluation, 
and also under-estimate the complexity of practice. Public sector programmes are often 
better served by complex and adaptive evaluation techniques (Sridharan and Nakaima 
2020). However, even though the case for such approaches have been powerfully made, 
the support for complex and adaptive evaluations and the capacity among evaluators for 
conducting them remains limited.
Fourth, within government programs and systems, there is the problematic tendency 
for processes of evaluation to be associated with performance measurement, a matter 
of considerable importance and anxiety. There is a constant concern that evaluations 
may become proxies for performance measurement particularly when multiple tiers of 
government are involved and the results of an evaluation may be linked to subsequent
<<<PAGE=61>>>

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
fiscal transfers or other forms of continued support for programmes at lower tiers of 
government. But the problem of performance and evaluation is perhaps even more acute 
in a routine sense. Evaluation as learning is more likely to occur in environments that make 
space for reflection and discussions about the reasons behind failures, as much as about 
success. Too often, failure invites penalty and creates incentives for gaming behaviour and 
measure-fixation, or the foregoing of evaluations altogether.
Finally, while government programs are reluctant to identify, discuss and learn from failures, 
they are not particularly good at learning from success either. A large part of this problem 
can be related to the value placed on novelty. Each government programme claims to be the 
first to employ a certain strategy for service delivery or meeting developmental objectives. 
Novelty is important because governments need to signal distinctive contributions and 
progress to voters, or state governments need to signal innovation to the centre, or 
individual bureaucrats need to signal achievement to advance in their careers. But this 
comes at the cost of creating institutional memory, and of seeing the linkages between 
the programmes we have today and the rich history of programmes that have often 
attempted exactly the same processes earlier. A system characterised by short tenures, 
frequent transfers of bureaucrats and over-burdened field functionaries inundated with 
orders, circulars and multiple, contradictory demands further widens the gap in creating a 
system that can hold, transfer, and learn from the knowledge accumulated through decades 
of practice. Over time, public servants have had to live with this structure— re-inventing 
the wheel each time—creating minimal scope for sharing credit and responsibility across 
different tiers and generations of government. 
Moreover, the political and administrative problem of attribution (both in terms of credit 
and discredit for schemes and programs) not only plagues learning within states but also 
among states and between union and state governments. New portals and platforms for 
experience sharing and knowledge exchange therefore seem to quickly lose profile and 
dynamism. It seems that everybody wants to become a best practice or a model, but 
no one is particularly inclined to learn from them! Indeed, this is an issue at the heart of 
building evaluative capacities for cooperative federalism.
3.  Principles and Practice: Shifting Norms and Values Towards 
Evaluative Thinking and Learning
Confronted with this extensive (and even then, only partial) list of challenges and constraints 
that impede evaluation and learning in government, it is tempting to take recourse to the 
common Indian refrain: we are like this only! And there is of course a grain of truth here. 
But such acknowledgement need not lead to resignation or the search for work-arounds 
that lead us back to the original problem. 
First, in our experience, understanding the contexts and priorities under which governments 
work can actually help position evaluation efforts much more constructively within 
larger programmatic learning environments. For example, claiming political credit and 
gaining political support for major development programs is an important priority for 
political and bureaucratic leadership; in it essential to the work of keeping programs

going under challenging and uncertain conditions. Maintaining a certain perception 
and aura of programmatic success, especially at certain moments, is therefore part of 
programme management, even when there may be relatively limited concrete evidence 
on outcomes. Sometimes this is necessary to even enable the space for course correction 
that administrators know is needed. This does not have to impede deeper programmatic 
learning as long as practitioners and evaluators alike can value and create space for 
internal, low profile, routine and rigorous systemic learning as part of programme evaluation 
processes, which also acknowledge the ways in which data and documentation will often 
be deployed in different ways to secure the program. Similarly, while reformers often try to 
reinforce the importance of training and learning by linking it more tightly with individual 
performance measurement and review, this often leads to gaming rather than actual 
engagement. Again, certain contextual and collective learning and evaluation processes 
might gain more from being kept out of such direct entanglement with the systemic and 
programmatic imperative for performance measurement.
Second, efforts towards building individual, organisational and systemic capacities for 
evaluative thinking and learning should be undertaken ahead of and alongside efforts to 
build monitoring and evaluation capacity itself. This should be more of a pre-condition 
rather than an assumption or an afterthought and must be a sustained process at all 
levels of the system.
And third, whenever an opportunity arises it is worth the effort (and the discomfort) to 
consciously and sensitively bring to the surface the presence and role of deeply embedded 
organisational norms and values in creating, nurturing and disabling cultures of evaluative 
thinking and learning. It is only when these are brought up and discussed that individuals 
and organisations begin to articulate the shared values that they wish to uphold and 
recognise that their organisational norms can indeed be adapted and changed in a way 
that enables them to serve their core public purpose (Cialdini and Goldstein 2004). 
4. Learning about Learning by doing in Meghalaya
Much of our own recent experimentation and learning on how we might do things 
different is emerging from the ongoing efforts of the Government of Meghalaya’s State 
Capability Enhancement Project (SCEP). Over a period of only a few years, the SCEP has 
initiated pioneering work to transform public systems, public service delivery, community 
institutions and social accountability in Meghalaya. During this time, the SCEP’s approach 
to adaptive leadership and systemic, iterative and collaborative problem solving has 
demonstrated significant progress in strengthening MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National 
Rural Employment Guarantee Act), public health (especially the response to the Covid-19 
pandemic, immunisation services, and prevention of maternal deaths) and has prioritised 
new approaches to addressing the challenges of climate change and Natural Resource 
Management (NRM) in the state (Kumar et al. 2021). 
One of the critical elements of this initiative is the attempt to open up spaces for 
collective and individual learning and reflection within public administration and program 
implementation at all levels. This includes sites of knowledge exchange and learning such 
as the Meghalaya State Capability Forum hosted by the chief minister and attended
<<<PAGE=63>>>
Valuing Evaluation: Building Capacities for Evaluative Thinking and Learning in Indian States

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
by ministers and senior bureaucrats and regular weekly meetings of district and field 
functionaries to review and analyse progress. In each case, in different ways the effort is 
to break down the distinction between theory and practice or academic knowledge and 
programmatic insight by creating room for deeply informed, open, analytical and reflective 
discussion within and across different levels in the system: it is in this sense that these 
are efforts build the capacities of thinking evaluative in the everyday course of political 
and administrative work.
As part of the process of systemic change, the Government of Meghalaya has also created a 
number of new organisations and invested in galvanising and re-designing older institutions 
to rediscover and pursue their core purpose. Here, the effort is focused on building learning 
and evaluative thinking into organisational design. The Centre of Excellence (CoE) for 
Sustainable Natural Resources Management and Livelihoods is one such newly formed 
organisation which from its inception is trying to instil purposeful learning and evaluation 
at the core of the organisation’s mission. Another vital initiative is the renewed vision 
for the Meghalaya Administrative Training Institute (MATI) as a centre of administrative 
learning and thinking through the organisational design and capacities that would enable 
this evolution. 
Finally, there is a conscious effort to bring to the surface the often-silent questions 
of norms and values in public administration as part of processes of training and skill 
building. Civil service training programs typically focus on substantive policy issues, public 
administration theory, or on imparting specific skillsets. Rarely is the opportunity used 
to initiate conversations about the norms and values that inform decision-making within 
government. For example, we worked with the Meghalaya Administrative Training Institute 
(MATI) in 2021 to deliver a course titled Values for the 21st Century Civil Servant. Through 
lectures, simulations, small group discussions, and in-class surveys, we explored the norms 
and values that underpin a diverse set of issues such as professional identity, diversity and 
inclusion, trust and collaboration in the public sector, the theory versus practice binary, 
and performance. 
One exercise was particularly illuminating: we asked trainees to respond to an in-class 
survey, the results of which were shared and discussed. Trainees were surprised to discover 
that the batch, who had been together in training for nearly six months, was divided 
on whether teamwork was considered important in the bureaucracy. They were also 
surprised and troubled by the divided views on whether colleagues would voluntarily 
share information and knowledge without being instructed to do so by a senior and on 
what they thought was the appropriate degree of public disclosure. This led to a discussion 
about both trust within the system and trusting the citizen and the public, as well as the 
common perception that the system prioritised individual glory and novelty rather than 
collective initiative. As the class prepared to take up their first field postings in blocks and 
districts across the state, each trainee also reflected on how they might personally want to 
contribute to changing such norms in the course of service and what that might take or 
look like. These are undoubtedly very small steps and slow processes of change, but they 
do point to the possibilities for building evaluative thinking and learning within government 
without being naïve and yet not embarrassed to begin with norms and values!

Developing a Culture of Evidence Use: Experiences from Uttar Pradesh

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
1. Introduction 
The state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) provides an important context to understand and develop 
a theory of change of data use capacity building over time. In this paper we describe a 
culture of use of data for decision making in the health department of GoUP supported by 
the UP Technical Support Unit (UPTSU) established under the Memorandum of Cooperation 
between Government of UP (GoUP) and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and provides 
technical assistance to the department to improve access and quality of care to women 
and newborns at health facilities and outreach using a life cycle approach. The key areas of 
focus also include strengthening of the core foundations of Health System in UP, especially 
in the areas of Human Resources for Health, Medical Supply Chain, and use of data for 
improve decision-making. 
UP has a population that has been estimated to be more than 230 million by 2021 (Ministry 
of Health and Family Welfare, 2019), with about one-sixth of the India’s population and 
having multiple administrative layers that include 18 administrative divisions, 75 districts, 
820 sub-district boundaries, and more than 107,000 rural villages (Office of the Registrar 
General and Census Commissioner, 2011). 
UP provides a unique opportunity to explore the role of evidence use in helping improve 
health systems across the state. 
The overall objective of establishment of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) unit under 
UPTSU is to provide techno-managerial support to health department of the Government 
of UP (GoUP) to enhance the use of data for decision making. The specific objective can 
be listed as follows
  Strengthen the availability and quality of government data system
  Increase the use of data for problem solving by gap analysis and prioritization
  Strengthen system capacity for concurrent monitoring, ensuring data quality, and 
its use for effective decision-making
Table 1 describes some of the gaps that the UPTSU attempted to address as a part of 
data system strengthening efforts.

Data Use
  No uniform framework for evidence-based review meetings 
  Monthly review mostly focused on financial progress

2. The Role for Evaluations
Building capacities for evidence use is rarely a mechanical process. While technical and 
managerial inputs matter for capacity building, there also is a recognition in the literature 
and practice that sustaining a “culture” of evidence use often needs more than technical 
and managerial support. 
In our experience, the pathways by which capacity building initiatives work are often 
under-theorized. The evaluation itself has a role in helping refine the theory of change over 
time. This paper is structured as a dialogue between the programming and the evaluation 
teams. We start with an initial theory of change and raise a few evaluative questions that 
can help refine the planned program for capacity building over time. 
In this paper, we argue that even with deep understanding of the technical and managerial 
processes involved in improving the use of evidence in a state such as UP, evaluation 
has a role in refining the theory of change for capacity building for evidence use in 
UP. Note that the pathways by which investments in data and cultures of evidence use 
more broadly impact health outcomes are in all likelihoods long and convoluted. When 
faced with complexity, as described by Pawson et al, (2004) evaluation itself needs to 
provide a way forward: evaluations provide “a process of thinking through the tortuous 
pathways along which a successful programme has to travel. It concludes with reflections 
and considerations on how to navigate some significant highways and byways”.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly share our understanding of a 
culture of evidence. Section 3 briefly introduces an initial program logic that the UP-TSU 
is using to implement a program of work. In section 4 we explore how an evaluation of 
the capacity building effort of the UP-TSU can help interrogate the initial program logic 
and help refine the theory of change over time. 
3. Capacity Building for Evidence Use as a Dynamic Process
It’s important to conceptualize capacity building for evidence/data use as a dynamic 
process that goes beyond a series of activities, events, or investments. Capacity building 
will require great attention to the context in which these activities, events, and structures 
are introduced. It requires paying attention to relationships between multiple actors, 
including key leaders and champions. It also means that building a culture of evidence 
use takes time and depending on contexts, different settings will have differential timelines 
of progress in building a culture of evidence use.

A culture of evidence goes beyond applying high-quality research, analysis, and evaluations 
to make program decisions. In the field of education, for example, Spurlock and Johnston 
(2012) argue that a “culture of evidence” differs from a “culture of justification” on multiple 
dimensions including (See Table 2): 
1. Intentionality 
2. Perspective 
3. Critical linkages 
4. Initiatives and directions 
5. Planning processes 
Using the framework offered by Spurlock and Johnston (2012), Table 2 describes how a 
culture of justification can differ from a culture of evidence. 
Table 2: Differences between Cultures of Evidence and Justification 
(Adapted from Spurlock and Johnston, 2012)
Culture of Justification Culture of Evidence
Intentionality
“People can describe what they are 
doing (i.e., operational or procedural 
specificity)”
“People know that they are doing the 
right things and can describe why 
they are doing them and what they are 
accomplishing.”
Perspective 
Critical
After the fact:
“Data are used retroactively as 
justification for pre-determined 
positions or previous decisions.”
“Data are collected and regularly used 
to inform processes. Data help close 
the loop on improvement processes” 
and outcomes
Critical links 
Initiatives
Cloudy:
“Assessment is conducted from a 
defensive posture, especially related to 
questions of budgetary and operational 
efficiency.
Transparent:
“Outsiders can see and understand 
contributions to. Information on 
progress and performance is shared 
with all stakeholders
Initiatives and 
directions
“Administration initiates assessment 
and it is done only when asked for or 
required”
“All stakeholders own assessment. 
Success is operationalized, concretely 
described, and evaluated on the basis 
of evidence”.
Planning 
processes
“Sporadic and limited to immediate 
question or application: Data are linked 
retroactively to strategic context, goals, 
and expectations, but the process is not 
planning-oriented.”
“Ongoing, strategic, and clearly linked 
to past and future: Triangulation of 
findings through multiple/established 
assessments. Data are incorporated 
into continuous strategic thinking.”
We believe that understanding a culture of evidence use needs to go well beyond data 
availability or quality. It needs to pay attention to the “choice making capacity” (Pawson,
<<<PAGE=69>>>
Developing a Culture of Evidence Use: Experiences from Uttar Pradesh
55
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
2008) of key practitioners and policymakers. As Table 2 highlights, the focus in a culture 
of evidence is ‘continuous strategic thinking’ and ownership of performance. This implies 
that a focus on the culture of evidence needs to pay attention to the “resources and 
reasoning” (Pawson, 2008) of key decision-makers as they make strategic decisions. The 
literature on the culture of evidence use (Lorenc et al, 2012) further reinforces the need to 
consider multiple factors in understanding evidence-practice (see Figure 1). Several factors 
including organization resources, routines and procedural knowledge, cultural norms all 
matter in influencing evidence-based practice.

4.  Proposed Program Logic for Building a Culture of 
Evidence  Use
The program logic for the UP-TSU program of work in building a culture of evidence use 
that can lead to improved health outcomes is described in Figure 2. While Figure 2 provides 
some initial idea of the connections between inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes, like 
all ‘initial’ theories of change, there are several implicit assumptions. In the next section, 
we argue that it’s an important function of the evaluation to help interrogate the program 
logic in greater detail, identify ways in which this initial program logic is incomplete, and 
also, consistent with a dynamic process view of capacity building, explore what additional 
inputs could help create a culture of sustainable evidence use in UP. 
Figure 2 provides a useful narrative for the proposed work but is also a significant 
simplification of the change process. Some high-level questions that emerge in response: 
Will improvements in availability, quality, and enhanced review suffice to build a culture of 
evidence use? What are some barriers and bottlenecks that still need to be addressed?

Table 3: Summary of Work Streams Proposed by UPTSU for Enhancing Data Use
Despite the fact the positive change has been noted across all the key thematic areas of government 
data system strengthening, yet there has been a persistent gap in achieving the universal use of data 
for decision making due to persisting differentials across the geography (high-priority districts2) and 
different levels (types of facilities). These gaps can be classified into gaps in data availability, data 
quality, data use and challenge in sustainability of the innovations and approaches implemented by 
GoUP. 
Drawing upon the learnings from its’ previous phases of the work, the next phase of the data system 
would primarily dependent on leveraging government resources to drive the works around data-
based decision-making. Post-transitioning the UP-HMIS system to the government, TSUs support 
will primarily be on providing technical support to the state, district and divisional level M&E staff 
on ensuring data quality and data use through enhanced capacity-building efforts. Recognizing the 
fact that the new data systems like IHIP (new HMIS), ANMOL, data digitization at source and other 
FLW level unitized data systems are paving its’s path in the data eco-system in the state, the role 
of UP-TSU will largely be on quality assurance and helping the state to build its’ capacity on the 
data analysis and use. However, establishing the data-based review system at the district-hospital 
level will be one of the key interventions that UPTSU will be focusing upon as such mechanisms are 
completely absent at the moment. 
Some of the other focused areas of work under the data system would be community and facility-
based synchronized evidence generation by leveraging the resources and expertise of the other 
government and specialized partners in the eco-system, establishing a routine program monitoring 
framework encompassing the high-level analysis of routine HMIS/UPHMIS/IHIP/RCH data and 
evidence synthesis through the secondary data sources for TSU’s priority program, assisting GoUP in 
building its capacity to engage specialist partners to design and conduct population-based surveys 
for tracking the directionality of change in key outcomes of interest, in sync with and not duplicating, 
the national initiatives such as National Family Health Survey (NFHS), and conducting scientific 
implementation research to test the feasibility and effectiveness of various pilot interventions 
proposed under the phase-3 intervention. Efforts will be made to ensure that the implementation 
research does not become a standalone activity in itself rather act as a responsive mechanism of 
addressing key gaps by offering system-level solutions in an almost real-time basis. Usually, most of 
the implementation research would be for 1.5 to 2 years, and hence, it will have an opportunity to 
feed into system-level solutioning within the Phase-3 intervention timeline. A systematic analysis of 
the understanding of heterogeneity and disparities would enable to identify and test the feasibility 
and effectiveness of innovative models in UP. 
All the interventions planned in the next phase of work would keep the transition and sustainability 
perspective from the beginning itself. Accordingly, fostering the skill of data analysis at the state (NHM, 
directorate) and divisional levels has been proposed so that appropriate and specific solutioning to 
the district-level problems could be provided. At present, district-level officials use the data for 
decision-making through the use of dashboards, however, these skill has to spill over to the sub-
district level for greater sustainability. We can’t ignore the role of local government institutions and 
other academic partners like Kings George Medical University, Lucknow University etc. on routine 
analysis and research. We plan to further collaborate to enhance capabilities in data analysis and 
research and use them as an important lever in implementing any research going forward. 
Some of the key achievements to date are described in Table 4; 
2 25 districts of the state have been categorized as high-priority districts based on the poor health outcomes like 
neonatal and infant mortality rates, total fertility rate, modern contraceptive prevalence rate, safe delivery and full 
immunization levels as per the Annual Health Survey 2012-13.

5. The Role for Evaluation in Refining the Theory of Change
Figure 2 also suggests that the drivers of improved health outcomes are data availability, 
quality, improved capacities, and enhanced reviews. While it might be a truism that 
enhanced data availability, quality, and data-driven review of health systems can lead to 
better health outcomes, this is by no means certain. An evaluation needs to demonstrate 
or provide evidence for the causal linkages described in Figure 2.
Some important evaluative questions that emerge include (see Figure 3):
  In what specific ways did improve availability or quality of data lead to better 
decision making? What are some concrete examples of ‘better’ decisions?
  Is there evidence or early signals that improved availability and quality of data 
also led to improved health outcomes? How can the contribution of improved 
data on better outcomes be demonstrated? (Note that both the attribution and 
contribution problem implied by this causal chain is not easy to demonstrate 
because typically in a large complex system, a several factors drive health 
outcomes). 
  Further, given the heterogeneities in district-level systems, are there some districts 
in which there is tangible evidence that high-quality review and planning processes 
aided by improved data availability and quality led to substantially improved 
outcomes?
  What role do organizational culture and local leadership play in driving effective 
data-based reviews? What kind of individual capacities need to be built for 
effective analytics and evidence synthesis at various levels? 
  Were there large amounts of variations in the quality of data-based reviews across 
the districts? 
  We also have an opportunity to learn about the types of support that are needed 
from the state to build capacity of such M&E hubs over time. Are there plans in 
place to sustain the dynamic process by which the divisional M&E hubs provide 
supports to improve the capacity of GoUP after the TSUs are no longer supporting 
the state government? 
  In what ways can the evidence culture be sustained by the State over time? How 
can a pipeline of HR competent in analytics, evidence synthesis, visualizations, 
etc., be set up in UP?

Note that these questions are only illustrative to highlight those evaluations themselves 
have a role to refine the theory of change, enhance the implementation of capacity building 
programs and also plan for sustainability. 
Addressing such questions would require a movement away from a mechanical, summative 
view of evaluation that simply asks, Did the program of work build capacities? Instead, 
the focus needs to be developmental (Patton, 2010) in which the evaluation team working 
collaboratively with the program team needs to help enhance the programing and refine 
the theory of change. Such a developmental focus is especially needed for planning for 
sustainability (Sridharan and Nakaima, 2019). For example, it’s important that multiple 
views of sustainability are adopted as we explore how the M&E hubs can help sustain the 
dynamic capacity building process. This implies thinking of sustainability as mainstreaming, 
exploring what needs to be done to ensure that the capacity building supports have 
been institutionalized within the state and can be sustained over time. It also implies 
incorporating of view of sustainable impacts to explore if the interventions that form part 
of the capacity building package of work continue to have impacts after the UPTSU ceases.

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
Abstract
The number and intensity of natural and man-made disasters is increasing across the 
world at an unprecedented pace, putting extreme pressure on governments and 
humanitarian actors to respond rapidly and with accountability. In India, the national and 
state governments have used their massive social safety net programmes as a first line of 
response to crises such as COVID-19 and cyclones. However, the Monitoring and Evaluation 
(M&E) systems of these government programmes require strengthening in order to be fully 
effective in times of crisis, including the ability to assess needs as a result of a crisis and 
provide a framework of accountability for the response. This paper presents a framework 
for strengthening government M&E systems during crises. It argues for four key strategies 
that can help government M&E systems to be responsive during crises.
a. Prepare: Strengthening M&E systems, pre-crisis
i.  Crisis situations demand extraordinary measures. To make the M&E systems 
effective and responsive during crises requires the strong M&E systems during 
pre-crisis situation i.e., during normal times.
b. Balance: Demand data is just as important as supply data
i.  Existing government M&E systems are largely supply-driven, yet in order to 
capture the demand created from a crisis, they need to be adapted and 
strengthened through use of regular systematic data collection.
c. Prioritize: Monitoring is vital during crises
i.  Crisis situations demand tracking the beneficiary needs and the service delivery. 
Modern remote monitoring tools and techniques needs to be strengthened 
within government systems. Strengthened monitoring systems can provide a 
solid baseline of updated information against which the impact of a crisis can 
be measured and can provide information on numbers and location of people 
affected by a crisis.
d. Learn: Evaluations to assess effectiveness of crises response
i.  Using monitoring data, evaluations can be conducted in the post-crisis period 
to examine the adequacy and effectiveness of the response. Planned or 
ongoing evaluations during crisis will also require mitigation strategies in place 
by the government institutions.
Disasters and its impact on Exacerbating Vulnerabilities
In the last five decades, the world has experienced more than 11,000 disasters3 which have 
resulted in an economic loss of USD 3.6 trillion and more than 2 million reported deaths 
(WMO, 2019). The number of disasters has increased over time, especially flood-related 
disasters. In India, extreme weather conditions have continued to threaten sustainable 
development. The estimated Average Annual Loss (AAL) for India due to tropical cyclones,

floods, and droughts was USD 87 billion (WMO, 2020).Besides, in 2020 and 2021, due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the country experienced an unprecedented health crisis triggering 
national and state lockdowns. This led to a sharp economic decline during 2020-21, and 
spike in unemployment, with an eventual recovery towards the end of year (PIB, 2021).
Disasters often have a disproportionately severe impact on the poorest households. Global 
studies have found that socio-economically deprived populations are more vulnerable 
directly and indirectly as they live in remote and marginalized locations in rural areas and 
cities with poor infrastructure. It becomes difficult for the government and humanitarian 
actors to respond to their needs due to lack of real-time information. 
The negative impact of disasters on income and consumption levels for the poorest is 
disproportionately strong (Rentschler, 2013). As a result, disasters are also amongst the 
main drivers of hunger and malnutrition in the world. Their impact results in loss of lives 
and livelihoods, destruction of homes, damage to productive assets and infrastructure, 
and reduced availability of food and water. The strategies affected people adopt to cope 
with disasters (i.e., reducing number of meals, selling livestock, debts, taking children out 
of school) has long-lasting effects, trapping them in cycles of hunger and poverty (WFP, 
n.d.). The COVID-19 pandemic and economic disruption shave further exacerbated pre-
existing food insecurity, with 118 million more people facing hunger globally in 2020 than 
in 2019 (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, & WHO, 2021).
2.  India’s Social Safety Nets During Normal Times And Crises 
Situations
About one-fourth of the country’s 1.3 billion population fall below the multidimensional 
poverty benchmarks (NITI, 2021). Poor nutrition, access to cooking fuel, adequate sanitation, 
and housing are some of the major contributors to this trend. Furthermore, some of the 
poorest regions/districts in the country are the most vulnerable to disasters, such as the 
Himalayan regions, alluvial plains, and coastal areas (NIDM, 2014).India implements one of 
the largest social safety programmes in the world to improve the standard of living of its 
population and insulate it from socio-economic vulnerabilities during normal times as well 
as during disasters. Government Central Sector (CS) and Centrally Sponsored Schemes 
(CSS) are the primary mode of funding the various development initiatives at the cost of 
INR 16.10 lakh crores or $US 215.3 4 billion (2021-22), entailing multi-sectoral programmes 
on food security, sustainable livelihoods, drinking water and sanitation, nutrition, public 
health, agriculture, etc. (GoI, 2022).
3. Case of the National Food Safety Net During Crises
Provision of essential food supplies form an integral part of India’s development priorities 
during normal and disaster situations. The erstwhile Public Distribution System (PDS), with 
its origin during the Second World War and Bengal Famine of 1943, is a notable example 
which was conceptualized as a measure for food assistance during disasters, stabilizing

food prices, and increasing agricultural productivity (Saini & Kozicka, 2014) (PEO, 2005).
Today, the National Food Security Act (NFSA), subsuming TPDS,MDM and ICDS makes 
quality food provision in adequate quantities a legal mandate for the government.
TPDS has been extensively used and instrumental in providing food assistance and relief 
during cyclone Fani in Odisha in 2019, floods in Kerala 2018, Bihar 2016 and 2017, Tamil 
Nadu 2016, Jammu and Kashmir floods in 2014, etc (DFPD, n.d.). The National Disaster 
Management Plan 2019 and its state counterparts have articulated the role of TPDS in 
supplying essential food commodities as a part of crisis response activities (NDMA, 2019). 
Most notably, the TPDS was used to deliver subsidized food grains to more than 800 
million beneficiaries, poor families, and migrant workers amidst the COVID-19 crisis and 
containment measures in 2020-2021. Additional food grains, over and above the entitled 
quantities, were distributed free-of-cost to prevent severe food insecurity (GoI, 2021).
4.  Architecture of Monitoring and Evaluation Systems for Social 
Safety Nets in India
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems are integral to the effective functioning 
of social safety nets before, during, and post disasters. In normal times, they provide 
empirical evidence for planners and decision-makers on existing vulnerabilities, needs of 
the community, coverage and quality of the services delivered, outcomes achieved, and 
identification of challenges with possible course-correction options (Bene, Frankenberger, 
& Nelson). During crises situations, they inform emergency response in identifying the 
number and location of people who are most affected and track the speed and quality 
of post-disaster recovery. Finally, systematic evaluations help improve the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the social safety nets and emergency disaster response policies from a 
resilience-building lens.
In India, M&E systems, and evidence framework for social safety nets in normal times 
comprise of a network of scheme-specific tools such as Management Information Systems 
(MIS), social audits, implementation progress reports/bulletins, and periodic external 
evaluations. It also draws data and evidence from periodic national-level surveys such 
as the Census of India, National Sample Survey (NSS) rounds, National Family Health 
Survey (NFHS), Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), etc. A snapshot of some flagship 
schemes under the social safety nets and their M&E framework is provided in the annexures 
(Table-01).
The year 2005 saw an articulation of the need for evidence and M&E to support disaster 
management planning and post-disaster recovery under the national Disaster Management 
Act. Under this legislation, needs assessment of the affected populations and M&E of 
disaster response became a major part of the recovery phase (NDMA, 2019). Specifically, 
relevant ministries/departments implementing social safety net programmes have to, 
(a) undertake post-disaster baselines to estimate damage, loss, and needs across sectors 
and administrative levels, and (b) formulate M&E plans to track recovery.

5.  Framework for Strengthening and Crisis-Proofing M&E 
systems
But addressing the evidence needs during disaster response and post-disaster recovery 
requires a large-scale strengthening of M&E systems in normal times, in terms of the 
frequency of evidence generation, nature of information collected, and tools/technologies 
used. Strengthened systems can then be further crisis-proofed to be disaster responsive. 
In this essay, we lay down an M&E framework for crisis with four strategies to guide 
government institutions in strengthening and crisis-proofing their M&E with a special focus 
on social safety net programmes.
5.1. Strategy-1: Strengthen existing M&E systems during normal times
Crisis situations demand extraordinary measures and are characterized by, (a) “time 
compression” or the short amount of time available for response, and (b) “tension between 
speed and deliberation” which is the choice between rebuilding quickly or slowing down 
to development comprehensive plans for betterment during the recovery period (Johnson 
& Olshansky, 2016). Effective M&E systems can help balance priorities for both these 
aspects by providing evidence under time and resource constraints. This requires systematic 
strengthening of the system in normal times, to make it reliable and responsive during 
the crisis. Relevant learnings for India can be drawn from countries such as Indonesia 
who have used M&E effectively for post-disaster reconstruction, recovery, and resilience 
building. There are a very few examples of collecting baseline data for any government 
programmes. As a result, it leads to a very difficult situation to monitor or evaluate the 
performance of any programme. Such baseline data if collected during normal times will 
be very useful during the crisis times. 
Indonesia is one of the major South-East Asian economies to make extensive use of M&E 
as part of its public service delivery in normal times. In 1996, the country implemented its 
National Policy on Development Project Performance Evaluation, making M&E an essential 
part of government processes (Barbarie, 1998). The 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami 
resulted in 128,645 deaths and more than 500,000 displaced people in Indonesia. The 
recovery and reconstruction phase, spanning four years, made extensive use of M&E for 
collecting information on needs of the affected populations. The post-disaster recovery 
and response plan was shaped to fit these documented needs, leading to continuous 
self-reflection and innovation across stakeholders. The Sumatra-model was successfully 
replicated in the disaster response plan for the 2006 Java earthquake, which saw one of 
the fastest reconstruction projects in the world (Johnson & Olshansky, 2016).
Key lessons
Enhance the capacity and use of government M&E during normal times. This includes, 
(a) the use of outcome-based approaches for annual M&E planning and programme 
reviews, (b)increasing the coverage and frequency of outcome evaluations across all 
major development programmes and especially those that act as a first line of response 
during disasters at least once in 2-3 years, and (c) strengthening capacities of government

functionaries in designing M&E.A readiness assessment of the existing M&E systems can 
be undertaken to check their crisis-responsiveness including strategies for tracking of 
beneficiaries, adequacy of the information collected, possible alternate sources of data, 
and mechanisms for using evidence to support decision-making during crises situations.
5.2. Strategy-2: Balancing focus between supply and demand data
M&E for social safety nets globally tend to be more supply focused and track more 
outputs than outcomes (WB, 2011). India is no exception. An overview of existing M&E and 
evidence framework (refer to Table-01) shows, with a few exceptions, the skewed focus 
towards capturing routine implementation data such as beneficiary coverage, financial 
expenditure, and quantity of service delivery with some quality dimensions, compared to 
beneficiary demands/needs, unmet needs, or standard of living outcomes. However, the 
simple quantification of supply during normal times and especially during crises situations 
can ignore dimensions of equity, socio-cultural dynamics of recovery, and household/
community needs. Need of the hour is to increase the capacity of existing M&E systems 
to capture more demand-side information in normal times and thereby increasing its 
responsiveness during emergency response planning or post-crisis recovery process.
Learnings can be drawn from the rapid need assessments undertaken during the first 
wave of COVID-19 (2020) in India, wherein impact of the lockdown and relief measures 
was analyzed through telephonic surveys and in-person interviews. In a short span of time, 
information was collected on key issues such as food insecurity, impact on livelihoods, 
access to healthcare, and household coping strategies from vulnerable households, 
migrant workers, and existing beneficiaries of social safety net programmes (APU, n.d.).The 
assessments were undertaken by several government and non-government agencies across 
most states including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, 
Maharashtra, etc., and informed the crisis-response and post-crisis recovery planning (WFP, 
2020) (WB, 2021) (Kesar, Abraham, Lahoti, Nath, & Basole, 2021).
Key lessons
Periodically collect demand and need-based information from existing beneficiaries of 
the social safety net programmes during normal times and leverage this mechanism 
during crisis-situations to identify key deviations and critical issues. Approaches such as 
rapid needs assessments and remote monitoring solutions offer a cost-effective method 
of generating critical information. These can be included as part of M&E frameworks in 
normal times for some of the flagship social safety net programmes and undertaken bi-
annually or annually.
5.3. Strategy-3: Monitoring gets precedence over evaluation during crisis
Crisis and disaster situations demand a greater use of monitoring systems to track affected 
populations, locations, as well as the coverage and adequacy of relief measures. Most social 
safety net programmes in India use internal MIS and traditional monitoring solutions to 
track service delivery and beneficiary coverage. These systems can gain from the use of
<<<PAGE=83>>>

69
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
new and emerging technologies and monitoring approaches. Learnings can be borrowed 
from the experience of disaster-recovery in New Zealand in the wake of 2010 and 2011 
earthquakes, which used a recovery monitoring and reporting framework including monthly 
economic recovery dashboard, quarterly reports of economic indicators, and semi-annual 
well-being surveys to track social recovery of affected families (Johnson & Olshansky, 2016).
Crisis situations also disrupt traditional forms of monitoring data collection (i.e., field 
monitoring, surveys). A potential alternative is offered by remote monitoring solutions 
which leverage digital and technology platforms for generating real-time insights. World 
Food Programme (WFP) uses solutions like mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping 
(mVAM) and Hunger Map LIVE across 90 countries to remotely monitor household food 
security, nutrition, and food-market related trends in real-time as well as assess the impact 
of climate variability and disasters on food security (WFP, n.d.) (WFP, 2022). The remote 
monitoring solutions do not replace existing systems but complements them.
Post-disaster recovery also provides an opportunity for building-back-better, as opposed 
to simply returning communities to pre-disaster conditions. Strong monitoring systems 
supplement these efforts by building a pre-disaster baseline during normal times using 
relevant supply and demand data. The baseline provides a solid benchmark for assessing 
the extent of damage and speed of physical, economic, and social recovery of affected 
communities and individuals. More importantly, the baseline data informs planners and 
decision-makers about the existing vulnerabilities and equity dimensions to be considered 
during the post-recovery period (Joakim & Wismer, 2015).
Key lessons
Strengthen current monitoring systems for social safety net programmes to create baselines 
in the normal times which can serve as a benchmark for post-disaster recovery and building 
back better. New and emerging technologies such as remote monitoring systems and 
community well-being scorecards can complement traditional monitoring data collection 
tools during crisis situations. Their inclusion in the current government M&E systems can 
be tested through pilots.
5.4. Strategy-4: Evaluations in assessing overall crises response
Evaluations in the post-disaster period serve two overarching purposes; (a) “learning” 
which includes development and improvement of the emergency response and disaster 
management policies, (b) “accountability” mechanism for the allocation and use of resources 
(Beerens, Tehler, & Pelzer, 2020). In the past, India has undertaken strategic evaluations of 
relief measures and disaster management policies with development partners. The post-
disaster evaluation of preparedness and emergency response during the 1999 Cyclone 
in Odisha, affecting almost 19 million people in almost 18,000 villages, offered several 
important lessons in emergency response and accountability of state and non-state actors 
which helped shape the Odisha disaster management policy (Thomalla & Schmuk, 2004). 
The state subsequently ramped up its emergency response capacities and has averted loss 
of life in future cyclones such as Phailin in 2013 and Fani in 2019 (WB, 2019).Evaluations,
<<<PAGE=84>>>

70
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
leveraging data from monitoring systems, also provide critical feedback for building-back-
better by enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities. The evaluation of damage, 
loss, and needs by Cyclone Fani recommended increasing the attention and expenditure 
on resilient infrastructure and livelihoods for commensurate economic growth in the post-
disaster period. It also brought to light the differential impact of the cyclone on the most 
vulnerable communities.
Learnings from Odisha can help strengthen government evaluation frameworks by, (a) 
incorporating the lens of resilience and equity as part of periodic assessments undertaken 
during normal times, (b) leveraging information from monitoring systems and baselines to 
identify existing needs and vulnerabilities, and (c) reviewing the adequacy of emergency 
response during disasters to address those needs.
Evaluations by government and non-government institutions during normal times also 
need mitigation plans to adapt itself during sudden onset of crisis situations. Lessons can 
be drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic that nudged several organizations to experiment 
with alternative approaches in this regard. Evaluations planned or occurring in affected 
locations were strengthened to collect information on beneficiary needs and impacts using 
a mix of remote data collection tools and in-person surveys. Multi-sectoral evaluations were 
combined to capture information on different dimensions at one-go and reduce workload. 
Finally, evaluations that were less relevant to the crisis context were postponed until post-
crisis period (UNODC) (WFP) (IOM, 2020).
Key lessons
Social safety net programmes and relevant ministries should incorporate the lens of 
resilience and equity as part of their evaluations during normal times. Valid baselines should 
be drawn periodically with a focus on identifying vulnerabilities. Post-disaster evaluations in 
the affected regions can be undertaken to assess the adequacy of emergency response and 
seek learnings for strengthening safety nets going forward. Planned or ongoing evaluations 
can be further crisis-proofed to make them more responsive and relevant.
6. Conclusion and way forward
The last few decades have witnessed an increase in the frequency and intensity of disasters 
and crises situations. Social safety nets in India act as the first line of response to insulate 
vulnerable populations from severe negative impacts of such events. M&E systems act as a 
critical tool for tracking the performance of safety nets and beneficiary well-being during 
normal times, but their role in informing disaster response and post-disaster recovery is still 
an evolving field. Existing M&E systems require further crisis-proofing to support planning, 
emergency response, and post-disaster recovery.
Learnings and key lessons can be borrowed from national and international experiences 
in the use of evidence for disaster planning, response, and recovery. A framework with 
four strategic action points have been presented for government institutions to further 
strengthen their M&E architecture and make it more crisis responsive. Going forward, 
the action points can be tested through pilot exercises, especially within the flagship
<<<PAGE=85>>>

social safety net programmes and in disaster-prone locations. Relevant central and state 
ministries/departments can also undertake a periodic disaster-readiness assessment of 
their M&E systems to identify gaps and undertake specific capacity building activities.
Finally, evidence from international case studies suggest that strong M&E systems in 
normal times can be relied upon to address evidence needs during crisis situations. A 
key lesson for India is to continually strengthen the capacity, experience, and expertise 
of its government institutions in undertaking and using M&E, as well as foster innovative 
and evidence-based thinking during crisis.

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
1. Introduction
The National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) in India aims to support women’s self-help 
groups5 (SHGs) and developing institutions of the poor that address economic security, 
women’s livelihoods and importantly, gender norms in the community. Various states are 
also forming SHGs through State Rural Livelihood Mission (SRLM) that provides financial 
services to its members and includes wide range of services such as credit, savings, 
insurance, and remittances. The goal is to help in achieving social and financial inclusion 
through mobilizing and organizing women of the most marginalized households into SHGs 
and build their capacities for self-employment and entrepreneurship (NRLM, 2017). NRLM 
has mobilized over 81 million households into SHGs in approximately 6,700 blocks across 
the country (NRLM dashboard, 2022). The highest number of women’s SHGs have been 
formed in Bihar (>10 lakh), followed by Uttar Pradesh (>9 lakh) and Andhra Pradesh 
(>8 lakh) (NRLM, 2022). These days women’s SHGs are not only addressing economic 
security, livelihood and gender norms; they have emerged as a promising platform 
for multiple development outcomes including but not limited to income generation, 
agriculture, behaviour change communication and awareness generation. (Nicholos, 2021). 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the SHGs and their federations played a significant role 
in extending support to the community during the lockdowns, spreading messages on 
COVID appropriate behaviours, and COVID vaccination drive (NRLM, 2020). 
The federated structure6 of NRLM has emerged as a critical component of reaching more 
women effectively and building women-led institutions at the community level. NRLM has 
developed over 3.7 lakhs Village Organizations (VOs) and 3.4 lakhs community resource 
person across 2.5 lakhs villages to function at ground level (NRLM dashboard, 2022). The 
magnitude and scale of the program is vast that requires strong monitoring, review and 
evaluation mechanism to track the progress of the overall objectives and goals. Evidence 
suggests that programs with strong monitoring and review system help in getting desired 
results (Kusek & Rist, 2004). The success of programs depends upon the capacity of 
individual members involved in the mechanism. A lot of community members in the NRLM/
SRLM structure collect numerous data which get digitized into management information 
system (MIS). Although, some dashboards are generated using information from MIS, many 
data remain unanalyzed. More importantly, the data collectors, who are also peer-educators 
or provide support to the community, do not get to see the results for their community 
for whom they gathered data. In this essay, we wanted to highlight the need of building 
the capacities of the system as well as of the community institutions of large programs 
like NRLM toward monitoring and evaluations that can go a long way.

2. Case Study: Bihar
We illustrate the rationale for building evaluation capacities of NRLM, through an example 
from Bihar. The Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (BRLPS), synonymous known 
as JEEViKA, under the SRLM, has been a forerunner in innovating approaches to working 
with SHGs at a large scale. Over the past few years, JEEViKA, with support from external 
partners, has been trying to strengthen its capacities in multiple domains including but not 
limited to monitoring and evaluation. Population Council, as an external evaluation partner, 
conducted implementation research to measure the system capacities of JEEViKA through 
qualitative in-depth interviews with various staff and cadres at all levels. The assessment 
measured the changes over past five years around data collection, validation, data utilization 
in evidence-based decision making, and sustainability of community institutions. 
2.1. Structure of JEEViKA
JEEViKA’s structure can be outlined at the system level and community institution level. 
At the system level, it has a three-tier structure: 1) State Project Management Unit (SPMU) 
with state project managers and project managers of different verticals such as social 
development, health and nutrition, communication, financial inclusion, institution building 
and capacity building, livelihood – farm, non-farm and livestock, MIS, monitoring and 
evaluation; 2) District Project Coordination Unit (DPCU) with district level staff for each 
thematic area; and 3) Block Project Implementation Unit (BPIU) with block level staff, 
i.e., block project manager, area coordinator (AC), and community coordinator (CC).
Planning and designing of strategies take place at SPMU, which are shared with DPCUs 
for coordination at district level with different thematic departments, and activities that 
are planned and designed at state level are implemented at different blocks through 
BPIUs. The community institutions also have a three-tier structure and comprises of SHGs 
at ground level, VOs at village level and CLFs at the cluster level. Functionaries at these 
structures include office bearers and cadres who work at the community level such as 
community mobilizers (CMs), community nutrition resource persons (CNRPs), and master 
resource persons (MRPs). In Bihar, JEEViKA has formed more than 10 lakhs SHGs, more 
than 68,000 VOs and approximately 1300 CLFs in all the 534 blocks across the state 
(JEEViKA dashboard, 2022). 
2.2. Data collection mechanism and data flow
JEEViKA has designated several community functionaries to carry out the planned activities 
within the community. To track the process and progress of activities carried out by 
community functionaries, a chain of data collection process is followed. The CMs are 
responsible to collect and compile data at SHG level. VOs office bearers validate the data 
collected by CMs from all SHGs within a village; CNRPs placed at the gram panchayat 
level and MRPs placed at cluster level also supports in collecting data for the health 
behavior change communication intervention by JEEViKA. VOs are also responsible to 
review, validate and plan the activities conducted by SHGs. At CLF level, compiled data 
from VOs are submitted, which are further transferred to JEEViKA BPIUs at block level.

Block level officials enter these data into MIS, which is reviewed at district and state level. 
The feedback on the data quality flows back from state level to community institutions 
through monthly review meetings. This process is explained through Figure 1.

2.3. Quality of data collection and capacities of community institutions
The community functionaries collect numerous data which are entered into online MIS. 
JEEViKA has been shifting its approach of paper-based data collection to digital data 
collection through mobile phones and use of various ‘Apps’. For example, data collection 
using ‘Health and Nutrition App’ is happening at SHG meeting and places where events/
activities are conducted. The complied data comes to the VO dashboard for validation and 
then CLF reviews it at the CLF level meetings. VO also reviews performance of CM and 
similarly CLF reviews the work of CNRP and MRP. CC and AC also do sample verification 
of data of their catchment area. 
It was noted that JEEViKA has strengthened its data collection techniques and developed 
certain apps to be used at SHG level for data entry. JEEViKA has been utilizing digital 
medium to provide training, monitoring and validating the data through rigorous quality 
checks. Some dashboards have been developed which includes in-house portal to collect 
information on various indicators. Staff from state level reported that the collection of 
online data through mobile apps can be validated at SHGs/VOs level and thus escalating it 
to next level can be avoided. Currently, more than 47,000 CMs are using the App, however, 
the online data collection is not universal in all the blocks.  “…now we have made a new 
MIS and recently it has been launched. Everyone is not getting a mobile phone. So, they 
are using their own mobile phones, and some are facing app compatibility issues. There 
are other technical operating issues as well. Despite all this, 60% of our stuff is digitized 
but since it takes 2-3 months, decision making gets affected…So, data collection and 
compilation online is a very good thought for decision making but it has its own challenges.” 
[State level staff, JEEViKA]
Quality checks and validations have been added to this system; however, staff at lower 
level expressed the incomplete digitization for data entry resulting in delayed process. 
Although, VO level validation access has been given to VO office bearers, the community 
institutions may benefit more through handholding support in utilizing those apps for data 
analysing, evidence generation as well as data visualization. One block level staff said “...
we are doing work in the hard copy...We find it to be very expensive. If any such app is

developed that CM when goes to the field, she can fill in the details in that app…CMs also 
need training to learn using apps.”
[Block level staff, JEEViKA] 
JEEViKA has strengthened its monitoring system and are increasingly utilizing MIS data for 
decision making and planning at state level; however, due to large volume of data, a lot of 
data remain unanalysed by M&E staff. Despite monthly review of community institution’s 
work, the community cadres, who collect data at the ground level do not get to see the 
evidence emerged from the data that could help them assessing the progress in their 
community as a resultant of their efforts. 
Over the past five years, there has been improved participation of community institutions 
in planning and review meetings. Rotation of leadership within SHGs and VOs emerged as 
an encouraging mechanism in building leadership capacities within members of the group. 
Conscious effort has been made by JEEViKA in capacitating VOs/CLF for better community 
mobilization, reporting, review mechanism and self-sustainability of these institutions. While 
the community institutions still lack capacity in planning and designing the activities, and 
systematic review of their activities, the state level functionaries mentioned about the 
need for external support in building their capacities in preparing theory of change and 
evaluation methodologies which can help them develop and assess request for proposals 
for evaluating their programs. 
3. Summary and Conclusion
SHGs formed through NRLM/SRLM operate at a large scale and address the burning 
issue of rural poverty and livelihood. Large number community institutions have been 
developed throughout the country to manage their social and economic aspects, and these 
institutions function in similar fashion in almost every SRLMs. The capacity assessment of 
JEEViKA in Bihar suggest that there is an openness of higher structure to engage the 
lower cadres in participatory planning and having a decentralized mechanism for data use. 
There is a need and scope for building capacities of two types of individuals: a) at the 
system level who collate and analyse MIS data, and b) community level functionaries who 
collect data and are also important players in many intervention activities. There is a great 
scope to strengthen their capacities to monitor, track their own activities and review the 
progress. For this, building the capacities of these two sets of people for data collection, 
quality checks, compilation, synthesis and basic understanding of utilization of data for 
decision making is priority. Most of the women engaged in community institutions are 
from marginalized community and it may not be possible to build their capacity through 
sporadic trainings. Some mechanism to support the community cadres towards the costs 
for mobile phones and mobile internet, and data entry cost can certainly facilitate a greater 
data generation and utilization. 
Based on the learnings from our case study assessment in Bihar, we recommend making 
sustained effort and adopt innovative ways to build the capacity of staff and cadres around 
evaluating their own efforts for informed decision making at their end rather continuous 
guidance from outside. At system level, our recommendation is to strengthen the evidence-

based monitoring, review and feedback mechanism. This can be achieved through two 
possible ways: through building the capacity of cadres and community institutions to 
utilize data in evidence-based decision making and second, through sharing evidence 
from internal/external evaluations with all levels of staff for validating program activities.

Abstract
The principle of leaving no one behind from the benefits of development progress is 
embedded in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. Many nations and governments 
today are designing their developmental programmes and policies in alignment with the 
sustainable development goals. As evidence-based policymaking has become the norm, it 
is imperative for evaluations to be more inclusive, equitable and sensitive in their approach. 
Evaluation studies that are centered on the idea of inclusivity, by providing evidential insights 
about the experiences of the marginalized and the underrepresented, allow policy-makers 
to better acknowledge and address the dimension of inclusivity in policymaking as well. 
Failure to make evaluations inclusive might result in incomplete or biased representation 
of the reality, which in turn can lead to a policy response that fails to recognize the needs 
of the marginalized. 
Against this background, this essay attempts to underscore the role of equity-centric 
evaluations for empowering marginalized groups while maintaining utmost sensitivity to 
their needs and requirements. The first section allows the evaluators and other stakeholders 
to acquire a broader understanding of how an evaluation as a whole as well as its parts such 
as theory of change, selection of stakeholders, research design, instruments of observation, 
data collection and so on, can be designed to ensure better capturing of the perspectives 
and participation of the marginalized. The second section stresses on application of principle 
of equity to the process of budgeting since one of the goals of evaluations is to provide 
pertinent inputs to policy makers to improve efficiency and optimize resource-allocation 
of the schemes. 
1.  Including inclusivity in Designing, Planning and Implementing 
Evaluations
Evaluations provide a powerful tool to challenge the existing limitations of the public 
programmes and schemes in ensuring inclusivity. In order to achieve this objective, all 
facets of an evaluation study, starting from planning and designing stage to the reporting 
of results should be viewed from an equity-lens. Inculcating the idea of inclusivity as 
an integral and intrinsic metric of outcome and impact assessment can safeguard 
evaluations of government programmes/schemes and corresponding policy responses 
from overlooking socio-economic biases. Therefore, before planning any evaluation, it is 
crucial to determine the contextual relevance of measuring equity and the degree to which 
it should be embedded in an evaluation model. A2011 United Nations Evaluation Group 
(UNEG) guidance document7 proposes an assessment of evaluability of human rights and 
gender equality dimensions to broaden the scope of evaluations. This entails developing 
an understanding of characteristics of an intervention and its focus on inclusivity. Once 
such an understanding is established, it can be utilized to formulate an approach that 
addresses the limitations of the current system and strengthens inclusivity dimension of 
the evaluation.

1.1. Theorizing Equity in Evaluations
A planner or an evaluator should make an effort to factor in inclusivity while designing 
or revising theory of change and logical framework of an intervention. Impact pathways 
or outcomes should be clearly laid down for different socio-economic groups. Indicators, 
both qualitative and quantitative, should be selected so as to adequately capture the 
variations in coverage, effectiveness and impact of the programmes across different 
groups of population. In addition to this, and depending on the context of the programme, 
indicators should be disaggregated on the basis of different criteria such as gender, caste, 
religion, disability, rural/urban, income and so on. Data collected and analyzed based on 
this groundwork has the potential to allow the evaluators and policy-makers to assess 
if there is any divergence in the development pathways across different socio-economic 
groups. 
A handbook on inclusive education by Save the Children 8 observes that an overall 
improvement of learning outcome is not a sufficient indicator of the success of an 
educational programme, a Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, and Learning (MEAL) 
analysis should be comprehensive enough to indicate “ which children had improved 
learning outcomes, and which are still struggling”. Similarly, learnings from evaluations, 
which by highlighting inequities increased the programmes’ focus on addressing them, 
prompted the Gates Foundation’s office in India to embrace a gender equity lens into its 
health strategy and construct meaningful metrics around equity (Hay, 2017). 
1.2. Utility of Qualitative Evidence 
Quantitative evidence from inclusive and disaggregated indicators should be supplemented 
and triangulated by qualitative insights. Qualitative methods provide rich behavioral and 
experiential insights from people’s lives. These can be an effective way of including equity 
component in policy-making by capturing perspectives and learnings from a specific group 
of stakeholders, and driving policy-decisions that are cognizant of people’s views and 
experiences (Ford et al. 2021).Participatory tools, such as participatory learning and action 
(PLA) method, also provide a useful platform for not only understanding the cultural and 
social constructs of a community but also gaining from the knowledge of varied groups 
of end-users in planning, improving and managing the development programmes. Thus, a 
mixed method evaluation design, comprising of quantitative, qualitative and participatory 
tools, is important for eliciting information on how populations belonging to different 
socio-economic groups experience development. 
1.3. Leaving no stakeholder behind
Efforts should be made to imbibe the value of equity at all stages of evaluation. 
Identification and selection of stakeholders must be scientifically done so as to ensure 
that voices of diverse population groups, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized, 
receive accurate representation. A stakeholder analysis, which identifies and classifies all

the relevant stakeholders on the basis of their role in the intervention, their importance in 
the evaluation, level of their participation and so on, can be conducted (Faúndez, A. et al. 
2013). Such an analysis can aid evaluators in minimizing the exclusion error and ensuring 
adequate participation of the underrepresented. 
1.4. Learnings from Evaluations of 125 centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) of 
Government of India
Another important component that requires to be regarded from an inclusivity lens is the 
formulation of evaluation criteria and evaluation questions. The designing, implementation 
and reporting of third-party evaluations of 125centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) 9 of 
Government of India, which were conducted by Development, Monitoring and Evaluation 
Office (DMEO) of NITI Aayog, provide a good example in this regard. DMEO adopted the 
OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) framework of evaluating the programmes 
which included the principles of Relevance, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Sustainability and 
Impact (REESI).10 This framework was innovatively modified to REESI + E  by adding the 
principle of Equity (REESI + E). The figure below summarizes the focus of each of these 
six principles in the evaluations
Figure 1: REESI+ E Framework adopted by DMEO for conducting evaluations of CSS schemes

Inclusion of equity as one of the evaluation criteria increased the studies’ coverage on 
assessing the inclusivity of the schemes. It strengthened the scope of evaluations by 
enabling the studies to define objectives and explore corresponding evaluation questions 
along the lines of equity, besides other criteria. Cross-cutting themes such as gender 
mainstreaming and social inclusion were investigated across all the schemes and sectors. 
Some major insights on gender mainstreaming and social inequities from the evaluation of 
the schemes under Rural Development and Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries 
are summarized in the Box below.

from an Indian experience
1. Gender Mainstreaming in Rural Development Sector 
Although schemes in rural development sector have led to an enhancement in women’s 
access to income generation activities, economic independence, skill-development 
activities, and entrepreneurial opportunities, more concerted efforts are required for 
provision of sex-disaggregated data to recognize women’s rights to resources and their 
rights as workers. There is a need to focus on inclusivity and development outcomes 
for single women. 
While the formation of self-help groups under National Rural Livelihoods Mission 
(NRLM) has increased opportunities for financial inclusion and granted more decision-
making autonomy to women, there is still scope for enhancing women’s access to 
technology and infrastructure and strengthening women’s engagement across various 
activities along the livelihood value chain.
Women’s political participation and appointment to local leadership roles remains low 
because of several institutional and social barriers. Lack of training and skills among 
women leaders is also another barrier to women empowerment in political arena.

Analysis of the Key Indicators of Situation of Agricultural Households in India (NSS) 
show that bottom three decile classes in terms of monthly per capita consumer 
expenditure (MPCE) are dominated by Schedules Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe 
(ST) households. This inequality is also reflected in the size of the land holdings. The 
percentage share of SC/ST agricultural households in landholding declined from lowest 
size class (less than 0.01 ha) to highest size class (more than 10 ha). 
The household survey conducted as part of the evaluation reveals that 44.9% of all 
disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/other backward classes) are part of SHG or producer 
groups as compared to 54.3% for other social groups (other than SC/ST/other backward 
classes). Similarly, 83% of all farmers from disadvantaged groups are beneficiaries of 
the Green Revolution scheme against 92% for all farmers from other social groups. 
Regional differences in the quality of extension services and infrastructure also hinder 
the economic development of farmers belonging to socially-marginalised classes.

Inclusivity in Evaluations and Equity-Centric Budgeting

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
Designing instruments of observation and questionnaires is one of the most important 
activities of any evaluation study. The endeavor should be to include relevant questions 
for all the relevant stakeholders, including the disadvantaged and marginalized, in order to 
capture diversity in responses. The data collected using such instruments can be used for 
analyzing the level of programme’s emphasis on ensuring inclusivity of the marginalized. 
In fact, assessment of the programme’s role in addressing inequities can be included as 
an objective of the data analysis plan. 
1.5. Making evaluation sensitive to the marginalized 
Any form of data collection or interaction, especially with the marginalized sections of 
the society, must be carried out with utmost sensitivity. Evaluators should be cognizant 
and respectful of the cultural and socio-economic milieu in which the participants live and 
work. The data collection team should also batten to such sensitivities. The selected team 
is required to be sensitized and trained properly before establishing any contact with the 
participants, and consent must be sought from the participants before any interaction. 
The evaluation team should also maintain information privacy; a breach of which, without 
consent, has the potential to lead to economic, social, or physical harm for the participant 
or the community (Ford et al. 2021). In other words, it is unequivocally imperative to 
maintain the ethical and safety considerations of the participants of any evaluation study.
2. Equity Centric Budgeting
The objective of ensuring inclusivity in evaluations of government schemes is to inform 
policy makers about the performance of the schemes in coverage and extent of benefits to 
different socio-economic groups, particularly the vulnerable and marginalized communities. 
It provides pertinent inputs to policy makers in designing interventions that would improve 
inclusivity in government schemes. One such intervention is equity centric budgeting. 
Applying the principle of equity to budgeting brings forth concerns related to equitable 
allocation of resources to various socio-economic groups, and monitoring of their 
performance thereof. 
An important principle of good governance and a central discourse in public policy is 
analyzing if the budget outlays translate into outputs in the form of services to the people 
and how they lead to the improvement in the overarching developmental outcomes for 
the people and the country. Earlier, typically the budget document in India only had 
information about the money allocated and spent under various heads. This was not 
adequate to enhance public expenditure and increase accountability; especially in the social 
sector which is critical for the protection of the rights of the marginalized. To address this, 
the Government of India, in the recent years, has brought in major expenditure reforms 
such as easing of appraisal and approval processes and structural changes in the process of 
budget making itself, such as, doing away with Plan/Non-plan distinction. This has resulted 
in the cost borne by the center being treated in an integrated manner and brought public 
schemes and projects under an output-outcome framework (OOMF). Beginning with the 
financial year 2017-18, in addition to the financial outlays of schemes of the Ministries being 
indicated in the Budget document, the expected outputs and outcomes of the schemes
<<<PAGE=103>>>
Inclusivity in Evaluations and Equity-Centric Budgeting

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
are also presented in a consolidated Outcome Budget document. While output refers to 
the direct and measurable product of an intervention/activity, outcome is the collective 
result brought about in the delivery of the services. Thus, the Outcome Budget includes 
the financial outlay for each central sector scheme (CS) and centrally sponsored scheme 
(CSS) for each financial year along with clearly defined outputs, outcomes and the targets 
to be achieved in the said financial year. 
While the outcome budgeting exercise is an important reform aimed at promoting the ideals 
of good governance such as transparency and accountability, it is not enough to ensure 
the equitable coverage and empowerment of the marginalized. For this, it is imperative 
that equity considerations are included in the outcome budgeting by integrating specific 
inclusivity related indicators and targets in both outputs and outcomes of the schemes. 
Evaluations build on the idea of inclusivity can facilitate this decision-making process, such 
as integrating insights from the assessment of Equity and Efficiency criteria of RCEESI+E 
framework (discussed in the previous section) can provide practical recommendations for 
equitable budgetary allocations. Equity centric budgeting will help in prioritizing spending 
where it is required most and help utilize public resources to support the historically 
disadvantaged. As an example of equity centric budgeting, gender responsive budgeting 
is discussed below. 
2.1. Gender responsive budgeting
Gender responsive budgets have now emerged as a strategy to evaluate government 
budgets for their contribution towards gender equality. The integration of gender 
perspective into budgetary analysis and decision-making process was included for the 
first time in the Beijing Platform for Action in the year 1995. The call for mainstreaming 
of gender into macroeconomic policy analysis involves the assessment of the government 
expenditure and its impact on the socio-economic position of the women, men, girls and 
boys. Gender budgeting initiatives have three core goals as shown in the figure below:

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
While drawing on the concepts of transparency and accountability of the good governance 
discourse, the emphasis of gender budgeting initiatives on participatory principles have 
played an important role in promoting gender equality. Such initiatives can also be aligned 
to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly to Goal-5 indicators and targets 
which aim towards achieving gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls. 
Thus, gender responsive budgets help in identifying gender gaps and unmet needs and 
provide a blueprint towards implementing gender sensitive processes throughout the 
planning, budgeting and implementation cycles of government schemes. 
Moreover, gender budgets acknowledge the fact that the impact of government budgets 
occurs through both direct and indirect channels (Elson and Sharp 2011). Thus, a gendered 
lens is required to examine how these direct and indirect effects of the budget and policies 
have varying impacts on different groups of men and women. 
Initiatives such as gender responsive budgeting are ushering structural shift in the decision-
making processes and priorities of the governments which will ensure that going forward 
the policies would be responsive to the needs of the vulnerable and marginalized sections 
in a way that will promote equitable growth.

Road to Zero Hunger: Review of Evidence on India’s Food Safety Nets

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
Abstract
India implements one of the largest Food Safety Net (FSN) programmes in the world 
under the National Food Security Act (NFSA, 2013) covering almost a billion beneficiaries 
at a mammoth cost of Rs. 2.86 lakh crores (2021-22). The NFSA is a watershed initiative 
by the Government of India in achieving food and nutrition security in the country as it 
makes available adequate quantity of quality food to its vulnerable population. Also, it 
plays a pivotal role in achieving the SDG Goal 2 of Zero Hunger by 2030.
This article undertakes a review of available literature on the effect of FSN on achieving 
food security and improving nutrition outcomes for its beneficiaries. The paper summarizes 
key findings related to various food security and nutrition measures in India along with 
the impact of NFSA in key thematic areas. The review is based on articles from peer-
reviewed journals, which have been analyzed through the deployment for relevant content 
analysis techniques in order to synthesize the findings. The reference period for the review 
is 2000-2021.
Key findings from the review suggest that, with the implementation of the NFSA, important 
strides have been taken in the positive direction, such as broader coverage, lower targeting 
errors, accelerated PDS reforms and positive impact on nutritional status. Addressing 
the existing inefficiencies in the system is necessary to further strengthen the delivery 
mechanism. Overall, the review also points to a lack of comprehensive review of the NFSA 
after its enactment and need for further evidence for policy strengthening. 
1. Background
Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) programmes have been a pillar of India’s social policy 
since independence. The Public Distribution System (PDS), which started as a wartime 
measure during the Second World War (Bhattacharya et al, 2017), has undergone several 
transformations in the last seven decades. The multi-pronged approach under this system 
has been instrumental in sustaining and improving the availability, access, affordability, 
and utilization of food for beneficiaries. This strategy covers new technology generation 
and adoption adequate availability of inputs, institutional credit, subsidy on farm inputs, 
improved infrastructure, expansion of irrigation, institutional reforms, competitive markets, 
remunerative prices for farmers/producers, public procurement, system of buffer stocks, 
open market sales, supply of food through public distribution system, nutrition interventions 
and trade policy (Chand and Jumrani, 2013)
A landmark judgement by the Supreme Court of India in 2001recognized food security as 
a fundamental right and paved the way for the introduction of National Food Security Act 
(NFSA)11 in 2013. The NFSA is an umbrella legislation aimed at providing food and nutrition 
security in a life-cycle approach for socio-economically vulnerable households, individuals, 
and age-groups. The legislation and its current policies play a pivotal role in (a) India’s 
policy efforts towards achieving sustainable food systems, and (b) meeting targets under 
the Sustainable Development Goal-2 (Zero Hunger). The food-safety net created under

NFSA, one of the largest globally, comprises of three major schemes, namely: Targeted 
Public Distribution System (TPDS), Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), and 
Mid-day Meal (MDM) scheme.12The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), the largest 
component under NFSA based on number of beneficiaries,currently provides subsidized 
food grains at the price of INR 3,2 and1 for rice, wheat, and coarse grains respectively to 
roughly 77 crore beneficiaries (23.12 crore ration cards approximately, that includes Priority 
Households and under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY)) catered through a network of 5.44 
fair price shops (FPS).13
Post-NFSA, the increase in population that was entitled to receive subsidized food grains 
under TPDS also resulted in increasing the national food subsidy bill. The food subsidy 14 
bill increased from INR 63,844 crores in 2010-11 to INR 1,08,688 crores in 2019-20. It 
further shot up to INR 4,22,618 crores in 2020-21 (revised estimates) on the account of 
relief-packages to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and payment of pending 
dues of the Food Corporation of India (FCI).15 However, the increase in public expenditure 
on food and nutrition security schemes such as TPDS has not been accompanied by any 
significant improvement in the developmental outcomes. The recent estimates from the 
National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-V observe that more than 1/3rd of children <5 years 
are stunted (35.5%, 2019-20 in India compared with 22% globally 16), and more than half 
of all women aged 15-59 years and 15-19 years are anemic (57% and 59.1%, 2019-20). This 
is in stark contrast with only 14.6 percent of women in Northern America and Europe 
being affected by anaemia.17India also accounted for roughly 30% of the global burden 
of hunger in 2020-2118.
Against this backdrop, a review of the existing literature on Food and Nutrition Security 
policies and NFSA in India was conducted with the objective of identifying key areas of 
implementation challenges, inefficiencies, and mitigation measures for achieving national 
and international targets, and to identify evidence gaps.
2. Research Approach and Methodology
The research articles have been searched comprehensively through the electronic databases 
for the last two decades from 2000 to 2021 and conducted a screening of databases 
to identify articles with reference to food and nutrition security in India. 19 The databases

included in the search were PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, NITI Aayog library, among 
others. Articles compiled included peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, working 
papers/white papers, national and international reports, white papers etc. For the scope 
of this review, only peer-reviewed articles, which appeared in journals with a high impact 
factor, were considered for the review. With the enactment of the NFSA in 2013, the 
temporal limits for this review were pegged from 2000-2021, in order to satisfactorily 
cover literature published before and after this milestone. The inclusion criteria for the 
articles for this review were: 1) full-text of the article published in English; 2) publication 
in peer-reviewed journal; 3) focus on food and nutrition security in India; 4) focus on 
overall NFSA and its implications. Articles focusing on specific components of the NFSA, 
viz. TPDS, MDM and ICDS were not included for this review. After an initial screening of 
the articles by time period, title and abstract, as per these inclusion criteria, the remaining 
articles were then reviewed in entirety for final assessment.
The research approach developed for this analysis aimed to mirror a systematic literature 
review, as defined by the widely accepted PRISMA guidelines. 20For analyzing the final 
articles to be reviewed, directed content analysis approach was used to review and 
synthesize the findings. The articles were arranged thematically into categories and based 
on relevant themes emerging during the analysis, key insights were highlighted as “codes”. 
This approach helped in developing a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects 
of food and nutrition security in India, along with identifying the gaps in evidence based 
on the review.
3. Key Findings: Methodology
Based on the search criteria, a database of 427 articles was collated, of which 15 were 
duplicates and 3 were temporal outliers. The eligibility of the remaining 409articles was 
then determined through review of titles and abstracts. This led to rejecting 309 articles, 
leaving 100 articles to be included for the analysis of the text based on the inclusion criteria. 
A total of 29 articles were finally reviewed after meeting the inclusion criteria. (Fig 1)

While the articles reviewed dealt with overlapping themes, based on a broad categorization 
of the overarching theme of the paper, the maximum articles dealt with the theme of 
food subsidies (n=13), followed by food security (n=10), nutrition (n=4), and NFSA (n=2). 
The analysis also depicts an increasing interest in the domain of Food and Nutrition 
Security in India, markedly so since the enactment of the NFSA in 2013. The literature 
published within the 7-year reference period post NFSA (n=18) exceeds the cumulative 
literature during the 12-year period prior to it (n=11). The National Sample Survey (NSS), 
which collects nationwide data on various aspects of socioeconomic relevance, was the 
most frequently used data source (n=12) in the literature reviewed. This was followed by 
the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) (n=3) and National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau 
(NNMB) survey (n=1), which provides large-scale database on key health and nutrition 
related indicators, respectively. Three studies were based on primary surveys conducted 
in a specific state or a group of states, which included Odisha, Kerala, and Maharashtra. 
The table below provides a snapshot of the key data sources along with the key indicators 
of interest in each, as cited in the literature.

4. Discussion
The key finding which emerged from undertaking this comprehensive review is that, while 
the NFSA has contributed towards improving the FNS status in the country, significant 
bottlenecks such as diversions and leakages; transportation and storage related spoilage; 
profitability of Fair Price Shops and technological improvements need to be tackled in 
order to further improve the nutritional and overall quality of life of the population.
The following section discusses high-level findings emerging from the literature. Following a 
brief discussion tracing the evolution of the PDS in India, the remaining findings have been 
synthesized under four thematic areas (Coverage, Supply Chain, Entitlement, and Impact), 
which have developed as the focal points for discussions on improving FNS and NFSA.

4.1. Evolution of NFSA in India
India’s Public Distribution System (PDS), now under the umbrella of the NFSA, is the 
largest distribution network of its kind in the world. In its nascent stages, before the 
1960s, the PDS was dependant on imports of food grains. In the 1960s and 70s, it was 
strengthened as a response to food shortages, with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) 
being set up to bolster domestic procurement, storage, and distribution capabilities. In the 
two decades following that, it developed from being a universal food subsidy scheme to 
a being revamped to target the poor and remote populations in the 1990s. It was in 1997, 
that the government of India introduced the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), 
with the aim of providing subsidised food and fuel to the poor through a network of ration 
shops. The responsibilities of beneficiary identification, grain procurement and distribution 
of grains were shared by the centre and state.
This system was further reformed and strengthened with the introduction of the National 
Food Security Act, 2013. The Act emphasizes on a lifecycle approach to improve FNS 
outcomes and to recognize the Right to Food as a justiciable right. It introduces several 
improvements to the erstwhile TPDS in terms of beneficiary targeting, recognizing women 
as the head of the household, introduction of technological reforms, among others. 
The table below provides a chronological description of the evolution of the PDS, and 
concomitantly the FNS policies, in India.

4.2. Coverage
The PDS has been riddled with charges of poor targeting, corruption, and inclusion-
exclusion errors since its early years. However, the present literature suggests that the 
NFSA has led to broader coverage, lower targeting errors, accelerated PDS reforms. (Dreze 
et al, 2019)Ravi and Nair (2019) find that the NFSA has led to an increase in the number 
of beneficiaries who were dependent totally on the PDS in Kerala. There has also been an 
increase in the purchase of subsidized grains from the PDS shops over the years. (Kishore 
and Chakrabarti, 2015)
4.3. Supply chain 
The key concerns around the PDS supply chain have been around the issues of leakages, 
losses, wastages, and corruption. While the estimates for leakages/diversions from the 
PDS vary, this number is estimated to be “alarmingly high” at about one-third of total 
food grains. (Krishnamurthy et al, 2017) In terms of losses, it is estimated that about 
10% of grains are spoilt during storage and transportation. (Jha et al.,2013) These issues, 
coupled with the “barely profitable” Fair Price Shops (FPS), lead to inefficiencies creeping 
into the system, which when addressed could significantly improve the performance and 
utility of PDS to address the objectives it set out to meet. Kaul (2018) finds that in 
states where corruption is significantly higher, the impact of calorie intake is significantly 
smaller. However, even at the existing rate of leakages and losses, the PDS contributed 
to an improvement in nutritional status. Eliminating such bottlenecks could improve the 
efficiency of the system by as much as 46% (Srivastava and Chand, 2017).
4.4. Entitlement
While there have been discussions pertaining to the merits of an in-kind food subsidy in 
comparison to a Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, such as cash transfers, Srivastava 
and Chand (2017), demonstrate that “effect of subsidies spent on in-kind PDS transfer on 
calorie-intake is 3.5-3.9 times the effect of direct cash transfer of food subsidy.” With this 
in view, they suggest strengthening of the PDS system or conditional cash transfers for 
improving nutritional status. Khera (2011) shows that in areas where there has been under 
purchase and low utilization of PDS commodities, it has been mainly due to supply chain 
constraints. Several studies indicate that further enhancing the scope of the distribution, 
adding to rice and wheat, through provision of commodities such as coarse grains, millets, 
highly nutrition foods, etc., could help in meeting the nutritional needs, especially of the 
poor populations. (Malaiarasan et al., 2021; Chand and Kumar, 2002)
4.5. Impact
Several data sources indicate that the distribution of subsidized food grains through 
the Public Distribution System in India has “significantly and positively impacted food 
consumption and nutritional intake across households” (Malaiarasan et al, 2021; Kishore and 
Chakrabarti 2015, Shrinivas et al, 2017). It is estimated that PDS beneficiaries consumed 
“83% of the subsidy’s implicit income transfer in the form of food”. (Srinivas et al, 2017).

Studies also indicate that there has been a small albeit positive impact on calories from all 
food groups, not just cereals. (Kaul, 2018). However, calorie deficiency has been reported 
to be higher in rural areas as compared to urban areas. (Ghosh, 2021)
5. Evidence Gaps
It has been emerged that there has been a paucity of comprehensive large-scale evaluation 
of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) since its enactment in 2013. The last evaluation 
of the erstwhile Targeted Public Distribution System was conducted in only 7 states in 2015, 
when the reforms directed under NFSA were still being implemented and in nascent stages 
of observation. While there have been guidelines and directives by respective government 
ministries for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the components under 
the ambit of the NFSA, it was observed that these did not contribute significantly to 
impact assessment evidence generation at a national scale, due to various factors, such 
as low sample size, region-specificity, etc. 
As the NFSA completes almost a decade - with the recent COVID-19 pandemic further 
highlighting the need for a robust food and nutrition security programme for a large 
section of the country’s population - it would be prudent to undertake a holistic systematic 
evaluation and impact assessment of the NFSA in its entirety, in order to bolster the system 
further through recommendations for course correction.
6. Conclusion
The NFSA is a milestone in India’s food and nutrition security policy, resulting from 
decades of investment in adaptive governance and course correction of the food safety 
nets programmes in India. The findings of the literature review of food subsidies and 
NFSA in India suggest that important strides have been taken in a positive direction with 
the implementation of the NFSA. These include better efficiency, in terms of targeting, 
coverage etc., of the system as well as positive impact on nutritional indicators, such as 
dietary diversity. Their view also points to further needs for improvement in the system in 
terms of addressing leakages, wastage, and corruption; implementation of technological 
reforms; strengthening nutritional outcomes; and better and more transparent governance 
mechanisms. The NFSA, if implemented in letter and spirit, would significantly improve the 
food and nutritional security status in India. Overall, the review also points to a lack of 
comprehensive assessment of the NFSA and food safety nets in India to properly address 
the question of food policy in India and its efficiency and impact. Cross-learning of best 
practices can be used for improvement in its implementation to enhance its impact and 
to improve the food and nutritional security standards in the country.

Abstract
Evidence-based approach to policy making has become the cornerstone of programme 
development and implementation. Much of program monitoring and evaluation designs 
emphasize on traditional quantitative and qualitative approaches which are used in silos 
and hence do not provide comprehensible findings of the evaluation. Information on policy 
and program will be more holistic if qualitative and quantitative data via mixed-methods 
approach is used. It will not only aid in identifying and explaining policy/programme impacts, 
but will go beyond “causality” to better understand the dimensions of “why” and “how” 
of observed impact effects. This paper highlights the key elements of mixed-methods 
design along with challenges and opportunities for strengthening the mixed methods for 
evaluation. 
Keywords: Mixed-methods, evaluation, evidence-based policymaking, quantitative, 
qualitative.
1. Introduction 
There has been a greater call for accountability for policy effectiveness and program 
outcome. Increase in data availability and advances in methodology, tools and technique have 
bolstered not only the demands but also the capability for evidence-based policymaking. 
Academic and policymaking circles [1] are collaborating to promote systematic approaches 
to review and evaluate policy using scientific evidence in social policy making. An 
evidence-based approach to policy making has become the cornerstone of programme 
development and implementation. Much of monitoring and evaluation forums emphasise 
mainly on quantitative methods, which provide evidence with high degree of internal 
validity, generalizability, and replicability with reference to its causal inferences. Question 
that is posed is, what methods constitute rigorous and reliable evidence and how research 
evidence should be generated and judged. In evidence-based policy making, there exists 
a generally established hierarchy of dominant research methods, with many forums have 
formally defined classifying studies according to research design and methodology, with 
highest value being awarded to Randomized Control Trials (RCT) (Burch & Heinrich, 2016). 
However, pursuing mixed methods have their own merits. 
For evidence-based policy making, it is imperative to know what are the outcomes and 
outputs, but also what is the impact and why did citizens or program implementers behave 
the way they behaved. This can be provided by combining qualitative and quantitative 
methods, i.e., combining the inherent advantages of large sample size, probabilistic 
precision offered by quantitative analysis with adding deeper context and exploring 
phenomena in qualitative research. Numbers from quantitative research add precision, 
while words, pictures and narrative description from qualitative research adds the meaning 
and explanation to those numbers.
Quantitative methods which by definition itself is numerical based, provide uniform 
measure of output and outcome, enabling econometric analysis of identifying causality 
and relationship among variables but have their own challenges when it involves abstract 
constructs. Qualitative methods are better to capture abstract social issues, as it uses

more flexible, open-ended questions, connecting researchers with subjects, to elect more 
honest filter free responses. However, there is a trade off in terms of sample size, that is, 
on depth vs breadth thereby Quantitative and qualitative evaluation complementing and 
covering are cover each other’s blind side. Combining qualitative and quantitative methods 
enhance generalizability and completeness through triangulation and corroboration of 
findings (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004) and at the same time, initiates the process of 
exploring new interpretation (Rossman & Wilson, 1985). 
Mixed method does not and should not aim at addressing differences in paradigms but 
leverage dualism, which reflects the subject of our study in policy research, shedding new 
light not duplicating effort (Bryman, 2006)(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). Mixed methods 
assist in building new perspectives or frameworks, or the reframing of research questions 
itself., augmenting depth in inquiry. Combining qualitative and quantitative data via mixed 
methods approach not only enables identifying and explaining policy/programme impacts 
but goes beyond “causality” to fathom the dimensions of “how” and “why” of observed 
impact effects. 
This paper articulates the challenges and highlight opportunities, making a case for 
augmenting the mixed methods in the context of public policy evaluations.
2.  Mixed Method Approach in the Programme Evaluation Context
2.1. Definition of mixed method approach
The central premise of using mixed methods research is to use both quantitative and 
qualitative approaches together. The methods draw on potential strengths of both the 
qualitative and quantitative approach in combination which maximizes the ability to assess 
the program performance. It provides complete information, that is more coherent and 
reliable, than a standalone quantitative or qualitative method of evaluation.
The use of mixed methods in development evaluations can be traced back to the 1800s 
(Play, 1855)(Bois, 1899). In 1959, Campbell and Fiske (Campbell & Fiske, 959) argued the 
need for using “more than one trait and more than one method” in the validation process, 
and to achieve this they proposed a multi-trait multi-method matrix (Campbell & Fiske, 
1959). The chapter in the 1997 issue of the ‘New Directions for Evaluation’ by Greene and 
Caracelli, that explored the role of mixed methods in evaluations, played a significant role 
in forwarding this discussion in the evaluation communities.
USAID in its evaluation policy has strongly recommended the use of mixed-method 
approaches in evaluation studies, stating that a combination of qualitative and quantitative 
methods yield optimal results. The complementarity in both the methods aid in overcoming 
the weaknesses of one approach over the other when used in mix method research. In the 
evaluation context, mixed methods approach is defined as followed by USAID: “A mixed-
method evaluation systematically integrates two or more evaluation methods, potentially at 
every stage of the evaluation process, usually drawing on both quantitative and qualitative 
data”(USAID, 2013).

2.2. Mixed method designs
While designing mixed method evaluations, it is important to carefully consider the 
design that would be right for the study. Qualitative and quantitative approaches may 
be conducted either in parallel, sequential. In case of parallel design, data collection and 
analysis are conducted separately for qualitative and quantitative methods during same 
or different time periods, and the results are then triangulated or synthesized based on 
whether the two methods were intended to answer the same question or different ones. 
In sequential design, one method precedes the other, in data collection and analysis. 
Based on the analysis from the data from the first method, the evaluator plans the next 
round of data collection and so on. Multi-level designs involve different methods being 
adopted at different levels in order to comprehensively understand the project outcomes 
and impacts (USAID, 2013). Mixed-method designs benefit in multi-level studies by often 
providing more accurate and credible findings from analysis on a smaller and more cost-
effective sample (Bamberger, 2012).
Another major aspect to consider in the design of a mixed method approach is the 
dominance of one approach over the other. Based on the study requirements and the 
evaluators expertise, qualitative and qualitative approach may hold equal or skewed 
weightages. In a dominant quantitative approach, data analysis will heavily depend upon 
quantitative analysis techniques to draw insights from surveys administered across the 
sample, while the qualitative techniques like interviews, focused group discussions etc. 
conducted on a smaller sample are used to design or bolster the quantitative analysis 
findings. In an evaluation study skewed towards the qualitative approach, quantitative 
analysis usually supports in designing and sampling the qualitative study. In studies where 
qualitative and quantitative approaches are given equal weightage, quantitative surveys 
are combined with a range of different qualitative techniques to either analyses the same 
or different sets of questions (Bamberger, 2012).
Based on the placement of the two approaches in time and dominance, literature has 
identified five major mixed method designs - convergent parallel design, explanatory 
sequential design, exploratory sequential design, embedded design and multi-phase design. 
In a convergent parallel design, both methods are executed independently and in parallel 
with equal priority, with an objective that findings from both the methods answer the 
questions. Explanatory sequential design prioritizes quantitative methods in both weightage 
and time, while qualitative method is used to bolster the findings from the quantitative 
method. On the other hand, exploratory sequential design prioritizes qualitative method 
in sequence and weight, with quantitative data normally used to understand how it builds 
over the qualitative results. Embedded design involves collection of both qualitative and 
quantitative methods, with one having more weightage over the other. While planning 
studies over multiple phases, concurrent and sequential methods are executed over the 
multiple phases of the study with the results of one phase cascading inputs to the next 
phase. Such a design is called the multiphase design (Desalos, et al., 2020) .

2.3. Added value of mixed methods
The mixed methods research plays an important role as the results obtained from mixed 
methods offsets the individual weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research and 
provides better understanding of the research problems. Additionally, it provides more 
evidence for answering a broad array of research questions using different methods and 
not restricting to one single method. Complementarity of results (results from one method 
to be combined with other), alignment in methodical development (use results of one 
method assist other method) and expansion of analysis (enhancing the inquiry dimensions) 
help researchers to distil the most informative results(Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989).
For evaluation of multi component programs, usually strong statistical designs such as 
RCTs and quasi-experimental designs often miss out on addressing the complexities of 
multi-component programmes. Qualitative methods when integrated with quantitative 
approaches help in providing deeper analysis of the issues at different levels. Further, mixed 
methods approach uses the same sampling frame to generate both large representative 
quantitative survey samples as well as small but representative samples for qualitative 
analysis (Bamberger, 2012). This allows for understanding the complex interplay of the 
findings from quantitative and qualitative methods across the multiple levels of the 
programme. 
Secondly, strong designs are inflexible as they are applied on the same sample, with 
the same data collection instruments for measuring the same indicators across project 
implementation lifecycle (before, during and after). This makes them much less effective in 
monitoring and learning through real time doing. Most of the projects are not implemented 
as planned like definition of target population, changes in control group composition etc. 
Hence evaluation design must be flexible to adjust to changes. Here comes the additional 
value of rapid and quick feedback techniques provided by mixed method approach; thereby 
bringing in agility.
Quantitative methods attempt to identify and isolate specific variables (seeking correlation, 
relationships, causality) of the study. On the other hand, qualitative design bring focus 
on abstract constructs (fore.g.- beliefs, perceptions, institutional dynamics etc), which 
inherently requires a scale to be prepared (difficult to quantify through administrative data), 
but are key to fundamentally decipher the program outcomes. Let’s understand this by an 
example: change in farmers income, crop yield are outcomes that are provided through 
quantitative methods. The reason behind increase in farmers income and crop yield due 
to adoption of the latest technology method via farmers organization is not reflected in 
the quantitative approach. On the contrary, qualitative methods will explain the social 
political relationship -why different types of farmers join and what different technologies 
were adopted which led to increase in income and crop yield. And, to understand whether 
the farmers will be able to generate the intended outcome under different circumstances. 
Hence, the quantitative survey is reflecting increase in income and farmers produce but not 
able to explain the reason behind increase in income and produce of the farmer. Similarly, 
the qualitative method helps us in understanding what different technologies were adopted 
and will they be able to generate the same outcomes despite the circumstances.

2.4. Towards fully integrated mixed method approach to evaluations
Fully integrated mixed methods research requires the integration and independent use of 
qualitative and quantitative methods throughout study from data collection and analysis. 
Further, a fully integrated mixed method approach does not privilege one approach over 
another (quantitative over qualitative or vice versa) but employs designs to leverage 
the strength of each approach to evaluate the outcomes and impact of the programme 
(Burch &Heinrich, 2016). Thus, in a fully integrated mixed method design, qualitative and 
quantitative methods are leveraged at each stage of the study right from inception phase 
of the study to design, data collection, and analysis. 
During the evaluation inception stage, qualitative and quantitative methods can aid in 
finalization of the research questions. Qualitative methods can help in fine-tuning the 
research questions/objectives of the study, while quantitative methods can help in 
formulating research questions through analysis of secondary data. Literature of mixed 
method approach classifies qualitative research as inductive and quantitative research as 
deductive, and integrating both at the evaluation formulation stage helps in refinement of 
objectives of the evaluation study by leveraging the findings from each of the methods. 
During the design stage, while exploring the secondary data plays a significant role in 
identifying historical trends and building plausible conjecture, qualitative data can aid in 
identifying anomalies and outliers in the data, and decoding the reasons behind certain 
patterns observed in the quantitative analysis. Appropriate inputs at the design stage assist 
in identifying the blind spots, reducing error in the econometric equation, and addressing 
the problem of endogeneity.
During the data collection stage, quantitative methods involve standardized numerical data 
collection that help in capturing trends across time and socio-economic groups. On the 
other hand, qualitative methods utilize less structured data collection methods that makes 
studying complexities, issues, process and behaviors in greater detail. 
At the data analysis stage, quantitative methods infer statistical associations and qualitative 
methods help in understanding the reasons behind these associations. Quantitative 
methods can also help in understanding the representativeness of the beneficiaries in the 
qualitative method adopted under the evaluation study.
Appropriate implementation and analysis of data through mixed methods, can help in 
identifying causal, mediating, and moderating variables along with their relative weight 
towards the impact and thus helping in identifying causal, mediating and moderating 
variables along with their weight towards the impact. 
3. Challenges of Mixed-Method Approach
Information from both methods can be combined to explore the different perspectives 
and dimensions of a common research question, Mixed method is not void of associated 
practical difficulties and challenges.
<<<PAGE=123>>>
Mixed Methods in Evaluation: Going Beyond “Causality” to Understand the “Why” and “How” 
109
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
The difficulty that is posed in combining quantitative and qualitative research primarily 
roots from the difference in the epistemological and philosophical frameworks that guide 
the two approaches. 
Many argue that both research methods have different assumptions towards addressing 
problem statement which makes it imperative to look at the findings from these approaches 
distinctly (Dootson, 1995)(Risjord, Sandra, & Margaret, 2002) (Salehi & Golafshani, 2010)
A major challenge for researchers is to decide the weight attribution for quantitative and 
qualitative information, whether the study would be dominated by one of the approaches 
and its assumptions (quantitative or qualitative), or consider equal weightage for both 
quantitative and qualitative approaches (Almalki, 2016). Deciding on the design for the 
study is a critical aspect that requires due deliberation by the researcher to make sure 
that all research questions are answered comprehensively.
Having mixed methods for data collection and analysis require, more time and expertise, 
which in turn making it not only time consuming but also expensive (Tariq & Woodman, 
2013).
4. Opportunities
In spite of challenges, the growing interest in the mixed method reflects importance for 
strengthening the use of mixed methods in evaluation. Effective monitoring systems are 
a key for effective implementation as well as evaluation. Currently much less thought has 
been gone in designing of the monitoring systems as compared to different methods used 
in evaluations for measuring impact. Mixed methods aid in customized data collection for 
particular program and provides information which can be easily contextualized which 
proves to be helpful in designing of the monitoring systems.
Secondly, a lot of focus is given by the Economist on strong statistical designs which have 
their own set of limitations, i.e., it can only be applied in a small number of development 
evaluations. Currently, a lot of literature reviews haven’t been done on strengthening of 
evaluation designs for the majority of the evaluations. This provides the opportunity for 
Mixed method designs to address this challenge with a cost-effective approach.
A third area of opportunity is to develop an alternative to the conventional statistical 
counterfactual. Techniques such as qualitative group consultation methodologies - 
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) to obtain beneficiaries perception on concept map, 
causality and theory of change are still at a very nascent stage and no other alternative 
to counterfactual have been found. This is a niche for mixed methods.
There are a number of other opportunities like refining approaches to mixed method 
sampling, reconstructing of baseline data, incorporation contextual framework and analysis 
into strong statistical designs, demand for new evaluation methods which are more flexible 
to cater complex programs. These are numerous areas where mixed methods can make 
a valuable contribution.

5. Conclusion
Mixed method research in the evaluation context provides an avenue to leverage strengths 
of both methodical approaches to more holistically assess the policy/program performance 
and impact. Across the literature, mixed method designs have been tailored on aspects 
such as weightage given to the quantitative and qualitative methods and whether the 
two methods would be implemented parallelly or sequentially, based on the need of the 
evaluation study. With the growing recognition of mixed method approaches in policy/
programme evaluation, there has been a greater focus on fully integrated mixed method 
approach, which integrates both methods with an equal priority, thereby enhancing the 
studies’ credibility and its relevance to stakeholders. However, mixed methods research 
has its challenges. Complexity in designing of the study, enhanced data collection efforts, 
requirement of both qualitative and quantitative experts, all leading to increased cost 
and time for execution of the study are some of the challenges that evaluators face 
while adopting the mixed methods approach. Maintaining agility, mixed method approach 
poses exciting opportunities for the future to refine different approaches of sampling, to 
incorporate contextual framework and analysis and robust statistical designs for complex 
programmes.

Abstract
With proliferation of technology and innovation, the creation and consumption of data 
has been growing at an unprecedented rate. Data-driven innovation can be transformative, 
as it provides plethora of opportunities to improve decision-making make more informed 
policies and strengthen economies by reducing waste and improving services. Data can 
improve social and economic outcomes, if used for generating evidence during formulating 
policies. So far improving governance, through the concept of e-Governance, has been the 
focus of technology utilization in public administration. However, use of big data can alter 
the pace of development. Appropriate policies and technologies must be structured to 
appropriately leverage big data. This paper aims to articulate “How can public sector use 
big data more efficiently and effectively”? Supported by policy cycle as a model this paper 
explores, how evidence-based policy making could be more efficient and effective by use 
of Big Data. It attempts to articulate a holistic process addressing issues of technology, 
citizen, and users, which often are moderated by culture and governance. 
1. Introduction
Applications driven by development in technology and the advancement of mobile 
communications has generated a “data gold mine” (Kernaghan, 2014). Telecommunications, 
along with advancements in cloud computing and storage techniques has boosted Big 
Data adoption. In line with development scientific paradigms have also evolved through 
empirical science, theoretical science, and computational science. Now we are at the stage 
of data-intensive science - the latest approach to discover knowledge or extracting value 
through derivative of technology- Data (Chen et al, 2014; Chen & Zhang,2014). Usage of 
data can generate economic and social value far beyond anticipation.
So far, in the Governments, improving governance, through the concept of e-Governance, 
has been the technology focus in public administration. Referring to Janssen and Kuk 
(2016). Governments can also leverage such techniques to enhance accuracy, efficiency, 
speed of policy formulation and implementation, and evaluation of such interventions 
through analytics. Yet real value of data is not fully exploited for public policy(Gamage, 
2016). We need data-driven innovation that is transformative and has the potential not 
only to make more informed policies but also to provide appropriate and applicable public 
services for the disadvantaged class (Manzoni, 2018). What are the areas where big data 
and related methodologies can be applied to enhance public administration and plausible 
approach for execution can be explored?
Based on policy cycle model this paper explores, how evidence-based policymaking can 
be optimized by data. The paper further aims to build a plausible approach that could be 
further optimized and institutionalized to enable use of Big Data in public policy making 
could be supported and promoted using Big Data and its application.

2. Data Sources 
Data sources can be classified based on original intent of data collection and data source. 
It can be sorted using a 2-dimensional framework as shown in figure 1.0.(WDR 2021). 
One dimension classifies data based on original intent - public or commercial purposes. 
Traditional as well as new age data collected for commercial use is classified as Private 
Intent Data; Similarly, data collected for public intent, irrespective of method or instrument 
is classified as “ Public Intent Data”. By design, public data can be focused on purpose 
of its application and may be a representative of population; while private data may have 
a self-selection bias, OTT platform data might be more incidental than representative of 
population. 
The second dimension represents methodologies - “traditional” Vs “new” methods.

2.1. Public Intent Data
This comprises of typically traditional data types- censuses and surveys, although geospatial 
have become more prevalent. Government data collection is for policy. Collection of public 
data via traditional methods being costly and time consuming, frequency of collection 
is reduced. Many a times the dimensions do not capture dimensions and nuances of 
subpopulations and micro segments. But traditional public intent data is more representative 
of population and less self-selection bias making them more affable to government officials. 
There are 6 different type of public intent data;
  Administrative generated—Administrative Data refers to data sets originating 
from transactional purposes. It is not designed with research as an objective. 
e.g. of same is Mortality record, transaction records such as GSTN. Administrative 
data can often be collected unobtrusively and non-reactively, so the challenges 
of ‘faking’ survey responses is minimal.
  Censuses, is aimed at recording information about an entire population. It can be 
aimed at individuals or business or be agriculture focused. For e.g., population 
and housing censuses 
  Sample surveys - drawn to be representative of the entire population, using 
appropriate sampling technique.

  Citizen-generated data– Generated by individuals. Primarily focused in solving 
issues faced by citizen. This data, can provide significant value in solving citizen 
centric issues. Geospatial data can be enriched by combining with citizen 
generated data.
  Machine- data automatically generated by an IOT device. E.g.- Air pollution 
monitor. 
  Geospatial - It primarily is satellite imagery data, providing information based on 
their geographic locale. With progress of technology, drone data is also adding 
significant value.
These data types are not mutually exclusive but each gives a different dimension of the 
variable. Every data point can then be represented with reference to time, space or person. 
Various data sources can be linked together through common identifier.
2.2. Private intent data 
Private intent data are often, associated with digital tools and application. Though it lacks 
representativeness of whole population, this data has far greater frequency, granularity as 
compared to Public Intent data. Private intent data collected through wireless devices such 
as mobile phones, etc., provides geolocation information, which the conventional methods 
of public intent data collected through survey just cannot provide.
Everything a digital user does- call, text, search, leave a post, make a transaction, or accept 
services terms and conditions leaves a trail, which is called as a digital footprint.
The footprints can also be passively collected by tracing IP address and search history. 
Digital residuals have exceedingly high frequency and microgranularity, enabling to insights, 
inferences and understand characteristics at an individual level. Mobile network data is one 
of high velocity data providing information on behavior, attitude and location. Call Detail 
records (CDR) is intended to use for billing, it can be repurposed for behavior, attitude, 
and mobility patterns. Firms which rely on data, such as e-commerce or social media firms, 
additionally generate behavioral patterns. Combining, variables can assist in prediction of 
economic and social status and of behavior pattern. For example, having an Apple phone 
is correlated with top income quartile in US. Similarly., time of purchase on e-commerce 
has a correlation with default propensity.
Data residuals have big data characteristics. Various definitions of Big Data exist in literature. 
Initial literature speaks about “Three Vs”, i.e., “Volume” representing size of data, “Velocity” 
represents data accrual pace and “Variety” representing dimensions of data (Jordan, 2014; 
Kitchin & Lauriault,2014; Laney 2001). Subsequently, 3 more characteristics for explaining 
certain features of Big Data were added i.e., “Veracity” - data quality, “Variability” - variation 
in data, and importantly “Value” - the potential hidden intrinsic value (IDC, 2012; White, 
2012). Big data is classified in four ways: 1. Structured. 2. Unstructured 3. Semi-structured 
and 4. Quasi-structured.

3. Policy Cycle and Big Data
Government can move beyond e-Government and e-Governance, by transforming policy 
making approach and cycle. Big data can optimize the classical approach of policy cycle 
by reducing elapsed time by continuous evaluation, rather than end of cycle impact 
assessment (Johann Höchtl et al 2016)
The policy cycle is composed of mainly 3 steps - Formulation, Implementation, and 
Evaluation (Wegrich and Jann 2007). Utilization of Big Data can optimize the policy cycle 
by bringing efficiency and effectiveness in policy formulation, execution, and evaluation 
(see Figure 2). Policies can be more relevant, focused, and customized.

3.1. Policy Formulation
Big Data, through use of social media and network can be more participative and 
collaborative in identifying priorities and formulating policies. (Dsouza & Bhagwatwar, 
2012). Data points from social media can indicate preferences towards a particular policy, 
to set agenda. Big Data provides opportunity to leverage various sources for identification 
of issues and problems, and formulate an efficient and effective policy approach (Williams, 
2014). 
Information can support open policy discussions and debate, ushering efficiency 
implementation. In policy formulation, Big Data can help in building ‘what if’ scenarios 
to predict possible outcome (Cook, 2014). The high velocity of data enabled by social 
media and supported by digital arenas such as online consultation, virtual meet, enables 
policymakers to quickly respond and not depend on traditional channels of feedback which 
are time consuming (Hochtl et al, 2016; Mergel, 2017).
3.2. Policy Implementation
A more transparent, efficient and effective allocation and provision of resources can be 
done by identifying patterns in data. This will facilitate a goal oriented, output - outcome 
focused budgeting process .and the structuring a framework that could appropriately focus 
and priorities resources. It could enable the identification of hidden patterns and enables 
us to identify pathways to research difficult to reach citizens as well as detect irregularities 
during implementation (Maciejewski, 2017).
3.3. Real-time time Evaluation
Evaluation can be done instantaneously or near-instantaneously. This enables continuous 
evaluation as opposed to end of policy cycle evaluation; this approach is also termed as 
e-Policy (Höchtl J et al, 2016).

However, data governance across departments and ministries is an imperative, so is cross-
organizational collaboration are imperative (Penchava et al, 2020; Desouza and Jacob, 2017).

4. Connecting Data for Development 
Materializing the points mentioned in the above sections are contingent upon availability 
of quality and granular data which is representative of the population being targeted. 
Public and Private intent data have their own merits and demerits; however, they have 
complementarities, which can be used jointly leveraged during analysis. For e.g. - A Health 
Ministry would better formulate a policy if it has data from Rural, Woman and Child 
Development ministries as well as from public and private health providers.
For this purpose, an Integrated National Data System designed is to be formulated. 
Governance system defines rules – dos and don’ts, while Integrated National Data System 
(INDS) can be envisioned as connectivity with provision to ensure data security. For INDS 
to be successful, all participants and stakeholders must align. INDS does not mean an 
integrated national database or a centralized governance structure. It is an ecosystem, 
wherein the data can be accessed, shared, used, and reused for the larger public good.
The conceptual framework links data to development (Figure 4). Data is contributed by 
government administrative systems or private sector platforms driven by technology. 
Data can be processed by various participant entities, for public policy analysis, primarily 
Government entities which happen to be the primary producers of public intent data as 
well. Civil society and Citizens play a role as the producers’ data, but the role of private 
sector is also critical. They are data fiduciary, an important entity in the value chain to 
contribute data production in the national data system. Academica support and build 
programs for the analysis of data and policy suggestions. To manage this ecosystem, it is 
imperative, to set out norms and have an integrated framework of infrastructure policies, 
open data laws, appropriate information legislation, and policies. Often cited is how the 
policy framework can address the issues and challenges of data security and privacy.

In this context of integrated framework, addressing personal and organizational privacy is 
important. Personal data points might permit connecting seemingly unrelated data points 
to provide hidden patterns; however, it is imperative not to undermine citizen’s privacy. 
Techniques such as anonymizing data or informed consent can address challenges posed 
by data privacy (Penchava et al, 2020). Another important point is data security. The high 
volume of data might make it susceptible to cyber attach and cybercriminals.
To balance the use of data, there is a need to create a new social contract which provides 
equitable access, and is based on trust among participants. Government, civil society, 
academia and businesses must align to ensure safe, secure use of data for public good. 
(WDR, 2021)
A social contract is not new. EU’s GDPR, and US Fair Information Principles aim at laws 
regarding govern data creation and protection. However, social contract in WDR 2021 has 
even enhanced framework. Data-creating and data-using parties must collaborate and have 
a safe secure framework to do so. Entities could be business, government or individuals. 
Social contract should enable appropriate reuse of data creating value in the process. 
A coherent planned effort is required to improve data governance as well as align with 
international principals through multi-lateral cooperation.
5. Illustrative India Policy Use Case
Empowerment has become a central theme of many programs and schemes across 
governments aimed to development. Opportunities lead to more choices. Empowerment 
can be said as a multi-dimensional concept and implies wherein people have freedom 
of expression and of exercising her choice to shape her life in all spheres of relevance. 
Economic freedom, freedom to transact and participate in economy. (Sen,81; Mandal, 2013). 
Different studies have measured empowerment differently, one measures actively used 
labour force participation and financial wellbeing, (Assad et all, 2014 , Haque, Zulfiqar, 
2016). A strong correlation exists between empowerment and development of economy. 
Higher participation in workforce, leads to higher is the economic development (Duflo, 
2012). Labour markets differ based on markets. Mature markets are more non-agricultural 
sector while emerging markets are more agrarian in nature. In developed economies vast 
majority of workers are formal wage and salary earners, while in emerging market it is of 
self-employment (Rustagi, 2011). 
There are some challenges to foster entrepreneurship in developing countries. Citizens 
are more constrained in economic initiatives by access to credit and infrastructure 
(Banerjee and Duflo 2007). Agency theory posits credit access is constrained by lack of 
information or rather asymmetric information availability coupled with perceived conflicting 
interest between financial institute and lender (Berger et al.,2001; Mason and Stark,2004). 
Credit hinged on transactional data is limited (Altman et al,2020; Van Caneghem&Van 
Campenhout,2012). Even in the Indian context, it can be very seen, there is a granger 
causality between digital transaction credit access (Chi Value 6.77 and P value 0.034).

Digital payments play a significant and important role in providing avenues to transact, 
(Pal et all, 2020), which leads to “economic facility” required for development (Jacob 
2016, Sen 2001, Pal, 2020). To have access to credit, which leads to economic wellbeing, 
one of the key drivers is Digital transactions, which in turn is a function of infrastructure, 
ecosystem, financial literacy, and digital financial literacy. Clearly digital transactions are 
a lead indicator of impending credit access. Digital and mobile payments is also leads to 
social and health empowerment, which again leads to economic empowerment.
Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) was launched in 2008 
by merging the two schemes namely Prime Minister’s Rojgar Yojana (PMRY) and Rural 
Employment Generation Programme (REGP). The goal of the scheme is to generate 
employment opportunities through entrepreneurship. The Scheme envisages credit linked 
subsidy to setup and upgrade new micro enterprises in non-farm sector. Total actual 
expenditure for 2020-21 was INR1905Cr.

PMEP, which aids microentrepreneurs’ success; can be optimized by looking at digital 
payment data as well as mobility data. A confluence of administrative data, public sector 
data and private sector data will help us focus appropriate execution by prioritizing districts, 
sub- segments (segment profile) and financial institutions in that area. These exercises 
will not only help in accelerating growth, but also assist the financial institutions achieve 
appropriate level of profitability. It can provide, government as well as NGO to focus on 
areas of capacity building to ensure success of the intervention scheme.
6. Conclusion
There are complex issues to be considered when Big Data is studied concerning the 
public sector. This paper focuses on efficient and effective use of Big Data for public 
policymaking. It attempts to develop a holistic and systematic approach in leveraging 
big data technology for evidence-based policy making. To have access as well as the 
ability to process data, it is imperative for a national framework, which alleviates risks as 
well as protects citizens from infringement of personal privacy. Appropriate supporting 
technology infrastructure, appropriate policies and regulations are needed to create trust 
in data systems.
The proposed approach can be said as a starting point to build a detailed framework, which 
is not just comprehensive but also flexible and agile. Future research can investigate other 
factors that may influence the effectiveness of big data in policy making and incorporate 
it into the framework. Capital, land, and labor are inputs to development, but data allow 
us to make these inputs focused and drive efficiency. However, unlike other assets such 
as capital, value of data does not diminish on usage, in fact derivate of data adds more 
value and can be repurposed.

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
Abstract
India has come a fair distance over the last 75 years in its efforts to improve quality of life of 
its citizens through growth and development. The evidence of impact created and lessons 
learnt could now be leveraged for enabling coherence to accelerate movement towards 
collective aspirations and national goals. Multi-sectoral collaboration can help unlock these 
synergies and solve “wicked problems” that cannot be achieved by isolated capabilities. 
One approach in achieving this is by inter-linking various data portals/dashboards used 
in tracking impact of Centre and States schemes. Another method can be where private 
sector contributes to these efforts by sharing data with the Government as well as provide 
solutions by utilizing anonymized administrative data and surveys available in public domain. 
India’s ability to break information silos to meet these goals will pave the way to a new 
phase of equitable, efficient, effective and sustainable resource utilization and could be 
the key driver of Amrit Kaal.
1. Background
The end goal of any government program or scheme is to improve the quality of life of 
its citizens. Quality of life (QoL), even though very subjective, includes many domains of 
an individual’s life like education, physical health, mental health, opportunities to work, 
housing, school, level of resources, among others 21. Hence, to improve overall QoL, it is 
important to devise strategies to target these essential domains22. Government schemes (or 
programs) aiming to improve QoL or a particular aspect of it, tend to overlap in terms of 
their objectives and impact they expect to create as these may be spread across various 
departments or ministries requiring coordination and collaboration among all of them at 
different levels. The ideal approach may be for such agencies to work across portfolio 
boundaries, formally and informally, to achieve a shared goal and an integrated government 
response to particular issues to improve effectiveness and efficiency. However, the division 
of work among Ministries/Departments and the traditional ways of working makes this 
coordination and coherence difficult to achieve. Coherence for efficient allocation of 
resources to various projects and complementarity in efforts of various stakeholders, both 
public and private, is key to sustainable development. 
The SDG 17 - Partnerships for the goals – emphasizes multi-sectoral collaboration as one 
of the approaches for achieving coherence. Multi-Sectoral Collaboration (MSC) means 
multiple stakeholders and sectors intentionally coming together and collaborating in a 
managed process to achieve shared outcomes and common goals23. For example, progress 
on Goal 14, involving sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources, will 
require integrated effort on a range of fronts, from reducing phosphates and agricultural 
runoff to improving sewerage and wastewater treatment to curtailing plastic waste in the

Figure 1 shows the network analysis of SDG goals for the achievement of SDG target 3.6 
to halve the number of fatalities from road accidents involving coordination between the 
traffic police, road transport engineers, ambulance services and emergency care providers, 
as well as educators, automobile manufacturers, and drivers themselves. This figure provides 
a compelling case for establishing effective collaboration and coordination. 
The relevance of MSC is also underlined by the recent addition of a criterion - coherence 
- to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Development 
Assistance Committee (DAC) list of evaluation criteria 24. Internal coherence addresses 
the synergies and inter-linkages between various interventions carried out by the same 
institution/government, as well as the consistency of the intervention with the relevant 
international norms and standards to which that institution/government adheres. External 
coherence considers the consistency of the intervention with other actors’ interventions in 
the same context. This includes complementarity, harmonization, coordination with others, 
and the extent to which the intervention is adding value while avoiding duplication of effort.

The need for breaking informational silos between ministries and departments has also 
been identified in the existing literature. The absence of effective coordination mechanisms 
can lead to suboptimal decisions made on the basis of inaccurate, biased, or incomplete 
information. It generates avoidable waste and duplication of effort among agencies. Poor 
coordination can create additional compliance burdens on citizens by forcing them to 
invest time, effort, and energy fulfilling similar requirements with different government

agencies because of a lack of inter-agency information sharing. Additionally, it may lead to 
delays in the decision-making process, poor and ineffective service delivery, and sometimes 
results in failure of the program resulting in huge costs to the government and citizens
The coordination and complementarity between the Centre and the States, under the 
Indian federal system could be much more effective, efficient and sustainable if the focus 
on benefits for the citizen for a better quality of life could be directed with a clear, 
objective, reliable set of measures and indicators that can be utilized to monitor efforts 
of the local, state and central governments progressively in close to real time.
2. Coherence in Monitoring
Any project’s lifecycle can be broadly categorized into 4 stages: Planning, Implementation 
and Monitoring, and Evaluation. Monitoring assesses the progress made against the outputs 
and outcomes identified to achieve the stated objectives of the project and is helpful in 
bringing up any bottlenecks or unintended consequences occurring when implementing 
the project along with identifying if the progress and development achieved are sustainable 
or not. 
Studies have shown that a project, which was perceived to be successful but fails to 
translate into changes envisaged, continues to be scaled up because a sound monitoring 
system to assess the progress, was not in place. In case a robust monitoring system was 
present, it could have saved valuable resources 25. On the other hand, Murlidharan et al 
(2017) showed that improved top-down administration monitoring may have a substantial 
impact on improving outcomes such as a reduction in unauthorized teachers’ absence. 
Thus, having a sound monitoring mechanism in place, is crucial to ensure success of any 
project. 
Some of the tools which is being used by Ministries/Departments to monitor key 
performance indicators (KPIs) for decision-making purposes are Management Information 
Systems (MIS) and dashboards. However, these MIS systems and dashboards often don’t 
talk to each other and work in silos even though many of these KPIs overlap with each 
other. Chapter 1 of Volume 1 of India’s Economic Survey of 2018-19  recognizes that data 
maintained by Government is dispersed across registries maintained by various Ministries 
and that a better experience can be delivered by bringing these datasets together. It 
highlights that doing so, will also help in reducing targeting error in welfare schemes using 
an example of an individual who is affluent enough to buy a car but is able to avail Below 
Poverty Line (BPL) welfare schemes, though unwarranted. 
Considering the amount of data generated by the Government both at the Central and 
State levels, sharing this data efficiently across boundaries is one of the low-hanging fruits 
and can significantly improve governance. The background note on draft version of the 
India Data Accessibility and Use policy, released recently by Ministry of Electronics and 
Information Technology (MeitY) resonates with us.

With increasing digitization and engagement, the volume of 
data is also increasing exponentially, providing opportunities 
for better governance, service delivery and innovation in 
sectors critical for societal transformation
Physical silos might be harder to break but virtual integration by breaking information 
silos is much more achievable, and the necessary first step. 
3. Multi-sectoral Collaboration
Importance of breaking down silos using data and technology is well understood by Ministries 
and Departments in India, which has resulted into several multi-sectoral collaboration 
initiatives. India-WRIS, for example, hosts data and information on the country’s surface 
and groundwater resources as well as on water quality. This ‘Single Window’ updates 
data in real time based on the information received by various stakeholders like States/
UTs and can be accessed by anyone in a standardized national GIS framework26. It allows 
users to search, access, visualize, understand and analyze comprehensive water data for 
assessment, monitoring, planning and development of water resources.
The 2030 SDG agenda sets the stage to accelerate adoption of modern approaches 
for private sector engagement and reevaluate the traditional public-private partnership. 
Indian government also identifies the importance of private players’ technical expertise for 
effective implementation of new schemes and initiatives involving data. One such example 
is of Google Earth Outreach’s Application Programming Interface (API) that provides 
nonprofits and the public sector with geospatial data and analytic tools for analysis as 
well as to help developers generate new tools and insights. This is used by organizations 
such as Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment to provide information 
related to forests to stakeholders including policymakers to protect tigers and elephants 
in forest reservations in India.

While a beginning has been made, there is an urgent need to enhance coherence in the life 
cycle of projects and interventions, especially at monitoring stage by unlocking synergies 
which will lead to improved service-delivery.

3.1 Using APIs to strengthen Intergovernmental Data Sharing
Strengthening intergovernmental data sharing is one of the foundational stones to bring 
internal coherence in monitoring. One of the mechanisms to achieve this is by improving 
the interoperability of MIS and dashboards by enabling Application Programming Interface 
(API) integration across such systems. API is any mechanism that allows a system or service 
to access data or functionality provided by another system or service API integration 
This will help in leveraging data collected, processed, and analyzed by various Ministries/
Departments resulting in a faster and more efficient decision-making process. A case in 
point is PM Gati Shakti – National Master Plan for Multi-Modal Connectivity, a digital platform 
that brings 16 Ministries together for integrated planning and coordinating infrastructure 
connectivity projects. The data exchange among all mode operators will be brought on 
the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP), designed for API and will be helpful in 
implementing and monitoring the project. 
The “ Policy on Open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for Government of 
India” brought out in 2015 by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) 
encourages the formal use of Open APIs in Government Organizations to provide right 
information to the right user at the right time. This policy defines open API as the API 
which has been exposed to enable other systems to interact with that system and wherever 
possible, may be free of charge and without restrictions for reuse and modifications. 
To assist Ministries/Departments in developing, implementing and consuming APIs, MeitY 
released guidelines in 2020. Further, to fillip efforts in implementing the policy, a platform 
which acts as an API marketplace as well as a directory was initiated in 2020. API Setu 
aims to bring all APIs under one roof for various stakeholders including government 
departments. The platform currently provides access to about 973 APIs for various services 
such as Driving License, Vehicle Registration, PAN etc. 
Moreover, these API linkages can significantly bring down the number of times a citizen 
has to login into different portals when engaging with government services. One such 
example is UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance), which is a single 
platform for all Indian citizens to access pan India e-gov services ranging from Central to 
Local Government bodies. As of January 2022, 1,417 government services are available on 
the app ranging from Transport to Public Grievances to Education. Additionally, it provides 
seamless integration with customer-centric services such as Aadhaar and DigiLocker. Such 
initiatives reduce duplication of data and wastage of efforts and resources.
Draft of India Data Accessibility and Use Policy also talks about the integration of all data 
portals/dashboards of Ministries/Departments through APIs.
3.2 Data collaboratives: Collaboration of Government and Private Sector to 
exchange data
Data Collaboratives or data-driven partnerships are defined as cross-sector (and public/
private) collaboration initiatives aimed at data collection, sharing or processing for
<<<PAGE=147>>>
Enabling Coherence in Monitoring by Breaking Informational Silos
133
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
the purpose of addressing a social change 27. Many studies reports, while traditionally 
governments have used Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to build hard and tangible 
infrastructure such as roads, institutions, they are now increasingly moving towards PPPs 
for soft issues such as education. Klievink and Bram (2018) notes that bringing together 
different goals and technical know-how of various partners helps in addressing some 
of the ‘wicked’ problems such as climate change. For example, The Data for Children 
Collaborative is a joint partnership between UNICEF, the Scottish Government and the 
University of Edinburgh’s Data Driven Innovation Programme. The initiative provides a 
platform to draw on the strengths of each partner to solve problems using data and aims 
to enable improvement in outcomes for every child. 
Often, these problems are too complex to be solved by one societal actor and their 
magnitude is too big to estimate cause-effect relations. This method of external coherence 
not only helps the public bodies to use data from private sector for better policy 
interventions but also helps private players to foster innovation, entrepreneurship and 
ensure future progress of an economy. For example, government can benefit from data 
from commercial satellites to develop better climate prediction models and on the other 
hand, private sector players can benefit from healthcare-related data received from the 
government which helps them strategize their research and development in a profitable 
direction. 
These data collaboratives have been useful in enhancing monitoring systems in times of crisis 
too. When Nepal was hit by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in 2015 affecting approximately 8 
million people, changes in mobility patterns identified by SIM card movements were used 
to identify areas where food and other essentials were needed. SIM card movement data 
was provided by mobile network providers to a non-profit organization for analysis. It 
undertook a comprehensive analysis of post-earthquake population movement trends and 
shared the same with the humanitarian community, such as UN’s World Food Programme, 
in less than two weeks after the earthquake which further helped in targeting the people 
who were affected the most28.
Another example demonstrating how data collaborative can be helpful comes from 
Indonesia. Global Fishing Watch (GFW), a non-profit organization founded in 2015 
through collaboration between 3 partners: Oceana, an international ocean conservation 
organization; SkyTruth, a technology firm that uses satellite imagery and data; and Google, 
with an objective of advancing ocean governance by creating and publicly sharing map 
visualizations, data and analysis tools to enable scientific research and drive transformation. 
They partnered with Indonesian government to help them repress illegal fishing activity. 
This collaboration resulted into insights and actions leading to decrease in foreign fishing 
in its waters by 90% and total fishing by 25% 29.

Considering the shift towards creating a ‘data-driven economy’, the policymakers in India 
also need to explore and experiment with these new methods of partnerships in the form 
of data collaboratives for better coherence in monitoring. However, government has started 
taking steps in the right direction by launching India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX) platform.
3 .2 .1 IUDX: Unleashing the Power of Data for Public Good
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) launched IUDX platform, an open-source 
software platform that serves as a seamless interface for data providers and data users, 
including ULBs, to share, request, and access datasets related to cities, urban governance, 
and urban service delivery. It is developed in partnership between the Smart Cities 
Mission and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. It can be a helpful asset for 
effective monitoring as it ensures data aggregation and standardization by collecting data 
from different silos and presenting them in a single compatible form. It also provides a 
standardized model by allowing data generated in different forms to be translated into a 
common format that can be understood easily. Effective utilization of the IUDX platform 
will be beneficial for improving quality of life in urban cities through the power of new 
data-driven services. Additionally, the public and private sector players can also leverage 
this ecosystem to create innovative solutions from IUDX-obtained data.
Box 1: Use cases of IUDX: Pune Smart City – Improving City Safety 
and Night Travel
Pune has created a phone-based app, where people will be able to plan trips while 
taking safety considerations into account and avoiding unsafe areas/streets. Citizens, 
public transport, and law enforcement agencies are the intended customers of this 
application, where the safety index for the streets/places will be identified based on a 
variety of road safety parameters. For this the datasets will be collected in the form 
of location wise reported crime data, surveillance camera feeds, street light locations/
status, number of people on the street, and crowdsourced ‘feeling’ data. Some of the 
features of the project are: 
  Safety index computed using an algorithm based on various data sources 
such as street light status, crowds, gender diversity, etc 
  Incorporation of Safety Index into IUDX for use in navigation and other 
services 
  Real time updates of safety index based on IUDX data 
  Use of analytics on IUDX data to derive safety parameters 
  Integration with navigational apps or tourist guides

4. Way forward
When we look at the monitoring systems and frameworks of the Centre and states, 
prima facie it can be said that, substantial efforts and resources are being put into it at 
various levels. It is the quality, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and timeliness of these 
efforts that could be significantly improved upon for sustainable results and quick course 
corrections as per needs. 
Over the past few years, India has transitioned to become a data-driven economy and 
realized the potential of data as a limitless resource that can fuel innovation and growth. 
We have seen valuable use-cases of data being able to support effective last mile delivery 
but it is also important to understand that these initiatives and interventions cannot take 
place in silos. There is a need to adopt multi-sectoral collaboration to break down the 
existing barriers using data and technology.
As highlighted by UN e-Governance Survey, key blocks to achieve coherence are the 
Whole-of-Government approach and policy integration which will help transgress sectoral 
barriers. In this context, a working group on National Enterprise Architecture by the Ministry 
of Electronics and IT developed an India Enterprise Architecture (IndEA) framework. The 
framework envisions to treat Government as One Government, wherein everything is 
functionally inter-related and can facilitate a boundary-less information flow for delivery 
of services efficiently. Adoption of this framework can lead to Whole-of-Government 
Architecture for India, Ministries, and States.
<<<PAGE=150>>>
Enabling Coherence in Monitoring by Breaking Informational Silos
136
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
Multi-sectoral collaboration through APIs adoption will be essential to strengthen 
Intergovernmental data sharing going forward. India has already taken a step towards 
this by issuing “Policy on Open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)”. Benefits of 
this can only be accrued through timely adoption of this policy and its guidelines by 
concerned stakeholders. Government’s role here is to raise awareness and build capacities 
to assimilate the significance of such internal coherence in monitoring. 
In addition, to support the Open Data initiative of the government under the provisions 
of the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), a platform was developed 
- Open Government Data (OGD)  - to be used by Ministries/Departments and their 
organizations to publish datasets, documents, services, tools and applications collected by 
them for public use. It intends to increase transparency in the functioning of Government 
and open avenues for many more innovative uses of Government Data to give different 
perspectives. Enforcing guidelines of NDSAP and developing mechanisms to ensure timely 
update of data will strengthen the ecosystem for open data sharing in India and will reduce 
duplication of data and wastage of resources for monitoring purposes. Opening data to 
citizens and private sector, through the platform, will help in unlocking untapped potential 
to collect and share data for efficient service delivery.
Indian policymakers can also benefit by reviewing guidelines and recommendations 
released by international development organizations. For example, OECD has released 
Recommendation on Enhancing Access to and Sharing of Data (EASD) which is the first 
internationally agreed-upon set of principles and policy guidance on how governments can 
maximize the cross-sectoral benefits of all types of data – personal, non-personal, open, 
proprietary, public and private – while protecting the rights of individuals and organizations. 
The Recommendation intends to help governments develop coherent data governance 
policies and frameworks to unlock the potential benefits of data across and within sectors, 
countries, organizations, and communities. In similar lines, Draft of India Data Accessibility 
and Use Policy aims to enhance access, Quality and use of data in line with the current 
and emerging technology needs and recognizes that Increased sharing of data amongst 
public and private sectors optimizes digital welfare delivery and increases administrative 
efficiency, enabling citizen-centric services.
Overall, there is a lack of a coherent, integrated cascade despite the fact that each layer 
does make efforts at monitoring and measuring progress in its own way. There is a 
strong case for turning this around to give the country common data sources to have a 
meaningful conversation that leads to coherent efforts from all stakeholders to accelerate 
the movement towards its collective aspirations for its people. As Economic Survey 2018-19 
highlights, ‘data of the people, by the people, for the people must therefore become the 
mantra for the government’. How well the partners in development and growth are able to 
do it would be a key driver of India’s Amrit Kaal becoming a reality in the period ahead.

Abstract
Social protection systems are designed by nations to help vulnerable and marginalized 
sections of the population overcome abject poverty and better cope with the risks 
associated with essential survival. Within social protection systems, nationally owned 
policies and programmes help people meet basic needs, mitigate the immediate impact 
of shocks and support a basic level of income for people living in poverty or prevent them 
from falling into poverty. Social protection can also have long term goals, such as cutting 
short generational life cycles of poverty, inclusive growth and sustainable development. 
India fits uniquely into the paradigm of social protection, by offering a myriad of schemes for 
service delivery across the values of assistance, insurance and labour market programmes 
amounting to 2.4% of the GDP. The current coverage of social protection programmes in 
India is in need of substantive improvement given the informality of work, and the impact 
of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has likely pushed many into the fold of poverty. States 
in India are at different levels of institutional preparedness to embark on the challenge 
of designing and implementing effective systems for social protection. They also operate 
within different contexts, demographics, institutional challenges, fiscal space and systems of 
implementation. With less than a decade to go before the 2030 deadline of SDG 1.3 which 
provides for the implementation of nationally appropriate social protection systems and 
measures, including floors, to achieve substantial coverage of the poor, the social protection 
space in India is poised for a fundamental transformation from a set of fragmented schemes 
to an integrated system –State Governments will be key to this story. 
Therefore, the relevance of building State Capacity for designing, implementing, and 
financing social protection is paramount. The following essay identifies key enablers of 
social protection for States which include a strong policy environment, institutions and 
human resources to implement policies and institutional mandates, essential fiscal space, 
strong and dynamic integrated data systems with forward and reverse linkages across 
departments to help identify beneficiaries, design outreach efforts, monitor and evaluate 
progress. In addition to the same, States’ responsiveness to shocks such as disasters and 
pandemics, is essential to the sustainability of social protection systems.

1. Introduction 
Social protection systems are designed by nations to help vulnerable and marginalized 
sections of the population overcome abject poverty and to better cope with the risks 
associated with essential survival. Within social protection systems, nationally owned 
policies and programmes help people meet basic needs, mitigate the immediate impact of 
shocks and support a basic level of income for people living in poverty or to prevent them 
from falling into poverty. Social protection can also have long term goals, such as cutting 
short generational life cycles of poverty, inclusive growth and sustainable development. 
Social protection can be non-contributory for the poorest of the poor needing essential 
social assistance in the form of food distribution, free education, public works programmes 
such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), 
etc. It can also attend to sections of society which can afford to contribute to insurance 
in the field of pensions, health, crops etc and labour market programmes such as skill 
development trainings and others. 
Integrated social protection systems aim to reduce multidimensional poverty and other 
vulnerabilities and are inextricably linked to Sustainable Development Goal 1, Ending 
poverty in all its forms everywhere and SDG 3.1 which provides for the implementation of 
nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures, including floors, to achieve 
substantial coverage of the poor. (United Nations, 2019) 
Integrated social protection systems can be defined across four key domains: 
a. Overall policy coherence and a shared vision along with financing mechanisms,
b. Programmatic coordination and harmonisation at all levels, 
c. Integrated administrative tools such as registries, payment mechanisms, grievance 
redressal and;
d. Evidence to help chart policy design including poverty and vulnerability analysis 
and evaluations (UNICEF 2019)

benefits with social care and support services “through integration of databases, and 
the establishment of “single window” service centres, and integrated Case Management” 
(UNICEF 2016, page viii).
2. The Indian Context 
India fits uniquely into the paradigm of social protection, by offering a myriad of schemes 
for service delivery across the values of assistance, insurance and labour market programmes 
amounting to 2.4% of the GDP. The current coverage of social protection programmes in 
India is in need of substantive improvement given the informality of work, wherein more 
than 90% of the workforce is engaged in the informal economy and the impact of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, which has pushed many back into the fold of poverty. (ILO, 2020) 
States in India are at different levels of institutional preparedness to embark on the 
challenge of designing and implementing effective systems for social protection. They 
also operate within different contexts, demographics, institutional challenges, fiscal space 
and systems of implementation.

For example, the greatest burden of Multidimensional Poverty as a proportion of the 
population is borne by Bihar at 51.9%, followed by Jharkhand at 42.2%, Uttar Pradesh at 
37.8%, while states like Kerala have very low burdens at 0.7%, Sikkim at 3.8% and Tamil 
Nadu at 4.9% of the population. Expenditures by States on the social sector also vary 
significantly, with social sector expenditure as a proportion of State GDP the highest in 
North Eastern States of Manipur at 29.9%, Meghalaya at 22.8% and Arunachal Pradesh at 
22.4%, and the lowest in Gujarat at 5%, Karnataka at 5.5% and Punjab at 5.9% in 2020-21.

Similarly, fiscal deficit as a proportion of the State GDP is an important marker of the 
availability of fiscal space for increasing the coverage of social protection programs. This 
varies significantly, with seven States having a deficit greater than 4% of State GDP. These 
include Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh 
and Goa in 2020-21. 
Digital infrastructure to extend social protection systems to all beneficiaries through 
dynamic registries is also key to this exercise. However, capacities vary across states 
significantly. In some States, while more than 90% of Gram Panchayats have internet 
connections including Kerala, Haryana, Karnataka and Rajasthan, others have less than 
or equal to 10% of Gram Panchayats with internet connections (nine States/UTs). These 
include Manipur, Himachal  Pradesh, Nagaland, Andhra  Pradesh, Jammu  and  Kashmir, 
Mizoram, Sikkim, Arunachal  Pradesh, Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands(BharatNet 2018). In 
an assessment of e-governance facilities provided by States, Haryana, Telangana, Rajasthan, 
Punjab ranked as the best states (out of 18) in providing online services in Social Welfare 
(including health and agriculture) in a National E-governance assessment of States in 2019. 
(DARPG, 2019 )
Therefore, a one size fits all approach to India’s social protection architecture would not 
succeed without understanding the contextual needs of states, and involving them as 
integral stakeholders in the journey of crafting safety nets.  A necessary prerequisite to 
this involvement is an assessment of where States stand using a framework of essential 
enablers of social protection. This is outlined in the next section.

Several gaps exist in social protection systems in different states. On the supply side, these 
include inefficient government machinery to reach out to intended beneficiaries, presence 
of parallel data systems and a lack of a unified repository of data leading to duplication 
of efforts by different departments to collect and manage data. On the demand side, lack 
of awareness among eligible citizens on availing benefits, lack of real time information to 
effectively administer benefits, especially in response to sudden shocks. On the basis of 
existing literature from around the world, and in developing country contexts in particular, 
there are few key enablers of social protection against which states capacities may be 
assessed with the intention of assessing the status quo and setting systems in place for 
improvement. 
3. Enablers of Social Protection Systems 
3.1 Policy and Legal Provisions 
Policies with the objective and mandate of bringing the vulnerable into the fold of social 
protection are integral to the success of this ambitious agenda. The countries of Bulgaria, 
Kosovo, Kyrgyztan and Montenegro have a well-integrated policy environment for social 
protection as there is clarity in overall responsibility and leadership of social protection and 
there is often a lead ministry to spearhead social policy development and implementation 
accompanied by decentralisation in local/sub national contexts (UNICEF 2020).
The most successful and sustainable experiences of social protection systems are those 
which are grounded in legal instruments which, in a human rights approach, give the 
beneficiaries legal prerogative to invoke rights. A core aspect of a human rights approach
<<<PAGE=159>>>
Improving States’ Capacities for Responsive Social Protection Systems
145
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
to social protection is a national legal framework, supported by a strategy and plan of 
action. For in order to enjoy the true success of a social protection system, the beneficiaries 
should be able to identify actors who bear responsibilities. Therefore, legal mechanisms 
set the stage for the states’ accountability to deliver as per their mandate. (Nyst, 2012)
While several schemes have been in force for decades, governments across the world have 
not succeeded in reaching all which are most in need of protection. Subsuming scheme 
delivery within a legal mandate is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough to 
guarantee responsive delivery. In itself, the need for legal provisions should not be a 
showstopper to schemes in the domain of social protection, and may also come after 
piloting and implementing social protection initiatives in real time. 
In India, an important policy tool orchestrated at the National Level to this effect is the 
Digital India Mission Wherein Common Service Kendras are identified as points of contact 
between the state and the beneficiary, wherein enrolment, dissemination, financial benefits 
converge across key schemes pertaining to identification, health, agriculture, education, 
financial inclusion, and others. States are the vehicles of implementation of this ambitious 
idea. 
Other policy tools relevant to social protection in India include missions and schemes 
pertaining to Health, Education, Agriculture, Digital Literacy, Direct Benefit Transfers among 
others. As such, at this stage there is no overarching scheme or policy for an integrated 
social protection system at the National Level. Several States have successfully scaled up 
pilots to promote integrated social protection systems which can serve as a model for other 
states. For example, Haryana’s Parivar Pehchan Patra programme identifies beneficiaries 
for potential inclusion in a plethora of essential schemes. It has been supplemented by 
the Haryana Parivar Pehchan Patra Act of 2021 to ensure the sustainability of the exercise, 
along with delineating the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders. Similarly, Rajasthan’s 
Jan Aadhar programme for onboarding beneficiaries to multiple welfare schemes through 
a unique identity was accompanied with the Rajasthan Jan Aadhar Authority Act 2020. 
3.2 Institutions & Human Resources 
In the last five decades, institutions have been integral to the delivery, design and 
implementation of social safety nets. In the 20th Century, the prevalence of social protection 
systems was largely in a few European countries. Today, systems for social protection 
have significantly expanded (WB, 2018) and a majority of countries have social protection 
programmes covered by law. (ILO, 2020)
Institutions are linked to development, and define the mandate, capacity and objectives of 
social protection programmes. While designing any social protection system, it is integral 
to identify suitable institutional arrangements and the best ways in which to achieve 
operational efficiency. (ADB, 2003) 
Since social protection has traditionally seen fragmented schemes across ministries and 
departments which have subsequently coalesced into national systems for integrated 
delivery, the development of institutional mechanisms to coordinate amongst all stakeholders 
would be an important next step. This integrated machinery of planning would include
<<<PAGE=160>>>

146
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
government, especially in areas which are traditionally not served by the private sector, 
civil society and the private sector to achieve pro-poor sustainable growth. 
By developing the basic software for growth, that of human resources, social protection 
can make the hardware of growth more productive via equitable outcomes, strengthened 
relationships and resilience. (OECD, 2019) Where policy commitment is complemented by 
human capacity development and augmentation to deliver programmes, it can accelerate 
the achievement of wellbeing and the standard of living of children and families. 
There are four main elements at play in the creation of an effective interface administration 
of social protection, they include (UNICEF 2020) 
a. Workforce arrangements which provide services, and clarity on their roles and 
responsibilities (avoiding gaps and duplications) 
b. Existence and typology of integrated front office services
c. Existence and typology of back- office services 
d. Social work coordinating service provision using case management 
In India, institutional mechanisms and human resource provisions underlie each scheme 
pertaining to social assistance, insurance and labour market provision. However, in the 
absence of a national social protection policy or mission, there is significant potential 
for coordination among identified institutions and departments under a shared vision to 
maximise efficiency in delivery and cut duplications and costs. As is the case for legislation, 
several states have kickstarted institutional pathways to ensure coordination for social 
protection, some examples include Haryana’s Parivar Pehchan Patra wherein a three-tier 
Data Governance structure has been established with a Steering Committee (chaired by 
Additional Chief Secretary to Government), Executive Committee (chaired by Additional 
Chief Secretary, DPAR eGovernance) at the State level and a Working Group at the level 
of each department.
Going forward, to assess readiness for social protection systems at the state level, it would 
be important to know if there is a clear mandate of institutions to deliver social protection, 
either at the sector or scheme level, or as a whole of government approach. Additionally, 
it would be important to assess the presence of institutions with defined approaches to 
M&E for social protection (whether fragmented or integrated)
3.3 Data Systems for M&E
Many countries have made provisions for various social benefits and services to meet the 
diverse needs of their populations across different sectors. The objective of implementing 
any social program is to deliver goods, services or financial aid to people deemed eligible. 
However, in reality, a lot of potential eligible beneficiaries get left out of the process due 
to old and fragmented data systems maintained by departments for different schemes.
Social Registries support the first phase of the delivery chain of outreach. They serve as 
information systems to support intake, registration, and determination of potential eligibility
<<<PAGE=161>>>
Improving States’ Capacities for Responsive Social Protection Systems
147
M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
for one or more social programs and subsequent outreach. They are therefore integral to 
avoid duplication, and maximize the outreach of schemes to improve the standard of living 
of citizens across the country, in a manner that is cognizant of the rights to privacy and 
consent of all. Several countries have adopted integrated social protection systems within 
their fold, with robust data architecture systems to optimize last mile delivery, including 
Kenya, Pakistan, Brazil, Chile, Estonia and others. Data systems which are able to capture 
beneficiary coverage at the scheme and department level in real time, and are amenable 
to updates through forward and backward linkages are essential to realistic estimates for 
planning and design of programmes. 
In the Indian Context, understanding the readiness of States to implement this ambitious 
agenda would include understand if there are IT systems or a data governance architecture 
to enable Government to Citizen (G2C) delivery. Some States in India have already created 
integrated registries to identify beneficiaries for automatic enrolment, and to implement the 
principle of “ask only once” to reduce the burden of a beneficiary in accessing essential 
scheme benefits. These include experiences from Karnataka’s Kutumba programme, 
Haryana’s Parivar Pehchan Patra, Rajasthan’s Jan Aadhar programme and Madhya Pradesh’s 
Samagra programme.

3.4 Fiscal Space
Fiscal space is generally the ‘room in a government’s budget that allows it to earmark 
resources for a desired purpose without jeopardizing the sustainability of its financial 
position or the stability of the economy’ (Heller, 2005) and “the financing that is available 
to government as a result of concrete policy actions for enhancing resource mobilization” 
(Roy, 2007 ) Today, at a time of fragile global recovery in the wake of the pandemic, the 
need to create fiscal space for social protection has never been greater. Even as no one 
country’s experience will be the same as another’s, a one size fits all approach to the 
creation of fiscal space cannot be applied to state governments.
Some states may have room to borrow more, while others may want to restructure their 
debt. The priorities will also change depending on demographic needs. For example, 
ageing states such as Karnataka and Kerala may want to create greater fiscal space for 
old-age pensions, while states with emerging populations of working age such as Uttar 
Pradesh may want to create greater space for labour market programmes. 
In a study of 187 countries to assess how fiscal space may be created, it was observed 
that Costa Rica and Thailand had reallocated military expenditures for universal health, 
Indonesia and Ghana are using fuel subsidies to develop social protection programmes. 
Bolivia, Zambia and Mongolia are financing universal old age pensions and child benefits 
from taxes on mining and gas. High taxes on Tobacco have funded social protection 
programmes in Algeria, Mauritius and Panama. (ILO, UNWomen, World Bank, 2017)
<<<PAGE=163>>>
Improving States’ Capacities for Responsive Social Protection Systems

M&E @70:  Strengthening India’s Evidence Systems for Accelerated Reforms and Inclusive Growth
The following recommendations applicable to even the poorest contexts emerged for the 
creation of fiscal space:
  Reallocating public expenditures
  Increasing tax revenues
  Expanding contributory revenues 
  Lobbying for aid and transfers 
  Eliminating illicit financial flows
  Using fiscal and foreign exchange reserves 
  Managing debt: borrowing or restructuring existing debt 
  Adopting a more accommodative macroeconomic framework 
In addition to encouraging adequate tax collection, there is merit in systems in which 
individuals co-finance services, contributing individually or through community-based 
arrangements. This is the case for social insurance, micro and area-based schemes, 
social funds, and selected labor market and child protection programs. However, most 
programs, particularly those targeted to lower income groups, require a degree of public 
support. Financing from charitable or aid organizations is discontinuous and does not 
allow sustainable social protection programs. Such financing may help to fill the gaps on a 
temporary basis only. In social insurance programs, accumulated savings/contributions can 
be invested in financial markets. Diversification of income sources is desirable to spread 
risks and ensure the overall sustainability of the program (ADB, 2003).
3.5 Responsiveness to Disasters
Social protection is a core part of the efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, facilitate 
speedy recovery and strengthen the resilience of poor and vulnerable people. Countries 
across the globe are already mobilising significant resources for social protection responses.
Preventing income insecurity and poverty are essential to survival within the mandate of a 
strong social protection system. However, in response to disasters or health emergencies, 
systems may be set in place to enable automatic disbursements in the form of cash or 
in-kind (food) assistance to ensure that the most vulnerable are able to survive. States 
should aim to increase their capacity to respond to shocks and also build long term 
resilience. (FAO, 2020)
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the key enablers of social protection include a strong policy environment, 
accompanying institutions, human resources within institutions to implement policies and 
institutional mandates, essential fiscal space to implement policies, strong and dynamic 
integrated data systems with forward and reverse linkages across departments to help 
identify beneficiaries, design outreach efforts, monitor and evaluate progress and impact. 
In addition to the same - responsiveness to shocks such as disasters and pandemics, is

essential to the sustainability of social protection systems. Incorporating the learnings from 
social protection outreach during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Given the diversity of needs, capacities and implementation mechanisms across the States 
of India, it is necessary to enable state flexibility within a national vision or policy for 
coordination to enable the development of integrated social protection system to improve 
last mile delivery and the standard of living. States, based on where they stand with 
respect to the framework proposed will be at different levels of readiness to implement 
this ambitious agenda in order to do justice to the vision of Sustainable Development 
Goal 1, leaving no one behind.
Understanding different levels of readiness would serve as an essential first step to 
handholding, capacity building, and knowledge sharing to foster a spirit of cooperative 
and competitive federalism to craft India’s social protection architecture. With less than a 
decade left to achieve substantial coverage of the poor within nationally appropriate social 
protection systems (Sustainable Development Goal 3.1), the time to act is now.
