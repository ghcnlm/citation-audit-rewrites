EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This report seeks to present in relation to evaluation in Zambia: (i) t he conditions under 
which demand is generated for evidence; and (ii) the areas in which supply can be 
strengthened to meet and foster this demand. This report shows that there is currently 
active, latent and potential evaluation demand and supply  in Zambia. It is argued that in 
Zambia each entry-point for evaluation is partial and is mediated by aligned interest groups 
rather than a neutral role-player seeking to expand evidence-based practice. This demand is 
set within a context where there is a high degree of political competition between political 
parties and various interest groups. In the po litical economy, loyalties to informal networks 
of power are in many cases more important than performance.  
The latent and potential demands are nested within the  Executive, while there is active 
demand for evaluation in the Ministry of Finance. This demand is conditioned by the 
political economy where both formal and informal agenda s determine how policy is 
implemented. Supply could be strengthened through the various think tanks , the newly 
merged Evaluation Association , and through work with t he well-resourced Centre of 
Excellence at the University of Zambia. 
Evaluation supply is limited in the country. International consultants, rather than local ones, 
often lead evidence gathering or evaluation exercises. The expertise to undertake 
evaluations in Zambia has some islands of well-connected evaluation practice that works 
both in the formal and informal political domains. The university sector has some research 
capacity, especially in the social science sector , but indications are that there are s tructural 
challenges in the sector with qualified staff leaving for better paid positions elsewhere.  
There are entry points in policy processes for improving evaluation capacities in Zambia with 
ongoing policy initiatives of the government as well as the Sixth National Development Plan. 
Functional sector working groups are lacking but are needed to feed into the governance of 
evaluations.  
The approach for evaluation capacity development suggested in this study is to work across 
multiple entry points simultaneously to improve evaluation practice. This has the advantage 
of being able to interact with different points in the political economy, while also  only 
resourcing different stakeholders to the degree that resources can be absorbed. This means 
that some institutions, such as Parliament, may require sensitisation activities and modest 
technical support rather than large -scale interventions. Meanwhile, entry-points, such as 
the Ministry of Finance, can be worked with to respond to new demands in a systemati c 
manner that already builds on their successes.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1. This report presents a mapping of the parties involved in evaluation practice in Zambia, 
namely the principals (demand), government agents (commissioners) and evaluation 
agents (supply). In Africa the re is now evidence of emerging country -led demands for 
evaluation (Porter and Goldman 2013), which is consistent with the general emphasis of 
the Paris Declaration on the use of country -owned systems. It is hoped that national 
stakeholders and those supporting them will use this report to better structure their 
assistance to evaluation capacity development (ECD). Consequently, the main audience 
of this study is intended to be those interested in ECD in Zambia. The Regional Centre for 
Learning on Evaluation and Results for Anglophone Africa (CLEAR -AA)2 conducted this 
study for the UK Department for International Development (DFID) as one of a set of 
cases covering five countries 3. Fieldwork for this study took place between 17 and 21 
June 2013. 
2. A secondary audience of this study is people who are in general interested in the 
development of evaluation systems. The analysis in this report presents a range of 
opportunities for capacity developme nt in relation to government agents (central and 
line departments), the evaluation agents (consultants, think tanks and universities), and 
principals (development partners, Parliament, the Executive and civil society). In 
undertaking the mapping of the evaluation context in Zambia, the study identifies latent, 
potential and actual demand, the conditions under which demand is generated and 
potential sources of supply, with  an explicit sensitivity to the political economy of the 
country. 
3. This study refers to evaluation as covering both evaluation and evaluative research and 
therefore uses the terms interchangeably.  The primary objectives of the study are to 
explore:  
1) The conditions under which demand is generated for evaluation evidence; and 
2) The areas in which evaluation supply can be strengthened to meet and foster this 
demand. 
The guiding questions that interface with these objectives are:  
(i) On the demand side:  
a) What has been the actual demand for evaluation from principals?  
b) Where is there latent and potential demand for evaluation? 
c) How is evaluation demanded in the current organisational arrangements? 
(ii) On the supply side:  
a) What is the range and capacity of entities supplying evaluation services? 
b) How relevant are the managers and producers of evaluation to the actual 
demand for evaluation? 
(i) On matching evaluation supply and demand:

c) Where can evaluation supply (actual, latent and potential) be 
strengthened so that it meets and fosters demand? 
 
4. This report finds that in Zambia there are multiple entry points to imp roving evaluation 
demand and supply. However, the entry-points are partial and mainly represent aligned 
interest groups rather than neutral role -players seeking to expand evidence -based 
practice. There is  active demand for evaluation within some government ministries, 
especially the Ministry of Finance,  and some potential demand to explore within the 
Cabinet Office. Outside of government there are well-connected organisations who seek 
to use evaluative inf ormation to engage i n advocacy with government. This demand is 
set within a context where there is a high degree of political competition  both between 
political parties and various interest groups . In the political economy , loyalties to 
informal networks of power in many cases are more important than performance. 
5. The supply of evaluation  expertise in Zambia is diverse in its quality.  In response to the 
historical demand from development partners and locally commissioned activities (using 
development partner  funding) a range of consultancy companies and individuals have 
arisen with particular areas of strength . In the health secto r, for example, a lot of 
resources have been put into the generation of evidence, particularly in regards to 
HIV/AIDS and malaria. The university sector has some research capacity, especially in the 
social science sector , but i ndications are that there are structural challenges  in the 
sector with qualified staff leaving for better paid positions elsewhere, as President 
Michael Sata (2013) observed at the opening of Parliament  “our universities and 
colleges do not only have dilapidated infrastructure but are also faced with shortage of 
staff and apt teaching and learning materials.” 
6. When conducting evaluations in Zambia there needs to be an awareness that the official 
objectives contained in development plans are only part ial articulation of the informal 
objectives of interest groups. In some cases  personal interests are pursued through the 
state. Within these constraints there are examples of evaluation being successful at 
informing strategy and policy and contributing towards development results. This means 
that when supply is being strengthened the emphasis is not only technical, but also on 
identifying entry points in the state where development agendas are being pursued for 
the benefit of the population.  
1.1 Methodology 
7. This study was carried out through a combination of desk review, including an analysis of 
existing evaluation products, and di rect semi -structured interviews with a selection of 
informants from across critical stakeholder groupings. The rest of this section presents 
the methodology of the study, and provides an overview of the stakeholder groups that 
were engaged with in the stud y. The study methodology encompassed the following 
overlapping stages:  
1. Establishing study commitment and support from key stakeholders;  
2. Collating and analysing primary and secondary data and information of the 
evaluation system (including available academic and popular literature);  
3. Conducting a series of interviews with actors; and 
4. Producing a draft paper.
<<<PAGE=10>>>

Each of these stages is discussed in more detail below. 
8. Establishing support from key stakeholders:  Given the nature of the study, an 
important initi al step was to identify relevant national stakeholders who would be 
engaged prior to, during and after the collection of data. Whilst the study was 
conducted independently, it is helpful that there is some level of active buy -in from key 
stakeholders to su pport the use of the study. In Zambia, letters were sent to the 
Government via  the Evaluation Association  to ask for interviews, while the country 
researcher made contact with a range of stakeholders.  
9. Collating and analysing secondary data and information: The collation and analysis of 
secondary data covered policy, academic and grey literature relating to the political 
context and the demand and supply side s of evaluation. Included in this was data on the 
size and scope of evaluation initiatives within government and the supply that emanates 
from outside of government. Following the country research phase , further primary and 
secondary documentation was referred to in order to substantiate the claims of the 
interviews and further develop findings.  
10. Interviews with key informants:  A series of interviews were arranged with key in -
country stakeholders (see Table 1 for details). The design of these interviews drew upon 
the literature reviewed and responded to  themes that emerged in the country mappin g 
process. In particular issues around the political economy,  potential and latent demand 
and the ability of supply to invoke demand were explored through the interview 
process. Data collection took place in a semi-structured fashion that allowed people to  
narrate their story – with some probing taking place based upon the guiding supply and 
demand questions. The data from interviews was analysed during the fieldwork with 
emerging conclusions refined.  
11. Production of a draft and final country report: Following the completion of first draft of 
this study, it was reviewed by the reference group. In addition this case was reviewed by 
the DFID country office and then also by the Government of Zambia. During these 
processes adjustments were made to the report to a id the clarity and accuracy of the 
core findings.

12. The findings of the country of case of Zambia are pres ented in the following manner: 
first, the development context is described in relation to evaluation; second, the state of 
the current evaluation demand and supply is mapped; third, illustrations of how the 
development context interacts with evaluation supply and demand are detailed; and 
finally, pathways to improve the national evaluation context are suggested  in alignment 
with the objectives of the study. 
2. DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT 
13. Zambia gained its independence on 24 October 1964, with Kenneth Kaunda as the first 
president. Although Zambia ha s not had  a major civil war , its geographical positioning 
placed it at the heart of liberation struggles on the continent . This difficult po sition, 
along with internal politic s, has meant that  its devel opment path has witnessed large 
scale declines since the 1970s before revivals in the 2000s. Zambia is regarded as one of 
the richest African countries in mineral wealth, but its development pat h has been 
stunted, with the country being unable to grow GDP per head and lengthen life 
expectancy until recently. On average people in Zambia today are poorer than they were 
in 1965 and live shorter lives than they did in 1971. The UNDP noted (2001: 1 ) that 
Zambia “is the only country in the world for which data on the human deve lopment 
index is available with lower human development indicators in 1997 than in 1975” 
14. After independence, Kenneth Kaunda and the United National Independence Party 
(UNIP) declared a one -party state in 1972. During the late 1970s , the price of copper, 
which is Zambia’s primary export, weaken ed worldwide resulting in a major contraction 
of the Zambian economy.  In the late 1980s the one party state of UNIP became 
increasingly unpopular. In June 1990 riots against Kaunda accelerated. Many protesters 
were killed by the regime. In 1990 Kaunda survived an attempted coup, and in 1991 he 
agreed to re -instate multiparty democracy and following multiparty elections Kaunda 
was removed from office.  
15. The elections were won by the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD , which was 
born out of a mix of trade unions and civil society organisations) and Frederick Chiluba 
became president. In order to try managing its debt burden, in 1991 Zambia undertook a 
range of economic liberalisation policies, such as privatisation, trade liberalisation, 
subsidy cuts and public sector wage freezes. The Joint Evaluation of Support to Anti -
Corruption Efforts (NORAD 2011: xv), points out that although there is  
…no empirical evidence on the causes and drivers of corruption in Zambia. Studies 
nonetheless agree that liberalisa tion in the 1990s introduced a ‘new culture of 
corruption’ in the country. A presidential slush fund, infamously used to obtain 
political buy-in during Frederick Chiluba’s regime, and privatisation, supported by 
World Bank -led s tructural adjustment programmes, have allegedly triggered 
high-level corruption. 
16. Frederick Chiluba was replaced by Levy Mwa nawasa (also MMD)  after failing to win 
support for a  third term. Levy Mwanawasa  undertook efforts to curb corruption. 
Mwanawasa’s death in 2009 led  to Rupiah Banda becoming the President until 2011.  
Both Chiluba and Banda were indicted for corruption following their term s in office. 
Chiluba’s indictment was withdrawn prior to his death  in 20 11 although a court in 
London found him guilty of stealing more than USD 40 million. In 2011 there was a
<<<PAGE=12>>>
5 
change of ruling party from the MMD  to the Patriotic Front , led by a former UNIP and 
MMD politician, Michael Sata. 
17. Zambia's economic record since the oil price shocks of the 1970s was woeful until 
around 2005 . Real GDP per capita fell from US$1455 in 1976 to US$1037 by 1987, an 
average of -3.6 per cent per year. This decline stabilised from 1987 to 1991, before the 
economy entered a massive recession again in 1992, the year an extensive progra mme 
of structural adjustment began. By the mid -1990s Zambia had one of the highest per 
capita foreign debts . A fter the external economic shocks suffered in the early 1970s, 
Zambia's total external debt rose from US$814 million to US$3,244 million by the en d of 
the decade. The situation then further deteriorated with Zambia's external debt more 
than doubling to US$6,916 million by the end of the 1980s . By 2000, real GDP per capita 
had fallen to US$892 (Focus 2004).  
18. From 2002 onwards , however,  the country has been enjoying consistent economic 
growth. Table 2 below is taken from the World Bank and illustrates the change in the 
various economic indicators and life expectancy over 2002 and 2011. Meanwhile  
19. Table 3 shows that aid has consistently become less important to the Zambian economy. 
Table 2: Summary of Zambia’s Economic Indicators, World Bank (Bank 2013) 
 
Table 3: Aid Trends in Zambia 
 
20. Since 2006, Zambia achieved s ingle-digit inflation along with GDP growth of roughly 6% 
per year. In 2010 the World Bank (WB) named Zambia one of the world's fastest 
economically reformed countries.  However, the evidence is this economic growth has 
not cascaded down to the rural areas. Equitable distribution of the national wealth still 
remains a challenge. In Zambia, t he World Bank ’s poverty headcount (measured by the 
percentage of people living under $2 per day) is one of the highest in the world at 86.6%  
in 2010 . This has risen since 2006 when it was 82.6% (Bank 2013 ). This reinforces k ey 
statistics in relation to Zambia’s development  which generally show a similar picture of 
inequitable distribution of development . The United Nations Development Programme  
(2013: 10 ) reports that, “Zambia’s Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, 
has worsened, from 0.60 in 2006 to 0.65 in 2010 .”  The UNDP Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) report stresses that economic activity is largely centralised in urban areas, 
leaving rural areas underdeveloped  and unable to access economic ventures because of 
unequal opportunities. Zambia has a life expectancy of 56 years (Bank 2013), which is 
comparable to relatively poorer countries like Rwanda and  Uganda. Recent

improvements in life expectancy appear to be related to advances in response to the 
generalised HIV epidemic.  
21. Zambia’s 2013 UNDP Report shows that the country  has made progress towards 
reaching its targets for some of the MDGs.  The report identifies 
 the country’s remarkable progress over the past decades in achieving certain 
targets”, but emphasi ses “the need to sustain these gains, while greater policy 
focus and investments are required to im prove progress on other targets . (UNDP 
2013: 56) 
22.  Zambia needs to pay particular attention to finding ways in improving MDGs related to 
secondary education, reducing c hild and maternal mortality, ensuring environmental 
sustainability, and reducing hunger (UNDP 2013: 53 ).  Zambia’s efforts to reduce the 
spread of HIV/AIDS are on target , while efforts to reduce malaria in Zambia are off -
target following a reduction in funding  (UNDP 2013: 39 -40). So while there have been 
increases to access to health and education , Zambians have yet to benefit from more 
efficient and effective service delivery systems . The reasons cited for this are that: there 
are human resource constraints and that all sectors are characteris ed by weak 
accountability for results at the local level ; the complementary role of non -state actors 
in service delivery has not been fully harnessed ; and there is heavy dependence on aid 
for education and health services (UNDP, 2011). 
23. The judicial system in Zambia lacks the capacity to deal effectively with the proliferation 
of litigation and cases, which tend to drag on for years before they are finalised. This 
source also notes that this sit uation has deterred foreign investment due to fear on the 
part of investors that the judicial system is so badly run down that it cannot offer 
adequate legal protection for investments.  
24.  Zambia is ranked at 12th out of 52 countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance 
(IIAG). The largest improvement in the index in Zambia has been in the health sector , 
which has shown an  improvement of +11.6 % over a 6 -year period 
(www.moibrahimfoundation.org). According to the IIAG, Zambia has witnessed a decline 
in rule of law since 2006 , while accountability as remained pretty much stable with a 
slight increase of 0.5%.  
2.1 Planning, Budgeting and Monitoring and Evaluation framework 
25. There appears to be broad consensus  on three strategic challenges  facing Zambia  
between government, civil society and development partners . First, that economic 
growth at a rate over 6% needs to b e maintained over a 25-year period  in order for 
Zambia to be come a prosperous middle-income country (GoZ 2005 ). Second, the 
Zambian economy remains too dependent upon copper exports that make up around 
60% of the country’s total exports  (Economics 2013 ). Finally, it is recognised that the 
decade of economic growth has not benefited the masses  or translated into improved 
human development (Front 2011; UNDP 2013; USAID 2011).  
26. In responding to these challenges , the current strategic response focus es very much on 
the provision of infrastructure, although official documents poi nt to a range of other 
priorities. Currently slightly different  drivers of policy can be identified in three main 
documents, namely: The Sixth National Development Plan  (incorporating Vision 2030) ,
<<<PAGE=14>>>
7 
the Patriotic Front’s manifesto, and the national budget. An analysis of all of these 
documents shows that although there are overlaps they do not completely align. 
27. The Sixth N ational Development Plan  (SNDP) is the current official development 
planning framework dated as effective from January 2011, having been r eleased before 
the elections in September 2011 , and the subsequent change in government . National 
planning, which was undertaken during the single party state, but not during the 1990s , 
came back into existence initia lly in the form of the Poverty Reductio n Strategy P aper 
and then  the F ifth National Development Plan for the period 2006 - 2010. The final 
evaluations of the Fifth National Development Plan  (FNDP) are currently being 
completed. 
28. The strategic focuses of the SNDP are  infrastructure, rural development, and human  
development. Within these foc uses the priority sectors  are agriculture, livestock and 
fisheries, mining, tourism, manufacturing, and trade and commerce. The SNDP is cited as 
the basis for development partners’ assistance. For example, the Joint Assistance 
Strategy, signed by fifteen bilateral and multilateral agencies,  supports the SNDP . The 
largest allocation  of the itemised support  goes to infrastructure development  (the 
largest package of overall assistance i s project grants, followed by general budget 
support) (Partners 2013). 
29. However, the challenge with treating the SNDP as an operational policy is twofold. First, 
implementation mechanisms for national plans have historically  not been consistently 
put into practice . For example, th e mid -term evaluation of the Fifth NDP noted that  
“there is a vacuum in the institutional set up because there is no planning authority to 
ensure that sector planners followed the FNDP” (MoF 2009: 152). Further to this point 
there is no evidence that the National Development Coordinating Committee (NDCC), a 
core body for supporting development between various acto rs, has actually been 
convened. Additionally, sector advisory groups are not consistently convened or if they 
are a number have been recorded as in effective (Leiderer and Faust 2012: 167 ; USAID 
2011: 154). Second, following the election the Patriotic Front according to interviews has 
emphasised t hat their manifesto takes precedence  over the SNDP . This has led to a 
review period of the SNDP to align it to  the Manifesto.  The current Medium Term 
Expenditure Framework  (MTEF), for example,  recognises both as sources for policy , 
stating that the MTEF  has “been guided by the... [SNDP] and the aspirations of the 
Government as set out in the Patriotic Front Manifesto”. In the body of the MTEF the 
key strategies for growth are mainly aligned to the SNDP. 
30. The second document that can be considered to be a source of strategic policy direction 
for Zambia is the Patriotic Front’s manifesto. Central to the Patriotic Front ’s manifesto is 
a core programme based on the aspiration  to create pro-poor growth, generate access 
to quality education and health care and i mplement decentralisation of the 
government’s administration  (Front 2011 ). Within some of these core progra mmes 
there are indications that the manifesto is being implemented. For example, a bill has 
been introduced to create a higher education authority in Zambia , a stated priority for 
tertiary education in the manifesto . In another example , the tax regime for mining 
companies has been reviewed , which has  increased revenue.  Further, there is 
momentum on decentralisation of administration power with the launch of a new policy 
initiative. However, the constitutional reform process , which the Patriotic Front
<<<PAGE=15>>>
8 
government had promised to complete within 90 days of coming to power in 2011 , 
seemed to be stalled at the end of 2013. 
31. The final document that could be taken to represent the  strategic priorities for the 
country is the national budget.   The theme of the 2 013 budget address in October 2012 
was “Delivering Inclusive Development and Social Justice”. Within the budget overlaps 
can be noted with the Patriotic Front’s Manifesto and the SNDP, for example, in the 
areas of infrastructure, decentralisation, agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. 
Education and health feature less strongly than the Patriotic Front’s manifesto implies, 
while the emphasis on infrastructure development is increased. The issue with taking 
the budget as a firm statement of intent is that the execution is very different. Issues 
with budget execution are further discussed below.  
32. Zambia has undergone a range of public finance reforms  linked to planning and 
monitoring and evaluation ( M&E) over the past decade. Three phases of reform s have 
been undertaken since the year 2000 . T hese are: (i) initial reforms  according to  the 
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)  Initiative; (ii) Poverty Reduction Budget Support 
and the Fifth National Development Plan; and (iii) National planning and budgeting 
reforms along with implementation of the  Sixth National Development Plan.  In 
reviewing this history some important progress  can be identified  with some on-going 
issues. 
33. Phase 1 - HIPC 2002 - 2005: Following the unsuccessful  third ter m re-election bid of  
Chiluba, the new government applied for the HIPC  Initiative. In the initial phases of 
financial reforms in the early 2000s it was recognised  by the IMF  (IMF 2005 ) that 
Zambia’s public expenditure management system was not a functional tool for the 
implementation of fiscal policy.  An activity -based budgeting system and MTEF were 
implemented in 2003 and 2004 to financially remedy this situation . Both of these 
systems are still in place today . In order to qualif y for the HIPC  Initiative, a Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was implemented. At the end of this first round of 
public finance and planning related reforms a range of issues emerged. In this first phase 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2005) reported the dominant challenge that was 
identified by implementing agencies was the inadequate and untimely disbursement of 
funds. It was  also noted that at the end of the period poverty ra tes remained largely 
unaffected. Furthermore there was no monit oring and evaluation of targets.  One of the 
chief recommendations  of the IMF  was that there is a need to carry out regular 
evaluations to assess progress on outcome and impact indicators.” 
34. Phase 2 - Poverty Reducti on Budget Support and Fifth National Development Plan  
2005 – 2010: This second phase of national planning and finance reform saw an 
increased emphasis on budget support mechanisms with implementation defined 
through a national development plan. Framing this process has been Vision 2030 , an 
aspirational document with general development aims. During the period 2005 – 2010, 
external and domestic debt  in Zambia  was brought down to moderate levels, 
international reserves increased significantly, and inflation reduced to single digits  
(Kemp et al. 2011). Reform of the budget calendar was undertaken during this period to 
support Parliament to have oversight of a full twelve months of implementation.  With 
support from the Ministry of Finance, “the de facto independence of the institution [of 
the A uditor General] has increased ” (Kemp et al . 2011: 108 ). An assessment of public 
financial management noted
<<<PAGE=16>>>
9 
significant improvements in various dimensions of [Public Finance 
Management]…in particular an improved basis for strategic budgeting, greater 
comprehensiveness of fiscal information (including systematic reporting of 
arrears), improvements in internal auditing and improved oversight, yet, all in all, 
Zambia’s… system continues to exhibit significant weaknesses.” (Kemp et al. 2011: 
113 & 15) 
35. Improvements in public finance in  2008 – 2009 have  been difficult to maintain since 
Banda’s election . Getting a more complete picture on budget execution has been 
hampered by a declining level of transparency. These issues are discussed in Box 2. 
Financial release s are reported to be a  continued problem , while  the decentralis ation 
plan was not implemented. Further, challenges in in the distribution of funds  and 
coordination continued to affect the efficiency and effectiveness of delivery . It was 
recognised in a mid-term review of the FNDP that the statistical services were not up-to-
date and that there is a lack of coordination and harmonisation of M&E systems 
between ministries. Importantly, 
 two Annual Progress Reports on the FNDP revealed the inability of several sectors 
to report against the [key performance indicators]. Six sectors could not report 
against any of the indicators…, while other priority sectors, notably Agriculture 
and Water and Sanitation consistently appear to have difficulties in reporting 
against some of their major KPIs.4 
36. Phase 3 - New Reforms 2011 – Present: The current reform phase is being undertaken 
in the context of a 2010 evaluation of the implementation of the Paris Declaration. The 
evaluation report of implementation of the Paris Declaration states that “ the findings 
highlight the need for a more balanced donor -recipient relationship i n Zambia which 
requires fundamental changes in the underlying pr inciples and incentives of aid.”  
(Chigunta and Matshalaga 2010: vii ). In particular it noted that there was a tendency for 
development partners to entrench their own positions through parallel forums in the 
context of the government of Zambia not being assertive about development priorities. 
37. As part of a response to these issues a draft National Planning and Budgeting Policy (GoZ 
2013) was being circulated for comments  in 2013. This policy (GoZ 2013: 6 ), recognises 
that challenges have persisted across the  two previous waves of reforms , stating that 
there is: 
…weak linkage between budgeting and development planning procedures; 
ambiguous and variable processes used in practice for preparing MTEFs, budgets 
and development plans; and no legally binding institutional structures in place to 
undertake budgeting and development planning procedures in a manner that 
ensures informed participation by relevant stakeholders and effective oversight by 
the National Assembly. 
38. In particular the new draft policy  notes that the implementation of activity based 
budgeting was not undertaken  with a  significant mind-set change to support a more 
results/performance orientation , while the credibility of the annual budget itself has 
been undermined for many years by wide in -year variations between appropriated 
amounts and actual expenditures incurred by ministries, provinces and other spending 
agencies. In the ir analysis a challenge with the earlier phases was that accountability

10 
mechanisms were not included in t he reforms. The draft policy notes th at the 
“effectiveness of SAGs has been compromised by the perception th at they are often 
donor- driven” (GoZ 2013: 10) . Reporting on  budget execution , the draft policy states 
that “significant variances are belatedly regularised by submitting large supplementary 
budgets to the National Assembly at the end of the financial year, in the last week o f the 
National Assembly ses sion” (GoZ 2013: 11). The challenges noted in the analysis above 
were confirmed in civil society submissions responding to the draft policy. A recent 
report by Zambia Institute for Policy Analysis and Research (Cheelo and Banda 2012) 
that analysed the Auditor General’s reports notes that financial irregularities in Zambia 
have increased 2.5 times from 2008 to 2010 (which also demonstrates challenges in 
Parliament’s oversight capacities to call departments to account). These issues appear to 
continue to this day according to reports in the Zambian press.5 As a result , the policy 
proposes a variety of technical and political fixes to better align the national planning 
cycle with the vagaries of a five year electoral cycle. 
39. In this third phase , the SNDP is an important  document for undertaking M&E within 
Zambia. As can be seen from Figure 1 , according to the SNDP  the Ministry of Finance is 
at the heart of the planning, budgeting and M&E system in Zambia. All information from 
sectors and lower tiers of government are col lated in the Mini stry of Finance, before 
being reported to the cabinet and Parliament. (i) Budget Execution Monitoring;  (ii) 
Project spot monitoring;  (iii) Analysis of administrative data or Management 
Information Systems; (iv) Surveys; and  (v) Research and Development. Evaluation in the 
SNDP document appears only being undertaken mid and en d-term. However, in reality 
the Research and Development Programme in the Ministry of Finance has been 
established to undertake ex -ante and ex -post evaluative exercises of sectors in relation 
to the SNDP. The role of the Research and Development Programme is discussed further 
in the mapping section.

40. Separate to the SNDP, the proposed policy framework (GoZ, 2013) suggests further  
evaluation mechanisms. For example, it suggests that major capital projects and 
recurrent programmes will undergo appraisals and/or evaluations (2013: 15). These may 
well compliment the existing annual review processes of the National Development 
Plan. In deed, currently the Ministry of Finance has produced Annual progress review 
reports is finalising a range of evaluations. This process will be discussed further in 
reference to government agents. 
41. Three challenges to implementing the  M&E plans of the SNDP  have been noted. Firstly, 
there is still no  National Development Coordinating Committee to review information 
and guide implementation.  Secondly, the capacity for M&E at all levels is qui te low 
especially at provincial and district level.  For example, d ata quality challenges in 
reporting and setting targets have all be en cited as current issues with the system  in 
interviews. Thirdly, while funding might be in place , it is rarely  actually expended on 
M&E.  
42. In summary, there have been advances in planning, b udgeting and M&E in past decade. 
Most notable is the  currently stable macroeconomic environment and  improved 
financial management processes. However,  there is a lso a continuity of challenges over 
the past decade. Chief among these is that poverty has not decreased. Meanwhile, there 
has been an ongoing challenge of budget execution. Across the phases efforts have 
continued to increase  rule-based accountability. However, the challenge may not solely 
lie in a lack of  rules, but with  tensions that exist between  differing aims of interest 
groups. This is further discussed below. 
2.2 Political Economy of Evaluation
<<<PAGE=19>>>
12 
43. In Zambia stated policy intent is strongly mediated in implementation by  the informal 
objectives of a variety of stakeholders. In other words, although policy intent may 
appear developmental, actual implementation is negotiated between interest groups , 
often to the benefit of the powerful . This leads to a situation where loyalty often 
matters more than performance (Leenstra 2012). Formal rules and systems can act as a 
façade for interests within an informal system of rules and decision -making that is 
broadly dispersed amongst those with pow er. This has otherwise been called neo -
patrimonialism. A range of commentators and a number of interviews highlighted that 
pecuniary interest and the extension of state power competes with poverty reduction in 
the objectives of powerful interests within the state (FODEP 2011 ; Leenstra 2012 ; 
Rakner 2012). For evaluation this means that openings for evidence to inform policy are 
much more tenuous than they may appear at face  value with change likely to be very 
incremental.  
44. This means that the constitutional values of  democracy, transparency, accountability 
and good governance are subordinate to the informal power structures within the state . 
Perceiving that formal rules often become vehicles for informal objectives helps to 
unravel a variety of seeming contradictions that inhibit or enable Zambia’s ability to 
improve learning through evaluation. 
45. An in depth case study of the Zambian health sector that was conducted by Leenstra 
(2012) provides an illustrat ion of the connections between the formal and informal 
system within Zambia. This study connects the micro -level behaviours in the health 
system to the macro context. The author finds that while rules do exist and are followed, 
these are also on occasions warped and used to justify behaviours that are against the 
public interest, such as health professionals “stealing government time” (Leenstra 2012: 
11) to pursue their own business interests. In interviews during this study it was 
confirmed and accepted that  professionals use their government position  to pursue  
their own interests . However, there is no simple pattern: people can choose to follow 
patronage-driven or rational legal behaviours, or even combine them. As Leenstra (2012: 
302) argues in relation to donor interventions in Zambia, this means that  
the results of …interaction can never be planned or foreseen: the arena is complex, 
made up of competing and conflicting interests, and what is articulated is never a 
complete and accurate representation of real interests. 
A structure or process can become ordered or disordered so as to enable personal, 
group, or institutional benefit to be derived. On the one hand, disorder such as poor 
record keeping and information management can be not due to a lack of capacity, but a 
strategy to avoid accountability. Similarly, order, such as in the form of public service 
reform programme can provide an opportunity for consolidating power, diverting assets 
and resource accumulation. On a large enough scale these behaviours transcend the 
personal interests and become a way groups accumulate entitlements.  
46. The interplay of formal and informal logics can be  identified in mediation of presidential 
power, the differentiated approach to public debate, and within divisions of civil society. 
Since 1991, presidential power has been both supreme and severely curtailed in Zambia. 
The constitution of 1991  gives the President supreme power within the state over the 
allocation and oversight of the business of government. The President appoints the 
heads of the j udiciary, the public service, the Auditor General , eight members of
<<<PAGE=20>>>
13 
Parliament out of 150  and the attorney general. Although all of the appointments have 
to be vetted by Parliament, the President can either overrule this or secure the votes of 
opposition MPs to get to a majority of support (in addition to the 8 MPs he has the 
power to appoint). Further there is very limited decentralisation of decision -making and 
political power. Decentralisation has been discussed in Zambia since the 1990s , and a 
renewed policy was put in place earlier this year 6. Yet historically little has been 
achieved on this front , which places a limit on the  entry points for evaluation practice 
into the main central ministries. 
47. The political manoeuvres since 2011 highlight the power of the President over the 
legislature in the political economy. In 2011 just following the general election there 
were 18 deputy ministers (Times 2011), while today there are 41 deputy ministers (P. o. 
Zambia 2013). According to the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA), 13 of 
these deputy ministers are formerly opposition MPs who have resigned their seats and 
triggered by-elections of which the government has won five out of six (Geloo 2013). As 
Table 4 shows, this has led to  an outright majority for the Patriot ic Front by May 2013, 
even without opposition ministers voting for the government.  In effect, the President 
has the power to limit the actual power of parliamentary oversight. Yet, in spite of the 
supreme power granted by the constitution , two presidents have been removed from 
office by popular processes when they sought to extend their rule : Kaunda by civil 
society and then an election , and Chiluba by members of his own party and civil society 
(Phiri 2003 ). In both cases it appears that the President seems to have alienated 
important power networks. 
Table 4: Members of Parliament by Party 
 
48. Contradictions between the operations of formal rules are also in evidence in regards to 
reporting in the public space. Although within the constitution of Zambia the founding 
values of transparency and freedom of speech are ens hrined there is evidence that 
control over public debates is sought by politicians especially in regards to the media. 
According to Freedom House, all governments have harassed critics within Zambia’s 
press since the end of one party rule. The government a lso broadly controls the media 
through the issuing of licences through the Ministry of Information. Currently Freedom 
House rates the Zambian press as “Partly Free”, although is it on the borderline of “Not 
Free” (House 2013). Rakner (2012: 12) reports that “there is clear evidence that licenses 
are used in order to control the private media.” Defamation laws and website blocki ng

are other tools used to control negative reporting. For example, the Zambia n Watchdog, 
a critical website , has been shut down through a combination of court action and 
blocking of the website (Carlucci 2013 ). On the ot her hand, government officials and 
ministers are available and accessible. Political parties can also advertise in the daily 
newspapers and there is debate in public spaces, which was reportedly more thoroughly 
curtailed during Kaunda's regime (Kasoma et al. 1997). 
49. One final role-player that requires consideration in the political e conomy is civil society, 
especially organised interests. Civil society has sections with political power, although 
these tend to represent organised interest groups. Civil society has played an important 
role in bringing an end to the one party state and in opposing Chiluba’s attempt to run 
for a third term (Leenstra 2012 ). A well -cited example of civil society momentum was 
the OASIS forum, a grouping of NGOs and opposition parties formed to oppose Chiluba’s 
bid for a third  term. It is currently reported that civil  society activism is weak in Zambia 
(Rakner 2012). It was perceived during intervi ews that Zambian civil society weakness is 
based upon a highly polarised political environment with different civil society 
organisations supporting different political parties. A sign of this is the report by 
Coalition for the Defence of Democratic Rights  to the Commonwealth Secretariat 
outlining a range of reported abuses by the Patriotic Front government (Bandow 2013)7. 
A further issue that arose that during the research is that the rooting of section s of civil 
society in the country is shallow and responds rather to donor funding. One respondent 
referred to the ‘Lusaka Consensus’ in policy processes.  
50. Against these challenges in civil society there remain strong interest-based organisations 
that have insider links to government , such as the Farmers Union and the churches. 
These examples, which are further discussed in the body of the report, demonstrate that, 
just as with oth er institutions, the power of civil society is based upon its ability to 
access both formal rule -based mechanisms and informal relational spaces. Where they 
are unable to do this their power relies upon those who do have access and form 
alliances to further specific agendas. 
51. Understanding that complex barely visible forces whose objectives  are focused on 
securing group interests have a range of consequences for identifying and interpreting 
the supply and demand for evaluation. It means that ECD work needs t o recognise that 
policy influence , even when there appears to be a clear cut opening , is tenuous and 
incremental. Issues in state performance cannot be understood solely as a lack of 
capacity to implement formal bureaucratic norms, because more rules will only have a 
limited effect. ECD therefore needs to recogni se that the use of evaluation  is achieved 
by working in both the formal and informal spaces . The informal space is, however, very 
difficult to penetrate.  
3. MAPPING OF THE EVALUATION SUPPLY AND DEMAND SYSTEMS  
3.1 Principals

52. Principals are stakeholders that in the ma in demand evaluation (although can supply 
and mange evaluations on occasions) as a result of their political power and positioning. 
In this study , principals inc lude the Executive, civil society, the legislature and 
development partners. 
The Executive: The Presidency, Vice President and the Cabinet 
53. There is so me latent demand for evaluation  in the Executive. Transforming this to 
consistent actual demand within  the political context will be challenging as a variety of 
other considerations come into play . The latent demand for evaluation is embedded in 
an Executive that demands on-going monitoring reports of implementation . Large 
changes in policy on important is sues can spring from the Executive without public 
discourse. This  curtails transparency and access to information. Seemingly in 
contradiction, the Cabinet Office  emphasises transparency of participation in policy 
processes and is open to the use of evidence. This apparent contradiction highlights the 
meeting of different  objectives within the policy process  from the more political and 
bureaucratic parts of the Executive given the political economy. 
54. In the interviews it was reported that the Presidency has been demanding monitoring 
reports of programmes currently being financed and implemented  by government. For 
example, according to the Zambia Daily Mail “the President could not compreh end why 
it is hard to obtain up -to-date developmental information on provinces when 
permanent secretaries exist.” 8 On-going monitoring takes place  through a budget  
tracking tool, a sample of which is  shown in Appendix  1. The nature of the  demand for 
monitoring, however, needs further investigati on. First, evidence could not be found of 
poor performance being censured as a result of the monitoring . Second, it was reported 
in interviews that it was felt that this monitoring was not necessarily development 
results-orientated, but focused on prioriti es of the presidency. Third, it needs to be 
ascertained whether the political Executive has interest to go beyond monitoring and to 
establish through evaluation the quality of outcomes.  
55. The Cabinet Office, which is under the Presidency,  oversees and coordinates all policy 
emanating from government ministries through the Policy Analysis and Coordination 
(PAC) Division. A Permanent Secretary, who the President has the power to appoint, 
heads this division. The formulation of policy can be  based on some evidence defined at 
the sector level, but it is not standardised to conduct evaluation s or identify evidence in 
the policy process . It was reported by the Cabinet O ffice that the process of policy 
formulation is consultative involving a wide range of stakeholders. There were different 
perspectives o n the extent of th e consultation processes. Some reported that it was 
limited to Lusaka. Other reports, however, emphasise bottom-up aspects of the Zambian 
policy process 9. Ostensibly, the centralised policy process supports transparency and 
participation in decision-making. This means that the Cabinet Office is a potential entry 
point for demanding evaluations within policy consultation processes. 
56. In contrast to the open pro cesses of the Cabinet Office , there is evidence of restrictions 
which have  been put in place by the Presidency on the flow of information from

different sources. For example, challenges accessing the Zambian Watchdog website 10 
are reported to be a result of government action11. Rapid and important policy decisions 
are sometimes made by the Executive which are then debated in the public media and 
general society, for example, changes to fuel and maize subsidies  in the month of May, 
2013. Major civil society stakeholders were not consulted in the decision process . 
According to two media statements attributed to the President, Mr Michael Sata, the 
removal of fuel and maize subsidies is justified on the grounds that the subsidies do not 
actually benefit the poor  and, therefore, funds saved from subsidies if applied to 
construction of infrastructure such as roads, schools and health facilities could benefit 
the poor more  (Chellah 2013). This case is considered in Error! Reference source not 
ound..  
57. According to interviews t here are certain sectors that the Presidency pays more 
attention to  if undertaking evaluation s. One such is infrastructure development , 
particularly roads. Recently the Roads Agency has be en centralised in the Presidency, 
with the  contracts from the previous administration cancelled. The evidence fr om the 
interviews suggests that procurement , especially of infrastructure, is an area where the 
political Executive remains quite hands-on and so may be a sensitive area for evaluative 
activities. 
Box 1: Farmer Input Subsidies Programme 
The current national debate on maize subsidies highlights the interplay and possible entry 
points for evaluation that arise s in the interplay between  various interest groups around 
policy processes. Although actual informal agendas are difficult to pin down there is enough 
information around this issue to demonstrate points o f entry for evaluation  in the debate . A 
national debate in the media between a various interest groups was sparked by an 
announcement by the President of a change in the subsidies regime  (widely reported as 
subsidies removal)  on the basis that the money could be better spent on infrastructure 
development. 
Farming s ubsidies in Za mbia cut across the value chain  with three main forms of 
intervention. The first is the Food Reserves A gency (FRA), which purchases maize from 
farmers. The second is the farmer input support programme (FISP), which provides targeted 
households with fertili ser. The third are subsidies to millers of maize aimed to help control 
the price of maize. Together these three programmes account for 80% of government 
spending on agriculture  and suffer  regular and very large  overruns, as reported by the 
President:  
…during 2012, the budget allocation for the FISP was K500 billion against actual expenditure of 
K1.181 trillion, representing a budget overrun of K681.2 billion; while during the year 2011, 
K485 billion was budgeted against actual expenditure of K1,354.70 trillion, representing a 
budget overrun of K869.7 billion….In addition, during 2010, K100 billion was budgeted under 
the Food Reserve Agency (FRA)  maize marketing programme against actual expenditure of 
K2.6 trillion, representing a budget overrun of K2.5 trillion; while in 2011, K150 billion was 
budgeted against actual expenditure of K3.2 trillion representing a budget overrun of K3.0 
trillion12.  
These subsidies operate to  achieve multiple  objectives. Ostensibly, the aim of these 
interventions is to provide cheaper food and reduce poverty in rural areas, but according to

research and reports actual benefits  accrue to more specific groups  (Mason et al. 2013 ). 
Purchasing of food by the FRA has provided above-market prices for maize for a number of 
years. For example, FRA purchased 83% of the marketed surplus  between 2010 and 201213. 
Mason and Myers (2013: 203)  show that that the FRA’s intervention in maize  
“…raised mean prices between July 20 03 and December 2008 by 17 –19%...which assisted 
surplus maize producers but adversely affected net buyers of maize in Zambia, namely urban 
consumers and the majority of the rural poor”.  
As a consequence the study concluded that:  
…the increase in maize price stability is unlikely to have had substantial welfare effects on poor 
households. In contrast, relatively wealthy producers are likely to have benefited from the 
higher average and more stable maize prices resulting from FRA policies. 
Research on FISP has found very little evidence of poverty reduction through the maize 
subsidies (Mason et al. 2013; Ricker-Gilbert et al. 2013). In investigating the net impact of the 
scheme on food prices, Ricker-Gilbert found that doubling the size of the input scheme would 
reduce maize prices by a maximum of 1.6%. On the other hand research by the same group  
(Mason et al. 2013: v ) found that the FISP was “being disproportionately allocated to better -
off households above the $1.25/day poverty line.”  Further, prior to 2011 constituencies won 
by the MMD recei ved “significantly more s ubsidised fertiliser than those in areas lost by the 
ruling party” . Media, Auditor General and civil society investigations into the allocation of 
FISP have confirmed challenges in its targeting with their own investigations14. 
The organisation Civil Society for Poverty Reduction (CSPR) is opposing the reduction in 
subsidies claiming that it  is critical to smallholder farmers.  The Zambia National Farmers 
Union (ZNFU) has claimed that hunger will i ncrease with a change in subsidy, arguing that 
“providing support to poor rural farmers in form of agricultural inputs is not a subsidy but a 
mandatory responsibility on the part of Government .”15 Finally, subsidies to millers have not 
been passed onto consumers in the form of cheaper maize meal from larger millers. Instead 
the informal sector has been able to process maize meal at lower costs leading to a reduction 
in price, though large millers are able to negate competition through the subsidy16. 
Against this background, where the benefits of subsidies currently consistently accrue to 
those who are better  off rather than the poor , government has been attempting to reform 
maize subsidies. For example, this has resulted in the introduction of a barte r system and 
electronic distribution for the beneficiaries of FISP.  The government ha s subsequently been 
reported as stating their support for FISP, rather than a focus on the long -term removal of 
subsidies17. The 2013 citizen s’ budget, which is a simplifie d version of the annual  budget, 
highlighting popular expenditure and revenues, notes that the  2013 FISP and FRA are still 
budgeted to receive K800 billion between them18.   
What this case illustrates is the gap between formal policy intent (poverty reduction) and 
actual implementation (rents accruing to more powerful interests) and  the complex array of 
interests mobilised around a policy shift. Given this , there are potential entry points for 
evidence to retarget the subsidy , and also to remove the subsidy, by conducting evaluations 
with civil society, farmers or the government. On the other hand , long-term research advice 
is harder to come by generally, but in this instance was provided by Indaba Agricultural 
Policy Research Institute (IAPRI), which is supported by SIDA and USAID.

However, what actual policy implementation ends up looking like is difficult to predict given 
the array of vested interests and the potential that actual interests are only being partially 
articulated publically as those who gain through large budget overspends on the programme 
will use the language of poverty reduction to defend their interests. 
Civil Society Organisations 
58. Civil Society and its role in politics in Zambia has been shaped by a history of 
authoritarian traditions, first during the colonial area, and later on during one-party rule. 
For several decades, civil society was largely restricted to activity within the agendas and 
control of the state, until it coalesced on two separate occasions into a major opposition 
movement (1991 and 1999) . This means that civil society has shifted between 
supporting and opposing government in various phases.  Though civil society has some 
broad challenges  (discussed belo w) which reduce its  ability to engage in advocacy 
through evaluation, there are some  organisations identified during this study who are 
well equipped for presenting their interests in both  the formal  and informal political 
economy, namely: Civil Society for Poverty Reduction  (CSPR); the Jesuit Centre for 
Theological Reflection (JCTR); Transparency International (TIZ);  and the Zambia National 
Farmers Union. This list could be expanded, but in the scope of this research it gives a 
feel for some of the entry p oints for  evaluative activity by civil society and its 
connections with policy. 
59. A robust and balanced participation of the civil society is still impeded by five factors 
even though the role of the civil society has continued to grow 19. First, there is a lack of 
institutionalised mechanisms for citizens’ participation in decision -making other than 
elections and political parties.  An example of this is the current constitutional 
development process. The Oasis forum , a body made up by a range of ci vil society 
groups, recently bemoaned the lack of participation in the process  that has been 
undertaken over six years20. Second, the relationship of government and civil society has 
been confrontational with regard to issues of governance, participation, h uman rights 
and the rule of law. An example of this is the recent NGO Act that was enacted in a short 
space of time without consultation  and has led to tension between civil society and 
government21.  Third, a large number of civil society organisations are based at national 
level, and have limited local representation. For example, Civicus (2010) found that 49% 
of civil society organisations in Zambia operated in Lusaka. The rest of the operations are 
spread out over the  9 other provinces with no more than 13% of the civil society  
organisations working in any other single area . This analysis reinforces a term that 
emerged during interviews that there can be a ‘Lusaka consensus ’ in decision-making. 
Fourth, organisational and monetary constraints often force  organisations to serve their 
own survival needs  and compromise on larger goals of development and change  
(Civicus, 2010: 12) . For example, Civicus (2010: 73) found that the focus of civil society 
more or less mirrored the development partner priorities and that organisations were 
almost entirely depend ent upon funding from these agencies. Finally,  there are 
challenges around  the coordination and collaboration within and between actors. For 
example, the organisational survey findings from the Civicus (2010: 45) study shows that 
                                                      
19 The following list has drawn from Maitra’s (1998) observations and recent work by Civicus (2010).

networking and communications tends to be more within the membership of umbrella 
groupings, rather than across the looser networks or alliances formed to address topical 
issues. 
60. These issues  mean that  although there are some stronger civil society organisations , 
broadly the sector has little collective weight and reach through which  formal or 
informal policy networks are influenced . Concisely put , civil society lacks many 
institutional entry points with government or the formation within itself to act as a 
persuasive agent. An example of this is the constitution process in which civil society has 
been involved that has not been finalised in six years.  There are some examples that 
have more reach, which are discussed below.  
61. CSPR, established in 2000, is an anti-poverty advocacy network of over 140 organisations, 
whose objective is to work for pro-poor development in different parts of Zambia . CSPR 
seeks to  ensure that civil society participates effectively and meaningfully in design, 
formulation, implementation and monitoring through sourcing evidence -based data . 
Budget tracking an d service delivery monitoring are  listed as current project s. Although 
no project reports have been updated on the website since 2010 , CSPR provides regular 
commentary in the media on poverty reduction efforts and budget allocations. CSPR also 
provided inputs to the recent draft policy for planning and budgeting following a 
submission to Parliament on the same issue. Given this ongoing activity, CSPR is an entry 
point for demanding evaluation activities to inf orm advocacy and policy infl uencing 
activities of civil society. In this regard , ECD activities could focus on identifying and 
demanding evaluative activit ies and perhaps managing these in a manner  that could 
further feed into CSPR’s and other similar organisations’ policy-influencing work. 
62. JCTR is a research, education and advocacy organisation that promotes study and action 
on issues linked to Christian faith and social justice in Zambia. JCTR began operating in 
1988 as a project of the Zambia -Malawi Province of the Society of Jesus with similar  
orientation and activities as other  Jesuit social centres around the world. JCTR is an 
important research advocacy organisation politically, based upon their history  and the 
prominent position of Christianity in the Zambian constitution. In the preamble to the 
constitution, the country  is defined as a  Christian nation and society . According to 
Afrobarometer, an independent, nonpartisan  cross-country research project that 
measures the social, political, and economic issues, religion is very important for 93% of 
people in Zambia , the joint second highest out of 31 African countries 22. It is reported 
that for Kaunda and Chil uba, losing the support of the churches was a major blow to 
their efforts to remain in power (Phiri, 2003).  
63. The JCTR produces the basic needs basket analysis. This analysis compares a basket of 
basic goods with the take-home pay of Zambians. This analysis is conducted in both rural 
and urban areas and is used for advocacy purposes  with government, communities and 
NGOs23. The rural analysis is important as it provide s external verification of ongoing 
poverty issues in Zambia. The JCTR used the basic needs analysis as a base for inputs into 
major polic y decisions. Recently, it has  provided input to the new draft planning and 
budgeting policy discussed in the previous section.

64. Transparency International Zambia  (TI-Z) was established in 2001.  TI-Z is a professional 
membership organization focused on  anti-corruption, integrity, leadership and good 
governance. TI-Z has been a vocal campaigner on corruption issues in Zambia . For 
example, it has openly criticised the current administration and pow erful actors such as 
the Police Service. A major publication towards which the local chapter contributes is 
the corruption barometer. In addition , TI-Z is pushing towards commissioning more 
advanced evaluation activities such as public expenditure tracking surveys.  
65. The Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) is an organisation that has high-level access 
and the ability to influence policy based  on its representation in the formal and informal 
agrarian sectors, representing a sizable economic and employment in terest. Its breadth 
of membership makes it one of the few organisations in Zambia to be able to claim 
country-wide reach. Its website claims that apart from churches, the ZNFU is one of the 
oldest associations in Zambia, having existed from the early 1900s. 
66. One of the main evaluation and advocacy mechanisms used by the ZNFU is the 
Agriculture Production Survey for which “data was collected from a sample of 4,000 
households.”24 Further the ZNFU makes detailed budget submissions drawing upon a 
range of evidence sources 25. It  was reported in interviews that  the ZNFU enjoys high -
level access to the government with ministers regularly attending ZNFU events. 
Notwithstanding the recent reducti on in the maize subsidy the ZNFU has been able to 
defend a variety of protections enjoyed by the farming industry. For example, a wheat 
import ban still remains in force , while the ZNFU is advocating strongly on payments to 
farmers for government maize purchases and for quotas for trade with the Democratic 
Republic of Congo26.  
67. Overall this mapping shows that there are a variety of entry points  for evaluation 
activities through civil society organisations in Zambia , although there are issues in the 
structure of civil society . Organisations can be identified that can demand, manage and 
implement a variety of types of evaluation exercises and take these into both formal and 
informal policy spaces.  There is no single champion within civil society : instead, as with 
policy influencing in general, there are multiple entry points with a variety of skills that 
may be better placed for different roles  and interests  in supporting opportunities for 
evaluation. 
The Legislature - Parliament 
68. Across a wide number of sources consulted during this study the message consistent ly 
arose that the legislature in Zambia has limited power of oversight in relation to the 
Executive (Rakner, 2012: 16; Civicus, 2010: 31).  The turnover in Parliament has been 
high, for example, in 2011, 60% of parliamentarians were new, especially in the ranks of 
the Patriotic Front 27. Subsequent by-elections have increased the number of new 
members in the chamber . This mea ns that the Parliament is currently operating with a 
relatively inexperienced number of  representatives with an assertive Executive. Further,

key committees such as the Parliamentary Accounts Committee are reconstituted ev ery 
year. This means that only half the members of the committee serve for the full term of 
the Parliament28. Parliament provides limited oversight on the Executive through its 
parliamentary committee system, as well as through the Vice President’s (rather than 
President’s) question time every Friday when Parliament is in session.  
69. There are some mechanisms for ev aluation in the legislature.  For example, there could 
be some ECD opportunities within the  Research Section of the legislature. The Research 
Section of the National Assembly of Zambia was established to serve parliamentarians in 
two main ways: i) provide information and evidence to Members of Parliament (MPs) 
who wish to make a private members motion; and ii) prepare background papers (briefs) 
for MPs who may attend local or international workshops or seminars. The Research 
Section has twelve researchers.  For the most part, the Research Section does not 
establish its o wn research agenda. It responds to MPs ’ information requests and 
requirements. Recently, h owever, it has started conducting research in anticipation of 
the information that might be required a nd needed by the MPs. The Research Section is 
currently conducting evaluative research to ascertain the effectiveness of some of the 
aspects of the parliamentary reforms whose implementation begun towards the end of 
2002. The funding of this research is co ming from the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP). 
70. The Public Accounts Committee reviews and makes recommendations on the re ports 
from the Auditor General (which receives around 70% of its budget from Norwegian Aid). 
The report s of the Auditor Gene ral, with the response s by Parliament, are released 
electronically more than a year after the period reviewed .  For example, the report for 
the year ending  31 December 2011 was released on 18 July 2013.  The Auditor G eneral 
also underta kes audits of other public entities, such as parastatal bodies.  Among 
parastatals there are failures to convene boards of directors, failure to prepare financial 
statements and poor management of infrastructure  (A. G. Zambia 2011 ). Among 
museums, there are no strategic plan s, weaknesses in the documentation of artefacts, 
and transportation is not maintained.  Responsibility for the remediation of the  issues 
rests with the Secretary to the Treasury, who must enforce these with line departments. 
The main challenge  is that the Treasury struggles to enforce change . T his will be 
discussed in the next section.  Although Parliament can only offer recommendations  
there might be scope  for improved use and follow -up of the audit products as well as 
increasing the scope of performance audits. Given the rapid turnover in committee staff, 
capacity development efforts might well focus on the staff of committees.  
71. Although firm oversight is limited, the legislature  does have a role in convening  
processes to discuss policy with multiple stakeholders, although final decisions are made 
in the Cabinet O ffice. For example, digital migration for the SADC region was 
implemented in Zambia through par ticipation of relevant stakeholders such as the 
media, civil society organisations and interested individuals.

Development Partners 
72. There is limited evidence that e valuations in Zambia are conducted as country-led 
process. This findi ng is in alignment wit h the Second Phase Evaluation of the Paris 
Declaration, which  notes that mutual accountability mechanisms are weak  between 
development partners and the Government29 . However, there are some existing 
mechanisms that are being used to support ECD which could be built upon. 
73. Interviews with evaluators conceded that most evaluations were commissioned and 
managed by development partners.  Recent evaluations related to cash transfers 30, 
European cooperation 31, the joint assistance strategy 32 and anti -corruption efforts 33 
were all commissioned and managed by development partners , and led by evaluators 
external to Zambia , with some cooperation from government . These findings highlight 
those important evaluations  on development, which have resource implications are 
regularly conducted exogenously to the state. On the other hand, development partners 
have supported a range of activities related to completing important surveys and 
developing statistical capacity. 
74. There are development partner efforts that are direc tly and indirectly supportive of ECD 
within Zambia. The largest amount of efforts quantitatively seek to engage in 
performance and  accountability related reforms, especially related to public finances  
(including the Auditor General ), with  8 out of the 11 development partners reviewed 
supporting this area of work (see Table 5 below). This work should be coordinated under 
the Joint Assistance Strategy as there is an outcome focuse d on the area. Another focus 
of development partners  that provides indirect support to evaluation is in funding civil 
society organisations  ability to demand accountability and to advocate with 
government. Here 6 out of 11 development partners have related funding.  
75. A challenge with leveraging this support is in understanding how the political economy is 
interacting with these programmes.  The evaluation of the Public Expenditure 
Management and Financial Acc ountability (PEMFA) Programme , a maj or initiative that 
lasted six years and cost USD  74 million, highlights the risks, especially of public finance 
interventions. The evaluation concluded that:  
In all of the twelve technical components, goals and objectives have either not 
been achieved at all or they have been delivered much later than programme 
design had envisaged. Where PEMFA has attempted directly to improve PFM 
processes, procedures and human resource capacities, in many ca ses this has not 
been achieved.34  
The challenges around this large and important public sector reform programme 
highlight that case-by-case analysis (perhaps from a political economy perspective) 
needs to be undertaken to understand the value of each reform initiative to ECD.

76. Direct support to developing evaluation demand amongst principals is somewhat limited 
in scope. The three main areas of support have been to the evaluation of the FNDP 
through the Ministry of Finance (to be discussed later), the upcoming demographic 
health survey, and a centre of M&E excellence at the University of Zambi a that mainly 
conducts training . Only the support to the evaluations of the FNDP has some local 
demand-side linkages. 
77. Two additional support mechanisms exist for evaluation through the coordination 
mechanisms of development partners , Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps) and  the new 
Joint Assistance Strategy . First, there does seem to be some promise in Sector Wide 
Approaches (SWAps) to support ECD. The potential of SWAps to support ECD is 
emphasised within the e valuations on the Paris Declaration  (Chigunta and Matshalaga 
2010). All of these documents emphasise that SWAps have produced improved 
coordination and lead to more evaluative  activities taking place. Second, t he Join t 
Assistance Strategy 2011 – 2015, which is aligned to the SNDP, is a point of reference for 
development partners. For example, both USAID refer s to the strategy in outlining their 
own country strategies  (USAID 2011 ). In this joint assistance strategy there is an 
emphasis placed on “using systematic information to improve decision -making” 
(Partners 2013: 14 ). It is intended that capacity development efforts are to be 
undertaken with the Ministry of Finance and Central Statistics Office . In addition, the 
partners have formed an M&E group through which monitoring and evaluation issues 
are discussed, strategy developed and funding coordinated to some extent.  
78. The above analysis reinforces that a number of entry points for supporting ECD do exist 
in Zambia. The challenge is that many of the opportunities are latent within larger public 
service reform efforts.  Further, there are limited functioning coordinating m echanisms, 
such as SWAps or Sector Advisory Groups.  This means that entry points  need to be 
nurtured in a context where there is a limited history of country -led evaluations and the 
potential support to evaluation is in the main  indirect. The direct work i n ECD, with the 
Ministry of Finance, University of Zambia, and Central Statistics O ffice are considered 
separately below.

Ministry of Finance and Sector Ministries 
79. In restructuring the Ministry of Finance 2008 a separate M& E Department was 
established with a mandate and responsibilities to monitor and evaluate the national 
development plan. Since 2010, a separate programme for evaluations and research 
exists, Research and Development Programme (RDP), which has coordinated se ctor 
specific analyses but also the final evaluation of the FNDP. Within the Ministry of 
Finance there is an actual demand for evaluations to support with policy processes, 
especially to ensure that the MTEF and annual budgets are based on analytical resea rch 
and M&E results. Responding to this, within the RDP an annual research and evaluation 
plan is issued in conjunction with the line ministries. In interviews it was emphasised 
that the Ministry of Finance has decent technical skills, a degree of manageme nt buy-in 
to evaluation and a commitment to implementing policy in accordance with rules 
(although at times these are circumvented). In other words, the Ministry of Finance was 
considered to have a commitment to development in alignment with formal rules a nd 
processes. 
80. There are three overarching challenges to implementing the annual research and 
evaluation plan, the first is human, the second is financial capacity, the third, 
institutional. Interviewees reported that currently, the M&E Department spends a good 
amount of time on the monthly monitoring exercise as part of supporting the new 
government wide M&E system (GW -MES) demanded by State House using the tool 
provided as a sample at Appendix 1. Stakeholders reported that the monthly reporting 
system has posed a challenge as most other ministries have limited capacity to populate 
it with the required data and information. This means that staff from the M&E 
Department need to spend time following -up with line Ministries. The issue here is that 
monitoring might crowd out attention to evaluation. It is also important to note that the 
implementation of Government Wide M&E is a new demand and represents a potential 
expansion of the mandate of the Ministry of Finance. However, it was reported in 
interviews that there is ambiguity around who owns the M&E system as there is an M&E 
unit in the cabinet office. This study could not find any evidence of their activities. 
81. The human resource challenge is reinforced as currently the coordination of the 
evaluations of the F NDP is carried out by an external consultant. The consultancies to 
undertake the evaluations of the FNDP have been paid for by development partners (EU, 
UN, JICA and GIZ) and only one component by the Ministry of Finance. The contribution 
of the Government  / Ministry of Finance is significant for all consultations, technical 
committee, publications and dissemination of results; the Cooperating Partners were 
approached to sponsor the consultancies only. This demonstrates a commitment within 
the Ministry of Finance to support ongoing evaluative exercises. 
82. Institutionally, the Ministry of Finance in Zambia is still developing compared to other 
very strong centre of government Finance Ministries in other African countries (e.g. 
Rwanda, South Africa). Consequentl y, it may not have the institutional legitimacy to be 
able to implement, advocate for and maintain a government -wide evaluation function. 
The challenges around the authority of the Ministry of Finance have been raised 
explicitly and implicitly. Explicitly,  Leiderer and Faust (2012: 167) state that “i n contrast 
to several of its counterparts in the region, the Zambian finance ministry is relatively 
weak politically and, as a consequence, has not been able to involve the sector 
ministries in an effective reform of public financial management.” Implicitly, the
<<<PAGE=33>>>
26 
challenges around exerting power from the Ministry of Finance can be identified in 
ongoing expenditure management challenges.  Although this judgement does not 
directly extend to the M&E unit, it does raise questions about the institutional strength 
of the Ministry. This is explored in Box 2. 
Box 2: Evidence in the Budget Cycle 
A review of the documents and announcements surrounding the budget cycle present a 
differentiated picture. The Open Budget Survey of 2012, for example, rates Zambia in the 
global bottom ten of its ranking with a score of 4 out of 100. Previously in 2010, Zambia 
scored 36 out of 100. In the current budget cycle, it appears that improvements are being put 
in place, which may facilitate improved entry points for evidence in the budget cycle.  
The national budget cycle in Zambia has four main stages: a) budget preparation by the 
Ministry of Finance base d on submissions by ministries and departments and by various 
stakeholders, including the civil society and private sector; b) budget authori sation or 
approval by Parliament; c) budget execution by ministries and departments; and d) audit by 
the Auditor-General’s office with follow-up by Parliament.   
A number of documents to improve the budget process became publicly available in 2013. A 
citizens’ budget has been put in place; public submissions to the budget process are being 
invited44; the MTEF, and the full activity -based budget, are available on  the Ministry of 
Finance’s website; and budget performance figures are available for the first quarter45. 
The national budget as prepared by the Ministry of Finance has the potential to be informed 
by a range of recent surveys produced  with the  Central Statistical Office  and development 
partners, such as, the Census,  Crop Survey ’s and the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey 
Reports. It was reported in interviews  that analyses like the gender assessments  have fe d 
into budgeting processes . The results of the Annual Progress Reports (APR) of the National 
Development Plan are utilis ed in drafting the MTEF and the annual budgets , when available. 
As noted in the earlier section t here are civil society organis ations that play a role, in 
monitoring the implementation of the national budget.  
However, there remains a gap in transparency around government expenditure  until the 
Auditor General report becomes available, up to 18 months after the end of the budget year. 
This usually leads to additional budget votes to make expenditure legal.  
During the preparation stage there is potential for the influence of evaluations. Those making 
submissions such as the JCTR, Economics Association of Zambia, CSPR and the ZNFU have the 
burden to prove their case to the Ministry of Finance. Past this initial stage , it is difficult to 
track implementation. According to interviews there is some evidence of technical demand 
for evaluation to feed into the  budget process , for example, through t he current round of 
evaluations and research being conducted by the Ministry of Finance.   
83. For line ministries and agencies there is no consistent system and mechanism to 
evaluate policy performance beyond annual performance reviews, which mainly focus 
on monitoring information. This study was unable to identify any electronic copies of 
annual programme review documents  although evaluations do confirm that they have 
taken place46.

84. The Ministries of Health and Education  have recognised M&E systems . The Ministry of 
Health has an active M&E Unit in the Planning Department which is also home to the 
Health Management Information System (HMIS). However, the M&E unit is much 
stronger on monitoring, which is undertaken monthly and reported on quarterly , than 
evaluation. The Ministry of Health undertakes a Joint Annual Review with their partners 
which have evaluative dimensions as well conducting  mid-term reviews of its strategic 
plans. HMIS enables the Ministry to collect  data and information on three major 
diseases, namely: malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS.  The Ministry of Education 
also manages the Education Management Information System (EMIS).  
85. The mid-term and the end -term review/evaluation of a policy are seldom undertaken 
except in situations where a development partner is nudging and financing. As a case in 
point is the Ministry of Education HIV/AIDS Work Place Policy  which was financed by 
UNICEF. Table 6 highlights some of the evaluations that have been undertaken  beyond 
routine information collection. Box 3 explores the links between evidence and policy.

Box 3: HIV and AIDS Response 
In Zambia there is a history of developing an evidence -based response to HIV with work 
between development partners, civil society and the government. This shows that 
development partner led efforts can support development results and capacity development. 
The development of the evidence base over the last 25 years has meant t hat the drivers of 
the epidemic have been understood.  HIV transmission in Zambia is primarily through 
heterosexual contact and this mode of transmission is exacerbated by the high prevalence of 
sexually transmitted infections ( STIs), the poor socio-economic status of women and high -
risk sexual practices ( such as  age at first sex debut, multiple and concurrent partners  and 
condom use).  
Evidence is then taken into practice through a consultative process that involves the National 
AIDS Council ( which is a form of Sector Advisory Group). For example, in November 2009, 
stakeholders at the National HIV Prevention Conference reviewed the drivers of the epidemic 
and these were included into the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Framework 2011 – 2015, 
which included p revention and control of tuberculosis, treatment of other opportunistic 
infections, access to ant i-retroviral (ARV) drugs, utilis ation of alternative and/or traditional 
medicines, promotion of appropriate nutrition, support to the infected and affected, su pport 
to orphans and vulnerable children as well as support to high risk and vulnerable groups 
(disabled groups, commercial sex workers, prisoners, refugees and long distance truck 
drivers). While all these measures have been implemented , their success rat es differ from 
one to the other with the most successful being provision of free ARVs through the ART 
programme. Appreciable gains have been made in the area of HIV and AIDS with the 
assistance of evidence.  
However, there still remain some key challenges to accessing the many services that are 
available in the country. Again evidence is available to help shape the changing nature of the

epidemic. For example , it is known that HIV and AIDS related stigmatization and 
discrimination threaten the effectiveness of HIV prevention, care and support programmes.  
Much of the HIV and AIDS work is funded by development partners yet it has led to a range of 
research publications that have involved  Zambians and helped build local capacities in 
evidence-based participatory policy definition. This shows that development partner efforts 
can be a pre -cursor to endogenous activities, for example, through the new Centre for 
Excellence in M&E at the University of Zambia. 
The Central Statistical Office 
86. The Central Statistical Office, the custodian of official government data,  has conducted a 
range of important statistical surveys. Organisationally, it is a department that reports to 
the Ministry of Finance. There is evidence of some of these products being used in public 
debate and for government planning documents. However, the Office  has capacity 
issues and needs external assistance to complete products. The Office completes regular 
inflation figures and GDP figures. Some of the surveys undertaken in the last four years 
are listed in Table 7. 
Table 7: Central Statistics Office surveys 
87. Central Statistics Office  gets both financial and technical assistance from development 
partners to complete these surveys , particularly USAID , DFID, GIZ  and Macro 
International. While the Census received a large amount of government funding 
(approximately USD 50 million) there was a DFID contribution of GBP 3.5 million.  
88. Some staff members are provided with advanced training in statistics especially by 
Macro International and Measure Evaluation. The M&E Centre of Excellence at the 
University of Zambia’s Department of Population Studies also provides some training o n 
statistical approaches.  
89. A number of challenges with the management of statistics were identified . During 
interviews it was reported that datasets often required substantial work before they 
could be used for analysis. This account  is substantiated by other sources. For example, 
the GDP indicator has been rebased. Further, in supporting the completion of the LCMS, 
DFID reported that the 2006 data needed to be re keyed. Additionally, issues around the 
project management of both the LCMS and Census led to delays in the release of data. It 
seems to be agreed that the Central Statistical Office needs long -term support, but the 
extent to which this is in-country or remote needs further clarification. 
90. In spite of the challenges there does appear to be demand from the Ministry of Finance 
to improve and use  statistical information. For example, it was reported that the re -
keyed data from 2006 was used in the formulation of the SNDP and the new data from 
2010 was used in the final report of the FNDP. Both LCMS 2006 and 2010 have also been 
used in the micro -macro simulator ZAMMOD, which is used for forecasting impact and 
expenditure of major GRZ policies and programmes.  Further the health surveys are used 
in formulating development partner and the ministries responses. However, there is no

report of high-level political demand for using survey information  or systems that entail 
review by politicians. 
3.3 Evaluation Agents 
Think Tanks 
91. In Zambia there is an in teresting emerging  array of  think tanks conducting policy 
relevant analysis in important and sensitive policy areas.  The Zambia Institute of Policy 
Analysis and Research (ZIPAR) undertakes good quality , policy relevant economic 
analysis, linked to government agents and provide evaluative recommendations  to 
principals. ZIPAR’s focus is on the  production of high quality analysis that feeds in to 
public debate and public education on economics . ZIPAR was set -up with support from 
the previous MMD Governm ent and only became operational in 2011 , as the 
government was changing, although it still receive d financial support from the public 
funds and development partners into 2012. This formation led to the impression that it 
was an MMD think tank. After the 20 11 election when the Patriotic Front formed a 
government a new Director was appointed and has been working to establish ZIPAR as a 
non-partisan think tank 
92. ZIPAR’s strategy is to build slowly. During interviews with ZIPAR it was emphasised that 
they focus upon undertaking in-depth analysis rather than rapid reviews . This approach 
is verified in their products, for example, they have produced detailed public analysis of 
the auditor general’s reports, the 2012 budget, and of the implications for the reduction 
in fuel subsidies for the poor. ZIPAR does undertake commissioned work. For example, 
they undertook an analysis of the constituency development fund for th e Presidency, 
recommending and starting to develop  an allocation formula.  Further t hey have 
presented work to the Committee of Estimates in Parliament on Mining Taxation.  
93. Managing this range of work was reported to be challenging as the capacity on both the 
demand and supply sides is limited.  For example, although they are interested in  
engaging in experimental and quasi -experimental impact evaluations, they have not had 
the opportunity  to do so , nor do they have the capacity to lead one.  Other than the 
Executive Director , who is a PhD holder , other staff members are at master’s degree 
level and are having to learn quickly on the job. 
94. ZIPAR reported that in their experience there are some pockets of demand for 
evaluation, but the Government does not seem to be organised to actually commission 
evaluation studies. Although in their work they have not undertaken many projects with 
the Ministry of Finance , they recognise that there is political will within the Ministry for 
supporting evidence in policy processes.  
95. The Policy Monitoring and Research Centre (PMRC)  is a relatively new think tank that 
was incubated in the structures of the Patriotic Front with some core funding from DFID. 
Since the 2011 election , it has received funding from the government.  The composition 
of its board includes Wynter Kabimba, the Secretary General of the Patriotic  Front and 
current Justice Minister . The management of the PMRC state that they have 
independence from the government and the party and have on occasions produced 
information that is critical of government performance and plans. For example, on the 
implementation process of th e SNDP. The PMRC has access to  government agents and 
political principals.
<<<PAGE=37>>>
30 
96. The PMRC generate  produces Policy Analysis , Infographics, and a variety  of special 
discussions named Series and Hard Talk47. Policy briefs have been presented t o a range 
of Ministers. Hard Talk is a recorded interview with Ministers where they are presented 
with and questioned on various challenging pieces of information related to their 
departments. PMRC appears to have good access to political principals and is  able to 
leverage these to enter into discussions. 
97. PMRC, in contrast to ZIPAR, have focused on generating a large quantity of products on 
a wide range of subjects. A lot of these products use cartoons  and graphics as part of 
their style of communication  making them quite accessible . PMRC, similar to ZIPAR , 
does not have postdoctoral researchers and relies on people with masters degrees. In its 
work with government , PMRC had identified health and education as organised and 
interested in using evidence.    
98. The Indaba Agricultural Policy Research Institute (IAPRI) is a non-profit company limited 
by guarantee and collaboratively works with public and private stakeholders. IAPRI exists 
to carry out agricultural policy research and outreach, serving the agricultur al sector in 
Zambia so as to contribute to sustainable pro -poor agricultural development. Their 
website currently lists seven researchers in addition to management structures.  Their 
main funding comes through USAID and SIDA. Michigan State University support their 
research development. They publish technical, policy and working papers. Their research 
products are often based on quantitative studies. During the recent food subsidies 
debate their evidence featured prominently in the national media. 
Universities 
99. It is difficult to get an overall picture of the state of university research and education in 
Zambia as the Higher Education Council is only now going to be set -up and the 
universities do not keep record s of their research output . In Zambia the Universities of 
the Copper Belt and Zambia  are the only ones to offer their  own PhD degrees. The third 
public university, Mulungushi, was founded in 2008 and is accepts only undergraduate 
students. There are also a number of private Universities that of fer postgraduate 
qualifications either through linkages to public universities or foreign universities. 
100. Zambian universities ’ ability to produce research is limited. The Southern African 
Regional Universities Association (SARUA) reported that in Zambia “the majority of 
universities are characterised by low research output and few scientific publications (as 
is common in most African countries)” . The SARUA 2012 profile of Zambian universities 
noted that there were only 11 PhD students enrolled in universities. Out of 1024  
university staff , only 255 (about 22%) have doctoral degrees (Kotecha et al. 2012 ). 
Currently Zambia has only one active journal publication in the last year identified in this 
study, the medical journal was last published in 2012 48. The Schimago Institutions 
Ranking, that produces a ranking against some main dimensions of research 
performance, rates only the University of Zambia . Currently the University of Zambia is 
top of the country ranking, 51 in the Africa region  and 1881. The University of Zambia 
has increased its research output from 353 articles over 2004–2008 to 510 articles from

31 
2007– 201149. This is the only current collated information on research output in Zambia  
(SARUA, 2012). 
101. Against this background the “demand for higher education institutions is very high 
and is far from bein g satisfied” (SARUA, 2012: 108).  A recent World Bank report found 
Zambian higher education to be regressive, only being open to a rich segment of the 
population. The challenge with the sec tor was recognised by the President who noted 
during his first opening of Parliament that “ our universities and colleges do not only 
have dilapidated infrastructure but are also faced with shortage of staff and apt teaching 
and learning materials .”50 A higher education bill has been introduced to Parliament to 
help to address the coordination and resource challenges. 
102. Although there are challenges , there are  social scientists who can  engage in 
evaluation, specifically in health, agriculture and demography . The Institute of National 
Economic and Social Research (INESOR)  is active in research. INE SOR has qualified staff 
with PhD and masters level qualifications and it is headed by a professor who is the 
director of the institute.  Currently they undertake resea rch on agriculture, economics, 
governance, health, urban development and socio -cultural research51. It is the research 
and consultancy arm of the University of Zambia. INESOR has been involved in a number 
of high profile evaluations including evaluation of some components of the FNDP. 
103. Meanwhile, the M&E Centre of Excellence has  received a sizable grant of USD  5.9 
million over five years that can help develop the research and teaching based for 
evaluation in the country . In achieving this aim the University has four short courses on 
data analysis, epidemiology for data use, the integration of population variables to 
development planning and plan ning monitoring and evaluation. In addition they have a 
module for fourth year undergraduate students on M&E and  are planning to launch a 
Master’s degree in Monitoring and Evaluation.52    
Evaluation Associations 
104. The Zambia Evaluation Association (ZEA) has been in existence for close to 10 years. 
Most of the members are independent ev aluators. However, its membership base has 
failed to expand over this period . ZEA is not established by an Act of Parliament and, 
therefore, it has no powers to mete out or enforce professional conduct among its 
members like other professional bodies. However, it has managed to establish links with 
some funding agencies.  For example, GIZ funded the Association ’s strategic plan and 
some monthly dissemination meetings. The African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) 
has funded the Association to publish a book on M&E practice in Zambia from the point 
of view of various disciplines, HIV/ AIDS and poverty among others, but only one paper 
has been written and so the funds would be s urrendered back to ACBF. While ZEA does 
not itself undertake evalu ation it does so through its members. Most of the people 
interviewed on the supply side are not members of the ZEA.  
105. MESSY is a grouping of M&E practitioners who have come together to support each 
other professionally and also to create a platform for shar ing M&E information. They

facilitate some presentations from among members and non-members on M&E topics of 
interest. ZEA and MESSY are merging to form one evaluation assoc iation. Both are 
affiliated to the Africa Evaluation Association (AfrEA). Most members of MESSY are in 
active employment  implementing monitoring systems and working as managers  of 
evaluations. The membership bases of a merging could therefore be complimentary.  
4. PATHWAYS, OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES 
106. This report finds that in Zambi a there are multiple entry points to improving 
evaluation demand and supply. However, each entry -point needs to be considered in 
terms of the aligned interest groups. There is active demand for evaluation within some 
government ministries, especially the M inistry of Finance who could play a broader role 
clarifying standards and expectations from government. Outside of government there 
are well-connected organisations who seek to use evaluative information to engage in 
advocacy. This demand is set within a c ontext where there is a high degree of political 
competition between political parties and various interest groups.  
107. The supply of evaluation expertise in Zambia is diverse in its quality and needs 
further development. In response to the historical demand from development partners 
and locally commissioned activities (using development partner funding) a range of 
consultancy companies and individuals have arisen with particular areas of strength. In 
the health sector, for example, there have been a lot of re sources put into the 
generation of evidence, particularly in regards to HIV and AIDS. The university sector has 
some research capacity, especially in the social science sector , but indications are that 
there are structural challenges in the sector with qua lified staff leaving for better paid 
positions elsewhere.   
108. This report finds that in Zambia there are multiple entry points to improving 
evaluation demand and supply. However, each entry -point is partial and often 
represents aligned interest groups rather than a neutral role -player seeking to expand 
evidence-based practice. Some of these entry points are outlined below. 
4.1 Demand  
109. Currently there is very little actual demand from Principals outside of development 
partners and to some extent civil society. Development partners are the main managing 
and commissioners of evaluations in Zambia. Even the current evaluations based within 
the Ministry of Finance rely upon external development partner funding. Civil society, 
meanwhile produce useful analysis that feeds into policy debate. Latent and potential 
demands for evaluations are discussed further below. 
110. The Executive: The Cabinet Office process for policy submissions provides a potential 
entry demand for evaluation. Further investigation needs to be undertaken of the 
monitoring processes being requested by the Presi dency as it is not clear how the 
demand for information feeds back into accountability and performance. The Presidency 
is both the centre of formal and informal power and demand for evaluation could have 
an important effect that serves broader development outcomes if it is received at the 
right time. Evaluations that touch on sensitive areas of resource allocation, such as, 
infrastructure need to be undertaken with consideration.
<<<PAGE=40>>>
33 
111. Civil Society Organisations:  There are a variety of pathways for evaluation w ork to 
be undertaken with civil society. The pathway chosen depends very much upon how 
commissioners of evaluation wish to position themselves in the political economy. For 
example, evaluations could be supported with existing influential interest groups such as 
the Farmers Union that seek to establish evidence for the benefit of their members, or 
with those groups with have a more hostile stance with the current government. If the 
concern is in undertaking evaluations that will be used and useful in the po licy process 
for the broader aims of development then supporting organisations like JCTR who 
already conduct evaluative activities and have strong formal and informal legitimacy 
may prove to a useful entry point. 
112. The Legislatur e: Currently, the legislature  provides a limited entry point for  ECD 
activities. Focused work on specific research issues  of interest to parliamentarians 
especially on strategic issues  could be helpful to generate an overall orientation to 
evidence-based practice . Further, the current  hearings and submissions on policy 
although not currently far reaching do provide potential entry points to introducing 
evaluation through external organisations. 
113. Development Partners:  This group is currently supportive of evaluation through 
funding and in -kind support. Getting sector working groups  and SWA ps functional will  
help to interact with the demand -side as they  provide a useful entry point for the 
identification and management of evaluations. This kind  of support  would need to be 
undertaken in alignment with the findings from the Paris Declaration Evaluation.  On the 
supply-side there could be a greater emphasis by development partners on 
commissioning in-country think tanks by themselves or as part of t heir own evaluation 
agenda. 
114. Ministry of Finance and Sector Ministries : The Ministry of Finance demonstrates an 
actual demand for evaluation. They are currently undertaking evaluations and are 
interested in setting -up an evaluation function. An issue with t he demand is that it 
requires development partner assistance to undertake the evaluations, both financially 
and technically. Yet, the Ministry of Finance can play a key leadership role in evaluation 
in accordance with the SNDP  in terms of setting out the r ules and incentives around the 
conduct of evaluation. In doing this the evaluations could get greater resonance with the 
Executive if they focused on priority areas and overlaps between the SNDP and the 
Patriotic Front’s Manifesto.
<<<PAGE=41>>>
34 
4.2 Supply 
115. Think Tanks:  Working with the think tanks profiled in Zambia can provide an entry 
point to undertake evaluations and also provide ECD services.  Both provide access to 
high-level decision makers through their boards  and so could present evaluations or 
undertake orientation to the importance of evidence in decision-processes. Both provide 
different kinds of entry points: ZIPAR research quality products and  PMRC rapid 
turnarounds on that are well communicated. For both organisations , the ECD activities 
would need to be sensitive to the politics surrounding the organisations.  
116. Universities: The Centre of Excellence initiative at the University of Zambia provides 
a well -resourced entry point to strengthening the supply of evaluation in the country. 
Working with this projec t would provide synergies with existing funding and support 
mechanisms. A challenge will be to support the initiative so that gains can be extended 
past the immediate funding period. This might require the centre to conduct evaluations 
as well as research on evaluation. There are broader issues around the capacity of the 
university sector in Zambia to be strengthened so that it fulfils research objectives rather 
than just providing consultancy opportunities . This would require longer -term 
interventions. Potential areas that could be considered are those where research 
capacity is required in the current SNDP, for example, infrastructure development.  
117. Evaluation Associations : With the merging of MESSY and ZEA there is now a 
boundary crossing community of evaluators. This provides a useful entry point for the 
discussion and clarification of standards and competencies for evaluators and an 
ongoing site of engagement around evaluation activities in Zambia  especially the diverse 
array of consulta ncy companies and individuals have arisen with particular areas of 
strength.
