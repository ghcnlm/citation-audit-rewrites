Evaluation, with Historical Events and Projects that 
Have Shaped the Development of Project 
Management as a Profession

Abstract: The term ‘project management ‘was coined in the 1950s, initially with em phasis on activity scheduling, budgeting and 
control and remained so even with the advent of computers in mana gement. In 1980s, it remained the same but with introduction of 
project information systems that ran on mainframe computers. In 1990 ’s project management was redefined by wide range of fields 
such as operations management, systems thinking, new product developme nt, risk management, the quality movement, organizational 
dynamics, industrial psychology and various other aspects of comme rcial management to become an independent discipline and 
profession. The understanding of what entails project management has ev olved over the years and is still evolving today . Project 
management has grown from the stage of non-functional componen t of the management science, to the stage of strategic component of 
organizational development. In project management two of the most importa nt processes within project management cycle, i.e. project 
monitoring and evaluation, are usually approached as side-acti vities by project managers and project management teams, whose 
unfortunate result is project or program failure. Project monitoring and evaluati on has grown in significance and today it is part and 
parcel of the project cycle from conception to termination and beyond . The formation of Project Management Institute in 1969 marked 
the first major step in transforming project management into a profession. W ith increased globalization, the project manager should be 
able to work across networks, cultures, languages, geographical features an d increased competition as well as collaboration. Project 
management has changed from an art to a science over time beca use of increasing standardization, continuous refinement of conce pts 
and development and use of computer software. Scholars generally a gree on the future of project management as a profession, but no 
agreement has been reached on when exactly modern project ma nagement started. It is however evident that modern project 
management is a direct result of the effort by the schedulers of 1960s t o develop their discipline.  The evolution of monitoring and 
evaluation has been influenced by developments in transport and communication, advances and application of management science, the 
invention and increased use of the personal computer and related s oftware and continuous influence and application of modern  
technologies in all functions of project management. The growing complexity, technology advancement and changing legal environment   
and stakeholder concerns and challenges in managing projects has g iven rise to new fields directly related to project management like 
safety and sustainability. Concerns over sustainability of projects and programs are  the main drivers for monitoring and evaluation 
today and hence the need to inbuilt sustainability in all aspects of project management.

1. Introduction to Project Management  
 
1.1. Definition of Project Management  
 
A project is an activity or undertaking that has definite start 
and end date(Atkinson, 1999)). It is unique in nature and 
brings change. Project execution is associated with some 
degree of uncertainty which introduces some risks (Alkin, & 
King, 2016).  Project Management is concerned with 
delivering undertakings „on time, within budget, to scope or 
specifications (Geraldi & Morris, 2011) by application of 
tools and techniques such as critical path method Atkinson, 
1999). Seymour & Hussein (2014b) argues that at its core, 
project management is concerned with creating a conducive 
atmosphere for people to work as a team and achieve a 
common objective and deliver projects successful projects 
on time and within budget. Project management is about 
managing projects from conception to completion. A project 
can be viewed as a dynamic system changing from one stag e 
to another in a lifecycle (Drop, 2009; Evaristo & Fenema, 
1999). On what role projects should play Abbasi & Jaafari 
(2018) remarked that projects and programs should business 
benefits to organizations.  The field of project management 
continues to evolve (Seymour & Hussein, 2014). The 
projects can be single or multiple (Evaristo & Fenema, 1999 . 
According to Söderlund & Lenfle (2013) projects played a 
significant role in the second industrial revolution and there 
is interest in understanding the role that projects played for 
evolution and transformation of society because among 
other reasons, there is a lot to learn from past land mark 
projects like the Pyramids of Egypt and The Great Chinese 
Wall. The history of projects and project management is a 
global phenomenon with variations across the globe.  
 
1.2. Origin of Project Management  
 
A number of projects like the canal projects, railway 
projects, road projects, power plants have played a 
significant role in industrial development and growth but not 
all have played a role in emergence of management theories 
and practices in projects and project organization. However 
the challenge is that the numerous and substantial projects 
that have been undertaken in history have little or no 
documentation about methodologies or techniques use and 
useful learning generated (Seymour & Hussein, 2014a). 
Therefore understanding the history of projects and project

management will help in understanding the roots of project 
management and evolution of current managerial practices. 
This may lead to recognition of innovative managerial 
salutations from the past on which to build on in improving 
the practice of project management (Söderlund & Lenfle, 
2013). In his view Flyvbjerg (2006) argues that project 
managers and practitioners should not underestimate the 
power of examples and the generalizations borrowed from 
rich historical narratives and that historical examples can 
constitute such global and powerful examples that 
researchers can talk about, compare and use to support their 
decisions and positions. Seymour & Hussein, (2014a) argues 
that understanding the past enables better understanding of 
the future and hence prepare for it.  
      
Therefore a better understanding of project management 
history has the capacity to create an improved understanding 
of challenges encountered in the process of shaping, creating 
and managing projects. Understanding project history will 
also help in creating a common ground between and 
amongst academics and practitioners in the context of 
knowledge and learning. 
 
Several known old structures including the pyramids of 
Egypt, the Pantheon or the aqueducts of ancient Rome were 
projects in every respect and had individuals responsible for 
the management and actual construction. Therefore whereas 
the history of project management is relatively new, project 
management itself is not new in the wider scope of 
management practice. It‟s only after the project management 
discipline had been codified that reasonable effort was made 
to identify historical developments and events that 
contributed to its development, such as the creation of the 
Gantt chart and the Agile Manifesto. Today project 
management continues to grow and influence the way 
people do almost all that has a start and a finish or an end 
(Haughey, 2014; Geraldi, & Morris, 2011; Westland, 2018).  
 
It should be noted that before project management was 
defined as profession, projects did exist, although they didn‟t 
share many of the foundations of today‟s project 
management. The pharaohs of Egypt built the pyramids 
around 2500 BC, but it is not quite clear how they 
accomplished such a huge task although records do show 
that the project was organized and had managers, who were 
responsible for each of the four faces of the Great Pyramid. 
Another example is the 208 BC construction of the Great 
Wall of China, which have records that indicate the planning 
went back even further. There is evidence in terms of 
historical data that the workforce for this large project was 
organized into groups. The three known groups were 
soldiers, common people and criminals. Millions of workers 
were ordered to complete the project. 
 
Project control has existed for many centuries. According to 
Weaver (2007) the evolution of and scope control as 
dimensions of project management occurred during the 14 th 
and 18th centuries respectively, but time management as the 
other dimension of a project lacked effective measurement 
and control too later dates. In the recent past, the increasing 
need for a clear and organized structure in industries like 
construction, transport and manufacturing in the 19th 
century led to the birth of project management as we 
recognize it today. Beneficiary projects include the building 
of the Transcontinental Railroad and reconstruction of the 
southern states after the American Civil War (Haughey, 
2014; Geraldi, & Morris, 2011; Westland, 2018). This 
suggests or implies that there was certainly leadership at 
play, and that there must have been some budget, even if 
open-ended, and scheduling of some sort. But with practice 
came process and refinement, as we shall see moving 
forwards. 
 
It was not until the 1900s that project management as we 
know it began to take form. As projects became 
industrialized, the process to manage them also experienced 
a revolution (Westland, 2018). The modern form of project 
management as characterized by the tools used, techniques 
applied, language used ,and concepts that we now associate 
with it, first appeared in the early 1950s after which  
significant development has taken place to improve on 
knowledge, performance in, and management of projects. 
According to Seymour & Hussein (2014b) modern project 
management started in 1958 with the development of 
Critical Path Method (CPM) developed in 1957 by DuPont 
Corporation the Program Evaluation Review Technique 
(PERT) developed in 1958 by US Navy. In their view 
Abbasi & Jaafari (2018), project management as it is today 
was developed by the US military in 1950s and that the 
starting point for modern project management was 
development of tools like CPM and PERT.    A lot has 
developed on what project managers need to do in order to 
deliver them successfully. Later on, effort has been on how 
to realize project successes including recognition of the 
important role management plays in project realization 
(Geraldi, & Morris, 2011). 
 
From the discussion, there is no agreement by historians and 
scholars on when modern project management started.  
 
1.3. Project Management and Scientific Management  
 
Project management is a problem solving method which 
involves planning techniques and methods that are similar to 
optimization theory and applied mathematics (Abbasi & 
Jaafari, 2018).  The roots of project management are related 
to the appearance and development of scientific 
management theories developed by Frederick W. Taylor, 
Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, Henri Fayol and Henry Gantt 
(Grob, 2009). In 1911, a reference work was produced 
entitled “The Principles of Scientific Management” written 
by Frederick W. Taylor. In his work, Taylor postulated the 
scientific management principles, which in his opinion 
according to Drob (2010) are; 
1) Use of scientific methods of work; 
2) Scientific selection of employees and improving the 
skills of employees; 
3) Good cooperation with employees; 
4) Scientific division of labor in skilled and unskilled labor 
and its proper allocation between managers and workers. 
 
Frank and Lillian Gilbreth had an important contribution to 
developing scientific management, mainly in the field of 
industrial psychology with their work regarding with this 
area was written by Lillian Gilbreth and entitled "The

Psychology of Management" which was published in 1912 
(Grob, 2009).  
 
In 1916, yet another book that had significant impact on 
management theory was published. The book was entitled 
“Administration Industrielle et Generale” (Industrial and 
General Administration), authored by Henri Fayol, a French 
engineer. Henri Fayol was regarded as the father of classical 
management theories of organization (Glob, 2009).  Fayol 
noted that the basic principles of management should 
consider are; 
1) Division of labor, which involves breaking down 
complex works into simpler and more consistent work 
and their allocation of specialized workers 
2) Authority, which is viewed as the legitimate right to 
give orders; 
3) Discipline, which implies the respect of the intern rules; 
4) Unity of command, which means that each employee 
should receive orders from only one manager; 
5) Unity of direction, which means that the entire 
organization to have the same vision and direction to 
pursue common objectives using a single plane; 
6) The subordination of individual interests to those of the 
organization; 
7) Remuneration, which must be properly determined 
according to performance of the workers; 
8) Centralization, which implies that power and authority 
are concentrated at the upper levels of the organization's 
management; 
9) Hierarchy, which involves establishing an adequate 
number of hierarchical levels, allowing for efficient 
movement of information both from the top to its base 
organization and vice versa; 
10) order, which must be set up in the organization so that 
every employee and material object to have its place 
and to find there; 
11) Equity and fairness set up in relations between 
managers and his staff; 
12) Staff stability; 
13) Encouraging initiative; 
14) Development of team spirit. 
 
The theories of scientific management have significantly 
shaped the development and practice of management. 
Project management is also grounded in these important 
theories of scientific management (Drob, 2009). According 
to Seymour & Hussein (2014a) advancement of science and 
technology have transformed project management to a full 
profession today. The origin of modern project management 
can be traced to quantitative research in planning oriented 
techniques and applications of engineering science and 
organization theory (Abbasi & Jaafari, 2018). In the United 
States, the father of project management is considered Henry 
Gantt, who developed a technique of planning and control, 
called the Gantt chart that is currently used in the project 
management (Drob, 2009). All these developments are 
grounded in scientific management. 
 
1.4. The Study and Practice of Project Management  
 
1.4.1. The practice of project management  
The history of project management as a practice or 
profession dates back to the  
Construction of the pyramids of Egypt.    As a practice or 
profession, project management was heavily influenced by 
research from the civil and construction industry. At the 
beginning, project management was closely associated with 
civil and built industry, and defense. The situation is 
different today and project management cuts across all 
industries from manufacturing, information systems, design, 
finance, service, arts and IT.  The Project Management 
Institute has seen its membership grow from 334,000 
members in 2010 to 445,000 in 2017 (Abbasi & Jaafari, 
2018).Therefore project management continues to entrench 
itself as a popular profession globally in all industries as a 
result of the role of the Project management Institute.  
 
1.4.2. Project management   as an academic field 
The understanding of project management has expanded 
beyond the original target or focus of executing and 
delivering projects. As an academic field, project 
management continues to grow with as demonstrated by 
growing number of project management related academic 
papers in peer reviewed academic journals and growing 
membership in project management related professional 
bodies (Abbasi & Jaafari, 2018). 
 
1.4.3. Emerging fields in the study and practice of 
project management  
The growing complexity, technology advancement and 
changing legal environment   and  
Challenges in managing projects has given rise to new fields 
directly related to project management of projects and 
programs like safety and sustainability (Abbasi & Jaafari, 
2018). 
 
1.5. Institutionalization of Project Management  
 
Project management has evolved from a one-off independent 
undertaking to an institutional or organizational undertaking 
today. Abbasi & Jaafari (2018) observed that since 1950s 
organizations have enhanced the use of projects and 
programs to realize their strategic objectives.  According to 
Geraldi & Morris (2011) there has emerged a third category 
in the development of project management which they called 
the institutional level. They proposed that project 
management can be thought of in terms of three levels, viz. 
 
1) Level 1:Technical level 
The nature of project management which emerged in 1950s 
and 1960s was mainly technical. This was in terms of   the 
operational and delivery orientation or requirements.  The 
technical, nature was both in terms of the engineering 
management character that combines project management, 
systems and engineering management. It involved use of 
tools and techniques that developed work breakdown 
structures, earned value, PERT, and value analysis. These 
have grown and developed to become the core to project 
management practice (Geraldi & Morris, 2011).  
 
2)  Level 2: Strategic level 
The strategic level as presented by Geraldi & Morris (2011)   
involves managing projects as organizational holistic 
entities, covering project front-end development and 
definition and with a concern for value and effectiveness. As 
project management continued to develop, challenges of

sustainability started to appear in the late 60s and 70s, with 
growing cases of project failures, both in number of projects 
and visibility or impact. There are cases where projects 
failed due to lack of effective project management e.g. the 
case Concorde. In the 70s and 80s and beyond, the project 
environment became increasingly complex. This brought 
concerns and need over, safety and environment, risk and 
opportunity, value and benefits, ICT, new Supply Chain 
methods of management including partnerships, and new 
ways of procuring progressively. This more demanding 
environment with underlying challenges, and high rate of 
project failures in   technology-intensive fields like nuclear 
power, oil and gas, software, and weapons systems, further 
stimulated evolution of project management to address these 
new challenges.  
 
The focus of this level was to align projects strategy with 
sponsors managing technology, influence od stakeholders, 
establishing an appropriate communication platform, 
leadership, teamwork and putting in place appropriate 
governance structures and control mechanisms.  
 
3) Level 3: Institutional level 
This level involves managing the institutional dimension 
hence creating the context and support for project success. In 
this level, issues are raised against treating projects in 
isolation. According to Geraldi & Morris (2011)   the 
institutional level operates outside and around the project.  It 
requires that projects be treated not just as unique but should 
fit in the institutional framework for synergy. Particular 
challenge of the institutional level is how the enterprise can 
best gather, organize, deploy and use knowledge and 
improve its organizational learning, more so  the long-term 
health and stability of the enterprise.  There is still a 
tendency to emphasize the recording of explicit knowledge 
whereas tacit knowledge is widely seen as more valuable. 
This stage has seen more and more institutionalization of 
projects. At this institutional level, professional associations 
become useful as they play a central role in the development 
of project management, and at institutionalizing discipline, 
which is a requirement for any professional practice. At the 
heart of Level 3 is the concern with the relationship between 
agency and the institution. Managing within this third leve l 
is to work on or for projects while managing at the other two 
levels i.e. technical and strategic is to manage in them. Other 
concerns at institutional level are; 
a) Organizational learning is a challenge of institutional 
level and includes issues on how best to gather, organize 
and deploy knowledge and improve performance. 
b) Governance systems and structures to ensure accountable 
management and leadership including project structure 
with reporting and working relationships with and 
outside project teams. . 
c) Stakeholder engagement which requires identification 
and recognizing needs and concerns of all stakeholders 
who should be treated as external customers.  
d) Portfolio management which may involve prioritization 
in deployment of resources on basis of availability, risks, 
competition, potential sales, costs, benefits efficiency. 
 
Therefore institutional level is concerned with organizational 
level issues which have a bearing on project performance 
and delivery but in a complete manner that is not limited to 
any specific project or program requirements. It creates 
synergy among all projects and programs in an organization.  
 
2. Historical Events that have Shaped  Project 
Management  
 
History is dotted with written and artefacts of projects 
undertaken many years ago.  According to Haughey (2014) 
and Drob (2009) a number of major developments and 
events have contributed to the development of project 
management. They include among others; 
 
1) 2570 BC: The Great Pyramid of Giza Completed in 
Egypt 
The Pharaohs built the pyramids with ancient records 
showing there were managers for each face of the Great 
Pyramid, who were responsible for overseeing their work to 
completion. There are indications that there was some 
degree of planning, execution and control involved in 
managing this project (Haughey, 2014). Therefore project 
organization is not a new concept in project management 
based on this historical evidence. 
 
2) 208 BC: Construction of the Great Wall of China 
The Great Wall of China is yet another wonder of the world 
that was built since the Qin Dynasty (221BC-206BC). 
Available historical data, shows or indicate that the labor 
force was organized into three groups consisting of soldiers , 
the common people and criminals. The overall command 
was Emperor Qin Shihuang who ordered millions of people 
to finish this project (Haughey, 2014). This shows 
emergence of organization, and command structure in 
project execution.  
 
3) 1917: The Gantt chart Developed by Henry Gantt 
(1861-1919) 
Henry Gantt, can be described as one of the forefathers of 
today‟s   project management. He created   his self-named 
scheduling diagram, called Gantt chart which is in wide use 
today in project planning and management. This was a 
radical idea and an innovation of worldwide importance in 
the 1920s. One of its first uses was on the Hoover Dam 
project which commenced in 1931.Today, Gantt charts are 
still in use and they form an important part of the project 
managers' toolkit globally (Haughey, 2014). 
 
4) 1931-1936: The Hoover Dam 
This was a huge project that involved the construction of a 
giant dam on Colorado River, in the United States of 
America. It was named Hoover in honor of Hebert Hoover, 
who was the US president. The Hoover Dam 201 meters 
thick at the bottom and 221 meters in height and it remains 
one of the most impressive hydroelectric power plants in the 
world. The planning and execution of the project applied the 
Gantt charts (Drob, 2009).  
 
5) The Manhattan Project(1942-1945) 
This project will remain historic and significant globally due 
to its size and historical consequences . The project led to the 
production of the atomic bomb and involved 125,000 people 
(Drob, 2009). This is a historical project in that the atomic 
bombs were used during the World War II and consequently

brought the war to an end with death and destruction in 
Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  
 
6) 1956: The American Association Of Cost Engineers 
(Now AACE International) Was Formed 
The AACE was formed in 1956 by the very early 
practitioners of project management and the associated 
specialties like planning, scheduling, cost estimating, cost 
and schedule control and few others . Today, the association 
remains one of the leading professional society for cost 
estimators, cost engineers, project schedulers, project 
managers and control specialists since its formation. In 
2006, the association released the first integrated process for 
portfolio, program and project management with their Total 
Cost Management Framework. This was the first step in 
professionalizing project management (Drob, 2009; 
Haughey, 2014). Therefore it can be argued that the 
development of project management as a profession started 
in 1956. 
 
7) 1956/1957: The Critical Path Method (CPM) Invented 
by the DuPont Corporation 
CPM is a technique used to predict project duration by 
analyzing and identifying a sequence of activities with least 
amount of scheduling flexibility. This was historically the 
first project to introduce science into process time 
management and control. In 1956/57 Kelly and Walker 
embarked on the development of an algorithm which 
became CPM for E.I. du Pont de Numours (Weaver, 2007).  
The objective was as to address the complex process of 
shutting down chemical plants for the purpose of carrying 
out maintenance, and then upon completion of maintenance 
restart the plants. CPM proved effective and quite successful 
that it saved the corporation $1 million in the first year of 
implementation. The technique is still in use today in 
activity planning and scheduling in project management 
(Haughey, 2014). 
 
8) 1958: The Program Evaluation Review Technique 
(PERT) was Invented for the U.S. Navy's Polaris 
Project 
PERT was developed by The United States Department of 
Defense's US Navy Special Projects Office during the 
development of the Polaris mobile submarine-launched 
ballistic missile project. This was during the era of cold war 
that witnessed an arms race globally and hence the desire to 
attain military superiority and defensive capability was a 
priority. PERT is a method used to analyze tasks involved in 
completing a project. It is used analyze mainly the time 
needed to complete tasks and identify the minimum project 
duration. (Haughey, 2014). PERT technique involves 
building a PERT chart which is a network graph with details 
about project activities, their duration, and their 
dependencies. PERT takes consideration of risks and 
uncertainties using probabilities on activity. They are 
divided into three, namely, optimistic, pessimistic and one 
being considered as most likely event (Drob, 2009).  
 
9) 1962: United States Department of Defense Mandate 
the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Approach 
The United States Department of Defense (DOD) created the 
WBS concept as part of the Polaris mobile submarine-
launched ballistic missile project. After completing the 
project, the DOD published the work breakdown structure 
that was used and allowed the use of the procedure in future 
projects of similar scope and size. WBS is a tree structure of 
deliverables and tasks that need to be performed to complete 
a project being undertaken . The WBS was later adopted by 
private sector project practitioners and today it remains one 
of the most commonly used project management tool 
(Haughey, 2014). 
 
10) 1965: The International Project Management 
Association (IPMA) Founded 
IPMA was the world's first project management association. 
It was started in Vienna, Austria as a forum for project 
managers to network and share information. It was 
registered in Switzerland, as a federation of about 50 
national and internationally oriented project management 
associations. The vision of IPMA is to promote project 
management and to lead the development of the profession. 
Since its birth in 1965, IPMA has grown and spread 
worldwide with over 120,000 members in 2012 (Haughey, 
2014). Therefore the development of The International 
Project Management Association was another step in 
entrenching project management as profession that it is 
today around the world.  
 
11) 1969: Project Management Institute (PMI) 
Launched to Promote the Project Management 
Profession 
PMI was founded by five volunteers as a non-profit 
professional organization dedicated to advance the practice, 
science and profession of project management. PMI was 
subsequently issued with Articles of Incorporation by the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1969 this marked its 
beginning and in 1970, PMI held its first symposium in 
Atlanta, Georgia that was attended by  83 people. One of its 
significant contribution is publishing 'A Guide to the Project 
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)' considered 
one of the essential tools in the project management 
profession today. The PMI offers two levels of project 
management certification, Certified Associate in Project 
Management (CAPM) and Project Management Professional 
(PMP). This certifications go a long way in ensuring 
professionalism in practice of project management 
(Haughey, 2014). The Project Management institute offers 
professional credibility in the field of project management. 
In 2006, there were over 200,000 people with recognized 
certification after passing exams administered by the project 
Management Institute (Drob, 2009).  
 
12) 1975: PROMPTII Method Created by Simpact 
Systems Limited 
Development of PROMPTII was in response to an outcry 
that computer projects were overrunning on time estimated 
for completion and original budgets as set out in feasibility 
studies. It was common to experience huge variations on the 
original estimates. PROMPTII was an attempt to solve this 
problem with computer projects. In show of success, i n 
1979, the UK Government's Central Computing and 
Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) adopted the method 
for all information systems projects (Haughey, 2014).

13) 1975: The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software 
Engineering by Fred Brooks 
In his book, Fred Brooks's central theme is that "Adding 
manpower to a late software project makes it later." This 
idea is called Brooks's law. The book covers software 
engineering and project management .The extra human 
communications needed to add another member to a 
programming team is more than anyone ever expects. It 
naturally depends on the experience and sophistication of the 
human programmers involved and the quality of available 
documentation. It does not matter how much experience you 
have, the extra time discussing the assignment, 
commitments and technical details as well as evaluating the 
results becomes exponential as more people get added. 
These observations are from Brooks's experiences while 
managing the development of OS/360 at IBM (Haughey, 
2014). 
 
14) 1984: Theory of Constraints (TOC) Introduced by 
Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his Novel "The Goal" 
TOC is an overall management philosophy that is geared to 
help organizations continually achieve their goal. The title 
comes from the view that any manageable system is limited 
in achieving more of its goal by a small number of 
constraints, and there is always, at least, one constraint. The 
TOC process seeks to identify the constraint and restructure 
the rest of the organization around it by using Five Focusing 
Steps. The methods and algorithms from TOC went on to 
form the basis of Critical Chain Project Management 
(Haughey, 2014). 
 
15) 1986 Scrum Named as a Project Management Style 
Scrum is an agile software development model that is based 
several small teams working in an intensive and 
interdependent manner. In their paper, 'The New New 
Product Development Game' published by Harvard Business 
Review in 1986,  Takeuchi and Nonaka named Scrum as a 
project management style which was elaborated later by 
themselves., Although Scrum was intended for management 
of software development projects, it can be used to run 
software maintenance teams, or as a general project and 
program management approach. IT was therefore a 
significant contribution to project management practice 
(Haughey, 2014).  
 
16) 1987: A Guide to the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) Published by PMI 
PMBOK Guide was first published by the PMI as a white 
paper in 1987, the PMBOK Guide was an attempt to 
document and standardize accepted project management 
information and practices. The first edition was published in 
1996, followed by a second in 2000, and a third in 2004. The 
guide is one of the essential tools in the project management 
profession today and has become the global standard for the 
industry (Haughey, 2014). 
 
17) 1989: Earned Value Management (EVM) 
Leadership Elevated to Undersecretary of Defense 
for Acquisition 
Although the earned value concept has been around on 
factory floors since the early 1900s, it only came to 
prominence as a project management technique in the late 
1980s early 1990s. In 1989, EVM leadership was elevated to 
the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, thus making 
EVM an essential part of program management and 
procurement. In 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney 
cancelled the Navy A-12 Avenger II program because of 
performance problems detected by EVM. The PMBOK 
Guide of 1987 has an outline of Earned Value Management 
(EVM) subsequently expanded on in later editions 
(Haughey, 2014). 
 
18) 1989: PRINCE Method Developed from PROMPTII 
This was published by the UK Government agency CCTA, 
Projects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE) became the 
UK standard for all government information systems 
projects. A feature of the original method, not seen in other 
methods, was the idea of 'assuring progress' from three 
separate but linked perspectives. PRINCE method developed 
a reputation for being too rigid and applicable only to large 
projects, leading to a revision in 1996 (Haughey, 2014). 
 
19) 1994: CHAOS Report First Published 
The Standish Group collected information on project failures 
in the Information Technology (IT) industry with the 
objective of making the industry more successful, showing 
ways to improve its success rates and increase the value of 
IT investments. The CHAOS report is its biennial 
publication about IT project failure (Haughey, 2014). This 
was deliberate effort to improve on project success. 
 
20) 1975-1983; Development of Project Management 
Soft wares 
In 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen created Microsoft 
Company which revolutionized computer technology. 
Project specific software were developed for project 
management. Other software companies came up for 
example Artemis (1977), Oracle (1977), Scythian 
Corporation (1979) and others. All of these companies later 
contributed to project management by developing project 
management specific software. In 1983, the Harvard Project 
Manager was launched, and was considered one of the first 
integrated software specialized for project management. 
This computer program could make planning of tasks, 
budget and resources. Subsequently, on the market dedicated 
to the project management programs appeared and other 
companies that proposed various solutions for solving 
specific problems of project management(Drob, 
2009;Haughey, 2014).   In 1998, in an article published in 
"Project Management Journal", identified top 10 seawares 
as; 
a) Microsoft Project; 
b) Primavera Project Planner; 
c) Microsoft Excel; 
d) Project Workbench; 
e) Time Line; 
f) Primavera SureTrak; 
g) CA-Super Project; 
h) Project Scheduler; 
i) Artemis Prestige; 
j) FasTracs. 
 
After 1995, starting with the widespread diffusion of the 
Internet, the software used for project management began 
offering the option to connect and work jointly in an intranet 
or Internet network. Today, the softwares for project

management, are found in great diversity, both in terms of 
functions they develop and price that are sold on the market. 
In the late 90's of the last century, Project Management 
Institute has proposed a set of standards and practical 
guidance for this area, that are incorporated in a document 
known as PMBOK (Project Management Body of 
Knowledge), which defines the fundament of management 
project for several fields, such as engineering, construction, 
IT and so on (Drob, 2009; Haughey, 2014). 
 
21) 1996: PRINCE2 Published by CCTA 
This was an upgrade to PRINCE that was considered to be 
in order, and the development was contracted out, but 
assured by a virtual committee spread among 150 European 
organizations. Originally developed for Information Systems 
and Information Technology projects to reduce cost and time 
overruns; the second revision became more generic and 
applicable to any project type (Haughey, 2014). 
 
22) 1997: Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) 
Invented 
The critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) was 
developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. The Critical Chain 
Project Management is based on methods and algorithms 
drawn from his Theory of Constraints (TOC) introduced in 
his 1984 novel titled, 'The Goal'. A Critical Chain project 
network keeps the resources levelly loaded, though need 
them to be flexible in their start times and to switch quickly 
between tasks and task chains to keep the whole project on 
schedule (Haughey, 2014). 
 
23) 1998: PMBOK Becomes a Standard 
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
recognizes PMBOK as a standard in 1998, and later that 
year by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
(IEEE). This was a milestone in development of project 
management as a profession (Haughey, 2014). 
 
24) 2001: The Agile Manifesto Written 
In February 2001, 17 software developers met at The Lodge, 
Snowbird, and Utah resort to discuss lightweight software 
development methods. They published the Manifesto for 
Agile Software Development to define the approach known 
by the same name. Some of the manifesto's authors formed 
the Agile Alliance, a nonprofit organization that promotes 
software development according to the manifesto's 12 core 
principles. This was a step in promoting use of computers in 
project management practice (Haughey, 2014). 
 
25) 2006: "Total Cost Management Framework" 
Release by AACE International 
Total cost management is the name given by AACE 
International to a process for applying the skills and 
knowledge of cost engineering. It is also the first integrated 
process, or method of portfolio, program and projec t 
management. AACE first introduced the idea in the 1990s 
and published the full presentation of the process in the 
'Total Cost Management Framework'. (Haughey, 2014). 
 
26) 2008: 4th Edition of PMBOK Guide Released 
The fourth edition of the guide continues the PMI tradition 
of excellence in project management with a standard that is 
easier to understand and implement, with improved 
consistency and greater clarification. The updated version 
has two new processes, not in the previous versions 
(Haughey, 2014). 
 
27) 2009: Major PRINCE2 Revision by Office of 
Government Commerce (OGC) 
A major revision has seen the method made simpler and 
more easily customizable, a frequent request from users. The 
updated version has seven basic principles (not in the 
previous version) that contribute to project success. Overall 
the updated method aims to give project managers a better 
set of tools to deliver projects on time, within budget and 
with the right quality (Haughey, 2014). 
 
28) 2012: ISO 21500:2012 Standard for Project 
Management Released 
In September 2012, the International Organization for 
Standardization published "ISO 21500:2012, Guidance on 
Project Management" after five year's work by experts from 
more than 50 countries. The standard was designed for use 
by any organizations, whether public, private or community 
groups. It can be used for any   project (Haughey, 2014). 
 
29) 2012: 5th Edition of PMBOK Guide Released 
The fifth edition of the guide, published in December 2012, 
provides guidelines, rules and characteristics for project 
management recognized as good practice in the profession. 
The updated version introduces a 10th knowledge area 
called, 'Project Stakeholder Management' and also includes 
four new planning processes. This further enhances 
professional growth and development of project 
management practitioners.  
 
After 1990s, project management developed to become an in 
depended discipline Globalization has brought greater 
challenges and the need for increased speed- to-market with 
products and services. Projects have become larger, more 
complex and increasingly difficult to manage. Teams are 
more diverse and spread across the world as opposed to one 
location. The world is changing, and project management 
must change to (Drop, 2009).  
 
The appearance and development of project management 
occurred as a result of need to apply theory and practice of 
management to projects. The use of specialized software for 
project management has facilitated application of various 
tools and techniques (Drob, 2009). Therefore software 
development has made significant contribution to 
development and of project management tool and 
techniques. 
 
2.1 Introduction to Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is a process whose main 
aim is help improve project Performance and achieve 
expected or planned results. The objective of monitoring and 
evaluation is to improve current and future management of 
inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact in projects and 
programs being executed by assessing the progress, 
performance and results of projects and programs, or even 
institutions, and organizations, whether international  or 
local  NGOs, government or individuals (United Nations 
Development evaluation Office, 2002). Successful

monitoring and evaluation requires participation of different 
players or stakeholders (Edmunds & Marchant, 2008). 
Monitoring and evaluation should be part and parcel of 
program and project design. This means that it should be 
embedded in every project and program and should not look 
like it is imposed later on (Sports and Development 
Organization, n. d.). Therefore, project monitoring and 
evaluation should be part and parcel of the project cycle 
from conception to termination and beyond. 
 
There has been a growing desire for development effort to 
be more effective from scarce or limited resources and 
funds. For this happen, projects and programs must be well 
managed or executed for better outputs or results. According 
to Sports and Development Organization (n. d.) and 
Edmunds & Marchant (2008), the main objectives of 
monitoring and evaluation are; 
a) Align monitoring and evaluation with results based 
management 
b) Promote evaluation environment and learning around 
results in the process of execution.  
c) Simplify policies and procedures used in project/program 
implementation. 
d) Support internal and external accountability of a 
program/project. 
e) Built organizational or program/project capacity. 
f) Promote empowerment of beneficiaries and stakeholders 
of the project and program.  
 
Monitoring and evaluation help improve performance and 
results. The overall purpose of evaluation is measurement 
and assessment of performance meet outcomes and outputs 
also called results. Traditionally, monitoring and evaluation 
focusses on assessment of inputs and implementation 
process. Today focus has shifted to assessing contributions 
of various activities to a given development outcome with 
such factors as outputs, participation, policy, procedures, 
brokering or coordination Project management uses 
information gained through monitoring and evaluation to 
improve strategies, programs and activities (Edmunds & 
Marchant, 2008). 
 
2.2 Monitoring 
 
Monitoring is a continuous   function that aims at providing 
management and stakeholders with indications of progress 
or lack of progress in realization of project or program 
results. According to Edmunds & Marchant (2008), 
monitoring of inputs and outputs is monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) at its very basic level where inputs are 
tracked. These inputs recorded or noted include human, 
physical and financial resources as well as how they are 
converted to outputs i.e. project goods and services. The 
indicators monitored are both financial and non-financial 
and are usually stored in a computer management system 
(MIS). At its basic level therefore monitoring is about 
keeping books or records of progress. According to 
Development Organization (n. d.), evaluation involves 
assessing in a systematic and objective way a project or 
program that is completed or a phase of an on-going project 
or programme that has been completed. Evaluations appraise 
information and data that guides strategic decision making 
hence leads to improvement.  
 
Monitoring is a periodically recurring activity that begins in 
the planning stage of a project or programme and allows 
results, experiences and processes to be documented or 
recorded. Therefore monitoring is an integral part of 
evaluation (Development Organization, n. d.). Monitoring 
focuses on the following; 
a) Quantity and quality of executed activities and how they 
are managed to give outputs. 
b) Process used in the project and programme e.g. effects or 
changes that took place due to the interventions 
undertaken during implementation. 
c) Processes that are external to an intervention i.e. impact 
triggered by implemented activities and other 
environmental factors.  
 
Project monitoring and evaluation can be divided into two 
basic parts, namely costs side and benefits side which are 
explained below; 
a) Costs side:  This side is concerned with efficiency and 
dispatch of with which the project was implemented. 
b) Benefits side: This side is concerned with the extent to 
which a project or program objectives were realized 
 
Monitoring and evaluation of impact of an intervention is 
often more complicated while gathering evidence on 
benefits side may also be really expensive. The common 
denominator in both monitoring and evaluation is that both 
depend on baseline survey or study done prior to 
program/project implementation (Stanford University, n.d).  
Therefore monitoring and evaluation are significantly related 
and have common reference points.   
 
2.2.1 Measuring impact and outcome 
Monitoring and evaluation for outcomes and impact shifts 
from performance monitoring to results measurement where 
the system attaches the highest importance to providing 
feedback on results at the level of outcomes and goals. In 
performance monitoring, data can easily be obtained from 
internal institutional information systems, but in results 
based monitoring, beneficiaries are targeted for information 
on the project and how it has affected them. The main 
objective of monitoring results at the outcome level is to 
show who is benefiting and how the benefits are realized as 
well as show  those who are not benefiting and so as to 
understand why they are not benefiting. This needs to be 
done while the program is being implemented so that 
corrective action can be taken. It is advisable to separate the 
monitoring of short-term (or early) indicators from the 
monitoring of medium- to long-term indicators. For the early 
indicators, rapid reporting is a critical factor, which as a 
consequence affects the choice of indicators and means of 
compiling or verification. Indicators that change slowly are 
not good indicators for measuring short-term outcomes, nor 
are those that are subject to extreme random fluctuations, 
evaluators should select and use  indicators that respond 
quickly and that are easy to collect (Edmunds & Marchant, 
2008).Therefore successful monitoring and evaluation 
requires careful selection of indicators to measure and there 
means of verification or measurement.

2.3 Evaluation 
 
Evaluation is selective exercise whose objective is to 
systematically and objectively assess progress towards 
achievement of outcomes or results as planned. This 
involves assessment of scope and depth carried out at 
several points in time in response to changing needs for the 
purpose of knowledge and learning. Evaluation should never 
be a one-time event or activity, but rather continuous. The 
project and program relevance, performance and the 
processes ought to be assessed in evaluations (United 
Nations Development evaluation Office, 2002). The 
evaluation of a project or program can take many forms and, 
in general, requires specialist skills but independence of the 
evaluation team is important. Many evaluations are carried 
out as an internal exercise but in order to ensure that the 
evaluation is unbiased and fair and, more importantly, 
perceived as fair and unbiased by relevant stakeholders, it is 
preferable to use an independent team or expert having no 
connections with the project or program. Evaluation 
involves taking outcome indicators and establishment of a 
trend or relationship if any between the indicators and 
results. In the case where the objective or purpose  is to 
determine the extent to which the change can be attributed to 
specific project interventions, the domain or level  changes 
to impact evaluation and social policy and impact analysis. 
This requires information on key indicators before, during, 
and after the specific intervention in project execution. The 
complete evaluation should also identify any unexpected or 
unanticipated outcomes of project/program activities. This 
exercise requires relevant and sufficient data and 
information. Impact analysis requires information on key 
indicators before baseline data, during, and after the specific 
intervention or reform has been executed (Edmunds & 
Marchant, 2008).Therefore evaluation is an analysis or 
interpretation of data that is collected through monitoring 
and considers relationships between results of a project or 
program effects and overall impact.  
 
2.3.1 Evaluation criteria and its origin/development 
Evaluation criteria according to Atkinson (1999) and DAC 
(n.d.) is concerned with relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, 
impact and sustainability. The criteria was first articulated 
alongside evaluation principles in 1991. The overall 
objective of the criteria is to support better evaluation which 
will then lead to sustainable development or project/program 
success. The evaluation criteria includes; 
a) Relevance; In evaluating relevance of a program  or 
project, it is useful to consider whether or not and to what 
extend are objectives of the program still valid as 
originally proposed, are activities and output consistent 
with overall goal and objectives. Are activities and 
outputs consistent with intended impacts and effects? 
b) Effectiveness; to evaluate for impact consider what 
happened as a result of the program or project, difference 
made by the activities to the beneficiaries and number of 
people affected. 
c) Sustainability; When evaluating sustainability of the 
project or program, consider the extent to which benefits 
continue after funding ceased, what factors influenced 
the achievement or non-achievement of sustainability 
d) Impact; Evaluation for impact  of project or program 
considers what happened as a result of the program or 
project, real difference made by activities to beneficiaries 
and how many were people were affected. 
e) Efficiency: Efficiency measures outputs in relation to 
inputs and generally requires comparison of alternative 
approaches. When evaluating program or project 
efficiency, evaluation should consider whether or not 
activities were cost effective, objectives were achieved 
within time and whether or not the project/program was 
implemented cost effectively.  
 
2.4 Monitoring and Evaluation  Analysis 
 
M&E analysis uses data to make the following comparisons: 
a) Comparisons over time or time series analysis, 
b) Comparisons over space called cross-sectional analysis, 
and 
c) Counterfactual comparisons with/without 
project/program.  
      
A key aspect is to establish the extent to which interventions 
have yielded desired impact on the problem that the original 
analysis identified. It therefore have to establish a causal link 
between policy and outcome which statistical analysis alone 
may not determine (Edmunds & Marchant, 2008). 
 
2.4.1 Comparisons over time 
The most common use for monitoring and evaluation data is 
time series analysis which involves the tracking of one or 
more indicators over time to see how they change. The 
indicators don‟t have to be complex but the prerequisite is a 
continuous supply of consistent and reliable data over the 
period under consideration. The data may come from the 
service providers‟ own records and reports, from focus 
group discussions and community surveys, random sample 
surveys of intended beneficiaries or other techniques 
(Edmunds & Marchant, 2008).  
 
2.4.2 Comparisons over space 
Making comparisons over space requires the comparison of 
one population group with another which often involves 
making comparisons between different geographic areas or 
projects/programs. Sample surveys can be used but have a 
limit on size and there is a danger that, in trying to satisfy 
this data demand, the samples may be expanded to such a 
degree that the surveys become totally unmanageable or 
unsustainably expensive. A viable option is to employ a 
combination of tools and to use them to impute values at 
highly disaggregated levels. These techniques have been 
successfully developed and used in the context of poverty 
mapping (Edmunds & Marchant, 2008). 
 
2.4.3 Counterfactual comparisons 
Counterfactual comparisons seek answers to questions like 
“what would have happened had there been no 
intervention?” or “Suppose the project was designed 
differently?” This opens up opportunities for multi -strategy 
modelling and is where the analysis goes beyond such basic 
questions as “Are incomes rising?” and additionally probes 
the data to discover why incomes are or are not rising, and 
what they would have been like without  intervention. The 
observation is that, there are several  tools now available for 
monitoring and evaluating programs than before (Edmunds 
& Marchant, 2008)..

2.5 Reporting in  Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
Reporting is an integral part of monitoring and evaluation 
and is a systematic and timely provision of essential 
information at periodic intervals. Reporting on results or 
findings is used for both internal management purposes and 
for external accountability to stakeholders. The reporting 
provides program/project managers and stakeholders with an 
opportunity to reflect on what worked or what failed, thus 
enabling learning and correction actions to feed into the next 
stages or phases (Edmunds & Marchant, 2008). 
 
2.6 Levels in Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
According to Edmunds and Marchant, (2008), monitoring 
and evaluation takes place at two distinct but related levels; 
a) Outputs level where specific products and services that 
emerge from the process inputs through the program, 
project and related activities. 
b) Outcome level where changes in development conditions 
that are aimed at by the implementation agencies or 
donors and funders. 
 
2.7 Feedback 
 
This is the process within the framework of monitoring and 
evaluation where information and knowledge are 
disseminated and used to assess overall progress through 
results or confirm achievement of results realized. Feedback 
communicates findings, conclusions, recommendations and 
lessons leant from the program (Edmunds & Marchant, 
2008).  
 
2.8 Lessons Learnt  in Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
This is an instructive example based on experience that is 
based on the experience to a general situation rather than to 
a specific circumstance. Lessons learnt from an activity 
through evaluation are considered as evaluative knowledge 
which stakeholders are more likely to internalize if they are 
involved in the evaluation process. Lessons learnt can reveal 
good practices and strategies that can be adopted or bad ones 
to be avoided (UNDP Project office, 2002). Monitoring and 
evaluation are typically the core processes used in learning 
from experience. Leaning implies an analysis method or 
process that requires evidence as basis. Monitoring and 
evaluation in this case provides pointers or indications of 
how to do things better through better understanding of what 
worked better. Therefore monitoring and evaluation brings 
together information and teach (Edmunds & Marchant, 
2008). 
 
2.9 M&E, Accountability, and Governance 
 
M&E has emerged as a tool for promoting development in 
its own right but only if M&E reports and findings are 
disseminated, stakeholders, civil society wider community. 
The information can then be used to make the management 
accountable. M&E information should not be used as a mere 
tool for policy-makers and planners. It should be readily 
available to all stakeholders thereby making monitoring and 
evaluation to tools for promoting democracy, good 
governance, and accountability (Edmunds & Marchant, 
2008). 
 
2.10 Differences between monitoring and Evaluation 
 
Monitoring and evaluation are important management tools 
that are necessary to track the progress and facilitate 
decision making for present and future interventions. 
However, there are lots of differences between them. Some 
major differences between monitoring and evaluation are 
listed below: 
 
Evaluation 
1) Evaluation is the periodic assessment of the 
programs/projects activities 
2) It is done on a periodic basis to measure the success 
against the objective i.e. it is an in-depth assessment of 
the program 
3) Evaluation is to be done after certain point of time of 
the project, usually at the mid of the project, completion 
of the project or while moving from one stage to 
another stage of the projects/programs 
4) Evaluation is done mainly done by the external 
members. However, sometimes it may be also done by 
internal members of the team or by both internal and

3. Historical Development of Monitoring and 
Evaluation 
 
3.1 Introduction to evolution monitoring and evaluation 
 
In the early days of project management practice, the focus 
was on the planning and execution of an Individual project. 
Emphasis in 2010s is on linking multiple projects with 
corporate organizational level strategies to enhance 
corporate competitiveness and performance. As a result 
projects are viewed as investments that form part of 
portfolios of projects. Organizations handling multiple 
projects need to make complex decisions to structure 
portfolios and to allocate resources to the individual 
projects, based on several criteria that include the strategic 
relevance and relative priority of each project. Computer 
systems have become essential in supporting these decisions. 
Despite some excellent developments in IT systems, 
software alone does not provide the ultimate answer to 
managing multiple projects – people skilled in the science 
and art of project management will always be required to 
make decisions (Steyn, 2010).The history of monitoring and 
evaluation is generally integrated with the history of 
program/project evaluation. The evaluation history is as long 
as the history of human activity which is full of problem 
identification, generation of alternatives and select the best 
solution. The basic rationale of evaluation is to provide 
information needed for action or decision making and 
therefore contributes to rationalization of the process of 
decision making (Alkin& King, 2016; Shadish&Luellen, 
2011). Evidence suggests that evaluation of personnel dates 
back to about 2200 B.C. in China. A number of 
developments in the first half of 20th century like the growth 
and refinement of theories and methods in social sciences, 
methods to improve evaluation of student achievement and 
the action research movement but Kurt Lewis made 
significant contribution to modern era program evaluation 
(Shadish&Luellen, 2011). Rapid expansion of government 
social programs of 20 th century after the greatdepression of 
1930s, the crash of stock market and collapse of banks had 
crippled the economy. After World War II, rapid economic 
growth in the US further contributed to the development of 
monitoring and evaluation (Shadish&Luellen, 2011; Hogan, 
2007).  
 
The beginning of 1960s saw evaluation grow and flourish as 
a profession through legislation and funding. Between 1968 
and 1978, evaluation was so popular that in the US alone, 
100 federal statutes advocated for evaluation of in the field 
of education alone. Additionally, state and governments 
funded program evaluation hence legitimizing evaluation as 
a core practice in project management and by 1980s there 
was a lot of financial motivation through funding for people 
to carry out project and program evaluations. With rapid rise 
in demand for evaluations, governments looked to evaluators 
in private sector and academia to fill the demand. At this 
time most evaluation related activities were in private sector 
aimed at improving profitability. The demand led to new 
training programs to train highly needed evaluators with 
relevant skills (Shadish&Luellen, 2011). 
 
The 1970s and 1980s also so the transition of evaluation into 
a profession. Indicators included the creation of professional 
codes of conduct, professional publications, and professional 
societies. This include journals like Evaluation Review, 
American Journal of Evaluation, Evaluation and program 
planning, New Directions for Evaluation as well as two 
professional societies. They were Evaluation Network 
(ENet) and Evaluation Research Society which were 
founded in 1970s. In 1986, ENet and ERS merged to form 
American Evaluation Association. In 1994, AEA facilitated 
development of guiding principles for professional 
evaluation (Shadish&Luellen, 2011; Hogan, 2007).  
 
3.2. Evolution of Monitoring and Evaluation in Project 
management  
 
There has been some form of project management from the 
early civilization, but project management in its modern 
sense and form began in 1950s. Even though people have 
been managing projects for years, the term projec t 
management emerged at the end of the 20 th century. 
However, a number of concepts that are important in modern 
project management   can be traced to the protestant 
reformation in the 15 th century. These among others include 
liberalism, capitalism, views that focus on individual or 
private wealth to improve society, Newtonianism in which 
people consult science for solutions.  In this sense, Fredrick 
Taylor who is considered as the father of scientific

management made significant contribution to early projec t 
management concepts (Cleland. &Gareis, 2006; 
Tache&Spăşoiu, 2013; Haughey, 2014; Ramachandran, nd.).   
Project management has been evolving over many years and 
1950s literature began to reflect the evolving theory and 
practice of project management. Project management has 
shown it‟s a rich heritage throughout its development of 
artifacts and cultural enhancements around the world. As the 
science of project management evolved, in complexity and 
application, monitoring and evaluation processes likewise  
got greater importance, in terms of methods  and techniques 
from simple control tools, to sophisticated mechanisms, that 
combine one or more methods of tracking project progress 
(Cleland. &Gareis, 2006; Tache&Spăşoiu, 2013). 
 
One of the challenges facing M&E is that it means different 
things to different people, and that they are disciplines that 
have been in a state of evolution. M&E began as a branch of 
applied research with much of the initial emphasis being 
placed on evaluation. But this view was soon challenged by 
those who saw it much more as a management tool. This 
school of thought placed the focus of the M&E reporting 
systems on project-level budget management and 
performance budgeting, and the users were mainly those 
with a financial or management interest in the project. By 
the early 1990s, there was a shift in focus from projects to 
sectors. A sector-wide approach (SWAP) became 
increasingly popular as a means of promoting and 
coordinating sector-wide and national development 
planning. Monitoring and evaluation became functions of 
sectoral ministries and appropriate M&E units were 
established at the ministerial level. In this period, expertise 
and skills were primarily on the data collection and 
processing side, not on the analysis of the data which often 
requires a good knowledge of the subject matter and related 
government policies. The analysis undertaken was primarily 
descriptive and the analysis of crucial links between specific 
poverty policies and their outcomes in living standards was 
missing. One had to turn to universities and research centers 
to find the appropriate analytical capacity. Still, useful 
capacity for poverty analysis was created during this period, 
and a number of excellent poverty assessments were 
prepared (Edmunds & Marchant, 2008). 
 
3.3 Basics of Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
The basics of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms have 
been established by Henry Gantt (who developed Gantt 
Diagram, recognized as the first tool for project planning 
and monitoring) and by Henry Fayol, who defined five 
management functions, of which control – evaluation 
function that still represents the base for the monitoring and 
evaluation processes is one of them. The two authors‟ papers 
are practically the precursors of resources allocation theory 
and of the WBS definition, two fundamental concepts that 
describe the objective, respectively the track of the 
monitoring and evaluation processes within the projects 
(Tache&Spăşoiu, 2013). 
 
3.4 Development of Stochastic Methods 
      
The next stage in the evolution of monitoring and evaluation 
mechanisms is represented by development of the 
management stochastic methods like CPM, PERT. CPM – 
Was developed as a joint-venture of DuPont Corporation 
and Remington Rand Corporation while PERT was 
developed by Booz Allen Hamilton Corporation. These 
development of project management with these two 
stochastic methods found application to project management 
within a number of fields, including engineering, and 
manufacturing projects. These made project monitoring and 
evaluation quiet attractive to investors and managers.  Other 
methods that were developed are CCPM (Critical Chain 
Project Management), XPM (Extreme Project Management), 
CEM (Critical Events Management) and PRINCE (Projects 
in Controlled Environments). The need for developing these 
systems and methods derive mainly from the fact that most 
approaches regarding the monitoring and evaluation 
processes follow a rigid logic, focusing especially on data 
(and not on information), technology (and not on human 
resources), on processes (and not on services) and on project 
management structures (rather than knowledge) (Bennets, 
Wood-Harper, & Mills 2000.; Sarantis, Smithson, 
Charalabidis, &Askounis, 2010; Tache&Spăşoiu, 2013). 
Based on these considerations a number of mechanisms for 
monitoring and evaluation of projects, currently used by 
project management teams, of which the most relevant are: 
1) Gantt Diagram, used both for planning and monitoring 
the projects; 
2) Logical Framework Matrix (LFM), tackled within a 
systemic framework approach; 
3) Matrix Organization, meant for optimizing the 
relationships between project team members and for 
facilitating information exchange; 
4) Probabilistic Management Methods (PERT, CPM, etc.), 
designed for both project planning and for their 
monitoring and evaluation; 
5) Monitoring with specialized information programs 
(Microsoft Project, BaseCamp, Quick Base, etc.), used 
for tracking in real time the projects‟ evolution, but also 
for the dynamic and computerized resources reallocation; 
6) Benchmarking techniques, on their basis being defined 
performance indicators, for the assessment of projects, 
processes and management relations, by relating to 
different reference levels determined in terms of similar 
projects performance that were developed in competitive 
organizations; 
7) Balanced Scorecard Management Systems, through 
which the team members are provided with the necessary 
informational flows for decisions making process, on the 
base of leading indicators or lagging indicators; 
8) Internal audits, whose utilization is susceptible to provide 
the team management with relevant information 
regarding the compliance to applicable standards, 
procedures and regulations; 
9) Initial, intermediate and final activity reports. 
 
3.5 Latest developments 
       
Latest contributions in the field of project management focus 
on the reconfiguration of already existing techniques and 
tools for monitoring and evaluation, or on the adaptation of 
the monitoring and evaluation methods taken from other 
areas of research to the specific of the management projects. 
Today, M & E processes include both qualitative and 
quantitative components in an attempt to capture as

complete as possible a certain project progress and 
development Tache&Spăşoiu, 2013). One of the most u sed 
tools encompassing directory lines applicable to the field of 
project management is Project Cycle Management 
Guidelines, which asserts also a set of tools used in projects 
operation: logical framework approach, Key Quality 
Assessment, risk management matrix, progress reports, 
annual operational plans, and initial, intermediate and final 
activity reports, their sequence and the way they are 
simultaneously or consecutively applied during project 
implementation depending on a set of subjective and 
objective factors, but also on the ability, experience and 
expertise of the project manager (Gokhale& Bhatia, 1997; 
Tache&Spăşoiu, 2013).  Beginning with the year 2003, 
projects management science was added up with the notion 
of Management of the projects portfolio, which redefines the 
role of monitoring and evaluation of the projects in terms of 
two main coordinates 
a) Simultaneous monitoring of more than one project is 
complex and hard to manage and needs complex tools 
and mechanisms, that exceed the simple technique s 
applied punctually in most of the individual projects; 
b) Evaluation is essential, because an accurate evaluation of 
a sample of projects within a portfolio will provide with 
sufficient information and practical elements so that the 
iteration of same mistakes within future projects that will 
be attached to the portfolio be prevented, thus 
contributing, on long term, to the increase of its value 
(Jonas, 2010). 
 
In the  2000s and the advent of poverty reduction strategies 
that one started to see the coming together of project- and 
sector-based M&E efforts with poverty monitoring 
activities. The driving force behind this was the growing 
interest in evidence-based development and the need to 
establish national M&E programs centered on the 
monitoring of results. This also marked the beginning of a 
recognition that M&E information had uses that extended 
beyond serving as a tool for policy-makers and planners, and 
that, when made available to members of the public and to 
civil society, it could promote accountability in public sector 
managers and good governance. There are several important 
lessons to be learned from this short history in that during 
the early days when the M&E activities consisted primarily 
of an un-coordinated and disparate set of project level 
activities. 
 
In the 1980s monitoring and evaluation were seen primarily 
as project-related activities. It defined monitoring as a 
continuous assessment both of the functioning of project 
activities in the context of implementation schedules and of 
the use of project inputs by targeted populations in the 
context of design expectations. It was seen as an internal 
project activity, an essential part of good managemen t 
practice, and therefore an integral part of day- to-day 
management. Evaluation was presented as a periodic 
assessment of the relevance, performance, efficiency, and 
impact of the project in the context of its stated objectives. It 
usually involved comparisons in time, area, or population 
requiring information from outside the project (Edmunds & 
Marchant, 2008). 
 
Almost 20 years later these terms were revised and updated 
by the DAC Network on Development Evaluation (2002) 
which defined monitoring as “a continuing function that uses 
systematic collection of data on specified indicators to 
provide management and the main stakeholders with 
indications of progress and achievement of objectives and 
progress in the use of allocated resources Thus, monitoring 
embodies the regular tracking of inputs, activities, outputs, 
outcomes, and impacts of development activities at the 
project, program, sector, and national levels. Evaluation was 
defined by the DAC as “the process of determining the 
worth or significance of a development activity, policy or 
program so as to establish the relevance and fulfillment of 
objectives, development efficiency, effectiveness, impact 
and sustainability of a project or program. An evaluation 
should provide information that is credible and useful, 
enabling the incorporation of lessons learned into the 
decision-making process of both recipients and donors 
(Edmunds & Marchant, 2008).

evaluation mechanisms in correlation with the project 
management dynamic 
 
 Period Stage Evolution Of Monitoring And  Evaluation Mechanisms 
1 1860-1900 Inception 
stage 
First concerns regarding management as a science emerge while the mechanisms for monitoring and 
evaluation have not appeared yet. 
2 1900-1955 Empirical 
stage 
First base concepts of the project management, being outlined. First definitions and approaches of the project 
concept, with regard to civil engineering or to military services. As monitoring and evaluation tools used the 
Gantt Diagram and simplified versions of it 
3 1955-1970 Applied 
stage 
Need for efficient activity generated an anachronism regarding the relation between theory and practice. The 
CPM and PERT methods are used as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and was made the first reference 
to Logical Framework Approach, respectively to Logical Framework Matrix. 
4 1970-1990 Scientific 
stage 
Theorization of the project management as a science develop. There emerge magazines and publications with 
regard to the project management, most of them being still current. Project management bodies emerge e.g.  
IPMA or PMI. The monitoring and evaluation mechanisms remain focused on Gantt Diagram, CMP and 
PERT methods and Logical Framework Matrix 
5 1990-2000 Information 
stage 
Project management follows the world economy approach, detaching practically from the status of technical 
science and going quasi-definitively to the sphere of economics sciences with use of software. Flexible 
management structures, such as matrix organization emerge including management through projects or also 
new methods and techniques (Balanced Scorecard). 
6 2000-present Strategic 
stage 
Project management emerge as the key field of the organization strategy, capable of producing added value 
and competitive advantage. There developed companies that have as activity object the elaboration, 
development, implementation and project monitoring

3.7 Modern Evolution Approaches of Monitoring and 
Evaluation Processes within the Context of Project 
Management 
 
Currently, on the background of amplifying the concerns for 
using efficient mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of 
the projects, there emerged and manifest a set of approaches 
for upgrading the use of monitoring and evaluation 
mechanisms, taking into consideration the fact that both 
internal and external stakeholders of a project are aware of 
the impact of exerting complete and coherent processes of 
monitoring and evaluation of the project results. In this 
context, professional literature reflects three major 
approaches that manifest within the exertion of monitoring 
and evaluation processes and that generate a significant 
positive impact also on the tools used for exercising these 
two utterly important processes. 
 
1) Correlation of monitoring processes with the project 
lifecycle 
Starting with the project lifecycle, defined by PMI (1996), 
the theoreticians and the practitioners came to the conclusion 
that each stage of the project lifecycle has certain features 
that demand using some monitoring and evaluation tools, to 
the detriment of others, in terms of their advantages and 
disadvantages. Furthermore, the correlation of the 
monitoring and evaluation processes with the project 
lifecycle does not only regard the differentiate selection of 
the tools used for exerting monitoring prerogatives, but also 
regard the intensity of which these processes are exerted, 
through relating to other processes that are specific to the 
project management cycle. 
 
2) Correlation of the monitoring and evaluation tools in 
complex mechanisms designed to these projects 
exertion 
Each of monitoring and evaluation methods and techniques 
previously mentioned, individually approached, represent 
tools that facilitate the exertion of monitoring and evaluation 
processes and that substitute both the traditional direct 
observation (the oldest monitoring method) and the direct 
comparison (the oldest evaluation method). Each of these 
tools, presents advantages and limits, their individual use 
being efficient only on short term. On the other hand, using 
an unstructured mix of monitoring and evaluation tools is 
not indicated, this process being time consuming, and in 
most of the cases, human resources and financial consuming. 
         
In these circumstances, the professional theory and practice 
put the problem of identification a sequence in using certain 
monitoring and evaluation tools, sequence that, through the 
combination of its elements, determines a monitoring and 
evaluation mechanism applied within a project, based on the 
principles of synergy effect. This approach manifests more 
and more significantly in the context of project management, 
the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms being organized 
either in terms of project team preferences, or in terms of the 
specific of the developed project. The emergence of new 
professions in the context of project management with 
attributions in monitoring and evaluation sphere. 
 
Taking into consideration the fact that the monitoring 
process can prove time consuming and needs also capacities 
and personal abilities for its exertion in an efficient and 
compliant way, specialized companies in providing with 
services designed for project management generate qualified 
personnel in exerting monitoring processes. Additionally, 
more and more financing bodies (World Bank, EBRD, 
European Committee, commercial banks, credit 
cooperatives, etc.) double the guarantees claimed before 
grants through a monitoring process of the way the offered 
grants are used. 
 
An eloquent example is represented by the situation of the 
projects that are financed from European funds, where to 
each project there is allocated a monitoring responsible, and 
within Management Authorities there are established 
committees/ departments or even monitoring directions of 
projects implementation, being thus emphasized their 
importance in the context of modern project management. 
      
The materialization of these approaches leads to diminishing 
the negative impact currently exerted by a set of chronic 
factors on the efficiency of the projects monitoring and 
evaluation processes, respectively: 
a) Lack of experience of the project managers and of the 
project implementation team regarding the correct and 
complete use of the monitoring and evaluation tools and 
mechanisms; 
b) Inefficient use of budgets allocated for the exertion of the 
monitoring and evaluation processes, fact that makes 
them look insufficient in relation with the real existing 
needs within projects; 
c) the mentality of traditionalist project managers, who 
consider the monitoring and evaluation processes as 
being preponderantly bureaucratic, that take much time 
and do not generate added value, reason why they 
subvert the role and the importance of these two 
processes in the good development of the projects; 
d) Unsuitable combination of the methods and techniques, 
into inefficient 
e) or illogical mechanisms, without realizing a correlation 
of the tools with the project lifecycle, with its 
dimensions, with its specific elements, or with other 
relevant factors for the correct definition of a monitoring 
and evaluation mechanism; 
f) Concision lack and SMART objectives set, that lead to 
the impossibility of drawing some performance 
objectives; 
g) Lack of a methodology for the collection of records and 
data regarding the projects implementation, so that these 
may be used as historical data sources for future similar 
projects; 
h) Lack of project managers‟ involvement in the stage of 
fundamental monitoring of a significant information 
volume derived from the compliance monitoring of 
others similar projects. 
 
The emergence and the dissemination of the three 
approaches, along with the obvious endeavors for 
repositioning the monitoring and evaluation processes in the 
context of project management represent sufficient 
arguments in order to justify the need for further study of t he 
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, thus to identify their 
applicability and vulnerabilities, so that the monitoring and 
evaluation processes can be developed in efficiency

circumstances and to achieve the goal for which they are 
included in the project management cycle. 
      
Modern project which started in 1950s has been evolving 
subject to a number of developments in technology and 
applications. According to Seymour & Hussein (2014b) this 
developments can be used to divide evolution of project 
management into four as follows; 
a) 1950-1957: First era characterized by advances in 
transportation and communication which affect logistics 
management.  
b) 1958-79: Second era characterized by advances and 
application of management science 
c) 1980-1994: This is second era characterized by 
innovation and development of the personal computer 
and application of related software and technologies. 
d) 1995-to present : Advanced technology continues to 
influence project  management in all fronts and functions 
 
Therefore the evolution of project management has been 
influenced by developments in transport and 
communication, advances and application of management 
science, the invention and increased use of the personal 
computer and related software and continuous influence and 
application of modern high technologies in all functions of 
project management. 
 
4. The Future of Project Management, 
Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
The environment and dynamics of organizations continues 
to evolve in earnest. Therefore the challenges of future 
project managers continue to change and become more 
complex. Projects continue to increase in size and 
complexity and so the future project managers should adapt 
to new requirements, dimensions and specialty with respect 
to technology and methods used as well as skills 
requirements which continue to be unique and project 
specific. Information requirements too have increased and 
continue to increase with the project manager required to 
handle huge data in different forms. This implies growing 
need and use of information, communication technology 
(ICT). The project manager should therefore be able to 
understand the big picture and effectively communicate with 
stakeholders.  
 
With increased globalization, the project manager should be 
able to work across networks, cultures, languages, 
geographical features and increased competition as well as 
collaboration. Therefore the future project manager should 
be able to cope with increased globalization and a complex 
project environment (Seymour & Hussein, 2014a).  
 
Project management continues to grow as a profession and 
will become a leading player in the job market. According to 
Seymour & Hussein, (2014a) in 2009, project management 
ranked as the third most valuable skill by employers just 
behind leadership/negotiation skills followed by business 
analysis skills. This is a big indicator of the increasing 
importance of project management as a profession today and 
the future.  
 
Increasing standardization, continuous refinement of 
concepts and development of software and its application in 
project management have together changed project 
management from an art to a science (Seymour & Hussein, 
2014a).  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Project management has developed based on scientific 
theories during 1950s and 1960s of the last century . From 
1990s project management has grown into an independent 
profession or discipline.  A more and more dynamic and 
complex business environment, effective project 
management is a key factor in achieving a sustainable 
competitive advantage in the market place. The term „project 
management „was coined in the 1950s, where it mainly 
involved scheduling, budgeting and control of activities. 
This continued even with advent of computers in 
management and in 1980s, it remained the same but with 
introduction of project information systems that ran on 
mainframe computers. In 1990s project management was 
redefined by wide range of fields such as operations 
management, systems thinking, new product development, 
risk management, the quality movement, organizational 
dynamics, industrial psychology and various other aspects of 
commerce. For the field of project management 
understanding the evolution of project management, 
monitoring and evaluation will create a better understanding 
of the project practices of the past, establish a stronger 
identity for those people interested in the project 
management of the past, and thereby also contribute to 
defining and redefining project management as a particular 
scientific management in the 1990s. 
 
In project management two of the most important processes 
within project management cycle, i.e. project monitoring and 
evaluation, are usually approached as side-activities by 
project managers and project management teams, whose 
unfortunate result is project or program failure.  It was noted 
that  monitoring and evaluation tools for project managers, 
aimed to provide complete and relevant information about 
the progress of the project and that the present scientific 
approaches regarding project management are mostly 
focused on topics like resources‟ allocation, activities‟ 
scheduling, time management, forecasting various economic 
or financial indicators like  IRR, NPV, Cost-Benefit Ratio  
while topics like monitori ng or evaluating the projects‟ 
progress, during their entire lifecycle, are left optional. It is 
just recently that monitoring and evaluation was driven 
solely by observation and “trial and error”. However, today 
knowledge and understanding has advanced and statistical 
and monitoring and evaluation methodologies have been 
formalized and are currently in use. One of the most visible 
gains from the pressure to monitor and evaluate progress 
towards the reduction realization of project and program 
been the reawakening of interest in and support for official 
statistics. Evidence-based development requires 
underpinning by statistical information and data. This focus 
on good data is supported by donors implementing the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, as its emphasis on the 
local ownership of development means that the donors are 
pulling back from actively managing the implementation of 
projects and programs to a more hands-off approach of

increasingly turning to setting objectives and targets to

Project management developed as a consequence existing 
desire to adapt the theory and practice of management to the 
projects. In practice, the application of the tools and 
techniques of project management is facilitated by the use of 
specialized software for project management. The real step 
to transform project management into a profession came 
with formation of Project Management Institute (PMI) in 
1969 to promote the project management profession. PMI 
published 'A Guide to the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMBOK)' considered one of the essential tools 
in the project management profession today. 
 
Whereas there is agreement generally on the future of 
project management, historians and scholars have not agreed 
on when exactly modern project management started. 
However modern project management started in 1950s.  The 
evolution of project management  as well monitoring and 
evaluation has been influenced by developments in transport 
and communication, advances and application of 
management science, the invention and increased use of the 
personal computer and related software and continuous 
influence and application of modern  technologies in all 
functions of project management. 
 
As a science, the first project to introduce science to project 
management and control was the work undertaken by Kelley 
and Walker in 1956/57 by developing an algorithm that 
became the Critical path Method for DupontChemical 
Factory in the US. Therefore development of science has 
significantly influenced the evolution of project 
management, monitoring and evaluation.   
 
The actual forerunners or catalysts for the development of 
discussions on project management and formation of 
associations to support new ideas and knowledge were the 
schedulers of 1960s.  Therefore the development of project 
management to what it is today is a direct effort and result of 
the schedulers who needed a forum to develop their 
discipline.   
 
With increased globalization, the project manager should be 
able to work across networks, cultures, languages, 
geographical features and increased competition as well as 
collaboration. Therefore the future project manager should 
be able to cope with increased globalization and a complex 
project environment. Project management has changed from 
an art to a science over time because of increasing 
standardization, continuous refinement of concepts and 
development and use of computer software. The growing 
complexity, technology advancement and changing legal 
environment   and stakeholder concerns and challenges in 
managing projects has given rise to new fields directly 
related to project management like safety and sustainability . 
Concerns over sustainability of projects and programs are 
the main drivers for monitoring and evaluation.
