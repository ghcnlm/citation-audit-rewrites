A conceptual framework for training of
trainers (ToT) interventions in global health
Maru Mormina 1* and Sophie Pinder 2*
Abstract
Background: Global health partnerships (GHP) between high or low-middle income countries are considered one
of the best approaches to health systems strengthening. They typically involve highly skilled healthcare workers
who volunteer to deliver capacity strengthening projects overseas, often in the form of peer-to-peer support
through training and mentoring. Given GHP ’s strong focus on education and training, a common assumption
is that training of trainers (ToT) is a strong predictor of s ustainability because of its potential for up-skilling
the workforce rapidly, cheaply and exponentially by developing local educators. Our aim is to test this assumption and
identify the strengths and limitations of this approach by analysing qualitative data from a set of GHP funded by the
UK Department for International Development through the Tropical Health and Education Trust.
Results: Our analysis identifies some of the common features of the ToT model and a number of limitations that can
prevent it from being both effective and sustainable. Whilst most GHP strive for the long-term sustainability of the
training by focusing on adequate training provision and support of local trainers, the wider issues that can facilitate or
prevent the continuation of training are not always considered. We propose a conceptual framework (TRAIN) for ToT
interventions to help inform practice and project evaluation. We illustrate the applicability of our framework through
five case studies, each chosen to illustrate one aspect of the framework.
Conclusions: TRAIN is intended as a starting point for further refinements and discussions about the factors affecting
capacity building strategies based on training cascades. Although we envisage its usefulness to GHP as a guidance to
design and operationalise ToT, we recognise that in practice it may be difficult to implement it in its entirety. The key
message underlying TRAIN is that the sustainabilit y of a cascade depends on a number of factors being
present or developing at different operational level s during the course of a project. These are crucial to
transform the opportunities that ToT affords to hea lth systems in developing countries into the actual
achievement of a training cascade that ultimately ups kills the workforce and improves health outcomes in
these countries.

Background
Shortages and poor retention of health workers represent a
significant problem of health systems in many developing
countries, with major impact on health outcomes [ 1].
Heavy workloads, poor salaries and limited access to train-
ing, education, mentoring and continuous professional de-
velopment (CPD) [ 2] are all contributing factors that
undermine the morale and commitment of healthcare
workers. This, in turn, contri butes to complex migration
patterns from low and middle income countries (LMICs)
to high income countries (HI C s )t h a te x a c e r b a t ec u r r e n t
workforce imbalances [3]. The World Health Organization
forecasts that the healthcare workforce deficit in LMICs
will reach 12.9 million skilled health professionals by 2035
[4]. For this reason, a strong focus on strengthening the
capacity of the healthcare workforce is crucial.
Since the publication of the Crisp report [ 5], which
openly endorsed global health partnerships (GHP) as one
of the best approaches to healthcare capacity strengthen-
ing, there has been an increased interest and support for

this kind of approach to development. GHP are usually
defined as long-term, sustainable and usually voluntary
collaborations between institutions with similar objectives
for the mutual exchange of skills, knowledge and experi-
ence [ 6]. GHP tend to be established between partners in
LMICs and HICs, though collaborations between institu-
tions with similar objectives both based in LMICs
(South-South collaborations) are becoming increasingly
common. They typically involve highly skilled healthcare
workers from HICs (or other LMICs) who volunteer to
deliver capacity strengthening projects overseas, most
commonly in the form of peer-to-peer support through
training and mentoring [ 7]. As with most development
initiatives, GHP place strong emphasis in sustainability,
which we define here as “the ability of a project to con-
tinue to function effectively, for the foreseeable future
(… )” [8]. Yet, despite its centrality in project planning and
evaluation, there is little evidence to guide GHP on how
to achieve it.
Given GHP ’s strong focus on education and train-
ing, a common assumption is that training of trainers
(ToT) is a strong predictor of sustainability. ToT is
very popular within the development industry because
of its potential for up-skilling the workforce rapidly,
cheaply and exponentially. The basic idea of ToT is
to initiate a training cascade: skills and knowledge are
taught to a small group of trainees who become
trainers and go on to transfer those skills to others
[9]. Thus, over time, up-skilling through training
should become self-sustaining. This, however, assumes
that the cascade is allowed to proceed swiftly and un-
impeded by other factors, such as attrition among the
new trainers or availability of resources for scaling up
the training. To presuppose that the problem of staff
shortages and limited capacity of the health workforce
in LMICs can be solved sustainably by training local
trainers seems at best simplistic and warrants closer
scrutiny.
Extended funding is rarely given for the evaluation of
a partnership [ 10] and for this reason training is often
assessed within a short-term horizon. This constrains
the capacity to test the above assumption by asking
questions about the effectiveness of the training and cru-
cially about its long-term sustainability ( ibid). Conse-
quently, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the
topic. Within this limitation, the aim of this paper is first
to identify some of the common features of the ToT
model, as implemented within a set of GHP funded by
the UK Department for International Development
(DFID) through the Tropical Health and Education
Trust (THET), an international non-governmental or-
ganisation that promotes and supports GHP. Informed
by our findings and applying Capabilities theory [ 11], we
propose a conceptual framework for ToT interventions
to guide practice and project evaluation. We show the
applicability of our framework through five case stud-
ies, each chosen to illustrate one aspect of the frame-
work. Given the widespread use of ToT in global
health initiatives it is important to establish under
which conditions this approach can offer a sustainable
solution to the capacity problem in the healthcare
workforce of LMICs ’.
Methods
In order to characterise ToT initiatives, we analysed
GHP in receipt of medium-size grants from THET (typ-
ically between £15-30 K). We excluded on-going part-
nerships and focused only on completed projects to
capture some of the longer-term outcomes of a ToT,
particularly in relation to the cascading of training. This
resulted in a dataset of 15 GHP spread mostly across the
African continent with ToT activities covering a wide
range of clinical and technical skills (see Additional file 1).
The research consisted of documentary analysis (applica-
tion forms, progress reports, email communications,
meeting notes, media reports, academic outputs, etc.),
using a directed content analysis. Unlike conventional
content analysis, where coding categories are derived
directly from the text, the directed approach starts with
a theory or relevant empirical evidence as a guidance for
deriving initial codes. [ 12]. In our case, we derived such
theoretical and empirical evidence from the academic
and grey literature (the latter referring to publications
outside traditional academic channels, such as govern-
ment reports), which we mined using the following key-
words: “Training the trainer ”, “training of trainers ”,
“cascade training ”, “global health partnerships ”, “inter-
national development ”, either alone or in combination.
It is difficult to assess the extent of existing research and
other materials relating to ToT, therefore it is possible
that some relevant information was not captured in the
literature review.
Whenever gaps in the documentary material were
found, the analysis was supplemented with key inform-
ant interviews; these were typically project leads. An it-
erative process consisting of several readings of the
documents and the wider literature allowed us to derive
a set of 32 key variables that we used as codes. These
were further refined and grouped into categories and
subsequently into themes.
Using Sen ’s Capability Approach (CA) as our analytical
lens [11], we then conceptualised an evaluative framework
that integrates the evidence derived from the content ana-
lysis, together with organisational knowledge (i.e. THET ’s
practical experience), key informant interviews and the
analysis of the literature. The CA is a philosophical theory,
originally developed by Amartya Sen to counter what he
saw as a reductionist evaluation of development purely in
Mormina and Pinder Globalization and Health          (2018) 14:100 Page 2 of 11
<<<PAGE=3>>>
terms of access to resources (wealth, income, legal rights,
etc.). The CA, instead, focuses on what individuals can be
and do (their capabilities), rather the resources available to
them. Capabilities are therefore, the opportunities that in-
dividuals have to engage in the actions and activities that
are important to them. Because capabilities are
multi-dimensional, they must be evaluated across multiple
domains. For this reason, the CA represents a suitable
conceptual tool to articulate a framework that helps us
evaluate the extent to which ToT interventions help ex-
pand healthcare workers ’ capacity beyond a unidimen-
sional focus on skills training.
From our dataset, we selected five case studies for fur-
ther analysis; for simplicity, each case is here described
to illuminate one aspect of the framework. Such single
focus inevitably invited omissions and simplifications,
and therefore it is possible that our account does not
fully capture the complexity and richness of each experi-
ence. This is because whilst each case study was chosen
to provide a practical example of a specific element of
our framework, they all interacted with elements from
every part of the framework.
Results and discussion
ToT interventions within THET-funded GHP
Across all 15 GHP , a number of common themes
emerged. In general, most partnerships have a long history
of collaboration and therefore assessment of training
needs was almost invariably conducted jointly. Though
the ToT initiatives we reviewed were very different and
covered a wide range of topics, in general the focus was
strongly on skills development of clinical and technical
staff. This is unsurprising, given THET ’sl o n gh i s t o r yo f
fostering partnerships among these cadres. Yet, good
healthcare management and leadership are also essential
for strong health systems [ 13, 14]; thus, a more active pro-
motion of partnerships to help build leadership capacity
was identified as an area requiring further development.
At the other end of the spectrum, we observed that front-
line community workers were also unrepresented in ToT
interventions (and training in general).
In the majority of cases (9/15), ToT was embedded into
a wider training plan, thus representing a relatively small
element of the project. Potential local trainers (LTs) were
generally identified by the LMIC partner; yet, the specific
selection criteria were not consistently reported, except
for the requirement of relevant clinical expertise. This
suggests that the selection of LTs was based largely on an
assessment of “hard” technical skills. Assessment of “soft”
skills (e.g. enthusiasm, willingness to teach, communica-
tion skills) was not routinely reported, suggesting that
such skills were either implicitly evaluated or not consid-
ered part of the selection criteria. The selection of HIC
master trainers (MTs) was also largely based on the
assessment of hard skills but, in addition, availability, de-
veloping country experience and teaching experience were
also consistently considered. The teaching of technical
skills was the main focus of most ToT curricula, though
pedagogical skills were included in 10/15 ToT projects.
ToT was usually delivered in the early to middle
phases of the projects, with gradual transfer of training
from the HIC to the LMIC partner towards the latter
stages. However, this was not observed consistently
across partnerships. The ability of LTs to take ownership
of the training seemed influenced by a number of fac-
tors, crucially time and resources. ToT is generally deliv-
ered in the context of time-bound projects lasting
between one and three years, a timescale that may not
allow for a full transfer of training skills, particularly
when those skills are highly complex and technical. In
our dataset, only three ToT projects achieved a complete
transfer of training from MTs to LTs; in most cases,
however, LTs were still reliant on MT support by the end
of the project, thus calling into question the sustainabil-
ity of the training. LT attrition was generally not cap-
tured by end of project reports, in part because these are
usually submitted within six months of completion. To
appreciate the extent of LT retention, as well as the im-
pact and continuity of the training cascade, such
short-term evaluation is unrealistic. Instead, a two-year
post-project evaluation may provide a more accurate
measurement of this indicator.
Although most of the GHPs analysed were endorsed
by national, regional or institutional authorities, in many
cases endorsement did not translate into concrete sup-
port in the form of financial resources, assistance with
recruitment of trainees, etc. Moreover, more than half of
GHP in our dataset had no clear plans to roll out the
training or to offer long-term support to newly qualified
LTs (e.g. through CPD) beyond the initial training given.
Hence, cascading of training was highly variable, ranging
from none to several hundred health workers being lo-
cally trained by the end of the project.
Though caution is required in assessing the above find-
ings due to the small sample analysed, they do nonetheless
reveal that various factors outside the specific training ac-
tivities conducted by partnerships can either enable or
hinder a ToT cascade: local conditions, lack of time and
resources, inadequate facilities, inadequate institutional
support (e.g. for the promotion of training workshops),
etc. These factors challenge the assumption that simply
increasing training capacity translates in a more capable
workforce; we must therefore think critically about ToT
beyond this single quantitative dimension.
The ‘TRAIN’ framework
Given the above findings, we suggest that an effective
approach to ToT must consider the multiplicity of

factors that impact on the capacity of trainers to sustain
a training cascade, beyond their own skillset. A training
cascade is a process whose outcome is to strengthen the
workforce capacity. ToT planning and evaluation, there-
fore, requires capturing outcome as well as process mea-
sures, the ultimate goal and the steps required to
achieve it [ 15]. One of the difficulties with process evalu-
ation is that it requires different indicators depending on
which strategies partnerships use to build capacity [ 16].
However, irrespective of the specific indicators, the ques-
tions that need to be answered cannot be only about
outcomes, but fundamentally about the factors that
affect people ’s capacity to achieve those outcomes.
Because ToT is a process of expanding healthcare
workers’capabilities to realise specific achievements, it is
amenable to analysis through the lens of Sen ’sC A[ 11].
In brief, the CA stresses the importance of agency and
empowerment. Capabilities are the opportunities open
to individuals to realise different “functionings” (re-
sources, activities, attitudes) that they recognise as valu-
able. What matters from an evaluation perspective is not
so much the functionings (i.e outcomes or achieve-
ments), but the choice and agency to achieve them and
crucially, the conversion factors, i.e. the forces that help
or hinder individuals ’capacity to convert capabilities into
functionings, or in other words, their ability to turn op-
portunity into achievement (i.e the process). The CA in-
terests us here precisely because it allows us to develop
an evaluative framework for ToT that captures the inter-
action between individual capabilities (the opportunity
set that training offers), achievement (the cascading of
training and ultimately the up-skilling of the healthcare
workforce) and conversion factors (the political, social
and economic determinants at play when building cap-
acity through ToT).
Informed by the philosophy of the CA, we propose an
analytical framework, which we call TRAIN. It aims to
help practitioners identify the negative and positive in-
fluences on ToT in order to develop appropriate and
sustainable strategies. TRAIN stands for Talent, Re-
sources, Alignment, Implementation and Nurture, which
capture the various elements that need to be integrated
if the ToT model is to succeed. The framework (Fig. 1),
which is adapted from Cooke [ 17], has two dimensions:
Three levels of impact : these are the individual, organ-
isational and supra-organisational (networks, national
and international bodies, etc.)
Five constitutive elements of ToT : these are discussed
in detail below and are represented in the diagram by ar-
rows that indicate their contribution towards ToT. The
arrows traverse the three structural levels suggesting that
activities and processes at all levels can influence the
contribution of each element to the success of a ToT.
The arrows point in both directions to indicate that ac-
tivities and policies applied at one level can have an im-
pact at all other levels.
Underlying the framework is the notion of sustainabil-
ity. Whilst this is not directly measured, the framework ’s
constitutive elements contribute to the self-sustained
long-term training capacity of the organisation receiving
the ToT intervention.
Talent
The main goal of a ToT intervention is to train partici-
pants to become trainers. Thus, both MTs and LTs must
have the right blend of skills, experience and knowledge to

train others (talent). A trainer without professional experi-
ence ( “hard skills”) has nothing to teach, and this is often
considered the main attribute of a good trainer. However,
equally important is to have a clear conceptual under-
standing of his/her own practice and the ability to transfer
this knowledge to others ( “soft skills”). Though individuals
can be taught teaching techniques, not everyone is able to
teach. Key personal attributes are essential to become a
trainer: patience, insight, confidence, communication
skills, leadership, capacity for self-reflection, ability to be
constructively critical, and above all motivation to help
others [9]. In addition, MTs working in LMICs must have
cultural awareness and flexibility to adapt training to the
local circumstances. LTs ’ long-term commitment to train
is also critical to avoid the high levels of attrition common
in LMICs. Thus, at the organisational level, partner orga-
nisations should have procedures in place to identify po-
tential trainers (MTs and LTs), e.g. through pre-
recruitment aptitude tests that assess both soft and hard
skills. At the supra-organisational level, policies and incen-
tives can be introduced to help talent recruitment and re-
tention, such as professional accreditation, benefit
packages, progression paths, etc. Tables 1 and 2 show
some examples of criteria that can aid talent assessment
for master and local trainers.
Case 1: Training health Workers in Kenya: Talent selection
and collaborative development
In order to strengthen antenatal, intrapartum and post-
natal care in four Kenyan regions, a partnership was
established between a Teaching Health Board in Wales
responsible for delivering healthcare services to rural
communities and its Kenyan counterpart. The partner-
ship, consisting of midwives from Wales as well as pub-
lic health and maternal and sexual health service leads
in Kenya, co-delivered a ToT project for local health
workers to transfer key knowledge in maternity care to
traditional birth referral agents (TBRAs). Special atten-
tion was paid to the selection and management of both
the Welsh health professionals who would become MTs
and the Kenyan health workers identified as potential
LTs. This proved crucial to ensure the effective cascad-
ing of training at the local level. For the Welsh partner,
this meant a rigorous recruitment process in line with
the Health Board ’s Volunteer Policy to identify and re-
cruit suitable health professionals to design, develop and
teach the ToT course to the Kenyan health practitioners.
The motivations of prospective MTs for joining the pro-
ject were specifically taken into account during the re-
cruitment process. Candidates were recruited following
extensive discussions with project leads and the Steering
Group in which the candidate ’s role in the project and
the extent of their involvement was clearly defined.
The three Welsh volunteers were all experienced mid-
wives chosen because of their specific skills, as well as
their enthusiasm and commitment to the partnership.
One of them had significant professional experience as
well as project management and evaluation skills gained
through a previous role as practice development midwife
in the UK. Moreover, she had previously developed
training programmes and supported staff to develop
skills in maternity care in the Kenyan setting. The two
other volunteers were clinical midwives with extensive
UK-based experience in midwife-led care and out of
hospital births. For their part, the Kenyan management
team selected local community health volunteers to at-
tend the ToT course as prospective LTs based on their
enthusiasm to work with local communities beyond
their usual health care roles and their interest in leading
improvements in community health care. Assessing mo-
tivation and commitment was essential given that about
half of the candidates were unpaid health workers.
Several strategies were embedded in the four-day ToT
programme aimed at developing the training potential of
prospective LTs. These involved exploring the partici-
pants’ experiences and level of knowledge of local com-
munity needs, allowing them to reflect on these needs in
relation to their new roles and responsibilities as
trainers. In addition to clinical skills and knowledge
training, trainees were also taught teaching and facilita-
tion techniques, so they could effectively cascade the
training to the TBRAs. LTs were encouraged to draw de-
tailed training plans for TBRAs based on the local

challenges they identified, thus fostering a sense of own-
ership. LTs received face-to-face support from MTs to
deliver their first training course, with subsequent train-
ing activities being supported by remote mentoring.
By the end of the project, all 16 health workers who
completed the ToT course had cascaded the training to
a total of 106 TBRAs. The locally owned training
programme brought into close contact local health
workers and TBRAs, and this resulted in increased mu-
tual trust between these cadres: TBRAs made 941 refer-
rals to skilled health workers and the health staff began
to value the role of the TBRAs as a local resource to
draw upon for support and information at community
level. Some of the TBRAs even gained employment at
local dispensaries.
Resources
This rubric includes the structures and processes that
enable training to cascade. Time is the main resource
limitation reported not just by the partnerships in our
dataset but more broadly in the literature [e.g. [ 18]].
Many LTs struggle to find the time to attend the ToT
course and to cascade the training afterwards. MTs also
experience time constraints, usually having to fit
overseas volunteering during their annual leave or
around highly demanding full-time jobs. Releasing staff
from their normal duties is crucial, yet often met with
reluctance. HIC organisations can perceive this as an un-
necessary burden, although the benefits for volunteers in
terms of professional development have been richly de-
scribed [ 5, 19]. LMIC organisations facing understaffing
need to integrate ToT within their wider strategic plans.
This can be done by adequately identifying the most
suitable LTs and conducting a realistic assessment of the
organisation’s capacity to absorb the workload once indi-
viduals are released from their duties to become trainers,
instead of uncritically welcoming overseas input that
might, in the long term, result in undue pressure on the
workforce.
Time to develop as a trainer is also important. Most
ToT courses are run as short workshops, which may not
always be appropriate. If topics are new to trainees or re-
quire behaviour changes, longer timeframes may need to
be built into the ToT curriculum to allow trainees to
learn, assimilate the information and feel ready to teach
it to others [ 9].
Besides time constraints, lack of financial and other
material resources can hinder ToT participation and
cascade. There is often an unspoken assumption that re-
source mobilisation by the overseas partner will help
cover recurring costs such as refreshments, teaching
equipment, travel expenses, etc. The importance of these
contributions to the success of a ToT cannot be under-
stated but neither can it be assumed that these will
always be covered by the HIC partner. Therefore, shared
responsibility with clear commitments and transparent
financial arrangements can help reduce barriers to ac-
cess and avoid imposing undue resource burden on part-
ners. Such commitment should not be limited to
financial support. Managers in LMIC institutions are
critical enablers of the training cascade, e.g. by helping
disseminate information about training events. Poor
communication may result in training being cancelled,
LTs demotivation and eventually the collapse of the cas-
cade. At the supra-organisational level, facilitators of
ToT courses and cascades include financial support, in-
frastructure (e.g. venues for training events) and dissem-
ination, particularly when the training takes place across
institutions or regions. Table 3 shows some examples of
criteria for measuring resource availability at different
levels.
Case 2: Negotiating time and resources for the development
of an internationally recognised gastrointenstinal
endoscopy training in Malawi
Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed is a common med-
ical emergency requiring timely and appropriate inter-
vention, but its management can be challenging if
medical supplies, equipment and trained personnel are
inadequate [ 20]. Following visits and a needs assessment
in 2009, a government tertiary teaching hospital in
Malawi and a UK university teaching hospital formed a
partnership to improve local endoscopy services. The
partnership focused on the provision of endoscopy
equipment, as well as training and support for endos-
copy staff in Malawi. To this end, a trainer from the UK
provided hands-on training in basic endoscopy skills to
a number of trainee doctors and clinical officers. In
addition, the UK team worked with a group of experi-
enced and trainee nursing staff on improvements in
practice and protocols.

The training was established to closely mirror the
standards of UK gastrointestinal endoscopy courses.
This included the requirement that trainees continue
training (under a suitably qualified trainer) for a further
six months after the completion of the course. This
well-founded principle was clearly as important in the
Malawian setting as it is in the UK. Yet, lack of properly
trained endoscopy trainers in the country became an
obstacle for meeting this requirement. Given the interest
on gastroscopy training from various hospitals in
Malawi, an opportunity was identified, therefore, to de-
velop a Train the Gastroscopy Trainers (TGT) course to
provide teaching training and skills-enrichment for con-
sultants. The long-term expectation was to establish a
National Endoscopy Training Centre by attracting offi-
cial recognition and funding both from within the coun-
try and from overseas.
The TGT programme was developed to specifically
and effectively enhance the teaching skills of the local
faculty in a limited timeframe. The training involved
local faculty personnel observing UK trainers teaching
the TGT, then delivering part of the training themselves
with the support and supervision of the UK team, thus
simultaneously training new trainers and enhancing the
skills of the existing local faculty to deliver future ToT.
Of significant concern was the fact that the running of
training courses would affect the vital provision of health
services by taking staff out of their jobs for periods of
time. The partnership addressed this concern by incorp-
orating training practice on live patients and by effective
coordination with the hospital to ensure that courses
were delivered and staff were released only when service
provision could be guaranteed. Such embedding of train-
ing activities within the cycle of service provision en-
sured a positive attitude towards local trainers and good
support from their unit and employer.
As a result of the partnership ’s ongoing work, in 2015,
a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed
between the World Gastroenterology Organisation
(WGO), British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), the
course accrediting body in the UK and The Malawi
Training Centre to establish an international training en-
doscopy centre in Malawi ’s second largest city, Blantyre.
The Centre is jointly managed by LMIC and HIC part-
ners, including Malawi ’s College of Medicine, the Mala-
wian Ministry of Health, the Blantyre hospital and a
programme funded by the UK ’s largest biomedical re-
search charity, the Wellcome Trust. The MoU clearly
outlines the division of responsibilities between partners.
For instance, the WGO has committed to promote the
centre and its courses among its networks, the BSC of-
fers free international membership to local trainer fac-
ulty in Malawi and local training centre delegates. In
May 2016, the Centre was inaugurated as a WGO
training centre, cementing the commitment of inter-
national and local partners to jointly develop and run
educational programmes through the Centre.
Alignment
ToT interventions will succeed if they align with individ-
uals’ professional goals. Becoming a trainer, thus, should
be recognised as part of a career path and not as an ad-
junct duty if attrition is to be avoided. GHP are rarely jus-
tified if their activities are not tailored to the local context
and health needs [ 21]. Similarly, ToT should feed into
local needs and organisational priorities. A good align-
ment between the outcome of a ToT and the organisa-
tion’s strategic objectives is more likely to result in greater
buy-in and support for cascade activities from local man-
agers and leaders. Such support can materialise, for ex-
ample, in successful lobbying at supra-organisational
levels to establish policies and processes that facilitate the
up-skilling of specific cadres. Alignment with regional or
country priorities is also important, and this will require
the establishment of formal and informal coalitions of dif-
ferent organisations (hospitals, districts, professional bod-
ies) to influence the policy environment (Table 4).
Case 3: Changing practice in maternity care in Zimbabwe
Maternal mortality in Zimbabwe remains among the
highest in the world, standing at 443 per 100,000 live
births [ 22]. This motivated the establishment of a part-
nership between one of the largest hospitals in
Zimbabwe and an NHS Foundation Trust in the UK,
with the aim to improve the quality of maternity services
offered by the former. To this end, a team of midwives,
obstetricians, a paediatrician, an anaesthetist from the
UK, together with members of a charity dedicated to
providing health training in Zimbabwe, travelled to the
country in November 2011 to run a Practical Obstetric
Multi-Professional Training (PROMPT) ToT course.
PROMPT is an evidence based multi-professional train-
ing package for obstetric emergencies. The course has
been directly associated with improvements in perinatal
outcome and enhanced knowledge, clinical skills and
team working [ 23]. The partnership hoped that

introducing this training in Zimbabwe would improve
outcomes for expectant mothers and save many lives.
From the outset, the partnership engaged the local
hospital board and key leaders across the institution in
their discussions to set up a maternity quality improve-
ment package of in-hospital training, tools and perform-
ance monitoring. Through this early engagement with
the institution ’s managers, the partnership secured the
hospital’s commitment to the project, creating an enab-
ling environment for the training to take place. For ex-
ample, acknowledging the competing demands on staff
time, the Board agreed the release of all maternity staff
from their clinical duties to attend a one-day training
course at the hospital. Furthermore, it considered the
training as part of staff normal duties, thus paying staff
their usual salary during the training instead of the usual
per diems for off-site training. These are often given as a
financial incentive to increase staff motivation to attend
meetings or conduct work-related travel but can have a
distorting effect on employees ’ attitudes [ 24], for ex-
ample by prioritising financial gain over professional
standards. By removing per diems, the hospital helped
cement a new attitude to training, not as an additional
duty but as integral part of their professional responsibil-
ity for continuous development.
This alignment between hospital policy and the part-
nership activities enabled the delivery of 10 one-day
training courses. In the first year alone, 87% of all hos-
pital staff were trained and by the end of the project,
252 staff members across a range of cadres had been
trained, most of whom had never attended any obstetric
emergency training. In addition to conducting PROMPT
training, Zimbabwean staff made a number of practical
improvements to their working environment which en-
abled a better monitoring of clinical outcomes.
The partnership was also able to engage with an im-
portant body running health delivery institutions across
the country. Seeing the success of the PROMT training,
this body agreed to support the roll out of the training
to the 52 health facilities that they own and run across
the country. They followed a similar model, making
training mandatory for all staff and agreeing to their re-
lease from clinical duties without additional per diems.
This experience demonstrates the importance of embed-
ding training duties into the career path of health pro-
fessionals through effective management that aligns
hospital policy to training objectives. As the partnership
stated, “a policy removing the requirement for per diems
establishes on-going clinical training as the norm within
healthcare institutions. ”
Implementation
ToT evaluation usually involves assessing learning out-
comes through post-course questionnaires, i.e. the transfer
of skills from MTs to LTs. Yet, the long-term effectiveness
of the intervention is often poorly measured. ToT success
depends on whether LTs implement a sustainable training
cascade, i.e. deliver and develop training courses. A clear
implementation strategy (at the organisational or
supra-organisational level) is critical to cascade the train-
ing. This may mean making training mandatory within an
organisation or establishing educational programmes that
make use of LTs. Implementation by local managers or
government officials ensures the sustainable integration of
the training into local mechanisms (policies, processes,
etc.) [ 25]. In other words, the sustainability of a ToT ini-
tiative depends on the successful transfer of ownership to
a strong local leadership (Table 5).
Case 4: Engaging decision makers for mentorship training
in Malawi
A partnership between a teaching college of health sci-
ences (CHS) in Malawi, a non-governmental healthcare
provider and trainer of healthcare practitioners in
Malawi (NGHP), and a Nursing School at a UK Univer-
sity (NSUK) started from an impromptu visit of a lec-
turer from NSUK to CHS in 2005. Both nursing schools
identified reciprocal benefits from adopting the partner-
ship approach, based on the WHO ’s ‘twinning’ model
between HIC and LMIC institutions [ 26]. Students from
the UK visited Malawi for their overseas elective and, se-
nior teaching staff from CHS visited NSUK as part of a
staff development opportunity. It was soon identified by
CHS staff that mentorship in practice was an important
development opportunity that would enhance student
clinical placement experience and retention. Mentorship
of student nurses during clinical placements was not a
formal element of nursing education in Malawi but con-
ducted on an ad-hoc basis. Students arriving in their
placements lacked appropriate supervision and were not
able to integrate well in the workplace and gain valuable
learning opportunities, and this contributed to increas-
ing levels of attrition. The partnership set out, therefore,
to establish a mentorship training programme for

clinical teachers and tutors at CHS and the other nurs-
ing schools run by the NGHP. The role of these tutors
was to train nurses at a number of Malawian colleges
and hospitals in the principles of mentoring. The men-
toring training programme was rolled out to the seven
hospitals in Northern Malawi, and by the end of the pro-
ject a number of clinical teachers and tutors had com-
pleted ToT courses and cascaded the training to
approximately 355 nurses and clinical tutors who went
to become student trainers and mentors.
Critical to the sustainability of the ToT was the part-
nership’s effective advocacy with senior decision makers.
The partnership decided to invite the Registrar of the
Malawi Nursing & Midwifery Council (MNMC) and the
Chief Nursing Officer of Malawi for a visit to the UK,
where they saw for themselves how mentoring in prac-
tice was embedded in the nursing curriculum. The visit
was pivotal to promote mentoring as an effective
method of facilitating learning in practice, and the
MNMC, responsible for setting the standards for nurs-
ing education in the country, recognised the value of
mentoring and became enthusiastic advocates for its in-
clusion in the nursing curriculum. The MNMC hosted a
National Nursing Conference on Mentorship that was
open to all schools of nursing in the country and
attended by the Deputy Prime Minister and key mem-
bers of the Malawian Ministry of Health. Following on
from this conference, the MNMC developed a set of na-
tional competencies and standards for nursing and mid-
wifery education which includes a requirement for all
student nurses on clinical placements to be supervised
by a mentor. Such requirement created a need for the
mentorship training programme to be adopted across
the whole of Malawi, thus ensuring the long-term con-
tinuity of the training.
The partnership strategically influenced MNMC and
other key policy makers to appreciate the importance of
the training programme. Through early engagement, the
programme became owned and shaped by local actors.
The UK partner stated: “One of the most important les-
sons learnt is the importance of being aware of the polit-
ical landscape and being politically astute to take
advantage of emerging opportunities and combined with
that is the ability to be flexible with the project plan. ”
Nurture and development
Whilst it is important for trainers/educators to have the
right set of technical competencies, ToT courses must
also help individuals develop soft skills, i.e. attitudes and
behaviours that enable learning: ability for constructive
criticism, empathy, flexibility, etc. In this regard, having
the opportunity to conduct training under the supervi-
sion of a MT is key to the success of a ToT [ 9]. ToT are
usually short workshops embedded into larger training
programmes [e.g. [ 27]]. This limits the opportunities for
LTs to conduct supervised training. It also means that
emphasis is generally on the initial transfer of skills from
MTs to LTs. However, the sustainability of the ToT de-
pends not only on LTs being trained (which includes op-
portunity for MT supervision and feedback) but crucially
on preventing de-skilling over time. Sustainable upskill-
ing of the workforce requires opportunities for CPD to
be integrated into the long-term vision of the partner-
ship (Table 6). This should include not only the ongoing
one-to-one peer-support that is at the heart of GHP but
should extend to providing access to relevant literature,
further courses, and networking opportunities beyond
the partnership. Nurturing LTs should not be limited to
the initial training but should be gradually integrated
into local mechanisms with decreasing support from the
partnership.
Case 5: Nurturing educators in Ghana through reflective
practice
The Kintampo Project (KP) is a GHP established in 2007
between a college of health in Kintampo (CoHK), Ghana,
and an NHS Foundation Trust in the UK (NHSFT) to cre-
ate an entirely new workforce of mental health practi-
tioners to work in rural and at the time underserved parts
of Ghana ( www.thekintampoproject.org). This was seen as
necessary to compensate for the small number of mental
health professionals - approximately 10 – 20 psychiatrists
and 100 community registered mental health nurses
(RMNs) to serve a population of circa 24 million people.
The new cadre would be entirely community-based and
focus particularly on rural areas, thus helping shift the
focus of care away from large psychiatric hospitals and
into the community where it was most needed.
The challenge for the project was to establish a pre-
dominantly practice-oriented and reflective educational
programme for practitioners that did not exist in Ghana
at the time. Seventy percent of the teaching time would
be spent in practice and the remainder at the College
where students would prepare for and reflect on their
practical experiences. Given the very practical and

reflective nature of the programme, adequate mentor-
ship was key. This therefore called for a strong emphasis
on teacher development, on the principle that “there can
be no educational development without teacher develop-
ment” [28]. The first mentors were recruited among
practicing psychiatrists and community based RMNs
who attended ToT workshops. These mentors were
therefore expected to train a new and different kind of
workforce whose remit was still to be delineated. For
this reason, developing their skills and identity as educa-
tors was considered paramount to the success of the
programme.
Once the project was agreed and sanctioned at national
level, the UK partner provided expertise to develop the edu-
cational programme and to enhance the educators ’ educa-
tional practice using evidence-based teaching approaches
that were firmly grounded in educational thinking. To this
end, groups of CoHK senior educators spent short periods at
aU Ku n i v e r s i t yt os u p p o r tt h e i rd e v e l o p m e n tn e e d s .T h e
UK team introduced the concept of reflective learning as a
deliberate and active process by which learners pursue “ac-
tive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or sup-
posed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that
support it, and further conclusions to which it leads” [29].
Over time, the newly trained community of mental
health workers have became part of the teaching staff and
many of the original ‘trainer’ RMNs have now been re-
placed by the most able teachers amongst the new work-
force. Some have been appointed as teaching assistants at
CoHK. In addition, educational (ToT) workshops were
held in Kintampo annually between 2008 and 2014 sup-
ported by UK grants. NHSFT ’s role was always to facili-
tate, not to deliver, and their input gradually reduced. By
2015– 16 CoHK staff and the graduated mental health
workers themselves were independently running the
programme. The ToT workshops latterly became a com-
bination of ToT and CPD for the new workforce and this
kept more practitioners involved, avoided exclusivity and
galvanized the interest of those who would like to focus
more strongly on the trainer aspect of their service work .
Conclusions
ToT is widely used as an efficient and effective approach
to address the shortage of healthcare workers in LMICs
through upskilling and to improve their performance,
commitment and ultimately retention. Yet, we know
little about the conditions necessary for ToT to achieve
these positive results. Our findings highlight that
whilst a variety of approaches to ToT exist, there are a
number of limitations that can prevent this model of
capacity-building from being both effective and sustain-
able. Whilst most partnerships strive to ensure the
long-term sustainability of the training by focusing on
adequate training provision and support of local trainers,
the wider issues that can facilitate or prevent the con-
tinuation of training are not always considered. These
can include the negotiation of workloads and financial
responsibilities, the effective engagement with decision
makers through alignment of objectives and post-project
support.
Our findings, together with the THET ’s vast experi-
ence of supporting partnerships and the analysis of the
literature informs the conceptual framework we propose
here. The TRAIN framework offers a blueprint against
which ToT interventions can be mapped, allows a struc-
ture of requirements at various levels that allows individ-
ual capabilities and opportunities for training to
translate into the achievement of a long-term training
cascade. Although the framework will be valuable to
health partnerships as a guidance in the design and
operationalisation of ToT, we recognise that in practice
it may be difficult to implement it in its entirety. Of the
five constitutive elements, it may be more feasible to
address Talent, Implementation and Nurture and
Development as these are more within the reach of a
small-scale partnership. Resources and Alignment may
be much more demanding because they require ToT
to be embedded at individual, organisational and
supra-organisational level and projects may not have the
scope to influence decision making at all these levels.
The TRAIN framework is intended as a starting point
for further refinements and discussions about the factors
affecting capacity building strategies based on training
cascades. The key message underlying the framework is
that the sustainability of a cascade depends on a number
of “constitutive elements” being present or developing at
different structural levels during the course of the project.
These elements bring into focus the various conversion
factors that are crucial to transform “capabilities”,i . e .t h e
opportunities that ToT opens to LTs, into functionings,
i.e. the actual achievements of a training cascade that ul-
timately result in the upskilling of the workforce and the
improvement of health outcomes in LMICs.
